The New York Yankees need to get one win in Cleveland to maintain a puncher's chance in the American League Division Series. They whiffed on the first opportunity — and best opportunity — Thursday night. As the empty at-bats against Trevor Bauer compounded, sensible hope was extinguished.
It's against the unwritten baseball rules to cue the fat lady prematurely. But let's be blunt here in regards to the Yankees' quest for a 28th World Series. They are more likely to get swept than emerge triumphant with another trophy for the crowded case.
Indians manager Terry Francona cracked the door open just a bit by going with his gut and starting Bauer in Game 1 over Corey Kluber. Bauer, he of the 4.36 career ERA, enjoyed his best season as a pro this year. He is not, however, in the discussion for the most unhittable hurler in the game like his teammate Kluber.
Francona's gamble gave the Yankees a better chance to win Game 1 and seize momentum. Joe Girardi's club did not capitalize. They did not push that ajar door open even more. Instead, they went hitless for 5 1/3 innings and scoreless for nine.
Bauer exited after 6 2/3 innings of work in which he struck out eight and allowed only three baserunners. Again, this was the guy who was supposed to be relatively vulnerable. The Yankees finished with three hits and 14 strikeouts. Aaron Judge donned the golden sombrero while Didi Gregorius, Greg Bird, Todd Frazier, and Aaron Hicks each fanned twice.
One of the concerns about the Yankees' offense is that it's too reliant on the long ball. This all-or-nothing existence can be problematic in the postseason. Thursday night it was a lot of nothing.

You'll be waking up a little more awesome tomorrow. Whoa! Something went wrong. Try again?
Now the lineup must turn it around against Kluber, the favorite for AL Cy Young. All he's done this year is gone 18-4 with league-leading 2.25 ERA and 0.869 WHIP. He also led the AL in shutouts, complete games, ERA+, HR/9, and BB/9. Kluber was 4-1 with a 1.83 ERA and 1.049 WHIP during the playoffs last year and there won't be any nerves on his end.
CC Sabathia gets the ball for New York in Game 2. The veteran lefty has been reliable and a facsimile of his old self but is simply not the shutdown guy he once was. If he doesn't have one more magic outing in that arm, it will be an early departure for the Yankees and all their young talent.
It's getting late early for the Bronx Bombers. Getting to Bauer was their best hope and they left hopeless. Falling behind 2-0 would seal the fate. The pending Carlos Carrasco-Masahiro Tanaka matchup in Game 3 skews Cleveland's way. And Kluber would loom in any Game 5.
The Yankees are in deep trouble and in great peril. A three-game sweep became the most likely outcome as Bauer posted zero after zero. Overreaction? Maybe a slight one. But Yankees fans should have taken a healthy dose of reality into tonight's game.
It may already be too late.
Tracing Ram Gopal Varma's obsession with women — from Sridevi, Urmila Matondkar to Mila Malkova, Tori Black
If there is anything Ram Gopal Varma is known for, besides his gritty cinema and controversial statements, it is his obsession with pretty women. His movies, particularly the songs, have always depicted women in fashionable light.
In Govinda Govinda, the song “Amma Bramha Devudo” speaks about the godly charm of Sridevi. Nagarjuna's character, Seenu, is in love with Naveena (Sridevi) in the movie, and here is how the lyrics (penned by Sirivennela Seetharama Sastry) go:
Amma Bramha Devudo
Kompa Munchinaavuro
Yentha Goppa Sogasuro
Yeda Daachinaavuro
Poola Rekkalu, Konni Tene Chukkalu
Rangaristivo, Ilaa Bomma Chestivo
Asalu Bhoolokam Ilaanti Siri Choosi Untadaa
Kanaka Ee Chitram Swargaaniki Chendi Undadaa
The lyrics roughly translate to: Oh my god, you have pinned me down. Where had you hidden this beauty? Have you added some flower petals and honey drops and created this doll? Has the earth ever seen this kind of treasure? Does that mean this pretty woman belong to heaven?
These poetic words may have come from the thinking cap of an award-winning lyricist but the sentiment is certainly Ram Gopal Varma's.
He has been quite vocal about Sridevi's knockout looks. Apart from the incessant tweets he makes about the actress's body parts, he has named his book Guns and Thighs (apparently inspired by Sridevi's thighs).
In his book, he explains his initial interaction with the actress as: “The first heroine I was bowled over by was Sridevi and that was when I was just a viewer and hadn't yet come into films. When I first met her, I felt I had walked from the theatre straight into the screen. Over a period of time, I became close to the real Sridevi and for the first time consciously understood the difference between fantasy and reality.”
He has “consciously” tried to capture the gorgeousness of his actresses throughout his three decade long career. The other actress that immediately comes to my mind when somebody talks about Ram Gopal Varma's films is Urmila Matondkar.
The track 'Tanha Tanha' from Rangeela is again an example of Varma recording an actress's sex appeal for posterity. He wants to watch women through the lenses of a film camera and transform his lustful gaze (née boyish enthusiasm) into art. 'Art' is highly subjective here.
If you look at Jackie Shroff in 'Tanha Tanha', you can actually see Varma in his place. Shroff seems to be carrying Varma's emotions of enjoying Urmila's carefree moves on the beach. About Urmila, he says, in his book, “I was mesmerised by Urmila's beauty... from her face to her figure... everything about her was just divine. She had done a few films before Rangeela, which hadn't done well and she hadn't made much of an impact on the audience either. Then, after Rangeela, she became the nation's sex symbol. That doesn't mean it was I who made her look beautiful. I would say that she was a painting and I simply framed her. Apart from the frame, for a painting to be truly relished, it also needs the right place for it to be displayed in, and that place was Rangeela. One of my primary motives in makingRangeela was to capture Urmila's beauty eternally on camera and to make it a benchmark for sex symbols. I would say that I have never felt more of a cinematic high than when I watched her through my camera on the sets of Rangeela.”
That passage from Guns and Thighs must be enough to tell you how much he 'adores' attractive women.
In recent times, he has moved on to the web platform to make content the way he truly aspires to. The digital space allows creators to be their own bosses. The lack of a governing body (CBFC/Karni Sena) has sort of become a boon to makers like Varma. He has already released the trailers of Guns and Thighs (a series about the Mumbai underworld) and Kadapa (a series revolving around the rowdy elements of Rayalaseema). Though both the series are yet to see the light of the day, the buzz surrounding them, owing to the factors of profanity and female nudity, refuses to die down.
Do you notice the phrase “female nudity” there? That's right. Varma has not shown any interest toward men's handsomeness or making films on those subjects. And so, that makes only the women, of his choice, his top-priority.
That is also the precise reason for the absence of a male star in his recently released film God, Sex and Truth. Of course, there is a bit of philosophy (about how women are controlled in relationships and how they are not getting the kind of sex they are desiring) in it but when an adult star is narrating her sexual fantasies in a lyrical manner, and pleasuring herself in front of the camera, the motives behind Varma's actions are not hard to guess. He wanted to capture Mia Malkova's (the star of GST) beauty eternally on camera. Period.
Had he been accustomed to showcasing male nudity, there would have probably been actual sex scenes in God, Sex and Truth in addition to the masturbatory stances. If you keep the 'philosophical treatise' away from the table, you can easily guess how much Varma is bewitched by Malkova's body. In fact, he dedicated his book, Guns and Thighs, to Tori Black, another famous adult star who has won a number of awards for her work in adult cinema.
Varma has proved, time after time, that he is not afraid of envisioning projects that could be frowned upon by a large section of the population (even Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag for that matter), or of speaking his mind.
There may not be any truth in his ode to Malkova's body in GST. However, there is plenty of raw truth in his liking for women's bodies in his tweets, talks, films and series.

SYDNEY - Australia's Adam Voges has retired from international cricket, signing off with a test batting average second only to the great Don Bradman.
Voges became the oldest player to score a century on his test debut when he made an unbeaten 130 against West Indies two years ago, aged 35. The right-handed batsman scored 1,485 runs at an average of 61.87, ranking him second on the all-time list behind Bradman's incredible 99.94. Voges lost his place in the test team after the second of two defeats to South Africa in November and was treated for concussion after being hit by a bouncer when batting for Western Australia in a Sheffield Shield match the same month. Voges, 37, will lead the Prime Minister's XI against the touring Sri Lankan team in Canberra on Wednesday and has said it will be his last match against an international side. "This will be it for me," Voges told reporters. "I'm certainly looking forward to getting out there and playing this game.
I've had an amazing couple of years with Australia with the test team and I've loved every minute of it.
Australia have made wholesale changes to their team after a thrashing in Sri Lanka and home series defeat to South Africa. The Steve Smith-led team have since revived their fortunes by defeating South Africa in a dead rubber at Adelaide and went on to beat Pakistan 3-0 at home.
Premier John Horgan will be announcing the fate of the Site C Dam later today.
The NDP will either give the green light on the nearly ten billion dollar project already two years into development, or will drop the axe on over 2,000 jobs.
Last month, the BC Utilities Commission released a report explaining suspending and restarting the dam would cost the government an additional $3.6 billion.
An in-person technical briefing is set for 10:30 AM followed by a media conference at 11:30 AM.
The Ducks put together one of their most complete games in a while. They were aggressive on the forecheck, able to chip the puck deep and then lay bodies on the Devils. The Ducks also clogged up the neutral zone after they grabbed the early leads and were able to impede the fast-skating Devils from creating many odd-man rushes.

Netflix has renewed “The Rain” for a second season, the streaming giant announced Wednesday.
The series is Netflix's first Danish original series. The series will go back into production later this year, with the second season slated to launch in 2019.
“We're really excited to team up with the talented cast and our team of amazing creators for another season,” said Kelly Luegenbiehl, vice president of international originals for Netflix. “‘The Rain' has a relatable and human story at its core and touches on universal themes everyone can identify with. The fact that season 1 reached audiences all over the world, proves once again that strong stories can transcend borders.”
The series was created by Jannik Tai Mosholt, Esben Toft Jacobsen, and Christian Potalivo. it stars Alba August, Mikkel Boe Følsgaard, Lucas Lynggaard Tønnesen, Lars Simonsen, Sonny Lindberg, Jessica Dinnage, Lukas Løkken, and Johannes Kuhnke.
In the series, six years after a brutal virus carried by the rain wipes out almost all humans in Scandinavia, two Danish siblings emerge from the safety of their bunker to find all remnants of civilisation gone. Soon they join a group of young survivors and together set out on a quest through an abandoned Scandinavia, searching for any sign of life.
Washington: US President Donald Trump's escalating dispute with China over trade and technology is threatening jobs and profits in working-class communities where his "America First" agenda hit home.
The Commerce Department has received more than 2,400 applications from companies seeking waivers from the administration's tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which may result in duty payments of millions of dollars for larger businesses.
The department has begun posting the requests online for public comment; several of the applications released so far suggest deep misgivings with Trump's protectionist strategy, especially in areas where he won strong support during the 2016 election.
The tariffs are aimed primarily at China for flooding the global market with cheap steel and aluminum. But they've also led to confusion and uncertainty, according to Associated Press interviews and a review of records.
In Oklahoma, Texas and Wisconsin, for example, businesses operating in the furniture, energy and food sectors have outlined the financial difficulties they'd face if they're not excused from the steel tariff.
In Okmulgee, Oklahoma, dozens of jobs hang in the balance as office furniture giant Steelcase waits to hear back from the Commerce Department.
A Steelcase subsidiary, PolyVision, operates a plant in Okmulgee that uses a special type of steel from Japan to manufacture a durable glass-like surface for whiteboards and architectural purposes.
PolyVision "cannot and will not be able to procure" from U.S. companies the cold-rolled steel it requires "in a sufficient and reasonably available amount or of a satisfactory quality," Steelcase said.
Trump won most of the votes cast for president in Okmulgee County. Without a waiver, Steelcase warned, the "economic viability of PolyVision (and) the small town of Okmulgee" would be jeopardized.
The waiver request also indicates that a $15 million plant expansion may be at risk. Steelcase and PolyVision are on the verge of making the investment, which would create new construction and manufacturing jobs, according to the request.
Roger Ballenger, Okmulgee's city manager, said he and other local officials are "very concerned about the situation with PolyVision."
The tariffs — 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on imported aluminum — are designed to protect and rebuild the U.S. companies that manufacture the metals. The U.S. temporarily exempted several major trading partners, including the European Union, Mexico and Canada.
China, which was left on the target list, retaliated by imposing tariffs on $3 billion in U.S. products, including apples, pork and ginseng.
Trump responded by adding more protectionist measures as punishment for Chinese theft of U.S. intellectual property. And Beijing punched back by proposing tariffs on $50 billion in U.S. products including small aircraft and soybeans — a direct threat to rural areas that were key to Trump's victory.
Economists Joseph Francois and Laura Baughman estimated last month that the tariffs would increase employment in the U.S. steel and aluminum industries by more than 26,000 jobs but also lead to the loss of 495,000 other jobs throughout the rest of the American economy.
John Hritz, CEO of JSW Steel USA in Baytown, Texas, said his company is in lockstep with Trump's approach. "We're in favor of growing the steel industry in this country," Hritz said. JSW Steel, owned by Indian conglomerate JSW Group, is embarking on a $500 million overhaul of the plant that it says will create hundreds of jobs.
The growth would be welcomed in Baytown, where unemployment is 9.8 percent, more than double the national rate. Baytown is located partly in Harris County, which Democrat Hillary Clinton won, and partly in Chambers County, which Trump handily won.
The future is much murkier for another Baytown steel business, Borusan Mannesmann Pipe. Without a waiver, Borusan may face tariffs of $25 million to $30 million annually if it imports steel tubing and casing from its parent company in Turkey, according to information the company provided to the AP.
Borusan said the Baytown production line would no longer be competitive and "jobs would be threatened" if it cannot import 135,000 metric tons of steel annually over the next two years. The pipes Borusan produces are used primarily as casing for oil and natural gas wells.
But if Commerce says yes, Borusan will be able to unlock a $25 million investment in the Baytown facility as it seeks to become a "100 percent domestic supplier," according to the waiver request. An additional $50 million expansion in pipe fabrication capacity would follow, the company said, leading to as many as 170 new jobs.
Seneca Foods Corporation, the nation's largest vegetable canner, said in its waiver application that it's unclear, at best, if U.S. suppliers have the ability or willingness to expand their production in the long term to meet the company's annual demand for tinplated steel.
But "clearly they cannot meet demand in the short term," Seneca told Commerce officials. That means Seneca has to buy a portion of what it needs from overseas.
A person with knowledge of Seneca's situation said the company would face a $2.25 million duty if the Commerce Department doesn't approve its waiver request for 11,000 metric tons of tinplate it already agreed to purchase from China. The material is to be delivered this year and next, according to the waiver request. The person was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.
Seneca said it employs more than 400 people at can-making facilities in Wisconsin and Idaho and near its headquarters in New York's Wayne County, where Trump bested Clinton. The company doesn't warn layoffs are imminent if the waiver isn't approved. Instead, the tariffs would likely come out of Seneca's bottom line, the person said.

Princess Diana's funeral was an unforgettably tragic and touching event watched by billions around the world. Almost 20 years later, the images still conjure up emotions, especially those of her two young sons, Princes William and Harry. Among the most iconic is the picture of the boys walking behind Diana's horse-drawn casket with their father, grandfather, and uncle, Earl Spencer, Diana's brother. Atop the casket, Harry had placed a card addressed to "Mummy."

The story behind the procession provides insight into the royal family dynamic ahead of the funeral. Sally Bedell Smith relays the details in her new biography of the Prince of Wales, Prince Charles. The day before the funeral, the royal family had arrived back in London after grieving privately at the queen's Scottish estate Balmoral. Bedell Smith explains that "the one lingering question about the funeral was whether William and Harry would walk in the procession behind their mother's horse-drawn gun carriage." Charles wanted his sons to walk because it was a tradition for royal men, but the boys were reluctant.
Finally, it was their grandfather, Prince Philip, who helped William and Harry make the decision. Bedell Smith writes that Prince Philip told William, "If you don't walk, you may regret it later." He went on, "I think you should do it. If I walk, will you walk with me?" Thanks to that conversation, William and Harry joined the procession at St. James's Palace, providing history with a moment we won't soon forget.
A former Calgarian living in New York City said the scene in midtown Manhattan on Monday following an explosion at the city's Port Authority transit terminal was “madness.”
Ron Tarrant moved to Manhattan two years ago after nabbing a job with the Howard Stern Show on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.
Tarrant lives about four blocks away from the Port Authority transit terminal and said he didn't know anything was wrong until friends and family started contacting him.
“I heard a crazy amount of sirens,” he said. “My phone started going off like crazy as I was getting ready for work. I started looking at my text messages and everyone is like ‘are you OK? There's a crazy bombing right by your house.'”

Tarrant said he can normally see the hustle and bustle of midtown Manhattan when he looks out the windows of his apartment, but on Monday morning everything was eerily still.
“I went over to my window and looked, and that's when you could tell something was happening just down the street from me.”
“Usually I can see all the traffic from the day. When I went to the window for the first time the streets were completely empty.”
WATCH: Cellphone footage captured by Tarrant shows the chaotic scene in midtown Manhattan on Monday following an explosion at the Port Authority transit terminal.
Officials said the explosion happened in an underground passageway under 42 Street between 7 and 8 avenues at around 7:20 a.m. ET.
When Tarrant left his apartment and began walking to work, his route took him to the centre of the chaotic scene.
“I started walking over on 42 Street and everything is completely shut down so it's kind of an eerie sight in Manhattan when there's usually thousands of people on their way to work on a Monday morning.”
“I was able to get kind of through [the area] more than other people because you have to show where you work … In order for me to get to work in Times Square, I had to show that I work at Sirius XM. It's a little bit crazy around there.”
The explosion has been called an “attempted terrorist attack” by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.
At a morning press conference, NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill said the suspect intentionally detonated a “low-tech” device at the terminal.
“Preliminary investigation at the scene indicates this male was wearing an improvised device, low-tech explosive device attached to his body,” O'Neill said. “He intentionally detonated that device.”
Tarrant said he visits the terminal frequently, which made news of the explosion unsettling.
“It's kind of eerie only because I walk by there every single day to and from work,” he said. “Even last night I got off the subway at 11 p.m. and was walking home. To hear a bomb went off there the next morning – it's a little crazy.”
Investigators closed the Port Authority terminal after the bombing but the transit hub has since re-opened.

Jammu: Advising the BJP-RSS to refrain from "generating passions and exploiting public sentiments", especially during the Gujarat polls, National Conference (NC) chief Farooq Abdullah on Monday said the growing trend of dividing the nation on religious lines was detrimental to national interest and such a tendency should be eschewed at all costs.
He also expressed concern over "vitiating" the ongoing Gujarat Assembly polls on the basis of religion and said it was the "saddest development in the Indian polity".
In a statement issued in Jammu, Abdullah advised the BJP-RSS to refrain from "generating passions and exploiting public sentiments", especially during elections, and said the growing trend of dividing the nation on religious lines was detrimental to national interest and such a tendency should be eschewed at all costs.
He lamented the "attempts to provoke" the people to fight over "mandir-masjid" issues just in furtherance of political objectives.
"India does not belong to a specific religion, but it is a beautiful vase of flowers of different colours. People of all the faiths have equal rights in a secular India," the former Union minister said.
He added that in the prevailing "vicious atmosphere", the NC had a challenging role in keeping the flag of secularism aloft.
Abdullah decried the "exploitation" of religious sentiments for political and electoral gains, saying Prime Minister Narendra Modi should take a lead in ending this malady in the larger interest of retaining the secular fabric of the country.
"(Narendra) Modi is the prime minister of all, irrespective of religious or regional affiliations and this fact should neither be ignored nor undermined," he said, hoping that Modi would not allow himself to get swayed by petty politics.
Addressing the NC's other backward class cell functionaries at the Sher-e-Kashmir Bhavan in Jammu, the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister hoped that the prime minister would appreciate the danger communal polarisation posed and said the country should also introspect over the sordid state of its political affairs.
"The country of Mahatma Gandhi cannot afford to get fragmented into bits and pieces on the basis of religion to satiate the agendas of a few political outfits," he said.
The NC leader, however, mentioned that nothing better could be expected from the reactionary forces, who were now taking pride in "decorating the killer of the Father of the Nation".
Meanwhile, a retired police officer today joined the NC in the presence of Abdullah at the party headquarters.
Abdullah welcomed retired superintendent of police Rishi Dogra into the party-fold and said the NC was a natural choice for all those who wanted to serve the people of Jammu and Kashmir and work towards strengthening the peace and tranquillity of the state.
Cars are seen on display inside the General Motors Corp world headquarters in downtown in Detroit, May 28, 2009.
(Reuters) - Plaintiffs suing General Motors Co (GM.N) over faulty ignition switches and other alleged vehicle defects have reached a $1 billion settlement requiring the automaker to turn over that amount of stock, a lawyer for the plaintiffs said in a court hearing on Friday.
GM lawyer Richard Godfrey strongly criticized the agreement, telling U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan the Detroit-based company was given no say in the deal negotiated between the plaintiffs and a trust set up for creditors of “old GM,” which holds many liabilities predating the automaker's 2009 bankruptcy.
Godfrey said the settlement was a result of collusion between the plaintiffs and the trust, and "a complete surrender and sellout using new GM's money."
The ignition switch litigation consolidated before Furman stems from GM's 2014 recall of 2.6 million vehicles with defective switches. One type of switch has been linked to nearly 400 injuries and 124 deaths. The claims have expanded to include a variety of alleged defects in millions of cars.
GM said in a statement it would fight the settlement in court, calling it a “contrived scheme” doomed to fail.
According to Steve Berman, the plaintiffs' lawyer, the settlement called for the trust to take on $10 billion of ignition switch claims, which would boost the total claims against the trust to more than $35 billion.
He said that would trigger a provision in GM's bankruptcy reorganization plan requiring "new GM" to transfer about $1 billion in stock to the trust, which would be used to fund the settlement.
In a phone interview after the hearing, Berman said the settlement would resolve about 11.9 million economic loss claims and between 400 and 500 personal injury and wrongful death claims. He added that he expected to ask the federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan by Tuesday to set the deal in motion.
About 2.4 million claims, involving vehicles sold after GM's bankruptcy, would remain, Berman said.
"The notion from new GM that this is somehow an inappropriate procedure is crazy," he said. "They bargained for this."
Godfrey told the hearing the trust had $400 million in its own assets that could be used to fund a settlement, instead of requiring GM to turn over stock.
After the hearing, GM spokesman Patrick Morrissey said the automaker had been told the deal would include a $15 million payment from the trust releasing it from liability, effectively shielding that $400 million. That was not discussed at the hearing, and Berman declined to comment.
KARACHI, Pakistan, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The Karachi Cotton Association on Friday fixed the official spot rate, or base price, for Grade 3 cotton at 7,823 rupees per maund (40 kg). Grade 3 cotton has a staple length of 1-1/16" and micronaire value between 3.8 and 4.9 NCL (no control limits), which represents fine to coarse classes of cotton varieties. In the kerb market, the key crop varieties traded in the range of 6,850 to 6,500 rupees per maund.

Target has acquired San Francisco-based transportation technology company Grand Junction, in order to help it move more quickly into the business of same-day delivery. The company had already been working with Target on a same-day delivery pilot program in New York's Tribeca neighborhood, prior to this deal. That pilot will expand this fall to more New York area stores before a broader rollout to other large metros starting next year.
The retailer had already dipped its toe in the water of on-demand, local delivery. It has tested same-day delivery in 2014, and later in partnership with Instacart. And this May it announced its plans for Target Restock, a next-day delivery service focused on “everyday essentials,” like household items, personal care products and other dry goods – similar to those you can order through Amazon Prime Pantry.
The Restocking service had been in testing with staff at Target's headquarters before expanding to a consumer-facing pilot with customers in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, where Target is based.
Around the same time, Target also announced a small test of same-day delivery in New York. The pilot allowed guests shopping the Tribeca location to have their in-store purchases delivered anywhere in Manhattan, and to parts of Brooklyn or Queens. This eliminated the need for customers to haul their heavier purchases home themselves, or on public transit.
Grand Junction's technology was used in this NY area test, Target says.
The company offers a software platform that's used by retailers, distributors and third-party logistics providers to manage local deliveries through a network of more than 700 carriers. The software helps to determine the most efficient, the fastest route for a local delivery, while also tracking deliveries and giving the retailer an overview of carrier performance.
By bringing this technology in-house, Target says it will be able to offer same-day delivery in more areas, as well as assembly and installation services. Potentially, this could be used to speed up Target Restock from a next-day to a same-day delivery service, as well.
However, the deal is about more than just same-day, Target says. That includes all last-mile logistics needs, from regular online orders to same-day or next-day from stores.
With the acquisition, Target gains immediate access to Grand Junction's technology and carrier network, which will allow it to more quickly move into same-day delivery. Grand Junction's 13 employees will become a part of Target's technology team in San Francisco, where they'll best tasked with expanding the New York area pilot this year, ahead of a wider same-day delivery service rollout next year.
“Grand Junction's technology and algorithms will help Target deliver to guests faster and more efficiently,” said Arthur Valdez, executive vice president, chief supply chain and logistics officer, Target, in statement. “This acquisition is part of Target's ongoing efforts to strengthen Target's supply chain to provide greater speed, reliability and convenience for guests.”

Same-day delivery is an area where there's an increasing amount of competition. Amazon today offers Prime Now in over 30 U.S. markets, promising 2-hour delivery of thousands of items. A good handful of same-day grocery delivery services are also gaining steam, including Instacart, Shipt, Peapod and others. There's also Postmates for restaurant and general product delivery. And Uber is figuring out how to leverage its technology for than just moving more than people.
Meanwhile, Walmart has doubled down on a same-day pickup service for groceries, and even incentivized customers with discounts when online customers chose to ship items to the store for pickup instead of delivery. Walmart has also taken on Amazon with a free 2-day shipping service and has begun testing using store staff for last mile deliveries.
Lastly, startups like Curbside are working with major companies like CVS, Pizza Hut and Yelp, to expand access to same-day pickup services, too. (Target had also worked with Curbside before.)
“Target is seizing a tremendous opportunity to leverage local delivery as a retail differentiator,” said Rob Howard, Grand Junction's founder and CEO, who will become a vice president of technology at Target, as a result of this deal. “We're thrilled about helping to pursue this opportunity, and to join Target at this unprecedented time in retail.”
The move could help Target retain its footing as more brick-and-mortar stores face waning foot traffic and store closures. Target's online sales have been improving, having rose 22 percent in the last quarter, but it still faces huge threats from Amazon and Walmart in this area. That's especially true when it comes to groceries – something that's been made worse by Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods. However, Target recently boosted its Q2 earnings forecast due to an expected increase in comparable-store sales.
Studies in human development depict a person's life as a series of crises to be negotiated and, for lack of a better word, mastered before moving on to the next challenge. Experts argue that if someone fails to come to terms with a particular phase in a healthy and productive manner, they run the risk of developmental paralysis and missing out on the stages that come afterward. For some reason, this information from a bygone professorial career crept into my mind while I listened to Pearl Jam's Yield over and over again this past week as it turns two decades old. I wondered, do similar hurdles exist for rock bands? Because Yield always felt like a daunting hurdle cleared to me — a clear division between who Pearl Jam are now and who they once were.
Several of the acts Consequence of Sound celebrates seem to have made that leap from adolescence to young adulthood and later to middle age. Productivity may slacken, breakup rumors may periodically surface, and hiatuses of multiple years may come and go, but bands like Pearl Jam, Foo Fighters, Radiohead, and even studio feet-dragging outfits like Tool seem destined to carry on well into old age. The late Erik Erikson, a pioneer in human development, may have posited that the stability demonstrated by these bands stems from them being comfortable with themselves, secure in their relationships, and content with their standing in the music world. Hence, when it's time to plug in again, the band members are in a healthy space to create, contribute, and collaborate rather than backslide into the behaviors that cause an inordinate number of bands to whither long before their time.
None of this is meant to make an academic study of the longevity of rock bands, but it's perhaps worth considering that the difference between a band burning brightly or burning out prematurely could be this idea of discovering a new type of maturity in the midst of crisis. And considering all the mounting tensions that consumed Pearl Jam prior to recording Yield, it makes the record seem like a clear-cut resolution of the destructive behaviors and problems that had plagued the group and threatened to cut their career short. The album feels not like a coming of age but, for this band, a coming of middle age and the first leg of the rest of their run together as a veteran act.
Pearl Jam might be the most dependable, well-oiled American touring band around in 2018, but that's light years from the tumult of the group's earliest days, which included, among other trials, rising from the ashes of a fallen friend and bandmate. Less than three years after Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament had buried both Andrew Wood and their rock star dreams as Mother Love Bone, the two found themselves at the unpredictable epicenter of the grunge explosion as members of Temple of the Dog, the fictional band Citizen Dick in Cameron Crowe's Seattle-promoting Singles, and the multiplatinum-selling grunge band Pearl Jam. The fame rushed in even quicker than units could ship out, but with notoriety also came cries of “sellouts,” castigation over the graphic “Jeremy” music video, and barbs flung at the band by no less than Kurt Cobain — comments the Nirvana frontman later rescinded.
By the time Vs. and Vitalogy had run amok all over the top of the charts a couple years later, the band had already taken personal steps to sidestep some of the media's glaring spotlight. They stopped giving interviews, cut down on their television appearances, opted out of releasing singles, and refused to belittle their songs by making music videos. More infamously, they declared war on Ticketmaster after finding out that the ticketing behemoth had been sticking it to fans with secret service charges on tickets to Pearl Jam concerts, even ones organized as “benefits.” The ongoing five-year battle saw Gossard and Ament testifying before congress and the band attempting to tour from scratch without the backing of the world's biggest ticket broker or its spiderweb network of venues.
1996's No Code can be viewed in several different lights. For fans, it remains an inexplicable outlier in Pearl Jam's catalog, even though many have warmed to its eclectic charms over the years. For Pearl Jam, as a band, it could constitute hitting rock bottom. Musically, it finds them, as on Vitalogy, pushing as far away from their anthemic roots as possible – as far away from themselves as possible, which makes sense. The gauntlet of grassroots touring sans Ticketmaster had taken its toll on the entire outfit, and Eddie Vedder, heretofore given complete creative control of the band's direction, had burned out on going it alone. So strained was the recording process that co-founding member Jeff Ament didn't find out Pearl Jam was even recording a new album until three days into the sessions. By all accounts, drummer Jack Irons can be credited with nursing the band through the sessions intact and even reportedly got the bandmates to begin sorting through their contentions by the end of recording. “No Code was all about gaining perspective,” Vedder would later explain, a theme easily identified in several of the album's contemplative, inward-looking songs, like “Off He Goes” and “In My Tree”.
I'd argue that just casually inspecting the packaging of Yield tells you so much about the band's maturity and state of mind. Instead of the chaotic, eye-diverting mosaic of 156 bizarre Polaroids that constitutes the album art for No Code — not to mention the collect-the-whole-album loose replica photos that came with each copy — Yield features a yield sign presiding over an open expanse of rolling Montana highway, sandwiched between two black bars, one above and the other beneath, as in a widescreen projection. Flipping open the front cover reveals a cut-out and that the yield sign actual resides in a sky-blue sea with no bounds. The cool, crisp, and pacifying artwork meant something slightly different to each member. Ament sees it as representing open possibilities, Vedder as a reminder of that aforementioned perspective, and Mike McCready as as sign of maturity and the band having become more comfortable in their own skin.
It's not surprising then that Yield sounds as it does: unabashedly like Pearl Jam, only a bit older and wiser. In many respects, it was the first Pearl Jam album not made in reaction to previous recordings. It feels at peace with itself, comfortable enough to open up and soar like the band hadn't in years on anthemic singles “Given to Fly” and “In Hiding” one moment and to mumble through a cataloging of Vedder's desires the next on “Wishlist”. The album, while eclectic, somehow manages to find a through line between songs as emotionally varied as the paranoid agitation of “Brain of J.”, the tranquility of “Low Light”, and the resolute abandonment of “MFC”. With Vedder ceding some creative control and asking bandmates to bring in more developed songs for him to polish, Yield marks the beginning of Pearl Jam as a more collaborative studio outfit –more a songwriting brotherhood now than Vedder and four flies on the studio wall.
As important as Yield and its songs are to Pearl Jam's narrative, the record also found them in a place where they were comfortable enough to begin making decisions based on what was best for the band and their fans rather than on broad, sweeping principles that had often crippled or put undue strain on them in the past. For instance, the band that had famously refrained from reducing their songs to music videos opted to partner with Spawn creator Todd McFarlane on an animated video for “Do the Evolution”, a power-drunk take on technology that perfectly matched McFarlane's dark, skeptical depictions of the world. Even more critically, Pearl Jam finally ended its one-band crusade against Ticketmaster, which allowed them to tour full-scale again and return to venues and towns they hadn't visited in years. Their 1998 North American tour behind Yield alone can boast an incredible live record (Live on Two Legs), bringing former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron on board full time, and truly planting the seed for what would germinate into the most reliable, dedicated, and rewarding veteran touring act working today.
If the maturing that Pearl Jam underwent as a band between the end of the No Code sessions and the touring of Yield can be viewed as the band equivalent of a person transitioning from adolescence to young adulthood, then the group have long since entered middle age. It's a time in life when people — in this case, a band — traditionally turn outward to care for others and view the world with empathy and concern. In that respect, look no further than the band's upcoming hometown shows this August in Seattle. They've pledged to donate at least a million dollars from those concerts to help the local homeless, with the goal of raising several more a million through community partnerships. Picture it: Pearl Jam's first hometown shows in five years; 100,000 people in attendance, the most for a show in Seattle since the Stones back in 1981; a guaranteed marathon set from one of the best live bands going; and a chance to funnel millions of dollars towards helping the most needy among us — the real forgotten Americans.
Now, that's a future worth growing into.
CHARLOTTE - Two spectacular birdies in the last six holes brought Justin Thomas his first major title, the 14th-ranked American taking the PGA Championship on Sunday in a back-nine shootout thriller.
On a day that saw five players share the lead at one stage, Thomas fired a three-under par 68 to finish 72 holes on eight-under par 276 for a two-stroke victory over South Africa's Louis Oosthuizen, Italy's Francesco Molinari and American Patrick Reed.
"I knew know matter what my game was at I had to be patient," Thomas said. "I knew I had the game to get it done. I just had to put it out there." Thomas rolled in an amazing 40-foot chip shot at the par-3 13th for a two-stroke lead and curled a 14-foot putt into the left side of the cup to birdie the par-3 17th for a three-shot edge, making a closing bogey all-but irrelevant. "To make a birdie there was beyond a bonus," Thomas said of 17. "And 13 was really special as well."
Thomas, 24, claimed the Wanamaker Trophy and grabs the top prize of $1.89 million (1.59 million euros) for his fourth victory of the season after last year's CIMB Classic in Malaysia and two January events in Hawaii, the Tournament of Champions and Sony Open.
World number three Hideki Matsuyama, trying to become Japan's first men's major golf champion, led at the turn but had five bogeys and three birdies on the back nine to share fifth with US star Rickie Fowler on 279. "The course played tough. The pins were receptive, though. I was just disappointed the way I played," Matsuyama said. "The last major of the year, and I was in contention. All I can do is just try harder next time."
Canada's Graham DeLaet and 54-hole leader Kevin Kisner were another shot back. Thomas sandwiched a birdie between two bogeys on the first three holes, but bounced back with birdies at seven, nine and 10 -- the last after his putt hung on the edge of the cup for nearly 10 seconds before falling in. "It just kind of snuck up on the hole," Thomas said. "It kind of acted like a child and threw a tantrum and then it went in."
One by one, rivals fell aside, the last being compatriot Kisner, whose 209-yard eagle longshot from the 18th fairway to force a playoff landed in a creek. "It was a crazy day," Thomas said. "It had to be an unbelievable day spectating."
Matsuyama sank a 22-foot birdie putt at the par-5 10th but made bogeys on the next three holes, responded with two birdies, then missed a four-foot par putt to bogey 16 and closed with another to fall back. Oosthuizen, the only major winner among the contenders after his 2010 British Open triumph, holed a 34-yard chip shot eagle at the par-5 15th but followed with a bogey to blunt the impact of his closing birdie. "The only putt I made was on the last hole," Oosthuizen said. "I gave it everything I had coming in."
Tension mounted as Matsuyama, Molinari, Kisner, Thomas and Stroud all shared the lead at seven-under at one stage. Kisner lipped out a six-foot par putt at 11 to fall back, his first miss inside seven feet all week after 53 such putts.
Stroud missed from the same distance for par moments later, his first off-target putt from so close as well.
Molinari charged into the hunt with four birdies in a five-hole stretch ending at 15 but a bogey at 16 and two closing pars was not enough. Reed made four birdies in five holes on the front nine, added another at 10 and birdied 14 and 15th to reach seven-under but a closing bogey doomed his hopes.
Fourth-ranked Rory McIlroy, the 2012 and 2014 champion seeking his fifth career major title, fired a 68 to finish on 285, sharing 22nd. After the round, the Northern Ireland star said he has been nagged by back spasms and might not play again this season. "I don't know what I'm going to do," he said. "You might not see me until next year. You might see me in a couple of weeks."

LAHORE - Pakistan's benchmark equity index, KSE100, has rallied 45.6 percent to become the Asia's best performing market in 2016.
The multiyear growth trajectory received boost after the MSCI announcement to reclassify Pakistan to Emerging Markets, resulting in KSE100 index outperforming its peers in Frontier Markets and most of the countries in Emerging Markets. Here, improving domestic economy and enormous local liquidity supported the index levels at the time of weaknesses.
Amongst Asian markets, Pakistan remained on top. Moreover it also remained number one in MSCI Frontier Markets. As shown in accompanied table, according to Bloomberg, Pakistan market posted 5th highest return in the world.
Strong performance of Pakistan equities in 2016 was mainly led by strong local cash liquidity thanks to falling interest rate and rising investor confidence. Economic recovery positively affected local demand for various sectors, rebound in oil prices, better security situation and exuberance on Pakistan's reclassification in MSCI EM Index also helped.
Foreign investors continued to offload equities during 2016 (net selling $340m) as most of the EM and FM funds kept facing redemptions. Despite all the gains, 2017 looks very favourable for the Pakistan equities as the MSCI reclassification has added cherry to the already built investment theme; based upon political stability, macroeconomic strength, better security situation and Chinese investments. PSX divestment further swells the enthusiasm, to result in better liquidity, new products and investor confidence.
In line with expectations, Automobiles and Cement remained top performing sectors in 2016 posting market cap gains of 73 percent and 66 percent, respectively. Index heavy weight Oil & Gas Exploration sector (E&Ps) was up 52 percent, whereas banks were up 33 percent. Fertiliser sector was down 5 percent due to weak fertiliser demand and high inventory levels.
Amongst top 30 stocks in terms of market capitalisation, Pakistan Oil Fields (POL), The Searle Company (SEARL) and Mari Petroleum (MARI) remained top performers posting gains of 112 percent, 106 percent, and 98 percent respectively in 2016. Average volumes at the local bourse increased by 14 percent to 281 million, whereas average value was up only 2 percent to Rs11.6 billion ($111m) in 2016. In the derivative market, traded value in single stock futures stood flat and remained at Rs3.0 billion/ $29 million a day in 2016 as against Rs3.1 billion/$30 million in 2015.
Margin Trading System (MTS) financing rose by 86 percent in 2016 to reach Rs9 billion, while open interest in single stock futures was up by 100 percent in 2016 to reach Rs11 billion. In spite of rising leverage, the financing rate in MTS fell from 9 percent to 8 percent at end on 2016 and similarly average ready future spread fell to 8 percent from 9 percent.
Despite booming market, in the absence of government offerings, Pakistan witnessed just 3 initial public offerings in 2016 with amount raised of Rs4.2 billion as against offering of Rs116 billion seen in 2015. Falling interest rate and maturity of high yielding government securities has been supporting the local equities. And this is likely to continue in 2017 also. Smooth transition of new army chief, political stability and improving security situation has also been a welcome development for the market in 2016. This has positive implications on investors' confidence. Resultantly, SBP-IBA consumer confidence index was up 3 percent in 2016. Political noise also reduced in 2016 as opposition parties' protest against Panama scandal has not been effective.
Though tension with India created some uncertainty but now it has also eased.
In another landmark development, 40 percent strategic stake in Pakistan Stock Exchange was sold to Chinese Consortium valuing the exchange at $215 million. Investors now hope of new products and better governance that will go a long way in the development of Pakistan capital markets. Another reason supporting this stock market rally in 2016 was improving economy. Pakistan economy grew by 4.7 percent in FY16 compared to last three-year average growth of 3.9 percent.
Foreign exchange reserves of the country improved by 12 percent to reach $23 billion at the end of 2016, enough for 7 months of imports. Policy interest rate reached multi decade low of 5.75 percent mainly due to lower inflation.

I've never played any of the Far Cry games, but that's probably going to change with Far Cry 5. Ubisoft has released a new story trailer for Far Cry 5, which delves into the game's central conflict—a doomsday cult called “The Project at Eden's Gate” has taken over the fictional Hope County, Montana, and it's up to you to put together a band of rebels and take down the cult.
Ubisoft has also announced that fans can get the Far Cry 5 Season Pass through the Far Cry 5 Gold Edition (old crotchety gamer voice: “I remember when you just bought the game and that was it!”) that will include “Hours of Darkness,” “which lets players travel back in time to Vietnam to battle against Việt Cộng soldiers; the zombie-filled ‘Dead Living Zombies'; and ‘Lost on Mars,' wherein players go to fight Martian arachnids,” according to EW. Additionally, if you're a season pass holder, you'll get access to Far Cry 3 Classic Edition four weeks prior to the game's summer 2018 launch on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. If you're a PC gamer, the season pass gets you Far Cry 3 immediately.
As for Far Cry 5, the gameplay appears to be in the same open-world, first-person shooter mold as past games, but I have to admit I'm intrigued by the setting. I can't recall another game that used a religious cult as the main adversary when you were on their turf, and that turf was in America. Whether that leads to a fulfilling story and/or a game that's fun to play, I'll wait until the reviews come out.
Check out the new Far Cry 5 trailer below. The game will be released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on March 27th.
Here's the official synopsis for Far Cry 5:
Back in 2012 Wercker, a Dutch startup which helps developers test and deploy code at a rapid pace, appeared. It fitted into the space of emerging new platforms that help developers build apps such as CloudBees, CircleCi and newcomers like CloudMunch. After raising a seed round it raised a $4.5 million Series A funding round last year.
It's today been acquired by Oracle for an undisclosed sum, which was clearly attracted by its container-centric and cloud-native automation platform, among others things.
Oracle and Wrecker are in alignment in that Oracle is building out its IaaS and PaaS foundation for its cloud computing platform.
Wercker's Series A round was led by Inkef Capital, with participation from existing investor Notion Capital. It had raised $7.5 million to date.
A Christmas message calling for prayers for those charged under Pakistan's blasphemy laws has led to death threats against the son of a provincial governor killed five years ago for criticizing the same laws.
The case highlights the continuing influence in Pakistan of Muslim hardliners who praise violence in the name of defending Islam, despite a government vow to crack down on religious extremism.
The hardliners have called for mass protests if police do not charge activist Shaan Taseer with blasphemy against Islam – a crime punishable by death.
Taseer's father, Punjab governor Salman Taseer, was gunned down by his bodyguard for championing the case of a Christian woman, Asia Bibi, who was sentenced to death under the blasphemy laws, which he said needed to be reformed.

In a video message posted on his Facebook page, Taseer, a Muslim, wishes a happy holiday to Christians, in solidarity, and also asked for prayers for the woman and others victimized by what he called “inhumane” blasphemy laws.
Taseer said on Monday that he had received “very credible death threats” from supporters of the hardline Muslim philosophy that inspired his father's killer, bodyguard Mumtaz Qadri.
“They are sending me Mumtaz Qadri's photos with messages that there are several Mumtaz Qadris waiting for me,” he told Reuters late on Monday.
Tens of thousands people attended Qadri's funeral last March after he was put to death for killing the governor because they considered him a hero – showing the potential for this case to become another flashpoint.

More than 200 people in Pakistan were charged under blasphemy laws in 2015 – many of them minorities such as Christians, who make up 1 percent of the population.
Critics say the laws are often used to settle personal scores, and pressure for convictions is often applied on police and courts from religious groups and lawyers dedicated to pushing the harshest blasphemy punishments.
At least 65 people, including lawyers, defendants and judges, have been murdered over blasphemy allegations since 1990, according to figures from a Center for Research and Security Studies report and local media.
A spokesman for the hardline Islamist movement Sunni Tehreek said it was demanding police in Lahore charge Shaan Taseer with blasphemy against Islam.
READ MORE: How concerned should you be about world travel after terror attacks?
Police declined to comment, and a copy of the police report on the complaint did not mention Shaan Taseer by name.
The police report did reference the Christmas message and opened an investigation the blasphemy laws' Section 295-A, which bans hate speech against any religion.
However, Sunni Tehreek has threatened mass street protests unless the younger Taseer is charged under Section 295-C – blasphemy against Islam or the Prophet Mohammad.
Sunni Tehreek figure Mujahid Abdur Rasool told Reuters the group was in negotiations with the government over the case.

“When we gave them a warning for protests, a delegation of Punjab government met us today,” Rasool said, adding they had set a deadline of Tuesday for police to meet their demands.
He said Sunni Tehreek was not calling for Taseer's murder, only his prosecution and eventual execution.
Punjab government officials could not be reached for comment.

The Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Ibe Kachikwu, says he has never received a call from President Muhammadu Buhari asking him to allocate oil blocs.Mr Kachikwu said this on Tuesday while declaring open 17th edition of the annual “Nigeria Oil and Gas Strategic Conference and International Exhibition'' in Abuja on Tuesday.He said Mr Buhari not calling him to allocate oil blocs was in line with the federal government's fight against corruption.According to him, he has led the restructuring of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), a culture which the Group Managing Director, Maikanti Baru carried out under the careful watch of the President.He reiterated that Mr Buhari had also never interfered on how he carried out his duties or tried to influence him negatively in the allocation of contracts.“One of the reasons why we have done so well is the fact that quite frankly, in my three years of serving as petroleum minister of state, I haven't received a single call from the president urging me to do an allocation to somebody or give a bloc to somebody.“I have not received such a call,'' Mr Kachikwu said.He said the president was expected to launch the `Project 100' by December even as he urged delegates to raise the benchmark of growth in the sector and not just attending conferences.The Project 100 is a concept Mr Kachikwu initiated to financially assist at least 100 competent Nigerian companies in the execution of projects hitherto handled by foreign companies.Mr Kachikwu disclosed that Nigeria's gas reserves had increased by seven trillion cubic feet (tcf) to 200tcf up from 192tcf.“By the end of the first quarter of 2018, field developments with total expectant production of 200,000 barrels were approved by the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR).“Gas reserves are estimated at 199tcf, up from 192tcf with the capacity to grow up to 600tcf.“We have to absolutely begin to look at how to provide gas for electricity and industrial use,'' he said.He said although the World was going electric with mobility, electric cars still constitute two per cent of world mobility, hence oil would be relevant probably till 2040 as global oil finds abound daily.“When we talk of other forces coming to replace oil, the truth remains that oil demands continue to increase. More oil wells are being discovered by the day.“The reality even when people point at electric cars, they still represent only two per cent of the instrument of mobility today.According to the DPR we have oil in excess of 59 billion barrels which will at the current consumption rate last more than years.“So, there is enough reason to feel that oil will be there for a long time, but the reality is that the performance within the oil sector will differ.“It is not how long it lasts, but what value it brings to the populace – the owners of the resource, how we are able to utilise whatever we find.“In 2017 alone, over 33 new mega projects, adding volumes of over 50 million barrels equivalents were sanctioned by the DPR.“We are increasing barrels, 36.18 billion barrels of proven reserves of crude oil and condensates as of first quarter of 2018, adding a life index of over 50 years at a depletion rate of 1.9 per cent.“There are about 80 open acreages currently under review to enhance the prospects in this sector. There are huge Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) in the horizon: Bonga South-West and Zabazaba which will be first ultra-deep-water project in the region.''He said there was a current normal and a new normal in the industry, the current being what was obtainable today, and the new where the industry should be.According to him, Nigeria's upstream rig count increased to about 21 during the first quarter of 2018, as against 17 and below five in 2017, and 2015 respectively.“Our current production level is roughly 2.15 million barrels per day. The stability in the Niger Delta has helped.“Today, we have about 46 Exploration and Production companies producing from more than 180 fields as at the end of 2017, 55.6 per cent (of oil production) comes from JV portfolio, 35 per cent from PSCs, six per cent from sole risks and three per cent from marginal fields.''He said Nigeria would have to quickly move to secure Africa's regional oil market for itself, as well as drive down her cost of producing oil per barrel.“With the emergence of the U.S to almost independence in terms of energy provision and less reliance on foreign imported oil, the market has dwindled substantially,” the minister said.“We need to begin to look at how to sustain and firm up regional adherence to our kind of crude.“Cost of producing oil in Nigeria continues to be extremely high on a comparative basis and the programmes that will drive the cost of production down must be one driven by business sense.''(NAN)
DUBAI - PTI Chairman Imran Khan has said that everyone in the country wants peace with India.
In an exclusive interview to Khaleej Times, the cricketer-turned-politician who met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year, said: “I am a bit disturbed by the way Prime Minister Modi has tried to isolate Pakistan rather than encouraging the relationship forward. All of us, I mean, everyone in Pakistan wants peace with India. Anyone who states otherwise is wrong.”
India and Pakistan have been at loggerheads since a group of gunmen killed 19 Indian soldiers in September at an army camp in Held Kashmir, an attack India blamed on Pakistan-based militants.
But Khan said that “the hallmark of good leaders is that they should resist this pressure of going back to hostilities in the event of a terrorist attack. I think the responsibility lies with the bigger country. India is a huge country and it could have done more to improve the relationship with Pakistan”.
“I think trade with all the neighbours should be Pakistan's priority. And trade with India and China would be the best way,” he suggested.
PPP leaders Asif Ali Zardari and Bilawal Bhutto have announced they would be entering the Parliament after winning by-elections.
And Imran Khan, who states he is fighting for a corruption-free and a just Pakistan, has hinted at being ready for a joint struggle to make Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif accountable for “stashing billions in offshore accounts”.
“As far as the joint Opposition against Panama goes, we were all together in the assembly.” We wanted the Prime Minister to answer those questions. And on that issue we'll probably be together in the Parliament with all the Opposition,” said Khan while making it clear that “there is no question of an electoral alliance” with the PPP.
A former Pakistan cricket team captain who won his country the World Cup in 1992, he is unhappy about the way the cricket affairs are being run in Pakistan. “Pakistani cricket is very poorly managed. The structure is probably one of the worst anywhere in the world. Because we do not have a proper cricket structure, proper management in Pakistan, we cannot tap into this huge talent.”
Khan, whose two marriages have ended in divorce, says he is not sure about a third one in 2017.

Kias 2018 Sorento is a pleasant driver that gives owners plenty for their money.
Thats because this family crossover leaves little to separate it from the best in its class. And it many categories it may hold that honor.
The Sorento, the latest generation of which was introduced two years ago, has a lot to recommend it. It is an attractive, modern crossover. It has the Kia front face and I like the impact of the narrow headlamp housings. The sidelines flow to brawny rear shoulders, something sport utes really benefit from having.
The Sorento, built at Kias U.S. manufacturing plant in West Point, Ga., is Kias best-selling CUV. Last year the crossover sport ute gets technology improvements, such as Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. The 2018 Sorento offers a host of optional driver assists such as autonomous emergency braking and active high-beam headlights.

All five Sorento trim levels  L, LX, EX, SX and SXL  get safety features which, in my view, should be on any vehicle sold today. These include electronic stability control, traction control, brake assist, hill-start assist, electronic brake force distribution and antilock braking.
Additional technologies such as Roll Over Mitigation and Cornering Brake Control on AWD models also were added as standard equipment. The safety value of these features  some of which are required by the government  cannot be overstated.
On some models you can add even more active safety features which help the driver to do what cars multitude of sensors think they are trying to do. These optional capabilities include vehicle stability control, forward collision warning, adaptive cruise control, blind spot detection, rear cross traffic alert and a surround view monitor. All these systems simply make people better drivers than they may really be. That in turn makes the roads safer for them, and the rest of us sharing their road.
But these capabilities add to the very nature of the Sorento. For a seven-, or even five-, passenger crossover, the Sorento is fun to drive. It is quiet, and rather large, but drives smaller than it actually is. It is nice to discover you are driving what is essentially a big car rather than a truck. It is tighter, more responsive and smoother than it would be if it was a body-on-frame truck platform.
The Sorento I tested was the top-of-the-line SXL V6 AWD. Its MSRP was a bit more than $46,000, but it left little to ask for. The stereo was tops, the interior both comfortable and high-end, with almost-white leather that looks great, and will hopefully consider ketchup-basted French fries a temporary mess.
Its 3.3-liter V6 produces 290 hp. and 252 lb.-ft. of peak torque, which flows through a six-speed automatic transmission. With an estimated fuel mileage of 17 mpg city and 23 mpg highway, those who want the additional power can have it without any serious guilt. In addition, if you have the right equipment on it, the V6 Sorento can have a 5,000- lb. towing capability.
The Sorento comes in either front-wheel drive or full-time all-wheel drive. The AWD system automatically routes power to the wheel with the most traction. It also includes a four-wheel drive lock mode that sets the power ratios between the front and back wheels.
But it is the cabin thats important on a family vehicle, and Kia has added plenty of features  even upscale features  to broaden the appeal of the Sorento to more affluent customers. So there are Nappa leather-covered heated and ventilated front seats with as much as 14-way powered driver and eight-way passenger seats. Even the second-row seats can also be heated.
Other features include dual-zone climate controls and Kias second-generation panoramic sunroof. The Infinity premium stereo system uses 12 speakers to make music from the optional 630-watt 11-channel amplifier. This system uses Infinitys exclusive Clari-Fi, which uses clever algorithms to expand the compressed music from any source to make it close to the musics original dynamic range. The difference is both noticeable and impressive.
Being the family van, the Sorento has plenty of space for stuff with 74-cu. ft. of overall cargo volume. Even with the third row in place there is still 11 cu. ft. behind it.
Prices for the Sorento begin with the Sorento L, with an MSRP of $25,800. Then LX, EX and SX models with various engines, and front- or all-wheel drive run the price up to the V6-powered Sorento SX-Limited which with AWD has an MSRP of $46,200.
Kias Sorento is becoming a common sight at school pickup sites and community sports parking lots. For many people, theyve discovered that Kia is no longer the value brand  which means its products are cheap. Today Kias offerings arent cheap, although they may be inexpensive.
The theory behind Kias pricing is to offer more for the buyers money, not charge less than the competitors. Its clear that many suburbanite families have discovered that they can have afforded to have what they need in a car and a fair bit of what they want as well.

Post Narmada Parikrama, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister and Congress general secretary Digvijaya Singh is now on to his next mission: Ekta Yatra.
Though the date of initiating this new mission has not yet been disclosed, it's expected to begin in the first week of May. Digvijaya's objective behind this Ekta Yatra (journey for unity) is to regain the lost ground by reconnecting with old Congress workers across the state, prepare them for the forthcoming Assembly election in Madhya Pradesh and create an anti-Shivraj Singh Chouhan atmosphere by highlighting failures of the BJP government.
While his previous 3,300-kilometre Narmada Parikrama along the Narmada river intended at exploring the soft Hinduvta line, the Ekta Yatra is more about connecting with the electorate especially the backward castes and Dalits.
The six-month Narmada Parikrama began on 30 September, 2017, and concluded on 9 April. According to Congress sources, the roadmap of the Ekta Yatra has been finalised. “The road map is ready. He'll visit up to block-level. Party's social media team will also play up this yatra on various platforms”, a source said.
Recently, Madhya Pradesh witnessed Dalit protests on 2 April during Bharat Bandh which resulted in six deaths. The state also witnessed a farmers' agitation in 2017, where six people were killed in police firing at Mandsaur district.
“Digvijaya ji will visit all the 166 Assembly seats of the BJP and showcase the failures of the government. He will highlight issues such as agrarian distress, suffering of Dalits and rampant corruption”, a source associated with the Digvijaya camp told Firstpost.
One may recall that at the end of the Narmada Parikrama, Digvijaya said with the completion of his auspicious journey, a religious and spiritual exercise, his political journey would begin. During his journey, Digvijaya remarked that he got evidence of illegal sand mining and people provided him documents and proof.
Once known as political mentor of Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Digvijaya —a two-term Madhya Pradesh chief minister and a descendant of erstwhile royal family of Raghogarh — has become active in state politics once again. “I'm a politician and that's what I'll do after I complete my parikrama”, he'd said.
Digvijaya had been out of active state politics since he'd lost to the BJP in 2003. Though he made it clear that he doesn't aim to be chief minister, regaining lost ground is the most important objective of this yatra. “I want to strengthen the party in the state”, Digvijaya remarked.
The last phase of Digvijaya as chief minister witnessed severe grievances and anger among people of Madhya Pradesh on various issues: From poor governance to deteriorating infrastructure. The BJP came to power by showcasing Digvijaya government's failure: Severe shortage of electricity, poor condition of roads and lack of water supply to farmers. As a result, the BJP government has been in power for the past 15 years.
Though this new initiative has been viewed as Digvijaya's personal effort — much like the Narmada Parikrama — it'll be backed by the party. According to sources, Digvijaya has kept Congress high command in the loop. A large number of Congress MLAs and workers are looking forward to it.
“He's our senior most leader in Madhya Pradesh. We all will support him for whatever he does for the party. We'll do whatever he asks us to do for the party and the state. His yatra is aimed at reconnecting with Congress workers who are either annoyed or have taken a backseat or have become inactive”, Bhopal-based Congress leader and spokesperson JP Dhanopia told Firstpost.
To draw national attention, Digvijaya recently wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of the latter's visit to tribal district Mandla on 24 April. Modi visited Jabalpur followed by Mandla as a part Panchayati Raj Divas celebration. Digvijaya wrote to Modi asking that payments under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act be released to labourers in Madhya Pradesh's tribal districts.
While the Congress hasn't yet finalised its chief ministerial nominee for Madhya Pradesh, it remains to be seen how far Digvijaya Singh succeeds in winning back the confidence of the people.
“I mean, you guys make it sound like we think about it, really. We don't. We just try to play and win each point, each game. Being two sets to one down is like being a set (behind) in a three-set match. We're not going to overthink it: `Oh, I'm two sets to one down. What am I going to do? How am I going to play the next point?“' he responded. “We try to play our best. We try to maybe change a few tactics and see how we can win the next point and the next game.”

The NDP's Bruce Ralston first won this riding in 2005, and has held it ever since.
From 1985 to 2001, it belonged to NDP's Joan Smallwood, and has only been held by the BC Liberals once in the past 30 years, after the 2001 wipe-out.
In 2013, Ralston more than doubled the vote total of his Liberal challenger (61 per cent – 29 per cent).
In 2009 Ralston's margin of victory was even higher.
In short, this is one of the safest NDP seats in Metro Vancouver.
Candidates
BC Liberals' Sargy Chima is described on her website as a “longtime public servant and active community volunteer.” Chima is the sister of former federal cabinet minister Herb Dhaliwal.
NDP's Bruce Ralston was first elected in 2005. Ralston most recently served as the Critic for Natural Gas Development, Trade, Immigration, and Multiculturalism.
A lawyer, Ralston served as Surrey city councillor from 1988-1993.
Green Party's Rita Fromholt is a former Project Manager and Business Analyst in the Vancouver tech sector. Fromholt has been involved in political campaigns on both the provincial and federal levels, with the Green party, the NDP and the federal Liberals. She is also part of Al Gore's Climate Leader Corps.

The Winnipeg Blue Bombers opened their three day mini camp at Investors Group Field Tuesday morning.
Four quarterbacks and 15 receivers were on the field, including starting-QB Matt Nichols and receivers Nic Demski and Adarius Bowman, both of whom were acquired in the off season.

Demski is a Winnipegger, while Bowman is back for his second stint in blue and gold, having played with the Bombers from 2009-2010.
Nichols said the receiving corps is shaping up to be very good this season, with a good mix of size and speed.
“We got some big guys out here, some guys that can run around, guys that can make some moves,” said Nichols. “I think that we're going to have the best depth by far that we've had at receiver so it's fun for me because you feel like anyone you're throwing the ball to has some ability.”
“The most excited I've been about a receiving core in a long time, that's for sure.”
Linebacker Maurice Leggett and kicker Justin Medlock were two of the other notable veterans suited up.
Most of the players on the field Tuesday were CFL rookies.

As for the fans, expectations for the team are high.
“I expect them to win the Grey Cup this year,” said longtime season ticket holder Ken Fredricksen.
“They certainly (loaded up) on defensive backs and wide receivers. But I think their biggest thing is the middle linebacker, they've got to get that fixed,” Fredricksen said.
Royce Collins said the offence is set up for a great season.
“I think with the acquisition of Kienan LaFrance and Demski from Saskatchewan is going to make a heck of a difference,” Collins, who also has Bomber season tickets, said. “I think Nichols is going to have a fantastic year.”
LaFrance is also from Winnipeg and appeared in 13 games as a running back with the Roughriders last season. Demski appeared in nine games, putting up 222 receiving yards and one touchdown.
Newly-acquired quarterback Darian Durant was not on the field Tuesday as he was dealing with a personal matter.
The Blue Bombers went 12-6 last season before losing to the Edmonton Eskimos in the West Division Semi-Final.
Mini camp continues Wednesday and Thursday and is open to the public.

Lenovo Group Ltd is looking to make smart wearables in India and raise its share of the local market by three-fold, in a plan that will help boost Prime Minister Narendra Modi's scheme to promote the country as an electronics manufacturing hub.
The company is targeting to corner by this year a 20 percent share of India's market for wearables, such as smartwatches and fitness bands, Sebastian Peng, head of accessories at Lenovo Mobile Business Group, told Reuters in an interview on 24 April.
Since the firm started selling its wearables in India in 2017, the company has achieved 6 to 7 percent of the market share of smart wearables in the country, he said.
The company is now planning to start manufacturing in India, where the smart wearables market is expected to grow 30 to 40 percent this year, Peng added. Lenovo currently makes its wearable products in China. “We have started talks with local manufacturers to start manufacturing within the country. We're trying to start these operations sometime this year,” Peng said over the phone from New Delhi, where he is attending a product launch.
Lenovo has already partnered with homegrown e-commerce firm Flipkart to sell wearables on its platform, said Naveen Bajaj, India head at Shenzhen Aodishi Technology, which is Lenovo's authorized overseas accessories distributor.
Lenovo, which also makes products ranging from smartphones to laptops, will expand its wearable offerings on other e-commerce portals, such as Amazon.com. The company will push to establish a physical retail network as well, starting with major Indian cities.
“Smart wearables is the key category we're trying to push for this year. We are very confident that we can achieve our target,” Peng said.
India's wearables market was worth $157 million in 2017, according to International Data Corporation. Other wearable sellers in the country include Xiaomi Technology, Huawei, and Fitbit. Once local manufacturing kicks off, Peng said the company would consider India as an export hub for wearables.
Lenovo already sells its HW02 fitness band and HX03W cardio smartband in India through its retail outlets and e-commerce platforms.

MK Bassal Ghattas. (Hadas Parush/Flash90)
YERUSHALAYIM - The Knesset Ethics Committee on Monday voted to suspend United Arab List MK Bassal Ghattas from the Knesset for six months. Ghattas will remain an MK but will not be able to vote or participate in Knesset debates, and he will lose his parliamentary immunity, and will not receive his salary or other benefits associated with Knesset representation.
Ghattas is currently under house arrest and will remain as such for at least the next five weeks, while police investigate the allegations against him. Ghattas is accused of smuggling of 15 cellphones to top terrorists in Israeli prisons, along with secret messages that were to be used to assist in the carrying out of terror attacks. He has been questioned numerous times on the matter, and has maintained his innocence. On Sunday, an indictment was handed down against Assad Daka, a relative and aide to Ghattas. According to the indictment, Daka provided Ghattas with 12 devices and 16 SIM cards, for use by terrorists.
While police decide if Ghattas's actions in smuggling cellphones into a high-security prison for the benefit of prisoners serving sentences for terror attacks is a crime, the Committee said that it was without a doubt an ethics violation. The request to suspend Ghattas was made by coalition chairman MK David Bitan (Likud) as well as MKs Yaakov Peri and Miki Levy (both Yesh Atid). Ghattas's actions “are traitorous to the State of Israel and its people. It does not make sense for Israeli citizens to pay the salary of a man who acts to harm them.”
After the vote, Ghattas told Army Radio that the decision was “politically motivated, and an act of personal revenge against me. This is the first time an MK has been treated in this manner, in the face of still-unproven criminal charges in an ongoing, open case. The Ethics Committee appointed itself judge and jury, and imposed a punishment.” Ghattas added that he was considering appealing to the High Court, demanding that he be restored to his position.
In an interview with Al Jazeera last week, Ghattas said that he was completely innocent, and that his arrest was due to anti-Arab “incitement. This is part of the fall of Israel down the slippery slope of racism, as the right and radical religious rise in power. I will pay any price to protect my rights to defend my nation, and in particular our prisoners.”
Responding to the suspension, MK Shuli Muallem-Refaeli (Jewish Home), a member of the Ethics Committee, said that the suspension was not sufficient. “This punishment does not match the severity of his crime, and the Committee should have been harsher,” she said. “Ghattas has set a new standard for actions that harm the state, to an extent that we haven't seen before. It would be proper to punish him in a much more serious manner for these actions.”
Opera Niagara is ready to raise the curtain on its second season.
And to get the aria started will be a spring showcase March 25 at the Seneca Niagara Theatre, gathering some of the brightest – and biggest – voices in the Niagara Region and beyond.
"The authentic quality is the thing we're looking for," says singer, teacher and Opera Niagara general director Maria Vetere. "To give young amateur singers an opportunity to gain necessary experience right here at home, so that they can pursue their careers abroad."
The first season in downtown Niagara Falls was such a hit, Vetere says she was constantly stopped by people thanking her for bringing something different to town. Inside the 300-seat theatre that used to be a moviehouse and even a troubled bar year ago, patrons heard Verdi, Puccini and other opera staples performed by both seasoned opera vets and students of Vetere's own Vetere Studio.
All under the watchful eye of artistic director Aprile Millo, who has performed in some of the most prestigious opera houses in the world alongside Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo.
"We're not presenting 'popera,'" says Vetere. "This is the real deal. People are singing full arias…these are fully trained people singing without microphones."
To make things easier for the audience, the first season included a screen above the stage with English translations.
To kick off Season 2 will be singers from Washington, New York and Vancouver, with guest baritone Jeffrey Carl and pianist David Eliakis.
"We're basically showing the various parts of our company, and it's going to be a first-class afternoon of really high level performing," says Vetere.
The spring showcase is the lead-in to two shows in June featuring Puccini's "Il Tabarro" and "Suor Angelica."
President Trump Isn't Abandoning Criticism Of FBI And The Russia Investigation
The White House says President Trump still has concerns about the FBI despite a Republican lawmaker deflating his "spygate" charge. It also weighs in on the Roseanne Barr controversy.
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
The White House says President Trump is sticking to his criticism of the FBI and the Russia investigation. That's despite a Republican lawmaker poking a hole in the president's claims that an FBI informant was actually a spy implanted in Trump's campaign for political purposes. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson joins us now from the White House to understand all this. Hey, there Mara.
MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Audie.
CORNISH: So the Republican we're going to talk about is Congressman Trey Gowdy of South Carolina. He chairs the House Oversight Committee. He's one of just a few members who actually attended last week's classified briefing on this whole FBI informant issue. Here's what he told Fox News last night.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
TREY GOWDY: I'm even more convinced that the FBI did exactly what my fellow citizens would want them to do when they got the information they got and that it has nothing to do with Donald Trump.
CORNISH: Has nothing to do with Donald Trump. So, Mara, wouldn't the White House be happy with that assessment?
LIASSON: They don't sound too happy, although as a matter of fact, none of the lawmakers who attended that classified briefing came out and said they'd been shown evidence that backs up the president's repeated claims that the Obama administration sent a spy to infiltrate his campaign. But today, the White House press secretary said the president still believes there's, quote, "cause for concern about the FBI."
But the only conclusion lawmakers have talked about after they went to that meeting, which the president asked for in the interest of, quote, "total transparency," was, as you just heard, according to Trey Gowdy, that the FBI was looking into what the Russians were up to, not what Donald Trump was up to.
CORNISH: In the meantime, The New York Times reports that the president tried to get Attorney General Jeff Sessions to reverse his recusal on the investigation. People will remember Jeff Sessions recused himself. And what is the significance of that right now, Trump's latest comments?
LIASSON: Well, the significance of that is that that could be potential evidence of obstruction of justice. But we already knew that Trump was very unhappy with Sessions' decision to recuse himself, according to DOJ rules. Today, the president tweeted he wished he hadn't chosen Sessions in the first place. Sarah Sanders was asked if he's so unhappy with Sessions, why not fire him? She didn't really answer that question. But the problem is that even though Trump seems to want to fire Sessions, Republican senators have reportedly told him in private that they wouldn't confirm a replacement for Sessions.
So for now, he's stuck with an AG who's recused from overseeing and therefore reining in the special counsel's investigation. So he continues to publicly disparage Jeff Sessions. At the same time, he's continuing this bigger effort of undermining the credibility of the FBI and the Mueller investigation.
CORNISH: Finally, the president weighed in on a major controversy in the entertainment world in the last 24 hours, Roseanne Barr. What did he have to say?
LIASSON: This is really interesting. Roseanne Barr is a friend. She's a big fan of his. He's a big fan of her show. He's told his supporters that he believes the show is about him and his supporters. He says, it's about us. He's reveled in the success of the show, talked about its high ratings. But the president did not come to defend Roseanne Barr's racist tweet. No one is doing that, not even Sean Hannity, who's criticized it too. But he did complain in a tweet about the apology that ABC gave to Valerie Jarrett, the African-American former Obama administration official who Roseanne Barr compared to an ape.
He tweeted, gee, Bob Iger never called Donald J. Trump to apologize for the horrible statements made about me. And Sarah Sanders continued that argument today in the briefing. Here's what she said.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS: Where was Bob Iger's apology to the White House staff for Jemele Hill calling the president and anyone associated with him a white supremacist, to Christians around the world for Joy Behar calling Christianity a mental illness? Where was the apology for Kathy Griffin going on a profane rant against the president...
LIASSON: Well, Jemele Hill was suspended, Kathy Griffin did lose her show. But once again, what you can see is that the president's MO is to be in a fight with a foil that he finds politically useful to him. Whether it's the FBI or the mainstream media, he's always in a culture war. He's one of the most effective culture warriors around.
CORNISH: That's NPR's Mara Liasson. Mara, thanks.
LIASSON: Thank you.

The Federal Open Market Committee selected Jerome Powell as its new chairman effective Saturday, replacing Janet Yellen. He will be officially sworn on Monday. Midwest economic expert Creighton University professor Ernie Goss believes there will be some change with new leadership.
“Yellen was more of a dove than Jay Powell, who is a little bit more hawkish,” Goss said. “He's more likely to be raising rates than she would have been.”
So, what does that mean for interest rates in the relative short term?
“I think they'll be a little more aggressive increasing rates at a bit faster pace,” said Goss. “They are now expected to raise rates by three-quarters of a percent by the end of the year. My bet is, we're going to have more than that. We'll probably have as much as a 1 percent increase in short-term interest rates. We've already seen short-term rates coming up. I think they're going to go up a bit faster in the weeks and months ahead. Long-term rates, mortgage rates also trending higher.”
So, if you're looking at refinancing your house, now is a good time.
“I would lock those rates in,” said Goss. “I'd go for more of a fixed rate than a variable rate. I would go right now. There could be some volatility in the long-term interest rates, in other words, those could come down a bit, but I'm more toward higher there as well.”
We should know more about the rates at the next Fed meeting in March.

MANAMA - Fernando Alonso's outburst of frustration and Stoffel Vandoorne's mid-race tweeted photograph summed up McLaren's failures in Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix and hinted at deeper turmoil ahead.
The Spanish two-time champion said he had never raced with so little power in his life while Belgian new boy Vandoorne posted a picture of him running on a treadmill after another engine failure had prevented him starting. Both men's action underlined the problems at McLaren where a promising chassis has been unable to show its real potential because of Honda's hapless failure to deliver a reliable and competitive engine. The team is widely expected now to intensify its efforts to find a solution with partners Honda or to seek a new temporary engine supplier.
Alonso, 35, and in the third and final year of his contract with McLaren, retired his car with an engine failure after a race spent fighting for mid-field positions. It was his third retirement in three races and may help to explain why he is so keen to take a break and miss the Monaco Grand Prix and take part in the Indianapolis 500 next month. "I have never raced with less power in my life," he said in one radio blast. When his team suggested a change of strategy, he said: "Do whatever you want, man."
Later, Alonso revealed: "The deficit in power and performance we had on the straights was amazing. Sometimes I looked in the mirrors at the beginning of the straights and saw the other cars 300, 400 metres behind... "So, I forgot completely about that car and started changing settings on the steering wheel and doing my own things, then the next thing I see when I come on the brakes is that car alongside me. "We were running close to the points but that's not enough. We never had the pace we had in Australia and China, and, in the end, we had a problem and we decided to retire the car. "When the red lights go off you're motivated and you start fighting, but you're so behind on the straights that there's no way you can defend your position. You fight in a fair way with everyone, but you don't enjoy the battle."
Vandoorne's social media post was accompanied by a comment in which he wrote: "Going for a run - you guys up to anything this Sunday?" McLaren's racing director Eric Boullier said: "What can I say? Fernando failed to finish and Stoffel failed to start. It was a bad day for McLaren-Honda and there is no point in pretending otherwise..." Alonso has suggested he is ready to consider offers from other teams later this year and reports in Spain have suggested he is already talking to Renault where he won his two world titles.
MERCEDES MULL TEAM ORDERS TO FOIL FERRARI: Mercedes team chief Toto Wolff says he is considering introducing team orders in a bid to halt Ferrari's momentum in this year's world championship.
In the wake of Sebastian Vettel's second win of the season in Bahrain on Sunday Wolff admitted that it may be difficult for Mercedes to continue to allow their drivers total freedom - and may ask new boy Valtteri Bottas to take the role of a 'number two' driver. The Finn was asked to allow three-time champion Lewis Hamilton to pass him in Manama as he laboured in pursuit of Vettel in a scenario that may be repeated regularly, if reluctantly.
"We don't like it at all," said Wolff, mindful of the team's tradition for open 'terms of engagement' that allowed intense competition between Hamilton and retired 2016 world champion Nico Rosberg in the last three years. "It's not what we have done in the last couple of years, but the situation is different now... So, it needs a proper analysis of what it means and where we are...
"We'd like to give equal opportunity at the start of the race. I think we owe it to them. "Then you see what we did in the race -- we made the call, we made the call twice, because we felt it was the only possibility of winning the race..."
For the first time in four years, Mercedes have lost their supreme dominance and face a serious battle to hang on to their drivers' and constructors' titles as a revived Ferrari have gained the initiative. In Bahrain, Ferrari's aggressive strategy and tactics made the champions look rattled and ponderous as Vettel followed up his win in the season-opening Australian Grand Prix to take a clear lead in the championship.
By seeking not to give either driver any advantage over the other, Mercedes were unable to respond immediately and delayed their decision-making after Ferrari's early move to make an 'under-cut' pit stop. Wolff said he did not favour abandoning the team policy of giving the drivers' equality and rejected the idea of backing the driver who took pole position, or was most advanced on the grid. "That would be too harsh," he said.
"It would be the opposite of what we have done through the years. It's important, as we start the race, to give them equal opportunity. "We would probably have taken a different decision if Valtteri had run at the front, with the problem on the tyres, and Lewis would have been second, but with Vettel, between them, there was nothing we could have done. "That's why it was the perfect storm....
"It is our mind-set and our racing philosophy, until now, that we have given them both equal opportunity. Like here, if you have two cars starting on the front row - if they run second and first, you just have to let them race. "When you have a problem on the car, as we had (with Bottas' rear tyres), then it is a situation to consider -- to swap them - but with a Ferrari in between, we couldn't. Three races into the season, you don't want to go there yet."

Kim Sharma's house help accuses actress of physical assault and non-payment of dues, lodges complaint
Actress Kim Sharma's former house-help has accused her of manhandling her after she made a mistake while doing laundry. 31-year-old Esther Khes says she forgot to separate the whites while washing Sharma's clothes and noticed that a black blouse had bled into the. She immediately went to inform who then allegedly in a fit of rage pushed her out of the house, asking her to never return, reports Mumbai Mirror.
Khes also says that Sharma has refused to pay her her salary, which is why she decided to lodge a complaint against her on 27 June at Khar police station. She had started working at Sharma's Khar residence on 27 April and the alleged incident took place on 21 May.
The report states that the non-cognisable offence has been registered under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) of the IPC.
Sharma, however, has denied hitting her domestic help or hurling abuses at her. She told Mumbai Mirror, "Khes has been told that her dues would be cleared on the seventh. I did not beat her. She ruined my clothes worth over Rs 70,000. I only asked her to leave after she did that."

The family of a teenaged girl who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend is outraged after learning her killer's accomplice has been released from jail after just one year.
Gursimar Bedi was convicted as an accessory in the 2011 killing of Maple Batalia last January, and was handed an 18-month sentence.

He has now been released after completing two-thirds of that term.
“Where are my rights? Where are Maple's rights? Where are my family's rights?” said Batalia's sister Roseleen.
Batalia's ex, Gurjinder “Gary” Dhaliwal, shot the 19-year-old aspiring dermatologist three times and slashed her repeatedly with a knife as she was leaving SFU's Surrey campus in September 2011.
WATCH: Maple Batalia's sister, Roseleen, and mother, Sarbjit, recall what kind of person Maple was like.
He pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for 21 years in 2016.
Roseleen said Bedi, who the court heard rented the vehicle Dhaliwal used the night of the murder, played a key role in the killing.

“His roles in stalking my sister and working as an informant, as the eyes and ears of Mr. Dhaliwal allowed Mr. Dhaliwal to access my sister. Otherwise, [Dhaliwal] had a no-contact order.”
Bedi had also faced a charge of manslaughter in the killing, but was found not guilty on that count.
Islamabad - Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad has asked National Database and Registration Authority to take necessary arrangements so that newly-established union councils in the capital could start birth and death registration and other functions at the earliest.
In a letter written by the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) chief metropolitan officer to the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) chairman, the assistance has been sought in accordance with ICT Local Government Act, 2015.
The letter said that the issues regarding birth/death registration are the major concern of the newly-established union councils (UC) as NADRA services were available only in 12 UCs, prior to the local government elections in Islamabad. Twelve UCs in rural areas of the capital were in place before the local government system while the remaining UCs, around 38, are yet to be connected with the NADRA database.
It further said that extending NADRA services for all the newly-established UCs in urban and rural areas of Islamabad are urgently required.
It sought NADRA do the needful, enabling these UCs to start birth/death registration in their respective areas.
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - India's Shubhankar Sharma remained on course for his maiden European Tour victory as lightning, rain and hail forced the Joburg Open into a Monday finish.
Sharma, ranked number 462 in the world, has a tournament total of 22 under-par and holds a four-shot lead over South Africa's Erik van Rooyen with 11 holes of his final round remaining.
Play will restart on Monday at 07h30 local time (05h30 GMT).
Sharma, 21, birdied the second and sixth holes on Sunday for a two under-par score in his final round, having now gone 44 holes since he last dropped a shot.
Van Rooyen remains in the hunt at four under-par from eight holes in his fourth round, and will have a three-foot putt on the par-four ninth to move to within three shots of Sharma when play resumes.
Tapio Pulkkanen of Finland and England's James Morrison are tied for third at 14 under-par for the tournament, with 10 and 11 holes remaining respectively in their final rounds.
The top three finishers at the Randpark Golf Club, who are not already exempt, will earn a place at next year's Open Championship at Carnoustie Golf Links.
Logitech's keyboards have long been my keyboards of choice, thanks to their versatility and focus on good design. But the new Craft keyboard may be my favorite Logitech keyboard of all time – and possibly my favorite keyboard, period. The Craft is being billed as creative tool thanks to the integration of a control dial with custom functions depending on which application you're using, but it's also just a top-notch typist tool for anyone who values good craftsmanship in one of the devices they probably use more than almost any other in their daily computing work.
The Craft is a premium-priced keyboard, at least for most people, at $200. It's true that real keyboard aficionados, especially those who place a high value on mechanical switches and customizability, will likely spend more, but for Logitech's primary demographic, $200 is a lot so spend even on this essential accessory. But the Craft is a good way to spend that money if you're at all interested in typing comfortably, and having a range of convenient features that really can improve your overall computing experience in subtle but significant ways.
Craft's signature feature is the ‘Creative Input Dial,' which as mentioned can customize its function based on what application you're using. When you have the Logitech Options software installed, it'll detect which application is active by default and switch its function automatically. Plus, there's even a transition between a clicky, graduated turning action for things like volume control, and an analog, smooth turn for adjusting things like exposure in photos, and it makes a big, positive difference in terms of user experience.
147A4316 147A4313 147A4312 147A4311 View Slideshow Previous Next Exit
But the dial is not likely to be a major driver in terms of convincing most people the Craft is worth the price to upgrade from their current keyboard. Luckily, the gadget offers a lot more besides that does warrant a look in terms of upgrade consideration. For instance, it's got a great, heavy weight that helps it sit firmly on your desk no matter how furiously you type. Plus, there's Logitech easy switch functionality built in, so you can connect it to up to three devices at once (using either Logitech's Unifying Receiver or Bluetooth) and switch between them with the press of a single button.
The keyboard also features a dedicated number pad, full-size arrow keys, and ambient backlighting. It charges its internal battery via USB C, which is great if you're already using a MacBook or other modern computer that charges the same way, and it features dual-purpose keys for Command and Start to switch seamlessly between PC and Mac use.
Craft's typing experience might be the best reason to upgrade, however – its keys are slightly concave, giving you great resting and key stroke experiences, and the travel depth feels just right, with more give than the standard Apple wireless keyboard. The finish on the key surfaces is also very pleasing in a way that's hard to describe: They're matte and feel like they're slightly grippy, and while it may seem like a small thing, if you're typing for many hours per day (like, say, if you're a blogger) it definitely adds up.
Logitech has done a terrific job with the Craft in terms of look, feel and add-on features, in short, and it's easily my favorite keyboard at the moment. At $200, it's probably not for everyone, but it's also well-positioned to be a premium keyboard option for the average consumer looking to treat themselves without going totally overboard into the world of hardcore keyboard fanaticism.
TEHRAN (Tasnim) – Najib Razak, the former Malaysian prime minister, has been arrested for his alleged role in the 1MDB scandal, which saw billions embezzled from a government fund.
Najib, who was toppled from power in May, was arrested in his Kuala Lumpur home on Tuesday afternoon and will be charged in court in the Malaysian capital on Wednesday morning, according to a statement from the team investigating 1MDB.
The former prime minster was picked up from his property using three unmarked cars and taken to the Malaysian anti-corruption agency (MACC) headquarters in Putrajaya.
His arrest came after the newly elected government, led by 92-year-old Mahathir Mohamad, reopened the investigation into 1MDB the moment it came into power in May and pledged to bring to justice all of those responsible for the multibillion dollar fraud, The Guardian reported.
Mahathir said last week that authorities had an almost “perfect case” against Najib on charges including bribery, theft of government funds and embezzlement.

Also, the minister called for Nokia's participation in the project of installing a 5G network throughout the country.
In addition, the sides discussed a number of other issues, including the Finnish company's experience in creating digital transport systems.
“History is a set of lies agreed upon.

–Napoleon
After the inspirational French Revolution of 1789, France crippling in corruption, experienced waves of abyss and turmoil where thousands were slaughtered.
In 1795, counter-revolutionaries attempted a coup to overthrow the government.
In order to control this escalating insurrection, an aggressive general in the French army was tasked to save the republic.
This army officer made a reputation at the expense of the deaths of his fellow countrymen.
This was Napoleon Bonaparte.
Napoleon was then posted in Italy to fight the Austrian empire where he reorganised an exceptional force, promoted on merit rather than noble birth, creating a sense of mutual loyalty since Napoleon himself wasn't born into a royal house but rather a product of the French Revolution.
In Italy, he won a series of battles through his proficient military strategies, proving his potential for leadership.
In his military career, Napoleon fought some 60 battles, losing only 8, mostly at the end.
In only two of the battles, he was forced to fight defensively because of his introduction of the perplexing Corps system.
France, due to its republicanism and new ideas, threatened European monarchists like Russia, Prussia, Austria, and her arch rival Britain as these sovereign nations fought and failed to obliterate France for more than 22 years.
Both England and France were determined to rid each other off.
France had long harboured planned the largest invasion of Britain as it feared that Britain's superior navy posed threat to its trade and colonies.
Today, Napoleon is considered as a warmonger but in actuality some seven European coalitions were formed against him and it can be thought as reactionary choices to invade other countries.
Chicago Blackhawks fans had something to celebrate on July 1 when the Hawks signed 3-time Stanley Cup champion Patrick Sharp. With the additional arrival of Brandon Saad, Hawks fans feel more optimistic than ever to bring the Cup back to Chicago after being eliminated in the first round of the playoffs two years in a row. However, there is much more than meets the eye to the fan favorite player Hawks fans have known and loved for over a decade. Here are five must-know facts about Patrick Sharp.
1. Family First
Sharp and his wife Abby have two daughters; five-year-old Madelyn and three-year-old Sadie. During free agency, his wife and two daughters played a big role in his choice to sign with the Hawks saying,“the family is thrilled to be coming back home.” Known for being a family man, he kept up that reputation by signing where his family wanted for less money than another team could have offered.
Sharp also cites his parents as big supporters in his career. His father's diagnosis with leukemia inspired him to help others fighting the disease through a charity called Leukemia Texas. Sharp's philanthropic efforts can be seen on his Twitter page.
2. Perfect Season
2013 was a great year for the Blackhawks that began with 24 games without a loss in regulation and ended in a Stanley Cup victory. The regular season was also a perfect season for Sharp as he stated at the “Sweet Home Chicago Panel” at the 2017 Blackhawks Convention: “You know who was undefeated that year? Sharp was. (I) started the season the first 24 games, we won every single game. I got hurt in game 24, I came back and played two games, we won both so we're 26-0. I sat out the next two weeks to rest the shoulder for playoffs, played the last two regular season games, 28-0.” That year he tallied 6 goals and 14 assists which are impressive for a shortened season.
3. Sweet Home Chicago
Sharp had many offers during free agency but ultimately chose to go with the Hawks because it felt like home. His wife was thrilled when he signed with the Hawks as he told NHL.com, “Stan (Bowman) got in touch. That was the end of it. I could have made more money elsewhere, but when I found out the Blackhawks were interested, that's all that mattered. I was in Connecticut. I took the call, then went outside with my phone. My wife, Abby, followed me. While I was talking with Stan, she was beside me, jumping up and down, saying, “Sign it! Sign it!” Chicago fans seem to return the favor and granted Sharp with a standing ovation when he arrived at the 2017 Blackhawks Convention.
4. Stronger than Ever
Despite being 35 and having a string of injuries in the 2016-17 season with the Dallas Stars, Sharp feels on top of his game. He told WGN Radio:
“I feel good, I feel healthy. It was a crappy year last year for a lot of different reasons. For me, individually, for the team in Dallas, we had high expectations to try to build off of my first year there. For whatever reason, it just didn't work out. It was a rough season, throw in a couple of injuries on top of that. I finally got this hip cleaned up which I have been meaning to do for a few seasons now. It's about a four to six month rehab. I just saw Dr. Terry this past week for my 4 month checkup and I'm good to go. I'm feeling healthy and as strong as ever, so I can't wait to get back.”
With Sharp back at his best, he can be a valuable asset in the Hawks quest to win the 2018 Stanley Cup.
5. Contract
Sharp's current contract is much less than it was prior to his trade to the Stars with a cap hit of $800,000. The contract lasts for a year and Sharp hopes to bring the Stanley Cup back to Chicago in the 2017-18 season. With his health back as well as the Hawks being closer to the team back to what they were in the 2014-15 season, he may very well achieve his goal.
Tyrod Taylor learned in 2017 to make sure he looks out for himself when he has the chance.
Benched in the middle of a playoff run, Taylor returned a half later after his replacement, rookie Nathan Peterman, crashed and burned in his starting debut. Taylor started all but one of the remaining games, going 3-2 in his final five starts as the Bills ended the NFL's longest active playoff drought.
And yet, Taylor enters yet another offseason filled with contract questions. This time around, he's not down for a restructuring.
"Definitely not part of my mindset," Taylor said, per the Buffalo News. "I've done that before. I don't think there's a need to do that again. That's definitely not part of my mindset."
A year ago, Taylor went from being set to make $30.75 million guaranteed (!) in 2017 to seeing a significant drop via contract restructuring as new head coach Sean McDermott and GM Brandon Beane attempted to remake Buffalo's roster without losing a competent quarterback. It came as a surprise, as many expected the two sides to part ways. This time around, it sounds like that's going to happen.
Taylor, who said he loves playing in Buffalo, learned about the cold nature of the business of professional sports when he was saddled with the blame for Buffalo's midseason struggles. After agreeing to make less money for the team's greater cause, he didn't see the same treatment from the organization. Now he's rightfully worrying about himself first and the letting the rest of the pieces fall where they may.
"I really haven't had any communications as to what's the plan moving forward," Taylor said. "I'm sure that it'll be communicated to me at some point, but as of right now, I'm going to continue to focus on myself mentally, physically, and get ready for another season."
From Taylor's standpoint, he'd command significant money -- somewhat closer to what he was supposed to make in 2017 -- if he entered free agency. He'd also add some juice to a group headlined by Kirk Cousins, and give teams an additional target if they lose out on the Cousins sweepstakes. There are more teams with a desire for a veteran quarterback than there are viable options. Taylor will get a sweet offer from at least one team.
As for Buffalo, the franchise enters an intriguing point if it finally severs ties with Taylor, a quarterback the franchise has seemed to begrudgingly retain for lack of a better option. What we saw from Peterman inspires zero confidence that he'll be the better option, but with this same offseason, Buffalo could swing a deal to add someone else at the position.
One thing is fairly clear at this point: It would be more surprising to see Taylor back in a Bills uniform in 2018 than it would be to see him in a different team's colors. For now, though, Taylor is still under contract.
"Until I'm told otherwise, I'm a Buffalo Bill," Taylor said on NFL Total Access.
Central Catholic High School placed six on the first-team All-District 7-1A baseball team and earned one of the two individual honors.
Central Catholic's Tyler Jensen was honored as Coach of the Year after guiding his squad to a district championship, following an undefeated league season.

Audi has released a few teasers on what it calls a combination between a luxury coupe and a sporty SUV. Based on what we know of Audi's upcoming products, we think it has to be the Q8.
Due later this year, the flagship SUV dons a sloped roofline and wide haunches. Resembling the two near-production Audi Q8 concepts that debuted in 2017, the sketch alludes to a full-width taillight design and a huge front grille, although it could look a bit different now.

Expect the Q8 to enter production in Bratislava, Slovakia later this year. It will ride on the same MLB architecture that currently underpins the Q7, although it won't have three rows of seating. In concept form, it was about 2 inches shorter than the Q7 but almost 3 inches wider. We've also caught Audi testing a hotter SQ8 variant, which is rumored to receive a performance hybrid drivetrain making as much as 470 hp.

The Audi Q8 will compete against other fastback SUVs on the market including the Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe and BMW X6. Audi is also gearing up to introduce another fastback-style SUV in the form of the Q4 for 2019.

With Tuesday's bombshell announcement that the federal government will purchase the Trans Mountain pipeline for $4.5 billion, emotions are running high on all sides of the debate.
Ottawa made the decision in the face of a May 31 deadline by Kinder Morgan, with the company threatening to pull out if the government couldn't assure the project would be built.
LISTEN: The Pipeline Hotline — Alberta and B.C. weigh in on the Trans Mountain decision
The decision has earned a mixed reaction, with even some pipeline supporters displeased with the idea of government ownership.

On Wednesday, Vancouver's 980 CKNW and Calgary's 770 CHQR held a simulcast with hosts Jon McComb and Danielle Smith to sample opinion on both sides of the Rockies about the latest twist in the pipeline saga.
Here's a sampling of what Albertans and British Columbians had to say.
WATCH: Notley says Ottawa buying pipeline limits BC's ability to hamper
Blame the politicians
Not many callers had very nice things to say about how Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has handled the pipeline file.
“I think we should call it the Justin Trudeau Memorial Pipeline. Because he's toast. He is toast,” said Dan from B.C., a pipeline supporter.
“I think this thing is going to cost him the prime ministership, and I think it should because he's demonstrated a total and complete lack of leadership on this.”
Les in Alberta agreed, saying Canadians have been left with a multi-billion dollar bill because the federal government didn't step up and push the project through.
“The B.C.-ers that I've talked to, 90 per cent of them are in favour of it,” he said.
READ MORE: Ottawa to buy Trans Mountain pipeline project, what does this mean for BC?
“It's just like the Trans Canada Highway, we've made it wider and bigger – sure, you're still going to get hazards of animals getting hit on the road. On the big scheme of things, the oil needs to go so that it will provide benefits to all Canadians.”
“I'm not too happy with Trudeau at all,” added Leslie in B.C.
“I wish he would have put his prime minister hat on his head for a change and said to the environmentalists, ‘Hey back off, this is going through.'”
WATCH: Did the Prime Minister have a choice on Trans Mountain?
But Tim in B.C. saw it a different way.
“The Liberals probably made the decision that was the most pragmatic because down the road, a lot of people, whether they're for it or not, may find it beneficial or it works in their favour.”
But Trudeau didn't get all the heat. Some callers laid the blame squarely in Victoria.
“Trudeau was forced to do this because of John Horgan. If John Horgan hadn't done all of this complaining and whining about stopping it [at] all costs, Kinder Morgan would be behind it 100 per cent,” said Richard in B.C.
“What does John Horgan feel the difference is with winning his court case and slowing down the bitumen flow in the pipeline, and Rachel Notley slowing down the bitumen with a law?” added Wayne in Alberta.

It's the economy, stupid
It's been a common refrain in the debate, and unsurprisingly callers from both provinces again reiterated support for the pipeline based on its anticipated economic contribution to Canada.
“I would like to be like Dubai and do everything safer than anyone else in the wold,” said Grant in Alberta.
“And pick up a nice cheque for about $1,500 a month from the government to be able to go out and buy flat screen TVs, towards a new car, towards everything else and get this country going.”

Dan in B.C. said the money the pipeline brings to Canada is crucial for social services.
“The hippies and the tree huggers here in Vancouver think we can just magically do all of these things without having the money for it. And the reality is that the rest of Canada and a lot of people here in Vancouver support this thing,” he said.
Rick in B.C. agreed that money is a key factor in the future of the project, but said what the province is getting from the deal isn't enough.
“At this stage of the game, the pipeline is going through. The reality of the risk that B.C. is going to pay with tankers leaving the province is a real event. And B.C. has now, whether we like it or not, become part of the oil producing chain of Canada,” he said.

“What really irks me is we're not seeing the profit portion of it. I would like to see us getting 20 per cent of the revenue that the Alberta government gets… because we're carrying all of that risk.”
Eric in Alberta was OK with Canada owning the pipeline if it meant federal money coming back to the province.
“After all of these days of Quebec getting all of our equalization money, I am so happy that equalization that we pay is going back to Alberta,” he said.
“It's unfortunate it had to be done this way, but hey, at least the money is coming back to us.”

Environmental debate
Jason in B.C. said he was “disappointed” and “heartbroken” about the decision for environmental reasons.
“So much is out there, so many jobs can be created within this green revolution. It can be done. This is taking us 30 years back,” he said.
“There's not an appreciation for the degree of upset that we on the coast feel, because we are looking at our way of life being completely threatened by this,” added Carl from B.C.

“We're looking at the possible loss of our orcas, we're looking at possible loss to our fishing, to our tourism, to our movie industry, it's frightening.”
Matthew from B.C. called himself a pipeline “moderate” but said he'd gone to some protests because a seven-fold increase in tankers is too risky.
“You know, half the risk and I probably wouldn't be out there, and a lot of the people I'm seeing probably wouldn't be out there either, the 40-hour a week people, they probably wouldn't be protesting either, they'd probably find better things to do with their life if the proposal wasn't so extreme.”

But east of the Rockies, many callers felt a degree of hypocrisy in B.C.'s environmental concerns.
“I haven't heard any complaining over the last 40 years about all the oil tanker traffic going down the west coast,” said Gary in Alberta.
“B.C. seems to be more concerned about their environment and the damage to an oil spill and the coast, yet they have the biggest problem with their own industry, their coal, their pulp, the cruise liners that dump in their ocean. And they're the third worst polluter in Canada,” added Dianne in Alberta.

Modest proposals
Several callers proposed their own solutions for resolving the pipeline dispute.
James in Saskatchewan called for an independent, third-party auditor to step in.
“What needs to happen is there needs to be some clarification on the major issues. There seems to be myth, hyperbole, even mis-directed intentionally arguments. And there's a necessity to clarify some of this,” he said.

Jim in B.C. said with carbon taxes — and the price of fuel — rising, the answer is to build the pipe… but refine the contents here in Canada.
“If you're going to build a pipeline, then you put the money aside to build a refinery either in Alberta or B.C. that that bitumen goes to as well, and that fuel is provided to this local economy at a reasonable price,” he said.
And Grant in Alberta had his own proposal: put the project up for a vote, then close the book once and for all.
“With the numbers that are coming out in the polls in B.C. with how many people support it, I would love to see a referendum,” he said.
The federal government's deal with Kinder Morgan is set to close in August, at which point Canada would own the project.
The Liberal government says the purchase will be on an interim basis, and the government will then seek new owners for the line.
Many millennials lack knowledge about the importance of sunscreen and continue to tan outdoors in part because of low self-esteem and high rates of narcissism that fuel addictive tanning behavior, a new study from Oregon State University-Cascades has found.
Lead author Amy Watson and her colleagues found that those with higher levels of self-esteem were less likely to tan, while those with lower self-esteem and higher levels of narcissism were more likely to present addictive tanning behavior. The motivation for the addictive tanning behavior was the perception of improved appearance.
“This study gives us a clearer understanding of actual consumer behavior,” said Watson, an assistant professor of marketing at OSU-Cascades. “The number of people stills deliberately exposing their skin to the sun for tanning purposes is alarming. We need to find new ways to entice people to protect their skin, including challenging the ideal of tan skin as a standard of beauty.”
The findings were published recently in the Journal of Consumer Affairs. Co-authors are Gail Zank and Anna M. Turri of Texas State University.
Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer worldwide, with more than 3.5 million cases diagnosed annually. Melanoma cases among women rose sharply between 1970 and 2009, with an 800 percent increase among women 18 to 39.
In an effort to improve consumer education about the role of sunscreen in the prevention of skin cancer, the Centers for Disease Control and the Food and Drug Administration developed a new “Drug Facts” panel of information now required on all sunscreen bottles. The panel includes directions for sunscreen use and advice on other sun protection measures, among other information.
The researchers' goal with the study was to gauge whether the information on this new label is effective at curbing tanning behavior and if new information is helping to increase consumer knowledge about how and when to use sunscreen and how much to use.
The study of 250 college students, most between 18 and 23 years old, measured their sun safety knowledge and included: questions about their beliefs regarding sunscreen effectiveness and ultraviolet light exposure danger; questions about tanning motivation and behavior; an assessment of tanning addiction; and personality questions relating to self-esteem, narcissism, appearance and addictive behavior.
The study participants, 47 percent male and 53 percent female, scored an average of 54 percent on an 11-question sun safety knowledge test, which included true/false statements such as: “On a daily basis I should use at least one ounce of sunscreen on exposed skin” (true); and “When applied correctly, SPF 100 is twice as effective as SPF 50” (false).
About 70 percent of the study participants reported purposefully exposing their skin to the sun to achieve a tan. About a third of the participants reported that having a tan is important to them, while about 37 percent said they feel better with a tan, and 41 percent indicated that having a tan makes them more confident in their appearance.
The participants' levels of tanning addiction were measured through questions such as “I get annoyed when people tell me not to tan,” and “I continue to tan knowing that it is bad for me,” and “I feel unattractive or anxious to tan if I do not maintain my tan.”
The researchers found that those with lower self-esteem and higher narcissism rates were also more likely to exhibit addictive tanning behavior. They found no evidence that increased knowledge about sun safety leads to lower levels of addictive tanning.
“What we found is that this knowledge doesn't matter to the consumers,” Watson said. “That tactic to require sunscreen manufacturers to include this information is not effective.”
Sun safety and sunscreen messaging from the CDC is all statistics-based, emphasizing the likelihood of a skin cancer occurrence or diagnosis, Watson said. But that type of message isn't resonating with millennials. The next step for Watson and her colleagues is to begin testing other types of messages to identify ways millennials would respond more positively to sun safety measures.
“People are starting to get the message about the dangers of using tanning beds, but a large number of people are still tanning outdoors, deliberately exposing their skin to the sun, because they think it's attractive,” she said.
“We need to move away from the narrative where tan skin is associated with health and youth. That's the opposite of reality. Because reality is tan skin is damaged skin.”
WASHINGTON — Three women who have accused Donald Trump of sexual misconduct or inappropriate behavior appeared on “Megyn Kelly Today” on Monday to reiterate their claims and call for some kind of reckoning amid the #MeToo movement.
The women appear in a new documentary short video about Trump's accusers, called “16 Women and Donald Trump,” from progressive filmmaker Robert Greenwald, and planned to appear at a press conference with him later in the day.
“I would like to see some reckoning, that he is not made of Teflon, that he acknowledges in some fashion and is called on to answer for the charges,” Jessica Leeds said on “Today.”
During the presidential campaign, Leeds told The New York Times that in the early 1980s, she was on a New York-bound flight and was seated in first class next to Trump.
“All of the sudden he was all over me, kissing and groping,” she said on “Today.” Then, she said, he put his hand up her skirt, and “I managed to wiggle out. I grabbed my purse and went to the back of the airplane.”
A couple of years later, she saw Trump at a Humane Society charity event, and identified herself, mentioning the incident. He called her the “c” word, Leeds told “Today.”

Samantha Holvey recounted her story of the 2006 Miss USA Pageant, which the Trump Organization owned at the time, and how Trump would line up all of the contestants to look them over in what she described as a demeaning way. Holvey, who was Miss North Carolina USA, said that she felt like “I was just a piece of meat.”
At one point Trump came backstage as the women competing were in the hair and makeup room, something that made them uncomfortable, Holvey said. “He comes in like he owns the place and owns you,” she said.
She, too, came forward to tell her story during the 2016 campaign, but said that she was distraught when he was sworn into office.
“It was just a tough day because it was like the entire country said, ‘We don't care that he is like this,'” Holvey said.
Also appearing on “Today” was Rachel Crooks, who also came forward during the campaign. She recounted her story of working as a receptionist for a company that had offices in Trump Tower.
She said that in 2005, having often spotted Trump using a nearby elevator bank, she decided to introduce herself.
He gave her a double cheek kiss, but then kept kissing her. “He kissed me on the lips and I was shocked. I ran back into the office and I remember hiding in my boss's office. I called my sister and said, ‘I don't know what happened. It is just horrible.'”
She said that she didn't make a big deal of it to her employer because she feared losing her job as her company, a development firm, did extensive business with the Trump Organization.
Trump later came into the office and asked for her phone number, she said, and she asked, “What do you need that for?” Trump told her he would pass it along to his modeling agency, but they never called her.
The White House has dismissed the women's claims, and did so again on Monday.
“These false claims, totally disputed in most cases by eyewitness accounts, were addressed at length during last year's campaign, and the American people voiced their judgment by delivering a decisive victory,” a White House spokesperson told “Today.” “The timing and absurdity of these false claims speaks volumes and the publicity tour that has begun only forth confirms the political motives behind them.”
Firefighters with the Alexander Fire Department along with the Saline County Coroner and Arkansas State Police troopers are currently investigating a house fire involving a fatality.
On Sunday, firefighters responded to the house fire at approximately 12:45 a.m. at 15910 South Alexander Road, said Fire Chief Mark Ridgeway.
The house was a total loss, and aside from the victim, no one else was involved in the incident, he said.
Along with the Alexander Fire Department, other personnel that responded included officers from Alexander and Bauxite Police Departments and firefighters from Crystal, Bryant and the Collegeville Volunteer Fire Departments.
Since this incident is under investigated, no other information could be released about the incident, Ridgeway said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury's top economic diplomat, David Malpass, on Friday accused China of enabling poor governance in Venezuela by propping up the socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro through murky oil-for-loan investments.
In a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Malpass said China's focus on commodities and opaque financing deals had hurt, not helped, countries in the region.
His attack on China's role in aiding the Venezuelan government came a day after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, ahead of a five-day tour of Latin America, raised the prospect of a Venezuelan military coup.
The Trump administration has imposed individual and economic sanctions on Venezuela's government for rights abuses and corruption. Maduro has accused Washington of seeking to oust him to improve access to the OPEC nation's oil wealth.
Malpass, Treasury's under secretary for international affairs, said Venezuela's economic crisis and lack of democratic rule were among the “biggest disappointments and disasters” of the region. Washington and the opposition blame Maduro's policies.
“Most of the blame for Venezuela's economic collapse and humanitarian disaster falls squarely on Venezuela's rulers, but China has been by far Venezuela's largest lender supporting poor governance,” Malpass said.
He said the international community and Venezuela's people would ultimately be left with rebuilding the country once democracy was restored.
“China denominated many of its loans to Venezuela in barrels of oil,” said Malpass. “This has the effects of masking the exact amount of payments that China made to Venezuelan officials and that Venezuelans are expected to make to China in the future,” he added.
Cooperation between China and the region was based on common interests and mutual needs, the Xhinhua state news agency said quoting the Chinese foreign ministry, and investments are in line with local laws.
“China is a major international buyer of Latin American bulk commodities, and imports more and more agricultural and high value-added products from the region,” Xhinhua reported, quoting spokesperson Hua Chunying.
China has said it is confident in Venezuela's ability to properly handle its debts. Venezuela has borrowed billions of dollars from Russia and China, primarily through oil-for-loan deals that have crimped the country's hard currency revenue by requiring oil shipments to be used to service those loans.
Since 2007 China has loaned more than $50 billion to Venezuela through an oil-for-loans arrangement that helped Caracas reduce reliance on U.S. energy markets. But the flow of funds from Beijing has slowed since 2014, when abundant crude oil led to a crash in oil markets and made China less interested in maintaining its alliance with Venezuela.
Malpass also expressed concern at a decision by the Washington-based Inter-American Development Bank, the biggest lender to the region, to hold its 2019 annual meeting in China, saying the gathering should be held in the Americas.
“The Bank's 60th anniversary is an important milestone to celebrate the Bank's accomplishments ... and it would be fitting to hold the meeting in the hemisphere among major donors and borrowers,” Malpass said.
The IADB did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Malpass criticism.
LAHORE - A terror hit always follows a spell of condemnation, mourning, and strong resolve to deal with the perpetrators of terror with iron hands and award them exemplary punishment yet evil doers again get a chance to wreak havoc on the life of people shattering all claims of the government. The recurrence of terror hits sounds the government relapses into business as usual soon after a tragedy happens.
Every terror hit gives some clues to the lapses in the security step, and demands the government to fix those as a matter of discharging its paramount duty of protecting life of the people, for which both the common man and the security personnel are entitled to under the constitution.
A terror attack brings human tragedy, it creates panic among the people and tests their resilience, at the same time however it presents an opportunity to fix the things. The aftermath is a time to reflect, to chart a way forward, to get up and take practical measures to avert recurrence of the destructive acts.
In the Charing Cross suicide hit, it is highly painful that senior police officials among the citizens have been martyred. The reach of the terrorists to that highly sensitive part of the town which is regarded as Red Zone, is highly alarming.
The Mall is banned for the public gathering under the Lahore High Court order while the Hall Road traders also abhor the Mall being used for protest as it badly harms their business.
Since inception of this government, hundreds of protests have been staged at the Charing Cross, also know as Faisal Chowk, by the people relating to almost every class of profession and call. By the grace of Allah, no terror incident took place previously, though a terror alert had been issued months ago about terrorists hitting the Punjab Assembly.
This time round a special warning was issued some 10 days ago but flaw was left in security which the terrorists exploited to their advantage.
After the cricket board had announced to hold final of the Pakistan Super League in Lahore, the people say, the government needed to be more on its guard and alert to preclude any destructive happening – particularly when a conspiracy is being hatched by our arch rival India to isolated Pakistan in the cricket world which this country once ruled with much pride.
After experiencing so much damage and destruction for so many years after 9/11, we have been speaking loud to have done much to deal with situation.
During the peak of terrorism in the country, Lahore was targeted at various places including FIA building, Naval War College, Elite Police Training School Manawan, Wahga Border, Gulshan Iqbal Park, Moon Market, GPO Chowk, Data Darbar, Anarkali Food Street, a church at Youhanabad and a religious place at Ghari Shahu. But hitting people outside the Punjab Assembly, at the heart of the provincial capital, shows much on the security side than what meet the eyes.
Almost every incident has been backed by beforehand intimation by the intelligent sources about the entry of terrorists and the impending action. But the terror attack has been taking place putting a big question on security steps.
After every incident, the government puts its foot down to incapacitate the terrorists through foolproof security steps. And the people take its words on the face value, thinking the government has found out the way how to deal with the situation and is moved to action with full force to ensure their security.
However, every next happening smacks the impression at the public level that masses' security is not on the priority list of the government. These sentiments were again heard by the people after Charing Cross attack last day.
The civilian government has been claiming credit for making reducing the frequency of terror attacks, but the people at large believe that it's the fruit of the operations carried out by the military on its own initiative and out of its own conviction.
Had there been a sincere political will making the civilian set up fully synchronize and coordinate their efforts with the armed forces to eliminate anti-peace elements from the settled areas of the country, the menace of terrorism would have completely vanished by now, they believe. The logic behind this public perception is quite simple: no terrorist groomed and launched hundreds of miles away in Pak-Afghan border areas can carry out an attack of this kind without support from local elements.
If the Punjab police, civilian security agencies and the civilian administration can show excellent performance towards protecting the most sensitive Moharram and Eid gatherings over the last three years, they can do the same on ordinary days provided the local collaborators of the terrorists are weeded out.
It would be wrong to say government has done nothing about addressing the terror problem. It has made some progress in implementing the National Action Plan (NAP), setting up multiple tiers of security and evolving a high tech and coordinated intelligence network and surveillance system. CCTV cameras are being operated under billions of rupees Safe City Project spread over the whole city, and a quite strict security check has been imposed on the entry and exit points of the city. But the problem is that it's not enough.
The provincial ministers particularly the Law Minister Rana Sana Ullah Khan have been making big claims of neutralising the terror network and tracing their route and line of action. They also claimed about reaching out to the facilitators of the evil doers and curbing the extremist sentiments which attract the innocent mind to terror related activity. A recurrence of terror incident however, puts a big question mark on these claims and makes the public feel betrayed by their own elected representatives.
After months of teasing, Google's finally brought its AR stickers to the Pixel 2. For most users with the company's latest flagship handset, the feature will be available today as part of an Android 8.1 update.
The feature was announced on-stage at the Pixel event back in January, offering a sneak peek of a fun little addition made possible through its ARCore technology, letting users drop augmented reality characters onto their own pictures and video. It was a pretty compelling demonstration of Google's ARKit competitor, and now its live for everyone to check out, including a couple of key product licenses.
Those Stranger Things stickers that we got to play with a few months back in here, bringing creatures from Netflix's popular series with them. And, a mere few days ahead of the much-anticipated release of The Last Jedi, the feature brings a bunch of new content from the Star Wars universe.
The company's celebrating the launch with a pretty delightful new ad, as well, incorporating elements from The Last Jedi trailer into real world setting, with a lot of kids, grownups and dogs dressed up as character from the movie. The sticker pack includes dynamic models of First Order Stormtroopers, imperial walkers, X-Wings and Tie-Fighters, familiar droids like R2D2 and BB-8 and, of course, Porgs. So, so many Porgs. As though the furry little beasts weren't all over the place already.
There's also a bunch of party paraphernalia and Foodmoji, which are more in line with Snapchat's viral dancing hot dog than Apple's Animoji offer — but should do an equally good job helping you kill time with you new phone. The sticker sets are available today for most Pixel 2 users as a free download, though some might be getting them over the next few days.

NEW YORK (AP) — Television networks will interrupt this presidency on Thursday to revisit an old obsession.
ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, MSNBC, HLN and ESPN will show O.J. Simpson's parole hearing at a Nevada prison, as he seeks freedom after spending more than eight years locked up for armed robbery and assault. CBS said it will livestream the hearing on its CBSN digital news affiliate.
Simpson's trial in California for the 1994 murders of his wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman, was a television obsession more than two decades ago. The former football star was acquitted, but has been imprisoned for trying to steal sports collectibles.
Interest in Simpson was revived last year with ESPN's documentary “O.J.: Made in America,” and the FX miniseries, “The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story”
Former Los Angeles police detective Mark Fuhrman, who testified in Simpson's original trial, will provide analysis for Fox News Channel.
Teachers should be paid well — and paid more for extra education for outside activity that helps them do their jobs more effectively. The problem with this program is that it appears to be unmonitored and untested. Common sense indicates that teachers might be receiving rewards for the wrong things. That's unacceptable in a district that has many needs, and so must spend every penny it gets in the most productive way possible.
Local voters could be deciding on fluoride, on-road ATV use, sales tax changes and changes to the borough's charter this October. Residents have submitted a proposal to end the practice of adding fluoride to Petersburg's water and hope to be able to start gathering signatures to put that issue on the ballot.
Another group is trying again with a proposed ordinance to allow on-road use of all-terrain and utility vehicles. Proposal supporter Richard Burke has rewritten that measure after the borough deemed it insufficient this month. Both the fluoride question and the new ATV proposal have been sent to the borough's attorney for review. If either pass legal scrutiny then supporters could start gathering the signatures needed to force a vote.
Meanwhile, it looks like voters will have at least one charter change to decide. What could be the first change to the borough's foundational document is up for its second reading and a public hearing before the borough assembly Monday. It would allow the city of Kupreanof to own and operate the dock in Kupreanof, if the state is willing to transfer that facility.
The ballot could also have several sales tax questions. On Monday the assembly will have the first reading of an ordinance to raise the sales tax cap from 12-hundred dollars to five thousand dollars. The measure would also eliminate a sales tax exemption for goods purchased here for use outside of the borough. Both those issues could be put on the October ballot. The tax cap change has been on the ballot multiple times in recent year. Voters said no to an increase to two thousand dollars just three years ago. That failed by 129 votes. An increase to 17-hundred dollars failed by just six votes in 2012. Those questions will need three approvals by the borough assembly before they'll appear on the ballot.
In other business for the assembly Monday, there's a vote on an application to purchase borough land on South Third Street. Another vote is on spending money to fix problems with the fire alarm system at Mountain View Manor. There are also votes on a reduced electrical power rate for the schools and the elimination of a 10 percent discount for advanced payment of moorage in the harbors.
The assembly will consider a contract for borough attorney Sara Heideman and has drafted a letter on the future of the Coast Guard in Petersburg.
The meeting is on Monday, April 17 at 6 p.m. in borough assembly chambers and you can hear it live on KFSK.

FAISALABAD -The University of Agriculture Faisalabad on Monday approved non-development statement of accounts worth Rs3.28 billion for year 2015-16.
The approval was made during 44th Senate meeting, which was chaired by UAF VC Dr Iqrar Ahmad while Registrar Muhammad Hussian presented the agenda and Treasurer Umar Saeed presented statement of accounts.
Addressing on the occasion, VC Prof Dr Iqrar said that the university has kicked off 48 new degrees program in the last couple of years, keeping in the view the modern challenges. He said that the number of students' enrolment in the campus has crossed 25,000, which was 16,000 in 2013.
He pointed out that for attracting students belonging to rural and underprivileged areas for admission, the UAF financial assistance programme has crossed to Rs700 million.
Dr Iqrar said that academia-industry linkages and knowledge based economy are pivotal to compete with the rest of world. "Our competitive research portfolio has crossed Rs2.5 billion, which is the largest among the all the varsities in the country, he claimed.
Talking about agriculture research, the VC said that Pakistan is spending 0.1 percent of its GDP on agriculture research "while India utilizes, four times more than us." He urged the government to invest in agricultural research that will help address the daunting issues of low productivity, rural development, food insecurity and others.
He said that farmers are applying five methods of irrigations for wheat crop whereas "we recommend applying three irrigation methods for wheat with raising concerns water scarcity," the VC added. He said the water, saved from through reduced irrigation from five to three times across the country, would be equal to Tarbela and Mangla storage.
He said that one of the challenges which Pakistani people is facing in health "malnutrition" reached at panic stage. He said that 40 percent of total population is being faced malnutrition today.
Throwing light on challenges in agriculture, the VC said that post harvest losses account for 40 percent of total losses, for which the farmers would have to adopt modern techniques.
He said that agriculture crops, vegetables and foods worth billions of rupees could be saved by adopting modern handling, storage, processing, transportation, and value addition to minimize post harvest losses.
DIVAR: After adopting mechanised farming, the farmers of Divar island have for the first time witnessed a tremendous rise in the paddy crop yield resulting in the island exporting around 250 tonnes of Jyoti rice.
A progressive farmer from Sao Minguel and sarpanch of Sao Mathias Prashant Harwalkar said that in 2016, Divar farmers harvested a bumper crop and nearly 250 tonnes of brown rice were exported.
He said, “This was a result of mechanised farming, which has been adopted for the first time on the island by three people. Reduced labour, less time involved and more produce encouraged us to go in for mechanised farming and now more people are adopting the technique.”
A former sarpanch Bhushan Bhomkar, who is a farmer, said that fields in Divar were abandoned by owners due to non-availability of labourers, high labour cost and due to the entry of saline water into the fields during monsoon. “Contractors of sluice gates and fishermen release the sluice gate water into the fields and render them unworthy of paddy cultivation. As such, the field owners stopped cultivating crops in their fields,” said Bhomkar adding that the forms submitted by the farmers for obtaining subsidy are lying with the government authorities but not yet passed by the concerned department.
Stating that Divar saw farming boom in the past and that every household was engaged in farming, sarpanch of Goltim-Navelim, Prasad Harmalkar, said that of recent farming has decreased to a large extent but added that mechanised farming has turned out to be a boon for the islanders. He blamed the sluice gate contractors for ruining paddy cultivation and promoting illegal fish farming, while rendering large tracts of farming land uncultivable due to the entry of saline water into the fields. Another farmer alleged that despite assurances by the government authorities to encourage farming, nothing concrete has been done.
Police in Haliburton are warning the public after two separate vehicles carrying eight passengers in total went through the ice Friday evening.
The first incident took place at around 4:45 p.m. on Twelve Mile Lake, in Minden Hills.
Four men were travelling together on a snowmobile and ATV when they broke through thin ice. Three of the four men were able to pull themselves from the water and a bystander helped remove the fourth with a rope.

In that case, a 35-year-old man had his licence suspended for driving under the influence of alcohol.

This is a surprising fall for a player who was projected as a top-five pick when we started this evaluation process. He slides a bit in part due to the early run on QBs.

Mumbai: Australia's World Cup-winning captain Michael Clarke believes India's impressive bench strength has put it on course for domination for the next five-ten years.
Interacting with cricket historian Boria Majumdar at the launch of the latter's book, Eleven Gods and a Billion Indians, the 37-year old praised the Indian team management's 'horses for courses' selection policy.
"Look at the quicks that you see around in the IPL. The strength there is so strong. You work unbelievably hard in India as a fast bowler and you work your backside off to get wickets. But come England, Australia and those conditions...that's why India are a threat for becoming the best team in the world for not just one year but for the next five-ten years. Because their bench is so strong and the bench strength is so strong," Clarke said.
In the ongoing IPL, five Indian bowlers — Mayank Markande, Umesh Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Krunal Pandya — feature in the top-ten wicket-takers' list. Of these, Markande and Pandya have never played international cricket. The leading run-scorers' list has a more generous Indian presence, with seven homegrown players in top ten. Four among these — Sanju Samson, Rishabh Pant, Ambati Rayudu, and Suryakumar Yadav — are yet to play Test cricket.
(Note: Stats before the start of Tuesday's match between Mumbai Indians and Sunrisers Hyderabad)
India coach Ravi Shastri also batted for the team's selection policy, and emphasised on the need to "play the pitch."
"You don't play the opposition, you play the pitch," he said.
"It (selection) has to be horses for courses many times. You can't please everyone in terms of selection because you are playing that pitch more than the opposition. If you can conquer the pitch, the rest will follow," the coach added.
In their recent tour to South Africa, spinners Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin, who occupy fourth and fifth spots respectively in the ICC's Test bowlers' rankings, were overlooked for the limited-overs' leg of the series. Wrist-spinners Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav were drafted in, and the duo starred with a combined tally of 33 wickets in the six-match series.
Clarke lauded India's move to not worry about players' reputation while deciding on their team combinations.
"You are dropping someone based on conditions, oppositions and gut instinct and all you try is to get the best XI to win that game of cricket. I think these guys and the leadership deserve a lot of credit for making those tough decisions," said Clarke.
"I feel Ashwin and Jadeja also deserve a lot of credit because of taking it on the chin. You watch Ashwin now. He has always bowled brilliant at the front of the hand and now he is bowling leg-spin to right-handers. He has gone away with the right attitude thinking 'Okay. How can I improve my game and go back into the team?' Whether it does or not is irrelevant but the fact that they are trying to get better is helping Indian cricket," he added.
Favourites for World Cup
Both Shastri and Clarke agreed that India have what it takes to lift their third World Cup next year. India's first title win in the quadrennial event came in 1983 in England, and they endured a 28-year wait before the second World Cup win came about, in 2011 at home. The team reached the last-four stage in the 2015 World Cup that was hosted by Australia and New Zealand.
"I am not one to take a backseat. Because the way the team has played, they believe they can win in any condition. For us, every condition is home," Shastri said of India's chances at the event.
Clarke, meanwhile, was impressed with team's positive attitude and conceded that the Virat Kohli-led side would be tough to stop in England.
"They are a brilliant team. Just listening to their attitude, they are halfway there," the Australian, who played in three World Cups and won the trophy twice, said.
"I believe this sport, particularly, is based on attitude. If you have confidence in your ability and your team's ability, you are halfway there. Having high expectations is one thing, but playing the way Ravi said, playing with freedom, is how you win big tournaments. You can win key moments in the game because you have confidence in your abilities. I think they are as good a team as any in the world across the three formats and if they have got that attitude, they are going to be tough to beat," he opined.

Senator Shehu Sani (APC, Kaduna) has revealed plans by aggrieved members of the Progressives Congress in Kaduna State to leave the party.He told reporters in Abuja, on Tuesday, that the new APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole assumed office at a time it had become too late to reconcile them with the party.Sani said, “I wish Adams has come earlier because like I said these grenades that were laid by the former chairman will explode in a matter of days.”According to him, party leaders including President Muhammadu Buhari have proved incapable of handling the crisis.The Senator explained that the ward, local government and state congresses in Kaduna were flawed and that complaints he and other party members lodged were ignored by the Chief John Odigie-Oyegun-led National Working Committee.He noted that to further compound am already bad situation, the immediate past party leadership went ahead to inaugurate the executive committee's which emerged from the flawed congresses.Sani said, “It is also very clear to us that even President Muhammadu Buhari is incapable of tackling the menace of the governor of Kaduna state.“How can a governor, openly called for violence against Senators and not a statement came from the seat of power cautioning such a governor?“How can a governor move bulldozers and demolish a house of a fellow party member, the one who helped him to be where he is and there is not even a statement from the presidency?“The governor uses the machinery of the state to emasculate political opponents. He even framed me for murder and there was no statement that came from the presidency to caution such a governor.“Virtually Kaduna state under governor El-Rufai does not create conducive environment for any of us to remain in that party (APC).”The Senator also said, “There were three attempts to resolve the Kaduna APC crisis; there was Inuwa Abdulkadir committee which was never respected by the governor, there was the governor Masari- led committee which was also not respected and there as you can see, Tinubu's attempt to reconcile members of the party was simply naturalized and abandoned. So we are not slaves to continue to be in that party.
Distributors of the Dangote foods companies, including Dangote Flour, Sugar and Salt smiled home last night as the management of the Companies doled out over N2 billion as rewards for their loyalty to the companies over the past one year.
At a colourful Gala night which the distributors were hosted to last night, top performers in each of the six geo-political zones as well as national leading distributors were duly recognised with plagues and cash rewards of varying amounts.
President of Dangote Group, Aliko Dangote said the recognition and cash rewards was in the character of the Companies management to appreciate their loyalty customers who stood by the organizations through thick and tin.
He explained that the management hold their distributors in high esteem because they are the reason for the success recorded by them in 2016 despite the economic challenges and the difficult operating environment businesses found themselves.
“Our achievements would not have been possible without you. You stood by us through thick and thin. We appreciate the confidence reposted in us to serve you. We came into these businesses at a time Nigerians have preferences for imported foreign foods, even if inferior.
“Because you are behind us we have succeeded and today we take the lead while others follow in ensuring we domesticated all our production processes and by so doing good creating jobs locally”
Dangote informed the distributors of his Group's venture into rice production saying it is a very ambitious project and that in two years time, Dangote Rice limited item will be churning out one million tonnes.
He stated that mission of Dangote rice is to wipe out all imported rice from the homes of Nigerians noting that by the time Dangote rice comes on stream, “Nigerians would not talk about Thai rice again, because our rice will be finer than imported ones”
While urging the customers to remain committed and loyal to Dangote products, he promised that the managements of the food companies under Dangote Group would double the over N2billion billion given out as rewards.
Dangote disclosed the food companies would replicate the same achievement recorded in cement industry through backward integration such that every component of their production processes would be domesticated to ensure all the products are available in all nooks and crannies of Nigeria and at the same price.
Also speaking, the Executive Director of Dangote Flour, Hajiya Halima Aliko-Dangote said what the companies did was just a token of appreciation for the volume sales recorded by the distributors despite the economic doldrum.
She stated that the managements were encouraged by the loyalty of the distributors to continue to invest in innovation and research extensively on how to make their products more consumer friendly continuously in line with the realities of the time.
In his address of welcome email earlier, Chairman of the Dangote Flour, Mr. Asue Ighodalo said the distributors have proven to be dependable allies with their patronage of Dangote products and loyal to the brands in all circumstances.
The Dangote Flour boss said 2016 was in it deed a difficult year for most businesses saying some closed down, some scaled down their operations and in the process retrenchment their staff. Dangote food companies rather absorbed the substantial higher cost of inputs so that the customers would remain in profitable business
“However, it is to your credits our dear distributors that in that particular challenging year, Dangote Food companies waxed stronger, produced more, sold, more and gave returns to all stakeholders hence our gathering together tonight. Tonight is your night, and tonight is your day”, he stated.
He said no region in the country did not do well and that is why the companies are happy to reward them bountifully. Ighodalo challenged them not to rest on their oars but strive to sell more.

Any music fan will be aware of how vinyl records have become strangely fashionable again, with the retro format enjoying a resurgence as an alternative mp3 downloads and streaming.
But now it seems that its counterpart, the cassette, may be enjoying a similar resurgence.
According to Official Charts Company data, the humble tape is the fastest-growing format in the UK at the moment.
Sales of cassette albums have doubled in the space of a year - up 112% compared to 2016, thanks in part to big name acts like Jay-Z , Royal Blood and Lana Del Rey releasing limited runs as a collector's item for fans.
The biggest seller so far has been the soundtrack to Guardians of the Galaxy - ‘Awesone Mix vol. 1' - the retro collection featuring tracks such as ELO's ‘Mr. Blue Sky' and Fleetwood Mac's ‘The Chain'. It has also sold more than 70,000 copies on vinyl.
More than 80 albums have been released on cassette already this year, leading to over 20,000 sales to date.
That's the highest annual total since 2006, bucking a trend which saw an all-time low (of less than 4,000 units sold) in 2012.
The best-selling non-compilation cassette so far this year is Kasabian's album For Crying Out Loud, with 1,026 sales to date. It's a small but not insignificant figure, given its limited run and exclusive availability on the band's official website.
“That's the best thing I've ever heard,” Serge Pizzorno told OfficialCharts.com, adding: “It's about fan loyalty, I think. It's about having a physical object. One of your favourite bands has put out an album and you want it on a different format that you can hold in your hands. It's nice to see the sleeve and the artwork in a different way as well.”
Other releases whose cassette versions re selling well include albums by Enter Shikari, Paul Heaton & Jacqui Abbott, Arcade Fire, Gary Numan and Blondie.
However, cassettes will have some way to go before they get back to their status as top-selling format, 27 years ago - long before CDs, and the internet, had taken hold. Still, with vinyl's rebirth, and with Christmas coming up, who knows?
An Entwistle woman is among three people police have charged after finding them in possession of a stolen vehicle in Wildwood, Alta.
On May 20, members of the Western Alberta District Crime Reduction Team were patrolling a rural area when they spotted a man who was wanted by RCMP and determined that man was in a stolen vehicle. RCMP attempted to make contact with the man, but he and two others in the vehicle fled from police.
Shortly thereafter, police located the vehicle again and arrested two of the occupants without incident. Adam James Barass, 33, of Yellowhead County was charged with possession of property obtained by crime over $5,000, possession of property obtained by crime under $5,000 and possession of break-in tools.
Megan Yuhasz, 34, of Entwistle, was charged with possession of property obtained by crime both over and under $5,000.
Barass was released on bail and will be in an Evansburg Provincial Court and Yuhasz was released on a recognizance with a court date scheduled for June 25 in Evansburg.
The third occupant, identified as Robert William Sherwood, 35, of Entwistle, managed to evade police despite Police Dog Services being brought into the area to assist with the search.
Sherwood is wanted on numerous charges, including eight new charges that stemmed from this incident. He has been charged with possession of property obtained by crime over $5,000, obstructing and resisting a peace officer, dangerous operation of a motor vehicle, breach of recognizance and four additional charges.
Sherwood is described as a slimly built, white male, standing 5'11” and weighing 146 lbs. Sherwood has blonde hair and green eyes.
RCMP is asking anyone with information on Sherwood's whereabouts to contact their local police or Crime Stoppers.
After Kevin Spacey's ouster, All the Money In The World to release in India on 5 January
New Delhi, Dec 11 (IANS) Ridley Scott's All The Money In The World, in which Christopher Plummer replaced actor Kevin Spacey at the last minute following sexual harassment accusations, will release in India on 5 January next year.
The film is being brought to India by PVR Pictures, read a statement.
It was announced in November that 58-year-old Spacey would be cut out of Scott's biopic, which would have seen him take on the role of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty. The decision was made after the actor faced a slew of sexual assault allegations.
All The Money In The World follows Getty's grandson John Paul Getty III, who was kidnapped by an organised crime regime, and his mother Gail's (Michelle Williams) attempts to convince his wealthy grandfather to pay the ransom.
Plummer re-shot all the scenes already filmed by Spacey. It also stars Michelle Williams and Mark Wahlberg, and will open in the US on 25 December.
The food and agriculture industry contributes over $101 billion dollars annually to our state's economy, and the 923,000 jobs associated with it accounts for about 22 percent of the state's employment figure. (Photo: John M. Galloway / Special to The Detroit News)
“Outta' My Mind on a Monday Moanin'”
Pure Michigan. The food and agriculture industry contributes over $101 billion dollars annually to our state's economy, and the 923,000 jobs associated with it accounts for about 22 percent of the state's employment figure.
We make a big deal out of our return on investment for money we use to promote tourism in our great state, and well we should. But how about these numbers: When you look at the $2.8 billion in food and agricultural products we export, $1 in export activity generates another $2.93 in economic activity, meaning Michigan's total agriculture exports alone have a local impact of an additional $8.2 billion.
Which is one reason we just had our first “annual” WJR- Paul W. Smith Show — Pure Michigan AG Tour. We wanted to draw attention, and give much deserved accolades, to a sometimes taken-for-granted group of hardworking men, women and children who keep us, and much of the rest of the world, well fed.

When you get something new, the first thing you'll want to do is start using and enjoying it and seeing the things it can do. That's why we want those new things in the first place, whether we're talking about a physical thing like a phone or a toaster oven, or a digital thing like an app or a new album. But if your new thing uses the internet, you should take a look at what else it might be doing before you dive in.
The recent (and ongoing) Facebook shenanigans really highlight what I'm talking about here, so I'm going to use it as an example. But know that applies to more than just Facebook, it's just the low-hanging fruit that makes it so easy to talk about. Facebook did a lot of ugly things but it only did the things you said it could do. I'm not here to say it's our fault — you'll never hear me come at you with that lame excuse because this was all Facebook relying on us not knowing what it was doing and trusting that the company wasn't willing to screw over every single user to make a few more pennies. But we could have prevented it from happening and hopefully we'll be more skeptical and untrusting in the future because of it all.
Predators like Facebook will always exist, so we need to do whatever we can to make things more difficult for them.
If you were to buy a new phone with Facebook installed or install the app as new, you might think that understanding the apps permissions would be enough to keep tabs on your privacy. We don't care about all of the details of our lives or who knows them; if we did businesses like Facebook wouldn't exist in the first place because we would never talk about what we're doing, who we're doing it with or where we did it. But all of that needs to be on our terms and shared with the people we decide to share it with, and no extra details need to be given. But a look at the default privacy settings for Facebook — and again, this goes for any app — will let you see that this isn't the case at all.
You're sharing details you had no idea you were sharing, had no idea could be shared, and had no idea that they were important enough for anyone to care in the first place. Your location, a history of your location, your internet history, details about your contacts, things you've purchased (and how you purchased them), and more are scalped from your phone or computer and shared with Facebook and its advertisers by default. Facebook is in the news because of how fast and loose it uses this information, but plenty of companies through plenty of services want the same kinds of data. That's why default settings usually have you opted into sharing it all — you are a cash cow to be milked as often as possible.
You might be OK with sharing some things to get better services.
This doesn't have to be a bad thing. What you get in return can be worth what you're giving away, especially when it comes to companies who offer services you love. Amazon, Microsoft and Google come to mind here. You can share private information and have a better online experience or a better personal assistant or a better way to shop. These three companies are also straightforward about what they take from you and how they treat it once its in their hands, too. But you should still take a look and see what you tell them be default, because like Facebook, the default settings are what's best for the company not what's best for you.

Hartlepool United boss Craig Hignett has hailed the character of his players after they rescued a point at Accrington.
Pools had to twice come from behind in order to gain their share of the spoils at Stanley's Wham Stadium this afternoon.
And Hignett was delighted to do that.
Although, ever the critic, he was far from pleased with the goals his players conceded.
Hignett said: "Offensively we weren't the best. We got in positions and didn't create enough.
"Apart from two lapses from set-pieces we were OK, we coped with everything they had.
"The first goal was always going to be important and they got it and I was pleased with character shown to come back, not once, but twice.
“They have got character, bottle and pride to come back and showed it today. They battled back well.
"I didn't ever feel like we were going to crumble. I didn't feel like it would happen, although they gave us problems with set-pieces."

After the drawn out saga leading up to his signing a new Arsenal deal, Mesut Ozil made sure fans know how much it means to him - now the playmaker's aimed his gratitude at those closest to him.
The German international's announcement on Thursday after signing a contract until 2021, which involves a massive pay rise up to £350,000-a-week, explained how it was "one of the most important decisions of my footballing career".
He continued: "That's why I had to think hard and talk with everyone who's important to me. Good things take time! In the end I let my heart decide.
"As I always said, I feel at home here and I'm highly motivated to achieve big things in the next few years. Once a Gunner, always a Gunner!”

So why bother with ETFs? Index mutual funds are similarly cheap and diversified, but they don't offer ETFs' flexibility and focus. ETFs trade throughout the day like stocks, while mutual funds are priced and traded at the end of the day. So investors can move in and out of ETFs quickly and easily. Plus, ETFs offer an increasing range of investment themes, slicing and dicing the market by almost any category imaginable — capitalization, industry, value, country and more. If you really want to bore in on a specific sector, ETFs can let you do that — at least, that's the idea.
This doesn't mean you should avoid ETFs entirely. After all, top investor Warren Buffett recommends S&P index ETFs as the top choice for most investors. But if a tightly focused investment is what you're after, you have to know what's in your fund.
But while large index-based funds, such as those that track the Standard & Poor's 500, may fairly represent the index's stocks, smaller niche ETFs don't always deliver strictly what their names promise, and you might wind up indirectly buying a lot of something you didn't really want.
Exchange-traded funds have swept the stock market over the past decade and been a blessing for many investors.
Take a look at the iShares MSCI Spain Capped ETF, which is meant to give investors access to large and mid-sized companies in a single country, according to its fund manager. But while the fund does use stocks listed in Spain, the revenues of those companies largely come from outside the country. According to asset manager Horizon Kinetics, the Top 10 companies within this ETF, which account for more than two-thirds of its total assets, derived 53 per cent of their sales from outside Spain as of Dec. 31, 2016.
The iShares MSCI United Kingdom ETF has a similar issue. The fund means to be U.K.-focused, but it's stuffed with global multinationals, which derived 64 per cent of their revenue from outside the U.K. in 2016, according to Horizon Kinetics.
These aren't isolated events; mismatches can occur in many funds. Small-company ETFs might have little exposure to truly small companies, preferring to shade into more liquid mid-size firms. And as Horizon notes, supposedly value-themed ETFs may deliver less growth and yet be more costly than the overall S&P 500, so hardly a value.
If you want to figure out what's really in an ETF, you'll have to dig beyond its name.
What's going on?
The rise in ETF investing has created a market where fund managers are awash in cash that must be placed in themed investments. Over the past decade, more than $1 trillion has moved from actively managed stock mutual funds to passively managed stock index funds and ETFs.
The more money an ETF has, the more it will be forced to chase larger companies, since these stocks can more easily absorb the dollars flowing in. But there's a limited selection of large, liquid companies. And, returning to the earlier examples, these companies tend to operate globally, so only small percentages of their revenue come from any one country. It ends up being hard for an ETF to get “pure” exposure to, say, Spain or the U.K.
What can investors do?
The first step is understanding that a niche ETF might not be quite as focused as its name suggests. Then you can find out much of what a fund does own, because each ETF details its top 10 stakes, including names and position sizes.
But you'll have to dig deeper — into the EDGAR database on the Securities and Exchange Commission website, for example — if you want to determine how much business a company does in a certain niche. That defeats much of the purpose of this kind of ETF: speed and simplicity.
The information the ETF provides can also help investors who assume that a themed fund will help them diversify their portfolio. For example, in the Spain fund, the top position, Banco Santander, makes up more than 18 per cent of the fund's assets — so if you already own that stock, or another fund that contains that stock, your portfolio's diversity will actually suffer.
With so many funds investing in the same large companies, you might end up with a bigger allocation to one company than you want. So if you're looking to ETFs for diversification — or for a precisely targeted investment — read the fine print first.

An employee of the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute tests its voice-recognizing tech with the mobile translation app Genie Talk at the institute based in Daejeon on Tuesday. (ETRI)
South Korea's Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute has developed voice recognition-based translation technology for nine languages, the institute announced Tuesday.A user first chooses one of nine languages: Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Russian and Arabic. When a phrase is spoken in Korean, text appears in both Korean and the chosen language.So far, the algorithms for each language show a maximum of 95 percent in accuracy for casual conversations, the institute said.The institute touts itself as the only organization in Korea that owns data on the largest number -- nine -- of languages in the country, including phrases that are directly available for translation from one language to another.ETRI's intelligence information research division used its deep learning tech for the analysis of immense data about each language in order to develop the language intelligent algorithms.In addition, the institute said it has secured technologies on big data refinement and the pronunciation of multiple languages, which could help expansion of the latest tech to the languages of Southeast Asian countries and even Hindi.The tech will help Korean electronics enterprises that are planning to jump into the global market for smart devices with voice recognizing features.“The latest tech is superior in Korean to Google's similar tech, while it is similar to the Google level with other languages,” said Kim Sang- hoon, head of the project at ETRI. “Considering the recent trending voice recognition in electronics, this tech could help local firms develop artificial intelligence assistant programs, AI-based translators and automatic programs for connected cars.”The institute plans to transfer the voice-based translation tech to local mobile carriers, internet firms and other related developers.It is currently testing the translator with Genie Talk, a translator app co-developed with Korean software mogul Hancom, with an aim to provide the voice-recognizing translation service for the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games.ETRI plans to expand the service to 14 languages by 2020, eyeing the Tokyo Olympics.By Song Su-hyun ( song@heraldcorp.com
March 19, 2018 (JUBA)- South Sudanese government is seeking a change of venue for peace talks, citing the political situation in neighbouring Ethiopia which has been hosting the talks since the conflict broke out in 2013.
Presidential adviser on diplomatic affairs and the head of the government negotiating team said his country has hoped the next round of peace talks would resume as per schedules but the political situation in host country has pushed the time to allow certain internal arrangements and processes to be completed.
“Because of the necessity to accelerate discussions we feel it would be prudent if the IGAD member countries accept the talks to resume and if the current situation in Ethiopia requires time, we feel another one of the IGAD member countries should host the talks until when the situation in Ethiopia allows”, said Nhial Deng Nhial in an interview with Sudan Tribune on Monday when reached to comment on whether talks would remain on hold until the current political situation in Ethiopia addressed and what is the alternative they are considering to end the war.
Last February, Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn abruptly resigned to pave the way for political reforms in the country following months of protests by the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia, the Amhara and Oromo.
After his resignation, the Ethiopian government declared a six-month nationwide state of emergency, but the situation remains stable and under control as the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front is still weighing the best solution to ensure a lasting political solution.
The presidential aide did not choose a particular country in the region as a prefered place.
“ It is for the mediation team to decide. What we want is a place where the negotiations can resume,” he said.
In a related development, Information Minister Michael Makuei Lueth said the government wants the venue of peace talks to be changed to another place because of the political situation in Ethiopia.
Lueth preferred Djibouti, Kenya and Uganda as some of the places in the region where talks could be moved. He rejected Somalia, Sudan and South Sudan because of security and political situation.
On 16 February, the peace revitalization process was suspended after the failure of the parties to reach an agreement over security, constitutional and governance matters. However, the mediators said the process would resume within three weeks, maximum.

The skeleton of a man crushed by an enormous stone while trying to flee the explosion of Mt. Vesuvius nearly 2,000 years ago has been discovered at the Pompeii archaeological site.

Archaeologists working at the ancient Roman city of Pompeii, Italy, found the man's remains from A.D. 79. The skeleton appears to be of a man who survived the initial explosion and was fleeing the city.
“Initial observations would appear to indicate that the individual survived the first eruptive phase of the volcano, and subsequently sought salvation along the alley now covered in a thick layer of lapilli,” officials explained in a Facebook post.

But archaeologists said a leg injury may have slowed him down before being hurled back by the volcano's pyroclastic flow (hot lava blocks, pumice and volcanic ash) and then he was crushed by a giant stone — possibly decapitating him.
“A formidable stone block (perhaps a door jamb), violently thrown by the volcanic cloud, collided with his upper body, crushing the highest part of the thorax and yet-to-be-identified head, which lie at a lower height of the lower limbs, and probably under the stone block,” officials stated.

On Tuesday, Pompeii officials released a photograph showing the victim, who may have been in his 30s, pinned under a large block of stone.
The archaeological site's general director, Massimo Osanna, said despite the “emotional impact of these discoveries” it was “an exceptional find,” that contributes to a better “picture of the history and civilization of the age.”
Luke Woods is the Head of Design at Facebook. In this episode, we discuss how digital design is in a unique position to make an impact on the world, dive into the details of what the evolution of design looked like at Facebook, and learn the importance of three little words: understand, identify, execute.
Facebook has grown immensely throughout the five-and-a-half years Woods has worked there. Throughout our interview, he gives us an inside look at how the design team grew from a few dozen to a few hundred, explaining the trials the team faced as it scaled and the tools they used to overcome their problems.
On how to approach designing a new product or feature, Woods says there are three steps: understand, identify, and execute. Take the time to understand what it is you're trying to accomplish with the product. Use that understanding identifying the biggest problems you need to solve. And execute on the idea by focusing on getting it done and making it real.

A 56 year old man, Manyengo Maliseni from Mwenela village in the Area of Traditional Authority Njerwa in Lilongwe died suddenly after drinking insecticide (poison).
In an interview, Lilongwe Police Spokesperson Kingsly Dandaula said a stepson to Malsiseni, Bokosi Langwani revealed that his stepfather died after mistakenly took insecticide.
He said the deceased was a local farmer who had a vegetable garden and he bought a 250mls bottle of insecticide from unknown market to splay his vegetables.
“He kept the bottle in his trouser's pocket and branched at one of the drinking joint in the village when he got drunk he bought a small bottle of beer for him to be drinking when going home” Dandaula disclosed.
He pointed out that the deceased kept the bottle in the same pocket where he kept the bottle of insecticide after he arrived at his house he mistakenly picked the bottle of insecticide sipping it thinking it was a bottle of beer.
“He sipped it for two times after realizing that it was poison the victim informed the relative who rushed him to Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH) where he was receiving treatment,” the PRO narrated.
Dandaula said on April 21, at about 4 pm the victim was pronounced dead whilst receiving treatment.
The body was sent to mortuary waiting for postmortem.
Trinidad and Tobago defender Daneil Cyrus insisted he did not have a drop of alcohol on New Year's Day and said he felt unfairly vilified after coach Tom Saintfiet told the media that Cyrus and his former W Connection teammate, Jomal Williams, came to camp late and smelling of alcohol.
Both players were axed from the Trinidad and Tobago squad to face Suriname and Haiti in 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup playoff action on Wednesday night and Sunday afternoon respectively at the Ato Boldon Stadium in Couva.
However, Cyrus said his reputation could be unfairly tarnished by Saintfiet's statements. And, although he stressed he did not want conflict with the Soca Warriors coach, the defender disputed any suggestion that he touched alcohol before joining the team camp.
“People think I came into camp smelling of alcohol,” Cyrus told Wired868. “[Saintfiet] asked Jomal: ‘You are smelling of alcohol'? And [Jomal] said ‘Yes, I took a drink with my family'.
“He never told me anything about that. And I never took a drink.”
Saintfiet's exact words to the media were:
“Two of the players came one and a half hours too late in camp and had still decent smell of alcohol around him (sic). That was Daneil Cyrus and Jomal Williams. Both were immediately sent home, back to party but are replaced in the squad.”
Cyrus, who has 62 full international caps, tried to explain the chain of events that led to him being dropped from the national team.
The Connection defender, who also played professionally in Vietnam and the United States, said he got a flat tyre while driving to the team's camp in Claxton Bay and realised he did not have a jack in his vehicle. He was in St Helena at the time.
Cyrus claimed he then called a friend who came from Santa Rosa in Arima to help him change his tyre.
The setback meant he was over an hour late to meet his teammates at the Cara Suites Hotel. All players were supposed to be at the hotel by noon but, according to Cyrus, he got there at 1.26pm.
On the way, he said he picked up Williams, who was supposedly having trouble getting a taxi to the Cara Suites. Cyrus said he relayed his mishaps to the technical staff via national teammates Alvin Jones and Aikim Andrews, who are both also Connection players.
“I called and told Alvin what happened,” said Cyrus. “And then Aikim called and he put on the manager, Azaad [Khan], who told me the coach was mad…”
Cyrus said when he and Williams got to the hotel, he went to see Saintfiet who immediately demanded to see the flat tyre to verify the defender's story. He said they were heading to check the flat when the Belgian coach got a whiff of his teammate.
Everything changed quickly after that.
“The coach asked me to see the flat tyre that I changed and I said okay,” said the 26-year-old Cyrus. “But before we could do that, he said: ‘Jomal, you are smelling of alcohol'? And Jomal told him that he took a drink before he came with his family.
“And then coach told us to wait in the lobby. And when he came back, he said: ‘Okay, you can go home. Go and party'.”
Wired868 tried unsuccessfully to reach Williams for his account of what transpired.
Cyrus said he was stunned by Saintfiet's reaction but shook the coach's hand and left. He insisted that he is fully committed to representing Trinidad and Tobago.
“It wasn't anything that I could control,” said Cyrus, who is a former two-time World Youth Cup player. “I am fully committed to play for my national team—anytime!”
Tall, mobile and aggressive, Cyrus was considered one of Trinidad and Tobago's top prospects when he broke into the senior squad, six years ago. But, like most of his teammates, he disappointed in 2016.
Cyrus looked especially vulnerable in the Warriors' two World Cup qualifying defeats in the Hex to Costa Rica and Honduras. But he held his hands up and admitted that his performances have not been good enough.
“I wasn't really at my best for the last two [World Cup qualifying] games and everybody knows that,” said Cyrus. “I know that too. Sometimes a player might be going through a good patch and sometimes a player is going through a bad patch.
“For the Guatemala match [on 2 September 2016], I thought I had an okay game but for the last two games I really wasn't at my best. I am not hiding. I just had two bad games.”
Cyrus plays central defence for Connection but was a regular at right back under former National Senior Team coach Stephen Hart. And, in his two outings under Saintfiet, he appeared in central midfield.
“I can play anywhere on the field, once I get time to adjust to the position,” he said. “A footballer should be able to play anywhere on the field. In the last game [against Nicaragua], I even got a chance one on one [with the opposing goalkeeper] and I missed…
“I do prefer to play centre back, honestly. But any position they let me play, I play it to the best of my ability.”
Cyrus will have to look on from the outside as Trinidad and Tobago try to book their place at the Gold Cup without him. The Warriors face Suriname from 7pm on Wednesday at the Ato Boldon Stadium.
He hopes his stay on the sidelines is brief, though. And he insists that he did not have an alcoholic drink on New Year's Day.
Family affair: Actor Patrick Duffy ("Dallas") grew up above his father's bar in Montana. His grandfather also had a bar in Boulder, Mont. And now his son Padraic and his daughter-in-law Emily Kosloski are spearheading a new bar on Theater Row called the Broadwater Plunge. When the bar opens inside the Duffy family's Broadwater theater complex on Santa Monica Boulevard May 24, it will be the first bar to open inside a theater that will operate regardless of when the theater is open (you will not need a theater ticket to get inside). The 900-square-foot bar is named after a spa called the Broadwater in Montana that had a swimming pool, or "plunge," in the middle of it. The Broadwater Plunge is adjacent to stages where the Sacred Fools Theater company, of which Padriac has served as the company managing director for almost a decade, puts on shows. "We wanted it to be a public space within the community where artists could all gather in one place," said Padraic. "It's the melding of our family history and the theater's history."
This is the story of Chris Bertish's unforgettable journey. A journey of 93 days, 4,050 nautical miles, and almost 2 million strokes filled with life-threatening challenges. Well, that's what it took him to paddle across the Atlantic Ocean on a stand-up paddle (SUP) board.
Starting off the coast of Morocco, he travelled for more than three months to reach English Harbour, Antigua, where he arrived haggard and grateful to still be standing. Weather and exhaustion were waiting to derail him as they worked against him. He had been surviving on freeze-dried meals for his entire journey. Waves threatened to swamp him, and he had several run-ins with sharks who tested the material of his board to see if it was edible.
Despite the struggles, Bertish recounted the challenging conditions he had to face. Relentless trade winds slowed his progress, though he kept to his gruelling pace as he paddled 12 to 15 hours every day. "It's more than the endurance side that was difficult to keep going. I had to manage the elements and manage myself mentally. I had massive system malfunctions that I was trying to troubleshoot myself."
His board-and with it, his feet and ankles-were also underwater most of the trip. His storage compartments would take on water, too, forcing him to open them even if it meant risking losing his food. "I pretty much constantly felt like I was sinking," he said. "Every two weeks I had to open up the hatches and pump out the water, but that's where my food was. It was a double-edged sword."
Bertish made the journey as a way to raise money for charity and test the limits of possibility. The Lunchbox Fund, Operation Smile, and Signature of Hope were the three main beneficiaries of the reported $380,000 raised by the epic journey.
Chris Bertish emphasised that this journey was worth all of the hardship he faced, as the money would be donated to charities that help children in South Africa. "Knowing the impact this will have," he says, "made every day out on the open ocean worthwhile."

City Councillor Diane Colley-Urquhart has resigned from the Calgary Police Commission, one day after board chair Brian Thiessen said she may have violated the commission's code of conduct by speaking on behalf of the commission without authority.
“Today we received a letter from Coun. Colley-Urquhart announcing her resignation from the Calgary Police Commission,” Thiessen said Tuesday in an emailed statement. “Though this resignation comes as a surprise, we would like to thank Coun. Colley-Urquhart for 10 years of service to the commission.
“Coun. Colley-Urquhart brought significant expertise and a passion for public safety.”
“We valued her perspective and contribution and wish her the best of luck.”

On Monday, the police commission released a letter stating that in October and November of 2016 it received “a number of letters, emails, and phone calls from individuals raising concerns about the conduct of Coun. Diane Colley-Urquhart.”
The letter said that Colley-Urquhart may have violated four provisions:
Speaking on behalf of the commission without express authority or delegation; Using one's position as a commissioner to advance personal interests; Executing duties loyally, faithfully and impartially, and; Executing duties in accordance with applicable legislation.
Thiessen said he addressed the allegations with Colley-Urquhart but she maintained a breach did not occur.
“The commission acknowledges the inherent difficulty a commissioner who sits on city council will face in balancing their obligations to both entities,” Thiessen said.

“Members of council always have to be super careful about balancing a number of different roles. We are representatives of the public and it's our job to speak out on important issues when we see them. We also have different fiduciary obligations,” Mayor Naheed Nenshi said on Monday.
“It's something almost every member of council has to balance on almost every issue, every day.”
The councillor came under fire late last year for speaking publicly about having met with female police officers who had serious concerns with the workplace environment at the CPS, suggesting problems were not isolated to just a few.
She said she first met with two or three women at her home in February, with meetings growing to as many as 18 people with complaints. The councillor shared some of the emails she's received, detailing examples of discrimination and harassment.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Brazilian club Chapecoense are hoping to take inspiration from playing in Japan as they continue to rebuild after all but three of their squad were killed in a plane crash en route to the Copa Sudamericana final in Colombia last November.
Chapecoense were awarded the trophy following the disaster and are in Japan to play the Urawa Red Diamonds in Saitama on Tuesday in the annual Suruga Bank Championship between the reigning J.League Cup and Copa Sudamericana holders.
The Brazilian side's manager Vinicius Eutropio believes it is important for his team to take a spiritual lesson from being in a country that was devastated by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami but has found its footing since.
"This is a country which showed the entire world what recovery is all about," Eutropio was quoted by Kyodo news agency as telling reporters on Monday.
"We are in the process of rebuilding and we want to take whatever we can from here that will help us on our path to recovery."
Eutropio added that his side were well prepared for their first competitive overseas match since the crash on a mountain near Medellin that claimed 71 lives.
"This match means something to us. We are serious about it and we hope to give it everything we have at this point in time," he added.
"There is an intercontinental trophy at stake, which is something Chapecoense have never won (on the pitch). So it's imperative for us to take this silverware back home.
"We are expecting a very difficult game. We've had a long trip to get here, have jet lag and our opponents are a quality side. I've only been in charge for 30 days, but I have faith in my players and hope to take a win back to Brazil."
Urawa, who are also playing in the event founded in 2008 for a first time, are looking forward to a match that they feel will be emotional for both sides.
"(Chapecoense) are moving forward one step at a time and we are fortunate to have the opportunity to play them," captain Yuki Abe said. "I've played a lot of games in my career, but I think this is one I will remember for the rest of my life."

THE HAGUE/SAN JOSE (Reuters) - Costa Rica claimed victory over Nicaragua on Friday, after the United Nations' highest court awarded Costa Rica disputed territory along the coastal border shared by the two Central American countries.
Nicaragua was ordered by the International Court of Justice in The Hague to remove a military base from a contested coastal area near the San Juan river, which the judges said violated Costa Rican sovereignty.
The court's panel of 15 international judges also found that Costa Rica has sovereignty over the “whole northern part of Isla Portillos, including the coast,” but excluding Harbour Head Lagoon.
Costa Rica's President Luis Guillermo Solis called the decision “historic,” while Foreign Minister Manuel Gonzalez said it was very close to what the country had asked for.
In a separate case heard at the court earlier on Friday, Nicaragua was ordered to pay Costa Rica nearly $379,000 dollars - less than it had asked for - in reparations for environmental damage to parts of its wetlands at the mouth of the disputed San Juan river.
Costa Rica should be compensated by April 2 for damage caused, the cost of environmental restoration, expenses and interest, the court said.
“The amount is not what we hoped for, but we accept fully and respectfully what the court decided,” Gonzalez said. “Nicaragua has a valuable opportunity to rebuild trust between the two countries and close the chapters that have distanced us in recent years.”
Nicaragua's government called the environmental verdict a “major defeat for Costa Rica” in a statement. It did not comment on the other cases.
As part of the border settlement, the court drew a new maritime boundary between the states, who have had rival claims since 2002, when Nicaragua published maps detailing oil concessions. Some of those were in waters claimed by Costa Rica.
Costa Rica had filed the suit in 2014, asking the court to determine its borders with Nicaragua in the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean.
In 2010, Nicaragua sent soldiers to open an artificial waterway to divert water from the San Juan River that divides both countries to a nearby Nicaraguan lake, in what Costa Rica saw as a move to shorten its territory. Nicaragua said it was dredging a natural waterway.
ISLAMABAD, Apr 24 (APP):Minister for Planning, Development and Reforms Ahsan Iqbal on Tuesday said the development budget was a part of Finance Bill and was approved by National Assembly while according to the constitution of Pakistan, National Economic Council (NEC) had only a consultative role in this regard.
He said the federal government could not present a budget for only one quarter of the year as per demand of the chief ministers of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh and Balochistan.
In a statement issued here, Ahsan Iqbal was of the view that after the 18th amendment, the main focus of federal development budget had been on the national infrastructure.
However, he said, some provinces wanted to include the provincial level schemes in the federal PSDP 2018-19.
He said usually special funds were allocated for underdeveloped provinces and the present government had allocated record funds for Balochistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan.
DETROIT (AP)  Mazda is recalling about 174,000 small cars in the U.S. because the seats can change angles suddenly, making the vehicles hard to drive.
The recall covers the Mazda 2 subcompact from the 2011 model year and the 2010 and 2011 Mazda 3 and Mazdaspeed 3 compacts.
The company says the seat height adjustment links can break or detach from the seat frame, changing the seat angle and increasing the risk of a crash.
Dealers will inspect the seat links and either install a reinforcement bracket or replace the whole seat adjustment unit. The recall is expected to start on March 31.

The internet has been dreaming up a Disney princess shared universe for years, but Disney went ahead and made it a reality (kind of) by staging the ultimate royal reunion in Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-it-Ralph 2. The long-awaited sequel will bring all the Disney princesses together on-screen when Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) wanders into a room full of the animated icons when she joins Ralph (John C. Reilly) on an adventure through the internet.
Disney debuted the footage at D23 last year, and stirred up quite the enthusiastic ruccus among those who were lucky enough to be in the audience. Disney recruited the original voice actors to reprise their roles for the sequence, including, Jodi Benson as Ariel (The Little Mermaid), Paige O'Hara as Belle (Beauty and the Beast), Linda Larkin as Jasmine (Aladdin), Ming Na Wen as Mulan (Mulan), Irene Bedard as Pocahontas (Poachontas), Idina Menzel as Elsa (Frozen), Anika Noni Rose as Tiana (The Princess and the Frog), Mandy Moore as Rapunzel (Tangled), Kristen Bell as Anna (Frozen), and Auli'i Cravalho as Moana (Moana). They even got a little Pixar in there with Kelly Macdonald as Merida (Brave).
We don't have a look at the footage just yet (no trace of the princesses in the last trailer), but Disney UK has revealed the first-look image from the princess sequence. Additionally, USA Today has debuted two new images from the film.
The sequel sees the return of director Rich Moore, who co-directed the smash hit Zootopia in between Wreck-It Ralph movies, alongside co-director Phil Johnston. Wreck-it-Ralph 2 also finds Fix-It Felix (Jack McBrayer) and Sergeant Calhoun (Jane Lynch) adventuring into the digital age. Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It-Ralph 2 arrives in theaters on November 21, 2018. Check out the new images below.
Gov. Kay Ivey declared a state of emergency for Alabama that went effect at 7 a.m. Friday ahead of Tropical Storm Nate.
"It is impossible for us to know how this storm will play out. However, I want to make it real clear. We are not taking this threat likely,” Ivey said Thursday.
[Read the latest weather information HERE]
Nate is expected to be a Category 1 hurricane when it makes landfall on the Gulf Coast.
Alabama Emergency Management Agency Director Brian Hastings discussed the impacts he's expecting.
“In Mobile and Baldwin county, there's going to be a surge and tide and flooding event in the low lying areas,” Hastings said. “In other places there may be flash floods that are localized for the rain event. But the majority of Alabama will see a wind event that if it continues as the forecasts say, it will result in some power outages because trees will fall on power lines.”
Ivey explained the reason for the state of emergency.
“I have signed the State of Emergency, because it frees up personnel and resources in case there is a need to respond to any storm related activity,” Ivey said. “State and local leaders are ready to respond if needed, but our people need to stay weather-aware and heed any directions given by local officials.”
Ivey has ordered the State of Emergency Operations Center in Clanton to activate to Level Three, allowing AEMA staff to monitor and prepare for the impact of Nate. The Department of Transportation, the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, the Alabama Department of Public Health, the Alabama Department of Human Resources, the Alabama Forestry Commission and the Alabama National Guard are prepared to respond as well.
“The time for residents to prepare is now. Please build or restock your emergency preparedness kit, have a plan to communicate with family members if you lose power, review your evacuation plan with your family, stock your vehicle with emergency supplies and have a method to receive the latest weather updates and emergency instructions,” Hastings said. “It is important for Alabama residents to understand the potential threat of this storm goes beyond the coastal counties. Everyone needs to closely monitor this system as it moves across the state in the coming days.”
“Lives cannot be replaced,” added Hastings. “So as you make the choice to do a voluntary evacuation or leave the area you think is at risk to mitigate your exposure to that threat, you should take solace in you're protecting your family. You're doing what's right because it feels good to you on an individual level.”
At this time, the governor is not ordering a mandatory evacuation of the state's coast but voluntary evacuations are in effect for parts of Baldwin and Mobile counties.

[Editorial] Obey court ruling
Would-be presidents, protest organizers should agree to accept decision on impeachment
The floor leaders of the ruling and opposition parties Monday agreed to accept whatever the Constitutional Court rules on the parliamentary impeachment of President Park Geun-hye.
It should be no wonder that the political parties of a democracy would obey judicial decisions. Disobedience to rulings by the top court is an act of repudiation to the constitutional order.
Yet the news of their agreement, though verbal, is a relief amid escalating confrontation between protestors for and against the impeachment motion. Some leading politicians on both sides openly uttered incendiary remarks, instigating disobedience and protest if the court decision were to go against their demands.
Former Gyeonggi Province Gov. Kim Moon-soo, a would-be president from the ruling Liberty Party of Korea, formerly the Saenuri Party, participated in a protest against the impeachment of Park on Saturday where he made an inflaming speech. “We should drive out the cruelest mob,” he said, referring to pro-impeachment protestors. “We should crush their revolution.”
Rep. Yoon Sang-hyun of the same party hosted a forum on the presidential impeachment in the National Assembly. Participants excoriated such institutions as the special counsel team investigating the corruption scandal involving Park and her friend, as well as the news media digging up the scandal.
Moon Jae-in, the front-runner in the presidential race and former leader of the opposition Democratic Party of Korea, said he would accept the ruling, but added the populace would not condone it if the court rejects the impeachment motion. The remark implies people should protest against the court if it decides to reinstate Park to office. In December, he came under fire for saying if the court turns down the impeachment motion, a revolution would be the final resort.
Lee Jae-myung, Seongnam mayor and a Democratic Party presidential candidate, engaged in demagoguery, saying “If the Constitutional Court ignores popular expectations and throws out the impeachment, the people should fight the court.”
It's sophistry. There's no higher court to appeal to than the Constitutional Court. Nevertheless, Lee was outspoken in saying he would disobey the decision to reject the impeachment.
If the situation continues, confrontation may escalate into chaos and violent clashes after the court decision either to uphold or reject the motion. To prevent the nation from falling into disorder, presidential candidates need to agree indisputably to respect the court ruling and not to foster protests after the decision, or to proclaim individually to do so if they find it hard to get together to sign such a deal.
As potential leaders of the nation seeking its unity, they should also try to persuade protestors to respect whatever the court decides.
The thing is, protestors are becoming recalcitrant. Protests are showing signs of going too far and becoming provocative.
The principal of a high school in Seoul criticized the parliamentary impeachment of Park in his speech to students last week, and members of a conservative parents' group rallied for him in front of the school Tuesday. Whether a head teacher's address to high school students denouncing the impeachment of Park is educational is certainly questionable.
Seo Seok-gu, one of the lawyers representing Park in her impeachment trial, entered the Constitutional Court with a Korean national flag draped over his shoulders. He showed the flag to spectators shortly before the start of a hearing. Outside the court, Seo has participated in anti-impeachment protests in which participants wave Korean and US national flags. His flag performance was restrained by a guard immediately, but his protest briefly encroached upon the sanctity of the Constitutional Court.
A television show host said he would participate in a pro-impeachment cultural event, and anti-impeachment protest organizers offered an open debate with him at their rally site.
Both sides have scheduled large rallies for Feb. 18, 25 and March 1. Feb. 25 is the fourth anniversary of President Park's inauguration, and a pro-impeachment civic group plans to hold a coast-to-coast protest on that day.
More and more people are worried about a likely post-ruling collision between the two sides as the day of reckoning approaches. Not much time is left before the court rules on the impeachment motion. The pro-impeachment side demands it make a decision before March 13, when its acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi is to retire, while the anti-impeachment camp emphasizes prudent deliberations, preferably extending past March 13.
To ease growing public concern about possible disorder after the court ruling, protest organizers on both sides need to agree to respect it and refrain from protesting against the court.
BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's would-be coalition partners agreed on Friday on an environmental policy in which cars with excess emissions would be refitted rather than taken off the road.
In a coalition paper seen by Reuters, Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) also said they would aim to promote the use of electric vehicles, in particular by fostering the introduction of more electric taxis, buses and delivery vehicles.
Names of about 1.15 lakh persons which were included in the first draft of the updated National Register of Citizens in Assam published on 31 December, 2017, will be excluded from the final draft. The Supreme Court in its order on 2 July approved a proposal by the State Coordinator, National Register of Citizens (NRC), Assam to this effect. The Supreme Court has also fixed 30 July as the new date for publication of the final draft.
State Coordinator, NRC Assam, Prateek Hajela submitted before the apex court that these 1.15 lakh persons already included in Part Draft "have not been found admissible for inclusion” in the complete draft during the verification process. These 1.15 lakh cases include 65,694 cases of “family tree mismatch” and 48,456 cases of married women who have submitted Panchayat certificates.
"The Part Draft NRC comprising 1.9 crore applicants out of the total 3.29 crore applicants were published on 31 December 2017. At that stage, the family tree mismatch investigation and Gaon Panchayat Secretary certificate verification in respect of married women were pending and scheduled for the subsequent draft list. During the course of the Family Tree investigation, 65,694 cases which were earlier found to be matched at office level were discovered to be false. Due opportunity has been given to such persons during the Family Tree hearing and as such their names are proposed for exclusion from Complete Draft NRC as per the provisions of Clause 4(3), 4(5) & 4(6) of the Citizenship Rules, 2003,"
"Similarly, 48,456 cases of married women who have submitted Panchayat certificates as a linkage document but were included in the Part Draft based on their office verification have not been found admissible in the re-verification process of hearing conducted for Gaon Panchayat Secretary Certificate verification as mandated by the Hon'ble Court. These married women were also issued notices and have appeared subsequent to their inclusion in the Part Draft for special verification conducted in respect of Gaon Panchayat Secretary Certificates. As such, 1.15 lakh persons already included in Part Draft have not been found admissible for inclusion during the verification process in the Complete Draft though were part of the Part Draft," stated Hajela in his report submitted to the Supreme Court on 29 June.
Explaining the "family tree mismatch" in respect of 65,694 applicants the state coordinator claimed that it was found during the family tree verification process that some persons had submitted legacy data codes but could not establish any relationship with the person whose legacy data they had used in the application.
That means the legacy data code submitted by such person actually belonged to other applicants who could establish themselves to be the true descendants of the legacy person while person included in the part draft failed to prove him/herself to be the real descendant.
Family tree verification is a system by which all legacy data submitted by all the applicants are examined to determine the genuine descendants. The 1951 NRC and all electoral rolls up to midnight of 24 March, 1971, are all digitised and collectively called as legacy data. Each entry in the legacy data is given a PNR type unique number called Legacy Data Code.
A computerised family tree is a software that generates all records of submitted data i.e. the details of all persons who have claimed to be children/grandchildren of the same legacy person against any legacy data code. Manual Family Tree is a form manually filled up by the applicants giving the names of the ancestor, and his/her grandchildren viz brothers, sisters or uncles, aunts etc. of the applicants. Both the computerised family tree and manual family tree details are matched to identify likely false claim for NRC name registration. All descendants who may be living in different places in the state are called to attend a single hearing held at a centrally located place. The genuine descendants identify the impostors in these hearings.
The family tree verification was designed to detect suspected misuse of legacy data code by any applicant. Citing an instance, he said, if in computerised family tree revealed details of four applicants claiming descendance from a single legacy person or a single ancestor (father, grandfather, grandmother etc.) but comparison with manual family tree statements reveals that three of the applicants who are actually brothers or sisters recognise each other as they are and the real descendants of the legacy person while they do not recognise the fourth person who has no link with them or the legacy person then, it is confirmed that the fourth person is an impostor and had submitted false claim of legacy data.
Sometimes, it can be the other way round and it turns out in the hearings that the three have ganged up together to deprive the fourth lone person who is the real descendant. As such, during the hearings that were held from February this year onwards, it was found that some persons who had already been included in the part draft were not the true descendants. The state coordinator, however, explained that all those 65,694 excluded due to family tree investigation would be able to appeal for reconsideration of their application or submit new documents for verification during the claims and objection after the publication of the complete draft.
When asked about the exclusion of 48,456 married women from the complete draft, who earlier were included in Part Draft, the NRC State Coordinator explains that at the time of publication of the part draft there was little time left for detail verification as directed by the Supreme Court on 5 December on the panchayat certificates submitted by married women.
Hence, based only on verification of authenticity by issuing authority and field verification results, names of some married women who had submitted such certificates were erroneously included by the field officers. However, the Supreme Court made it clear in the judgment dated 5 December 2017 that the certificates issued by the GP Secretary/Executive Magistrate will be acted upon only to establish a linkage between the holder of such certificate and the person(s) from whom a legacy is being claimed.
The apex court said in the judgement the certificate will be put to such limited use only if the contents of the certificate are found to be established on due and proper enquiry and verification.
"Thorough verification of the panchayat certificates submitted by married women could not be taken up before publication of part draft and some such applicants were inadvertently included in the part draft. Exhaustive verification as directed by the Supreme Court was started only in April this year and in respect of these women it has been found that the contents of the certificates submitted to claim that she is the daughter of the person whose legacy data has been used were not established during the verification and therefore their linkages were rejected," Hajela says.
However, after the publication of the complete draft, they would be able to appeal during claim and objection process for re-verification of the certificates or submit additional authentic documents that prove their eligibility.
The Clause 4(3), 4(5) and 4(6) of the Citizenship Rules, 2003 stipulate that for the purposes of preparation and inclusion in the NRC, the particulars collected of every family and individual shall be verified and scrutinised by the Local Registrar, every person shall be given opportunity of being heard before a final decision is taken to include or exclude their particulars in the National Register of Indian Citizens (NRC) and the draft of the Local Register of Indian Citizens shall be published, for inviting any objections or for inclusion of any name or corrections for the family or individual particulars collected and proposed to be finally entered in the NRC.
The apex court also approved the NRC state coordinator's proposal to inform these 1.5 lakh persons about the decision to exclude their name and they can file a claim for inclusion at the claim/objection stage. "Those applicants will be informed additionally through a Letter of Information (LOI). The LOI will have to be served to the rejected applicants within 7 days from publication of Complete Draft. The LOI will explicitly state that the applicant has the opportunity to file Claim for inclusion. The LOI will also inform about the time schedule and place of submission of the Claim," the proposal approved by the court added. It was also proposed and approved by the court that "there will be publication only of a list of inclusions. The list of those Rejected or put on Hold will not be published."
The NRC coordinator informed the Supreme Court that in addition to 1.15 lakh persons, the quality control exercise has also revealed errors in respect of 19,783 persons who were included in the Part Draft but are not eligible. Minimal increase in this number may happen till completion of data entry. "Such errors have been observed due to wrong data entry or error at the field level in contravention to the prescribed guidelines," Hajela said in his report and added that the exercise of NRC is being done by approximately 40,000 state government functionaries and outsourced data entry operators for the first time and given its complexities and magnitude, the scale/size of error is relatively small and have been detected in the quality control exercise for necessary corrections.
The division bench comprising of Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman also approved the “proposals contained in a, b, c and d of paragraph 18” submitted by Hajela in his report and directed the State Coordinator to act accordingly.” However, what contained in these proposals was not revealed in the court order.
Earlier on 22 June, the Gauhati High Court upheld a directive of the NRC state coordinator issued on 2 May to all deputy commissioners in which he had asked them to put on hold the inclusion of names of siblings and other family members of declared foreigners in the final draft. The high court dismissed a petition challenging the directive. The Assam government informed the State Assembly that altogether 90,206 foreigners had been identified since 1985 and 29,783 have been pushed back and 75 have been expelled over the past 33 years.
However, the declared foreigners also include those entering the state on or after 1 January 1966 but before 25 March 1971. This 1966-71 stream of foreigners is required, in accordance with the Assam Accord, to register themselves before the Foreigners Registration Regional Officer (FRRO) and they will have no voting rights for a period of ten years from the date of registration at the FRRO concerned. The NRC modalities say that names of only those registered with the FRRO will be included in the updated NRC.
The final draft will also exclude names of 1,25,333 ‘D' (doubtful/disputed) voters. They have been allowed to apply for inclusion of their names in the NRC currently being updated. The NRC modalities say that they would be included in the final list only after their names were cleared by the Foreigners' Tribunal concerned. In 1997 the Election Commission directed attaching the tag ‘D' against those voters who, allegedly failed to provide proof of Indian citizenship and they were barred from voting till their names were cleared by foreigners' tribunals.
All these indicate that NRC authorities' hands will be full even after publication of the final draft on 30 July with those excluded filing their fresh claims for inclusion of their names. The NRC authorities have informed the apex court that the Consolidation of central database and generation of PDFs of the NRC Draft for 3.29 crore applicants will be carried out from 21 July till 26 July and taking printouts of three copies of 22 lakh pages PDFs of the NRC final draft will be done from 23 July till 29 July.
Latest developments have triggered fresh speculation about the number of persons to be excluded from the final draft and how it is going impact the next Census 2021 in the state, the process of which has already begun. Language Data of 2011 published recently has revealed that while the percentage of Assamese, Bodo, Rabha and Santali speakers to the total population in the state have declined that of Bengali and Hindi speakers have increased.
The percentage of Assamese speakers in Assam declined to 48.38 in 2011 from 48.80 in 2001. The number of Bodo speakers declined to 4.53 percent in 2011 from 4.86 percent in 2001. The number of Rabha speakers have declined from 1,30,875 in 2001 to 101,752 in 2011 that of Santali speakers declined from 2,42,886 in 2001 to 2,13,139 in 2011 in the state. On the other hand, the percentage of Bengali speakers in the state increased to 28.91 in 2011 from 27.54 in 2001 and that of Hindi speakers increased to 6.73 percent in 2011 from 5.89 In 2001.
In 1991, the percentage of Assamese speakers in Assam was 57.81 percent and that of Bengali was 21.67 percent. The language data of 2011 coming just about a month ahead of publication of the final draft of the NRC has put the spotlight on the controversy over the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016 that seeks to grant citizenship to illegal migrants belonging to six non-Muslim communities Hindu, Sikhs,Parsis, Jains, Christians and Buddhists from Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Some organisations including the Assam Students' Union, which are opposed to the bill, have attributed the decline in Assamese speakers in the state to unabated influx of illegal migrants through the porous India-Bangladesh border and reiterated that if the bill is allowed to be passed then it would pose grave threat to identities and existence of Assamese and other indigenous language speakers.
The Assam unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the BJP-led coalition government headed by Sarbananda Sonowal announced that they would clarify their position on the bill after the publication of the final draft of the NRC. Apart from the data of the final NRC draft, the ruling party will now also have the language data in hand to articulate its position on the bill which is expected to be critical to its electoral prospects in the state in 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

A statement from Dave Barrett's family says the former NDP premier has died after a long struggle with Alzheimer's disease.
Barrett was elected eight times as a member of the B.C. legislature. He was B.C.'s first NDP premier when his government held power in the province for three-years in the seventies, 1972 to 1975.
He was also elected as a federal New Democrat MP in 1988 in the former Victoria-area riding of Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca.
Many of Barrett's reforms are still law, including the Agricultural Land Reserve, changes to B.C.'s liquor laws, and Pharmacare. Barrett's government passed a reported 357 bills, including public automobile insurance, and creating a provincewide ambulance service.
Barrett received the Order of Canada in 2005 and the Order of British Columbia in 2012.
In 2014, it was announced that Barrett had Alzheimer's disease and was living in a care facility in Victoria.

Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra's contract is soon to expire, but that will not happen anymore as the team confirmed that his contract had been extended. Erik Spoelstra has been serving as a Miami Heat assistant for years before he became a head coach, replacing Pat Riley at the beginning of 2008-09 seasons.
According to NBA, Miami team immediately responded to the media's query with regards to Spoelstra's contract. With no formal team announcement, Miami released a statement that his contract will run beyond this season.
During the Friday night's game against Boston Celtics which was held at TD Garden, Spoelstra express his gratitude to the owner Micky Arison and Heat President Pat Riley for extending his contract.

"I would like to thank the Arizona and Pat for their continued confidence in my staff and me, and their trust humbles me in me as head coach. It has been an incredible 22 years being part of the Miami Heat family, and we will look to continue our goal of winning NBA championships," Erik Spoelstra said in a statement on Friday.
According to Sun Sentinel, Erik Spoelstra is in his ninth season as an NBA head coach. He guided the team to four consecutive NBA finals from 2011 to 2014 and had celebrated with them the championships in 2012 and 2013. Spoelstra is considered as the NBA second-longest tenured coach.
Since the free-agency departure of LeBron James in 2014 offseason, the team has fallen harder. The heat failed to make some playoffs in 2015, advancing within one victory of the 2016 Eastern Conference finals. Now, the team is heading to the second lottery finish under Spoelstra's coaching career.
Erik Spoelstra has a great influence on the team which includes inputs on personnel decisions which was also written in his previous contract. Furthermore, he has learned to reshape his coaching staff with his four assistants.
Bronze in team event is pleasant surprise - head coach of Azerbaijani national team
2018-04-24 17:52 | www.trend.az | 2
Baku, Azerbaijan, April 24
By Anvar Mammadov – Trend:
Bronze medal in the team event was a pleasant surprise, head coach of the Azerbaijani national rhythmic gymnastics team Mariana Vasileva told Trend, commenting on the performances of Azerbaijani gymnasts at AGF Junior Trophy.
"I never expect concrete results. Yesterday as well, I didn't expect a medal. It was important for me that they would perform clearly. Especially since it is harder to perform at home - everyone expects a good result from a gymnast. So the bronze medal was a pleasant surprise," Vasileva said.
The head coach noted that the girls performed at the high level, although there was little time to prepare.
As the nation recovers from yesterday's tragic violence caused by pro-nazi and white supremacist rallies that took place in Charlottesville, Va., Twitter users have been mobilizing to identify the participants in the weekend's events.
Since early Sunday morning, the @YesYoureRacist account has been calling on Twitter users to identify participants in the rally.
If you recognize any of the Nazis marching in #Charlottesville, send me their names/profiles and I'll make them famous #GoodNightAltRight pic.twitter.com/2tA9xliFVU — Yes, You're Racist (@YesYoureRacist) August 12, 2017
Other accounts (like @shaunking of the NY Daily News) quickly took up the cause and within several hours one of the participants in the rallies had been fired by his employer.
Identifying participants in a public rally by name does not violate Twitter's terms of service (something Jason Del Rey noted in a Recode article earlier today) . Twitter only suspends accounts if the poster includes private information like a phone number, social security number, or home address.
The rallies in Charlottesville, which brought together an assortment of neo-nazi, white supremacist, and “alt-right” organizations to protest the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee ended in tragedy late Saturday afternoon when Heather Heyer, a resident of Charlottesville, Va., was struck and killed by a car driven by a participant in the white nationalist marches.
The police arrested James Alex Fields Jr., a resident of Maumee, Ohio, and charted him with second-degree murder for the attack.
The identification of participants in the white nationalist demonstrations have brought up the specter of doxing — when private information is released online to harass (or encourage the harassment of) a private citizen.
But, as Dave Weigel noted earlier today, the identification of participants in a public rally isn't doxing.
Attn trolls: It's not "doxxing" to identify people who appeared in public at a rally and have given media interviews about their beliefs. — Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) August 13, 2017
Weigel was referring to the identification of Peter Cvjetanovic, a University of Nevada, Reno, student who was identified by @YesYoureRacist and subsequently gave an interview to a local Reno television station.
This angry young man is Peter Cvjetanovic, a student at @unevadareno pic.twitter.com/7rLGJkcT3o — Yes, You're Racist (@YesYoureRacist) August 12, 2017
Cvetjnanovic participated in the protests, he said, because the removal of the statue was a symbol for “the slow replacement of white heritage within the United States and the people who fought and defended and built their homeland.”
Cvetjanovic also wanted people to know, “I'm not the angry racist they see in that photo.”
As the firing of Cole White indicates, the identification of participants in these protests has implications and not everyone online is comfortable with the outing of protestors (on both the right and the left).
It's also true that the Twitterati can make mistakes — which was the case when the conservative YouTube celebrity Joey Salads was accused of attending the rallies. Salads (not his real name) was actually vacationing in Jamaica.
Companies are well within their rights to fire people for their political beliefs, as this New York Times piece from 2015 outlines.
For private employees, who account for about 85 percent of the work force, the First Amendment's guarantee offers no protection from being fired for something you've said, either in the workplace or outside of it, as on social media. That's because the amendment addresses actions by the government to impede free speech, not by the private sector. And while federal laws bar employers from firing workers because of such variables as their race, religion and gender, there is no such protection for political affiliation or activity.
Even in states like New York and California, which have adopted laws that provide the most cover for political speech, people can be fired for expressing their views (in or out of the workplace).
As Times reporter Alina Tugend writes:
The broadest-based laws, such as those in California and New York, make it illegal to discriminate on the basis of an employees' political activity or beliefs in or out of work, Ms. Brantner said, unless such activity interferes with the functioning of the business.
Businesses can take a broad view on what kinds of activities interfere with the functioning of a business, and the law offers little protection.
It's that kind of legal backdrop that has made some commenters question the outing of the neo-nazi and white nationalist participants in the rallies in Charlotte.
The question seems to revolve around something that my colleague, Brian Heater, brought up earlier today.
The new generation of white nationalism seemingly does not see the need to hide behind hoods as their intellectual forebears may have done, because they do not think they will be held accountable for their views.
But there's no anonymity online these days, and anyone who acts in public can potentially face public scrutiny. The question is whether the people marching on a weekend are willing to have their views circulated in an office on Monday morning.

Many people may grow up falling in love with Disney princesses, but it is important to remember their lives really are just a fairytale.
They may have huge eyes and beautiful dresses, but their teeny-tiny waists are most definitely not achievable and should not be something to aspire to.
The reality that fairytales don't exist, and age, has hopefully taught us that as endearing as Disney princesses may be, they are just cartoons, and their qualities don't always translate into the real world.
But this fact hasn't stopped the latest worrying diet challenge from rearing its ugly head.
At its focus is Cinderella.
While Cinderella may have taught us "a dream is a wish your heart makes", her proportions could only belong in a fairytale, which makes the 'Cinderella weight challenge' all the more dangerous.
The challenge basically asks followers to reach a BMI of 18, which is officially classed as being underweight, the Mirror reports.
To calculate your 'Cinderella weight', you have to square your height in metres and then multiply that number by 18.
The trend is thought to have started in Japan and worryingly is quickly spreading.
Several people on Twitter have been sharing the worrying amount of weight they'd have to lose to complete the challenge.

(Updates prices, adds news from Mexico and Argentina) By Bruno Federowski São Paulo, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Latin American markets retreated on Friday after data showing U.S. job growth surged in January and wages increased, lifting expectations of faster U.S. interest rate hikes, which could dampen demand for risky emerging market assets. The robust employment report bolstered expectations of price pressures that could drive U.S. inflation back toward the official target. It underscored strong momentum in the economy, raising the possibility that the Federal Reserve could be a bit more aggressive in raising interest rates this year. The U.S. central bank has forecast three rate increases this year after raising borrowing costs three times in 2017. Higher U.S. rates could lessen demand for risky assets, which typically offer higher yields. That perception drove widespread profit-taking on emerging markets, which had undergone a sharp rally in the first month of the year. The currencies of Brazil, Mexico and Colombia fell between 0.13 percent and 1.59 percent. Also curbing demand for Brazilian assets were concerns over an unpopular bill cutting social security spending, which investors see as key to fueling long-term economic growth. "Local caution adds to risk aversion worldwide, bumping the dollar up against the Brazilian real," Spinelli brokerage trader José Amado said. Along with Argentina and Colombia, Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index led the losses among Latin American stock markets, weighed down by blue-chips such as lender Itaú Unibanco Holding SA and Banco Bradesco SA and miner Vale SA. Shares in Argentine power company Central Puerto SA CEPU.BA fell as much as 24 percent on the Buenos Aires stock exchange on Friday after the company's U.S. initial public offering priced below expectations. In Mexico, the central bank is expected to raise interest rates next week to a nine-year high in order to contain worries that inflation may not cool as fast as expected amid concerns the country's peso could be battered again this year. Banco de Mexico is expected to hike its key rate by 25 basis points to 7.50 percent, a level not seen since February 2009, according to 17 of 20 and analysts polled by Reuters. The move would follow a quarter-point hike in December.

The Oakland Raiders entered the 2017 season with high hopes, and rightfully so given a 12-4 campaign in 2016.
The wheels, however, came off as the Raiders struggled with consistency the past season, which included two four-game losing streaks en route to a 6-10 finish.
Nevertheless, the air of optimism has returned to the Raiders, and tight end Jared Cook attributes the feeling of a turnaround to Jon Gruden, who replaced Jack Del Rio.
"I think he definitely has guys buying in," Cook said of Gruden, via Michael Gehlken of the Las Vegas Review-Journal. "I mean, I bought in for sure because he knows what he's talking about, and you can tell a difference in a coach that knows what he's talking about and a coach that does not. He knows what he's talking about."
Cook's perspective offers intrigue when considering the 2017 season was his first with the Raiders and Del Rio, but the tight end isn't alone in rallying behind Gruden.
Quarterback Derek Carr praised Gruden's energy and the coach's message to the team to forget what happened the previous season.
"He said to hit the reset button," Carr said, "and then we have hopefully 10-plus years to, 'Let's just ride and figure this thing out, grow every year and do this thing.' When a coach comes in and does that for everybody, not just me but for everybody, that weight is lifted off. It's like, 'OK, that's done. Whatever that was [in 2017], let's just move forward. Let's just have fun together and work hard.'"
Throughout the offseason, the Raiders made numerous personnel changes to the roster, including bringing in established veterans such as wide receiver Jordy Nelson and linebacker Derrick Johnson.
But the team's key to success in what should be a wide-open AFC West falls on Gruden's sales pitch to the players.
While there remains plenty of time before the regular season kicks off in September, the Raiders have clearly bought what Gruden is selling.

Michael Woods says it is time for Hartlepool United's players to look themselves in the mirror.
Pools lost for the fourth time in five matches on Saturday when they were hammered 4-0 at Dover Athletic to slip from 13th to 14th in the National League table.
Two shoddy pieces of defending saw Mitch Pinnock help himself to a first-half brace at the Crabble Athletic Ground to give Pools a mountain to climb.
And two late close-range Ryan Bird finishes saw the Kent club come away with a flattering winning margin.
Angry Pools fans chanted “you're not fit to wear the shirt” before the end and Woods admitted that the players had let them and their manager and club down again.
“The fans are always brilliant,” said the midfielder.
“They deserve better, we keep saying it but there's been enough talking done.
“As players, we get everything handed to us on a plate, the staff couldn't do any more for us.
“It's come to the point where we, as players, take responsibility.
“At the minute can anyone look himself in the mirror and say ‘am I doing enough?'.
“Probably not. That's got to change.
“The gaffer stands up for the players, but it's about time we took responsibility.”
Pools put in the sort of performance that gets their manager the sack.
There was a lot of attacking play, with Pools winning 11 corners to Dover's three while the possession ratio, while not recorded must have been colossal.
However, Craig Harrison's team could not do their primary tasks of scoring or defending.
“I can't remember the last worldy into the top corner we've conceded,” said the ex-Chelsea midfielder.
“The goals we are leaking are just gifts
“It's the same in every line of work, if you are not doing your job properly then you'll find yourself out of one.
“There's got to be more quality as a team, we're getting into some great areas, we got in a couple of times and you are thinking it is harder to miss the target than hit it
“That sums it up for me.
“For the best part of 35 to 40 minutes after the break, we've not left their half and yet we've conceded two more goals.
Woods says Pools must get “back to basics” and not just start defending better but improving all over the park.
Pools have had the lion's share of the last three matches only to lose them all with an aggregate score of 9-1.
“We have to go back to basics,” the 27-year-old told SportMail.
“We have to defend better, That's not me standing here having a dig at the back four, it's about us defending better as a team.
“We all have to do better, we have to offer more protection to the lads at the back, the forwards have to look after the ball better.
“It's everyone.”
Pools take a break from the league this Saturday when they travel to Workington in the FA Trophy, a match which has now taken on greater importance.
“For sure we need a response,” he said. “We all have to stick together.
“We're all in this together, there's no point any individuals going off on their own.
“We've shown, in patches, we can be a very good side and it's about time we started looking like one.”
Woods denied that it was better to have a cup tie next rather than another National League match.
“Not really to be honest,” he added.
“After that it doesn't really matter who you play, we really could have done with a game tomorrow night rather than this lingering all week.
“I'm sure we'll be in every day, working as hard as we can.”
Craig Harrison has today appealed against Nicky Deverdics' sending off at Dover Athletic.
Hartlepool United cannot afford to lose their left-back for three matches while Deverdics requires justice after an unjust stain on a flawless disciplinary record.
Referee Richard Hulme dismissed the 30-year-old for what he ruled as an elbow on defender Connor Essam just over a minute from time of the 4-0 thumping at the Crabble Athletic Ground.
The two former Dover team-mates collided around 25 yards from the Athletic goal in a challenge for the ball.
Deverdics has inadvertently ‘clothes-lined' his old friend when putting out his arm, but footage shows it is not an elbow.
The Geordie, who has never been sent off in his career, debated the decision with Mr Hulme who he will now hope will review the incident.
Pools today put out the following statement:
“The club has been in touch with the Football Association on Monday morning to advise that we will lodge an appeal against Nicky Deverdics' sending-off at Dover Athletic.
“Deverdics was shown a red card in the 89th minute of the contest at Crabble Athletic Ground on Saturday for an alleged elbow on Whites defender Connor Essam.
“However, having studied footage of the incident, the Club feels there is sufficient grounds for an appeal and has now notified the relevant authorities.”
Boss Harrison said: “In real time in no way was it a sending off.
“I think it has been misinterpreted, mis-read by the referee I really do.
“I understand it happens that quickly and referees and their assistants have a tough job to do.
“I thought it was going to be a free-kick to us.
“It looked like Devs had got his body between the man and the ball and their lad has come through him.
“That was my assessment of it.
“At no point did I think a): it was going to be anything but a free-kick to us and b). there was going to be a red card coming out of it.”
It was untidy on the part of the player, but it looked a free-kick and yellow card, at worst.
Pools can ill afford to lose Deverdics for three matches given he is one of the players who are actually performing at his potential at the moment.
As things stand, he would miss Saturday's FA Trophy trip to Workington and the National League matches against Maidenhead (H) and Gateshead (A).
“Devs been one of our better players, without a shadow of a doubt,” said Harrison.
“We need as many senior players and consistent players as we can in our squad.
“He'll be a huge miss if he's out for three games.”
VIENNA (Reuters) - Iran will help shed light on the case of one of its Vienna-based diplomats who was arrested in Germany over a suspected plot to carry out a bomb attack on an exiled Iranian opposition group, Austria said on Wednesday.

The case cast a shadow over Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's visit to Austria on Wednesday at which both sides discussed issues including salvaging the Iran nuclear deal after the U.S. decision to withdraw and reinstate sanctions on Tehran.
“We expect full clarification in connection with this and I thank you, Mr President, for assuring us that you will support this clarification,” Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said in a statement to reporters after meeting Rouhani.
Rouhani did not mention the diplomat in his remarks and the two leaders took no questions.
Austria summoned Iran's ambassador over the case on Monday and said it was stripping the arrested Iranian of his diplomatic status.
Belgian authorities identified the diplomat as 46-year-old Assadollah A and said he is suspected of having been in contact with two people arrested in Belgium with 500 grams of the homemade explosive TATP and a detonation device in their car.
Their alleged target was a rally near Paris last weekend of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) - an umbrella organisation of opposition groups in exile that seek an end to Shi'ite Muslim clerical rule in Iran.
Belgium also issued a European arrest warrant for a man of Iranian origin being held in France suspected of being involved in the alleged plot, a French judicial source said.
U.S. President Donald Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani as well as former European and Arab ministers attended the NCRI meeting.
The NCRI held a small protest against Rouhani's visit on the edge of the area of central Vienna that police sealed off.
Foreign ministers from the remaining signatories to the 2015 nuclear deal - Iran, France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China - meet in Vienna on Friday to discuss salvaging the accord.
European powers are putting together an economic package aimed at safeguarding the deal by shielding Iran from some of the impact of U.S. sanctions resuming. Rouhani has said Iran will stay in the accord if its interests are preserved.
An Iranian official said Rouhani was also due to meet the head of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which is policing the restrictions the deal places on Iran's atomic activities in exchange for sanctions relief.
Rouhani's one-day visit to Austria followed a longer trip that was planned two years ago but which he cancelled at the last minute on unspecified security grounds.

Plans to build a bus depot for Easton and Redding school buses on land behind Samuel Staples Elementary School have reached an impasse.
“Right now, the whole thing sits in limbo,” Easton Board of Education Chairman Jeffrey Parker said.
Parker explained the new developments to school board members at their Sept. 12 meeting.
He said it's his impression that “Redding thinks it's a Board of Education issue, not a town issue.”
In other words, decisions about the terms and conditions of the proposed site should be made by the Easton, Redding and ER9 boards of education and not the towns, he said.
The process of choosing a bus depot site began more than a year ago when the landowner of the existing school bus facility in Bethel told officials that the property was on the market and lease couldn't be extended. The facility was set to close in June 2018.
Dattco, the bus company that serves Easton, Redding and Region 9 schools, told town officials there were no other sites available, Parker said.
“That's when the Easton board thought it would be prudent to look for a site,” he said. “If a site was agreed to in Easton or Redding, it would take the burden off Dattco. It's Dattco's responsibility to find a place for the buses.”
After considering several locations in Easton, officials had pretty much settled on the Staples site. Redding officials said that town has no place for a depot.
Easton was reluctantly willing to use town-owned land near Staples and incur the $397,000 cost of building a parking lot for 48 buses and 60 cars and a small building for the dispatcher and bus drivers.
Redding would pay Easton rent, which would offset the cost of building the depot over a period of time.
As part of the agreement, Redding's rent would be no more than what they paid in Bethel, Parker said, and “once they covered the $397,000, we would offer them a discount on rent going forward.”
Contract extension
The urgency of housing the buses eased somewhat in June when the Bethel landowner told officials he'd be willing to extend the contract through June 2019.
“He'd charge us a 2% rent increase which Dattco would absorb,” Parker said.
As plans for the Staples site moved forward, a site plan was drawn up out and costs were confirmed, Parker said. “We're all ready to go. If there had been an agreement between Easton and Redding, construction of this [depot] would already have been underway.”
Parker said he learned about Redding's shift in thinking at a discussion this past June among officials from both towns.
The purpose of the gathering was to update people and “bring interested parties together,” he said.
“Coming out of the meeting, the general sense was that the Town of Redding felt this should be decided by the boards of education and not the towns. Now that the town of Redding has no interest in the deal, it falls back on the boards of education.”
Benefits of Easton site noted
Easton officials have often emphasized the benefits of housing the buses in Easton. The plan would create a revenue stream, since Redding would pay rent, and Easton would no longer pay rent to Bethel. In addition, Easton would save an estimated $70,000 a year in labor and gasoline costs, based on shorter travel times and distances, officials said.
The current cost to rent a bus depot in Bethel is $179,000 annually, while the cost to run an in-house depot will be about $43,000.
Housing the buses in Easton would give the town control over transportation costs, and the town wouldn't be subject to the whims of another town.
“We'd be in control of our own destiny,” Parker said.
But now, things have changed.
“If Easton wouldn't get the plusses, why would we have any interest in doing it?” Parker asked. “Now we're left to work it out between the boards of education. It complicates it. I don't know if Easton is interested in housing the buses.”
He said it would be challenging to come up with agreements about rent or other issues if three school boards had to reach a consensus.
Dattco would need to come to Easton and work out contract issues and report back to the three boards that would vote on it, he said.
Parker posed a hypothetical question to school board members.
“Would Easton want to work with boards of education where the membership turns over or would they rather work with a town entity? Easton would like it to be the towns, Redding would like it to be boards of education.”
He said the next step would be for the Easton, Redding and Region 9 Transportation Committee to “meet and discuss the options.”
The committee would then make a recommendation to the three separate boards of education.
Transportation Committee Chairman Paul Coppinger “has been encouraged to call a meeting,” Parker said.
Easton school board member Randy Hicks didn't mince words during the bus depot discussion.
“This is nuts,” Hicks said.
It's incorrect to say it's a board of education decision, Hicks said later.
“Ultimately, Dattco needs to find a home for these buses,” he said. “Get the board of education out of this. Have the Town of Easton negotiate directly with Dattco, as can the town of Redding. It's not the board of education's responsibility to dictate to Dattco where to put the buses.”
Hicks reiterated the benefits of housing the buses at the Staples School site, including generating revenue for the town and saving money by cutting down on fuel costs.
“There's no easy solution, but the best solution is available,” he said.
Coppinger, chairman of the transportation committee, couldn't be reached for comment.

The Luxembourg Euro Meet is revving up for its 19th edition from the 27th-29th of January, 2017. Hosted at the 10-lane, 50 meters Piscine D'Coque Aquatic Center in the heart of Luxembourg City, the Euro Meet is an elite international event that has attracted swimming stars from around the world since 1999. Thus far, the 2017 competition has already confirmed the attendance of Olympians Adam Peaty, Camille Lacourt, Marco Koch and Laszlo Cseh, with more to follow.
Euro Meet 2016: Interview with SC Eschborn (Germany) from Swimspire on Vimeo.
The Euro Meet does not merely display the performances of the world-class swimmers, however. One of the unique aspects of this competition lies in the fact that these elite-level athletes will share the pool deck with Junior and Youth age group categories, a feature introduced by Euro Meet founder Nory Kruchten. Although these swimmers may be as young as 13, the strict time standards of the meet ensure that any junior swimmers participating are still the best of the best in their own age rankings.
Euro Meet 2016: Interview with Team Energy Standard from Swimspire on Vimeo.
Offering a fast 50-meter venue, the Euro Meet offers the added bonus of over €20,000 in prize money, awarded to the top 3 male and female swimmers in each Open category race. The top 3 male and female swimmers in each race for the Junior and Youth categories are awarded custom-made medals. Prize money is also awarded for Meet, European and World records, and to the top 3 teams at the competition.
Euro Meet 2016 – Interview with Coach Ingolf Bender, Luxembourg National Team from Swimspire on Vimeo.
Now in its 19th year, the Euro Meet has achieved a distinctly global reach while still preserving its European and Luxembourgish roots. It attracts over 700 swimmers from 25 nations each year, who are drawn to the competition for its top-notch organization, welcoming atmosphere, high-level racing, and three-day championship format. The state of the art 10-lane, 50-meter pool with an additional 6-lane 50 meter pool for training and warmup purposes, and spectator seating for 650 people, is another clear draw. Russian-Ukrainian team Energy Standard's team manager Ksenia Getmanskaya enthused, “….the organization is very high-level and we are very pleased to come to the Euro Meet every year!” Adds Hungarian elite coach Ivan Petrov, “I think this is the best competition in Europe. The pool is very fast, the three-day format is thoughtful, and the organization is extremely good.”
Euro Meet 2016: Interview with Jessica and Sandra Steiger (VFL Gladbeck, Germany) from Swimspire on Vimeo.
The growing popularity of the Euro Meet has helped fulfill the main dream of founder Nory Kruchten, immediate past president of LEN and Honorary Member of FINA, for the competition: “…[M]y dream in 1999, shared by a few friends on the Luxembourg Swimming Federation, was to attract as many swimmers and achieve as many top performances as possible in our beautiful pool in the Kirchberg District of Luxembourg City.” Adds Euro Meet Director Gil Kandel, “…the Euro Meet has two main goals: First, to host an international swimming event in Luxembourg that will promote swimming and the Luxembourg Swimming Federation to a wider international audience. And second, to give the Luxembourg swimmers the opportunity to compete against world class swimmers in front of their home crowd and in a pool that they know well.”
Euro Meet 2016 Interview with Christian Hansmann from Swimspire on Vimeo.
Such an incredible competition requires an extensive organizing team, and the committee and volunteers working behind the scenes each year help produce a masterpiece of a competition that offers a timely and fast event with a simultaneously warm and friendly welcome to all who attend. Luxembourg Swimming Federation President Marco Stacchiotti, meet director Gil Kandel, and meet manager Christian Hansmann headed the organization, supported by the Luxembourg Swimming Federation members and volunteers from around the country. The Euro Meet even extends its international atmosphere to the organizing committee, with press officer Georges Kiehl, who hails from France, managing the media aspects of the Euro Meet, while Finnish speaker Jussi Salminen serves as the speaker, infusing the competition with dynamism and enthusiasm. Jacky Ribeiro of Megatek France manages the electronic timing and scoreboard provided during the competition, and several of the FINA-listed officials are also internationally-based. Behind the principal members of the organizing committee stands an army of sponsors, such as Cactus Supermarkets, SEO, Loterie Nationale and Baloîse Assurances, as well as staff, and volunteers, each playing their own key role in making the Euro Meet a successful event. We were genuinely impressed by the coordination between all of the groups during the competition, attesting to the professionalism of the organizing committee and their love for the Euro Meet.
Euro Meet 2016 Interview with Marco Stacchiotti and Gil Kandel from Swimspire on Vimeo.
A high-quality organization, record-breaking performances, and a unique mission all come together to make the Euro Meet an event that is not to be missed this January, whether as a swimmer or as a spectator. FLNS President and LEN bureau member Marco Stacchiotti, Meet Director Gil Kandel, and the entire Euro Meet organizing committee are looking forward to welcoming all participants, teams, and spectators to the Piscine d'Coque from January 27th-29th, 2017! Registration ends on January 16th, so there is still time to enter the meet. For more information and to register, please check out the website at www.euromeet.lu
See you there!

Hector Tarango was lost, finding little purpose in life.
After a medical discharge from the Army following a series of ailments, including a ruptured Achilles tendon, he had developed post-traumatic stress disorder. His personal life was a mess.
My deployment money was gone, my son was gone and my wife remarried. It was ugly after my three deployments, he says. I gave up.
Then three people and one vocation turned around Tarangos existence.

His son, Joseph, re-entered his life. His friend Henry Rodriguez, whom Tarango calls my brother, alerted him to Battlefields to Ballfields, an organization that gets veterans involved in officiating.
And Mike Pereira, the former NFL head of officiating and current Fox football analyst who founded Battlefields to Ballfields a year ago, took Tarango under his wing.
Now, the 37-year-old Tarango not only is a football official, hes branched out into basketball.
I played sports and football, but I didnt know the rules, Tarango says. A lot of people watch football and think they know the rules, but they dont.
Henry told me Mike Pereira ran it and I had no idea who Mike was. I wasnt interested in it (originally), but I did some research and said, Yeah, Ill do it. I had never blown a whistle before.
Like more than 100 other former military members, Tarango regularly blows whistles now, working youth and high school games in California. Pereira launched his organization last year hoping to reach the century mark at some point in its buildup. Hes gone well past that number, and many of the vets have stories similar to Tarangos.
Battlefields to Ballfields funds the veterans through scholarships as they get involved in officiating. Pereira works with officiating groups across the country to get the veterans onto the fields and courts once they have learned their craft.
One of the hurdles when you start to officiate is the cost of starting: dues and registration fees and uniforms, he says. Its expensive, especially based on what you make per game.
Its also rewarding, not only for the former military members but for the officiating realm.
Theyve got the characteristics you need to officiate, Pereira says. The courage is a huge part, not being intimidated by any players, coaches or spectators. The whole notion of teamwork; they had to be part of a team before, and as officials you are part of a team as well.
The confidence, of course, to be able to do a job and do it well. And the stick-to-itiveness.
Its amazing to watch them learn, they learn so quickly because they have had to follow orders. Its hard  we all know officiating is hard  and it will take them a while. But they have all it takes to be successful and now all they need is repetitions.
My goal is to get them to stay with it.
That goal apparently has been reached with Tarango. He did Pop Warner football games on weekends and junior varsity contests on Thursdays, averaging perhaps four games a week. Hes doing the same with basketball, and doesnt sound averse to trying other sports.
I get to put a uniform on and I like wearing a uniform, he says with a chuckle. It gets me out of the house. It is fulfilling.
At first it was real hard. Theres that brotherhood, though. Im not saying it works for everybody, but it works for me. Reffing makes me part of the game and a part of something.
Thats the idea. Pereiras group has officials working a variety of sports, including wrestling, track and field, lacrosse, soccer, even one ice hockey official. Of the first 100 recruits to B2B, eight already were doing a second sport within a year.
Battlefields to Ballfields is looking for mentors among veterans who already have experience in officiating, and Pereira believes many of his recent signees have the ability to teach.
These guys and women make a good little extra income and theyre getting out and working with kids, Pereira says. We all talk about how we want to serve again in some way, and they feel like a part of the community.
Its the most fulfilling thing I have ever done.
Mon, Mar 19: Federal leaders are touring the country to hear from people that have been directly affected by human trafficking. Jeremy Keefe has details from day one.
The illegal dumpsite in the hills above the intersection of Highway 97 and the Okanagan Connector in Peachland is truly disgusting for its sheer area and volume of household junk, assorted garbage and general debris.
“It's absolutely horrifying,” says nearby resident Patricia Ryder who hiked the area with her mother as a child. “To think somebody would go to a beautiful spot like that and then just dump disgusting rubbish. Well out of sight of the highway so nobody could see what they were doing.”
The dump site was discovered in October when the Peachland Fire Department responded to a small blaze in the area.
“I've worked here for seven years and I think it's one of the worst ones I've seen,” says regional district waste reduction facilitator Cynthia Coates.
Plans to clean up the mess last fall were derailed by snowy weather. Now the initiative is back on track.
“We have the Okanagan Forest Task Force, an amazing volunteer group in town that tackles illegal dumping, they're going to be on site,” says Coates. “We're looking for additional volunteer groups. We're going to make a morning of it and see what we can get done. If we have to address it another day, then we'll do that.”
They've got their work cut out for them.
“We've planned for four, 40-yard dumpsters. Could be more for sure,” says Coates.
The cleanup is set for May 5th.
“I'd like to see the rubbish gone and I'd also like to see the people apprehended who have been dumping up there,” says Ryder.
After the garbage is hauled away the regional district will ask the property owner, the provincial government, to lock an access road gate to keep the thoughtless dumpers away.

A national charity is calling on people in Hartlepool and East Durham to take care around water – and seek safety training if needs be.
The plea comes from the Sea Cadets, which is concerned about the number of people who lose their lives when swimming or playing in water.
Tye Shuttleworth, the Sea Cadets' head of inshore boating, said: “Now that the school holidays are well under way, we are urging people to stay safe as we launch our Water Savvy campaign.
“More than 300 people drowned in the UK last year, and more suffered life-changing injuries through near-drowning.
“But many of these tragic incidents could be avoided through good knowledge of water safety.”
Sea Cadets' Water Savvy campaign highlights the importance of staying safe in, on and around the water, and making others aware of the dangers.
“We offer water-based adventure to 14,000 young people, aged 10 to 18, across the country who – along with our 9,000 volunteers – undergo specialist water-safety training,” added Tye.
“But we want to spread the message further.
“There are a number of things you can do to ensure you, your family and your friends stay safe.
“When swimming in open water, stay close to the shore, make sure you are appropriately dressed, and let someone know where you're going.
“If you fall in accidentally, cold water shock can be deadly and it's vital you do not swim or try to get out.
“Instead, focus on floating and keeping your airway above the water.”

The Sea Cadets is a national youth charity with 400 units across the UK.
Established in 1856 the Sea Cadets was created by communities wanting to give young people instruction on a naval theme.
Traditionally old seafarers provided training.
It's third-and-4. Ben Roethlisberger lines up at his own 36-yard-line with 1:08 left in the fourth quarter Sunday night at Heinz Field. The Pittsburgh Steelers trail division rival Baltimore Ravens by two points.
The world knew where the football was going: Antonio Brown.
"I just trust and believe in him," Roethlisberger said of Brown after the game. "Our chemistry is something pretty special. I know some people out there say I abandon my reads and go right to A.B. It's not always true, but sometimes, who wouldn't?"
Big Ben nailed Brown with a beautiful sideline toss in stride for 34 yards, setting up a game-winning field goal by Chris Boswell.
The Ravens have seen Brown blast them before. A year ago, his "Immaculate Extension" reach across the goal-line clinched the AFC North for Pittsburgh. His play Sunday night earned Mike Tomlin's team more shirts and hats.
Brown was unstoppable, corralling 11 passes for 213 yards. His 99 receptions on the season are 11 more than DeAndre Hopkins. Brown's 1,509 receiving yards also leads Hopkins by a whopping 276.
Sunday marked Brown's fifth game this season with 150-plus receiving yards, tied for most in the Super Bowl era. Brown joined Calvin Johnson (2012) as the only players to amass 1,500-plus receiving yards in the first 13 games of a season (Johnson set the single-season record in 2012 1,964 rec yards).
Business for Brown is indeed boomin'.
A.B. is on pace for 1,857 receiving yards this season, which would be the third-most for a single season in NFL history. His pace would also make him the first player in NFL history to have multiple seasons with 1,800-plus receiving yards (1,834 receiving yards in 2015).
Brown's otherworldly play has thrust him into the MVP discussion, behind only Tom Brady at this point.
His Steelers teammates know they're watching something special:
"He's the best in the world," center Maurkice Pouncey said, via the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
"He's on a different level," guard David DeCastro said. "It looks like he's playing a video game."
"They know they're watching him, but they can't stop him," receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey said. "He barely practices all week and he goes out and gets the job done. That's a true pro."
If Big Ben needs a play during next week's ginormous battle against Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, you'll know exactly where the ball is going to go.
"We really want to work with our owners to accelerate the pace of renovations and the quality of the restaurant image in Canada," Swartz said.
"We're really encouraged by the initial results that we've had, both quantitative and qualitative, in testing with our guests."
RBI's previously-announced $700-million renovation plan to spruce up its restaurants is one of the factors in its feud with GWNFA, which claims to represent more than half of all the franchisees.
The franchisees say that the company has effectively changed the rent and royalty structure by saddling franchisees with increasing costs and requiring them to renovate stores at their own expense.
The dissident franchisee group was quick to point out it believed the plan was ill-conceived and would cost individual restaurant owners about $450,000.
During the conference call, however, Swartz said "we have managed to increase average franchise profitability in Canada by a significant amount since we first acquired Tim Hortons."
The company, which keeps its books in U.S. dollars, earned $147.8 million or 59 cents per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31. That compared with a profit of $50.2 million or 21 cents per diluted share a year ago. Revenue totalled $1.25 billion, up from $1 billion in the same quarter last year.
On an adjusted basis, Restaurant Brands, which also owns Burger King and Popeyes, says it earned 66 cents per share for the quarter, up from 36 cents per share a year ago.
Analysts on average had expected a profit of 56 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters.
In the past, we have seen a few electric cars being discounted significantly on top of EV incentives, but there seems to be a new wave of them lately.
It appears to coincide with the next-generation of EVs coming to market which represents a more important step up than previous generations.
With more range and features for a lower price, electric vehicles like the Tesla Model 3, Chevy Bolt EV, and the next-gen Nissan Leaf are changing people's expectations of electric cars.

This Sprint deal seems too good to be true, but it isn't.
We often tease Sprint for its desperate attempts at getting customers on other networks to switch over, but this latest deal is a doozy, and well worth investigating.
Until June 30, 2017, customers on T-Mobile, AT&T, or (especially) Verizon get up to five lines of free unlimited service by switching over to Sprint. There are a few caveats, which we'll get to in a moment, but as long as you're a new Sprint customer, the deal is very enticing. The service is not some limited version of Sprint's regular unlimited plan, either: up to five lines get Sprint's full unlimited package, which includes calls, texts and up to 23GB of high-speed 4G LTE (and unlimited data at slower speeds after that) just by switching over.
Sprint claims that customers bringing five lines over can save over $2000 in the first year if switching from Verizon.
Now here are the caveats:
The offer is open to new customers only.
After the first year, which technically ends July 31, 2018, service will cost $60 for the first line, $40 for the second, and $30 for each subsequent one.
The offer is only open to customers bringing their own unlocked, eligible phones . These include devices like the Google Pixel, Nexus 6P, Moto G5 Plus, iPhone 7, and Galaxy S8. Check out the full list.
. You will have to buy SIM cards through Sprint for $2.99 each and activate them on the company's online portal.
Along with the unlimited calls, text and data, users get 10GB of hotspot data per line and HD video streaming at 1080p.
So while there are a few hoops to jump through, it's definitely worth pursuing for the insane level of savings. If Sprint has even decent LTE service in your area, you can't beat this kind of deal.

WASHINGTON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department said in a report submitted to Congress that expanding sanctions on Russia to include new sovereign debt would have “negative spillover effects” on global financial markets and businesses, Bloomberg reported on Friday.
“Given the size of Russia's economy, its interconnectedness and prevalence in global asset markets, and the likely over-compliance by global firms to U.S. sanctions, the magnitude and scope of consequences from expanding sanctions to sovereign debt and derivatives is uncertain and the effects could be borne by both the Russian Federation and U.S. investors and businesses,” said the report, which was submitted to Congress on Monday.
Bloomberg said investors interpreted the report to mean the United States was unlikely to sanction debt markets despite pressure from Congress for more action to punish Russia for its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Sanctions against sovereign debt, the report said, could put downward pressure on Russian economic growth, increase the strain on the banking sector and “lead to Russian retaliation against U.S. interests,” according to Bloomberg.
The report also warned that sanctions on sovereign debt could affect the “competitiveness of large U.S. asset managers,” Bloomberg said.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration on Tuesday published a list of 210 Russians, including 96 so-called oligarchs worth $1 billion or more, as required under a sanctions law passed by Congress, but it did not immediately impose any new penalties on them.
The failure to impose any new sanctions drew criticism from Democrats, but Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told lawmakers at a hearing on Tuesday that new sanctions would eventually be levied on Russia in response to Moscow's interference in the U.S. election.

A man has been caught on camera making what appears to be a 'dead drop' on one of Bristol's busiest streets.
What appears to be a covert exchange took place while a Bristol Post crew were shooting background footage for a video about Stokes Croft.
Our cameraman was at the junction with Ashley Road filming when he saw the man cross Stokes Croft, retrieve something hidden behind a traffic light, and then re-cross the street.
The man, who is wearing a dark hooded top, can then clearly be seen putting another object up behind the traffic light with his other hand.
The object he retrieves is not entirely clear – it looks small, square and white - or it could be reflective and catching the light.
He can then be seen putting something else back up behind the traffic light, but this object is hidden by his hand.
Reporters viewing the footage speculated that the lamp post could be a dead drop: a method often employed by drug traffickers and spy agencies, in which two people pass items between them at a prearranged place without having to meet in person.
One person will hide an item at an agreed location, in this case behind the traffic light, then the other will come along later and collect it.
In this case the man seems to put something else back behind the traffic light for someone else to collect later.
Dead drops in public places are often used by drug dealers because it is safer than keeping illegal drugs in a house. If the stash is ever found by the police, there is nothing to tie it to any particular individual.
Have you seen anybody using this dead drop on Stokes Croft? Do you know what it is used for? Have you seen one in use elsewhere in the city? Contact the Bristol Post at joe.smith@localworld.co.uk
Major League Baseball will hold its first Players Weekend late this summer, an event that will allow athletes to showcase their personalities through minimal uniform restrictions, Yahoo Sports reported Wednesday.
The event was negotiated between the league and the players' union and is being planned for Aug. 25-27, according to a memo obtained by Yahoo Sports.
As part of the weekend, a player will be allowed to put one nickname on the back of his jersey, as long as it's not "inappropriate or offensive."
There will be loose color restrictions on things such as cleats, batting gloves and catcher's masks, with the memo saying, according to Yahoo, that the colors only "must avoid interfering with the game and an umpire's ability to make a call. White gloves, wristbands and sleeves are prohibited."
Lastly, players will be able to pay tribute to a person or organization "instrumental to his development" by writing that person's or organization's name on a patch on his jersey during the planned weekend, the memo obtained by Yahoo said.
The jerseys will be sold by MLB, with proceeds going to the Youth Development Foundation, Yahoo reported.
“The taxes were raised at the turn of the year, and so there may have been some stocking up in December, which in turn may have decreased early-year sales in the statistics,” she says to Uusi Suomi.
Pia Mäkelä, a research professor at the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), reminds that it is still premature to draw any conclusions on the effects of the newly adopted alcohol laws based on consumption statistics from the first three months of the year.
The National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health (Valvira) on Thursday published the first set of alcohol consumption statistics following the adoption of the new alcohol laws on 1 January 2018. The statistics indicate that the volume of alcohol sales fell by 0.9 per cent year-on-year but also that, when converted to litres of absolute alcohol, the sales crept up by 0.7 per cent.
The statistics have been interpreted as confirmation that the new alcohol laws have driven alcohol consumption towards stronger beverages. They have also provoked questions about concerns that de-regulating the sales of alcoholic beverages would result in a considerable up-tick in alcohol consumption: THL, for example, initially predicted that the de-regulation would result in a six per cent increase in consumption.
Mäkelä dashed cold water on efforts to evaluate the effects of the alcohol law reform already in April. She pointed out in her blog that the introduction of stronger alcoholic beverages to the shelves of grocery shops has not resulted in the 40 per cent drop in their prices that was forecast by the retail sector.
“Retailers have said in interviews throughout the spring that the prices will change and settle probably in the summer,” she reminded.
The statistics also show that the sales of long drinks surged by 48 per cent year-on-year between January and March. Mäkelä estimated that the substantial increase may be a result of the fact that long drinks have been perhaps the most marketed and talked-about alcoholic beverage during the reform process.
“We don't know yet if the same sales promotion efforts will be expanded to other product categories,” she reminded.
The de-regulation, she underscored, will begin to have an impact on alcohol consumption gradually. The government, for example, has proposed that the effects be evaluated three years after the implementation.

Rob Gronkowski isn't leaving the gridiron for the big screen, the squared circle or the dirt-bike track.
Gronkowski will return to the Patriots for a ninth season in 2018, the All-Pro tight end announced via Instagram on Thursday.
"I met with coach today and informed him I will be back for the 2018 season with the Pats," Gronkowski wrote. "I have been working out, staying in shape and feel great. Looking forward to another championship run."
Coach Bill Belichick must have been pleased with the meeting, as agent Drew Rosenhaus told ESPN that "it was very positive and Rob is committed."
Retirement speculation has swirled around Gronkowski since he vowed to "sit down" and contemplate his future in the wake of New England's Super Bowl LII downfall.
While Gronkowski remained silent on his 2018 plans, rumors surfaced suggesting he would consider leaving football for a career as a big-screen action hero or professional wrestler.
After skipping voluntary workouts last week, Gronkowski added fuel to the fire with a bizarre promotional news conference that cited dirt-biking as the reason for his continued absence.
Although Gronkowski is not yet 30 years old, his body has been ravaged by a litany of injuries that now includes a late-season concussion on top of multiple surgeries to his back, knee and forearm. It's natural that he would take time to weigh the positives and negatives of another season absorbing blows from other behemoths.
The primary motivation for his offseason behavior, however, might be financial.
NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Monday that Gronkowski's attitude toward the team's offseason conditioning program stems from his desire for a new contract.
"He is going to play for the Patriots," Rapoport explained on Tuesday's edition of NFL Total Access. "The only question is what is his salary going to be. I would expect that Gronkowski and the team are going to discuss that."
In the weeks following Super Bowl LII, New England's loss was compounded by the doubts affixed to Gronkowski, quarterback Tom Brady and offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels.
Now that the all-important offensive trio is officially onboard for another run at the Lombardi Trophy, the healing can begin.
Under the new rules, which were approved by the group's 54-member board of governors at its most recent meeting, documentaries that have won a qualifying award at a competitive film festival will now be eligible for consideration "regardless of any prior exhibition or distribution by nontheatrical means." The academy will release its list of qualifying festivals later this spring.
WALESKA, Ga. (AP)  Reinhardt University is planning a vigil for Quentin Moses, a former NFL linebacker who was as an assistant football coach for the school when he died in a house fire over the weekend.
In a news release, the northern Georgia school invited the public to attend a "Celebration of Life" service on campus at 1 p.m. Wednesday.
Moses, his 31-year-old friend Andria Godard and her 10-year-old daughter Jasmine Godard died in a fire Sunday morning in Monroe.
The 33-year-old had been a defensive end for the Georgia Bulldogs and played four seasons with the Miami Dolphins from 2007-2010 as a linebacker.

Beginning in Melbourne's Federation Square today and tomorrow (August 14 and 15), there's a tiny Tesla house making the rounds of the country - showing off the Powerwall and educating the public on how to generate, store and use renewable energy for your home.
Oh, and the tiny home is towed by a Tesla Model X, because of course it is.
The tiny home is completely powered by renewable energy courtesy of a 2kw solar power system and a Powerwall. Inside, there's a design studio and configurator so you can calculate your own home's needs. There will be Tesla staff on hand to answer questions, too.
The confirmed portion of the tour includes Federation Square 14-15 August, Melbourne Home Show at Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre 17-20 August, Eco-Living Fair at Randwick Community Centre in NSW 3 September, Brisbane Home Show at Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre 8 - 10 September, Rundle Mall in South Australia 20 September – 2 October, Sustainability Lane at Lane Cove Shopping Centre in NSW 8 October and Sydney Home Show at Sydney Showground, Sydney Olympic Park on 27 - 29 October.
That's not all, though - if you want a visit from the Tesla tiny home at your town, school, business or community group you can nominate here.
So what's this tiny house made of, anyway?
Weight: 2 tonnes
Dimensions: 6m x 2.2m x 4m
Solar generation: 2kW PV system of 6 panels
Solar storage: 1 x Tesla Powerwall
Exterior: Clad in locally sourced, chemical-free, sustainable timber
Melbourne Man Says Powerwall 2 Will Drop His Power Bill To $0 Melbourne's first Powerwall 2 has been installed at a three-bedroom, one storey house in Coburg. Brendan Fahey and his wife Josephine added Tesla's shiny new battery to their home to complement their existing solar panels, after Brendan calculated that the Powerwall 2 could take his energy bill down almost to zero.

While two of Winnipeg's busiest homeless shelters are running at capacity, the organizations don't believe a lack of space is to blame for tent cities popping up in the community.
Dozens of people who were living out of tents on the lawn of a West Broadway church are looking for a new place to sleep. They were asked to leave by the church because of a wedding scheduled for the weekend.
READ MORE: Tent city at West Broadway Church coming down
At first glance, it might appear a capacity issue at homeless shelters is to blame.
For instance, Main Street Project said in the last 12 months it turned away 300 people from its shelter, which is about 25 people each month. But communications and fund development co-ordinator Cindy Titus said many just prefer to avoid the shelter.
“People who are experiencing homelessness crave the same things you and I might crave,” she said. “They want to be with their friends. They want to be with their community.
“The tent cities offer a bit of personal space for them within their tent and it offers a sense of community also.”
Across the street, Siloam Mission has the capacity for 110 people but on any given night can have between 10 and 30 people on its wait list for a bed.
Siloam is currently adding dozens of new beds to its facility but CEO Jim Bell doesn't believe it will necessarily stop tent cities from appearing.
“We do believe that the 50 extra beds will go a long way but it's impossible for me to say whether situations like tent city would hang around,” he said.
“The bigger initiative we're paying attention to is that there is a need for social and affordable housing.”
READ MORE: Osborne Village experiencing a ‘homeless takeover'
The Social Planning Committee of Winnipeg agrees that more affordable housing is needed. Community animator Josh Brandon said there are also scenarios where people are waiting months for a welfare cheque to come in or just can't access the right help.
“The current phenomena I think really relates to the lack of affordable housing as well as inadequate services for people who need help,” he said.
“There are big backups for accessing mental health services, addiction services.”
Even if everyone decided to stay at a shelter instead of in a tent, Brandon said it doesn't mean homelessness would be solved.
“It's also important to remember that a shelter is not a home,” Brandon said. “What we're trying to achieve is homes for all people in this city.”

The committee will be releasing information on Winnipeg's current homeless population, including its size and demographics, on June 12.
An exhaustive global analysis of rainfall and rivers shows signs of a radical shift in streamflow patterns, with more intense flooding in cities and smaller catchments coupled with a drier countryside.
Drier soils and reduced water flow in rural areas – but more intense rainfall that overwhelms infrastructure and causes flooding and stormwater overflow in urban centres. That's the finding of an exhaustive study of the world's river systems, based on data collected from more than 43,000 rainfall stations and 5,300 rivers monitoring sites across 160 countries.
The study, by engineers at University of New South Wales in Sydney and which appears in the latest issue of the journal Scientific Reports, explored how rising local temperatures due to climate change might be affecting river flows.
As expected, it found warmer temperatures lead to more intense storms, which makes sense: a warming atmosphere means warmer air, and warmer air can store more moisture. So when the rains do come, there is a lot more water in the air to fall, and hence, rainfall is more intense.
But there's been a growing puzzle: why is flooding not increasing at the same rate as the higher rainfall?
The answer turned out to be the other facet of rising temperatures: more evaporation from moist soils is causing them to become drier before any new rain occurs – moist soils that are needed in rural areas to sustain vegetation and livestock. Meanwhile, small catchments and urban areas, where there are limited expanses of soil to capture and retain moisture, the same intense downpours become equally intense floods, overwhelming stormwater infrastructure and disrupting life.
“Once we sorted through the masses of data, this pattern was very clear,” said Ashish Sharma, a professor of hydrology at UNSW's School of Civil and Environmental Engineering. “The fact that we relied on observed flow and rainfall data from across the world, instead of uncertain model simulations, means we are seeing a real-world effect – one that was not at all apparent before.”
“It's a double whammy,” said Conrad Wasko, lead author of the paper and postdoctoral fellow at UNSW's Water Research Centre. “People are increasingly migrating to cities, where flooding is getting worse. At the same time, we need adequate flows in rural areas to sustain the agriculture to supply these burgeoning urban populations”.
Global flood damage cost more than US$50 billion in 2013; this is expected to more than double in the next 20 years as extreme storms and rainfall intensify and growing numbers of people move into urban centres. Meanwhile, global population over the next 20 years is forecast to rise another 23% from today's 7.3 billion to 9 billion – requiring added productivity and hence greater water security. The reduction in flows noted by this study makes this an even bigger challenge than before.
“We need to adapt to this emerging reality,” said Sharma. “We may need to do what was done to make previously uninhabitable places liveable: engineer catchments to ensure stable and controlled access to water. Places such as California, or much of the Netherlands, thrive due to extensive civil engineering. Perhaps a similar effort is needed to deal with the consequences of a changing climate as we enter an era where water availability is not as reliable as before.”
“Climate change keeps delivering us unpleasant surprises,” said Mark Hoffman, UNSW's Dean of Engineering. “Nevertheless, as engineers, our role is to identify the problem and develop solutions. Knowing the problem is often half the battle, and this study has definitely identified a major one.”
Rainfall data used in the study was collected from the Global Historical Climatology Network, which contains records from over 100,000 weather stations in 180 countries and is managed by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. River flow data came from the Global Runoff Database, run by Germany's Federal Institute of Hydrology, which relies on river discharge information collected daily or monthly from more than 9,300 stations in 160 countries.

PANAJI: Brushing aside the general perception that he would go in for the dissolution of the state legislative assembly in 2019 and opt for its election along with the scheduled Lok Sabha polls, Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar on Sunday said that he wants to run the present government for its full five-year term.
“I absolutely want this government to function till 2022,” the Chief Minister added, pointing out, “These perceptions are created by people, who do not want the government to survive.”
“This is basically clash of interest; there are vested interests, who cannot thrive when I am here,” he observed, maintaining, “I am not saying that corruption has been 100 per cent eliminated from the state system, but corruption, to a large extent has been curtailed.”
Speaking to ‘The Navhind Times' Parrikar, who took over as the state Chief Minister on March 14, earlier this year, said, “If something (related to corruption) is brought to my notice, I act on it, because of which (corrupt) people can't make money.”
“To head the Defence Ministry for two-and-a-half years, without facing a single allegation, even after signing a contract of almost Rs 3 lakh crore is an achievement, which never happened during past many, many years in this country,” the Chief Minister stated, noting that in the past, scams have been continuously exposed in this Ministry. “I consider it a certificate for myself,” he noted.
“Now, if you consider the amounts involved in the running of the state administration, as compared to the Defence Ministry then they are definitely miniscule,” Parrikar said, “However, my presence here itself reduced certain mode of corruption as also wastage of the public money.” He also added that he is very particular about avoiding wastages, and many-a-times has been saving money from the state exchequer by pointing out that certain things are not required to be done, or could be done in a way by saving money.
“Such decisions on my part have become a factor for irritation for few people, who thrive on such things,” the Chief Minister stated, pointing out, “And always there are about 15 per cent people, who always sustain themselves on these kinds of activities.”
“They probably have easy money available to them and sometimes spread rumours,” he retorted on a parting note, concluding, “I am absolutely clear and confident that I will complete the five-year term of my government.”
Josh Brook replied for Moose Jaw (39-9-3). Brody Willms stopped 25-of-27 shots in a losing cause.

CARDIFF - England's four decades of pain at major 50-over tournaments will continue for at least another two years after an enigmatic Pakistan side sensationally dumped them out of the ICC Champions Trophy on Wednesday.
Pakistan were given next-to-no chance of knocking off the tournament favourites in their semi-final in Cardiff but another superb bowling performance steered them to a crushing eight-wicket win and their first final at a major ODI event since the 1999 World Cup.
LBW fortunes favour England early in semi-final
Ten days after they were humiliated by India in Birmingham, Pakistan now face the prospect of taking on their fierce rivals again in the tournament decider at The Oval on Sunday. India will play Bangladesh in the second semi-final at Edgbaston on Thursday.
As he'd done in victories over South Africa and Sri Lanka in the group stage, paceman Hasan Ali (3-36 from 10 overs) led the way as Pakistan dismissed England's all-conquering batting line-up for just 211 on a worn surface at Sophia Gardens.
Left-armers Junaid Khan and Rumman Raees, the latter in his ODI debut, also picked up two wickets each as none of England's batsmen finished their innings with a strike-rate of more than 100. It was just the second time in 47 matches since their much-publicised one-day revolution began two years ago that no England batsman has scored a half-century.
Any thought of the kind of batting collapse that has become Pakistan's unwanted trademark at this tournament was hammered away by another stunning performance from rookie opener Fakhar Zaman (57 from 58 balls), who shared a 118-run opening stand with the rejuvenated Azhar Ali (76 from 100).
Pakistan's opening pair flays England
And Babar Azam (38no) and Mohammad Hafeez (31no) finished the job as Pakistan secured victory with an eye-watering 77 deliveries remaining meaning England, for all they've achieved in ODI cricket since their embarrassing exit from the 2015 World Cup, are still without a trophy from 19 attempts at major ODI tournaments stretching back to the first World Cup in 1975.
Everything seemed to be heading in favour of the hosts after they'd been sent in to bat on a stunning morning in the Welsh capital; Jonny Bairstow, recalled in place of dumped opener Jason Roy, narrowly survived a video review in the opening over while Alex Hales and Eoin Morgan were both given out on the field only to have the decisions correctly overturned by the third umpire.
But from a strong position at 2-128 in the 28th over, England lost their last eight wickets for 83 as Pakistan's impressive seam attack brilliantly exploited the same pitch that had hosted their match against Sri Lanka on Monday.
Playing just his 20th ODI, Hasan added another three wickets to his hauls of 3-24 and 3-43 earlier in the group stage – despite appearing to be hobbled by injury – and moved to the top of the tournament's wicket-taking charts.
The reverse swing and clever variations of Rumman (handed his debut in place of the injured Mohammad Amir) and Junaid also proved to be too much for England's batting stars as they limped past the 200 mark in the 48th over.
Despite a few fumbles in the field, Pakistan also produced two run-outs while Fakhar pulled in a sensational diving catch on the square leg boundary, right in front of the viewing platform adjoining the team dressing-room's where delighted coach Mickey Arthur and his Australian offsider Steve Rixon stood and applauded. No-one epitomised England's torrid time with the bat quite like dynamic allrounder Ben Stokes, who was uncharacteristically sedate in compiling 34 from 64 balls (with no boundaries) as he struggled to come to terms with the two-paced pitch.
Despite the sub-par total, a victory target of 212 on a difficult surface for batting meant England would have gone to the break unsatisfied but knowing they were still in with a serious chance of victory given Pakistan's batting wobbles so far in the tournament.
But left-handed Fakhar, who has been a revelation since making his debut just a week ago, hammered a run-a-ball half-century including six fours and a six as Pakistan knocked off almost half of their victory target before the first drinks break. By which point the fat lady was already warming her vocal chords and England were beginning to ponder how their impressive one-day resurgence has still failed to net them a major piece of ODI silverware – at least until they host the next World Cup in two years' time.

Pakistan captain Sarfraz
Credit goes to the bowlers and the batters who finished it very well. We adapted to conditions, we knew if we restrict them we could easily chase it down. Every game is a knockout game and I told my boys to play their game and not worry about the result. Both India and Bangladesh are playing good so either of them can be in the final.
England captain Morgan
One thing we didn't do was adapt to conditions, which I thought Pakistan did extremely well. Full credit to them, they outplayed us on this wicket. We did prepare for a used wicket but 211 wasn't a good score. 250/270 would have been. This pitch is a test, the Champions Trophy is a test, you can't have home conditions for any side.
Man of the match
Hasan Ali
It was a big match and we were focused on our bowling. The way I bowled against South Africa is the same way I bowled today. I stuck to my plans and Azhar Mahmood (the bowling coach) helped me a lot. Tomorrow is my brother's birthday and I dedicate my man of the match award to him.
Washington: US president Donald Trump and French counterpart Emmanuel Macron called for a "new" deal with Iran on Tuesday, looking beyond divisions over a landmark nuclear accord that still hangs in the balance.
Trump laid transatlantic divisions bare during a visit by the French president, pillorying a three-year old agreement designed to curb Iran's nuclear programme.
The US leader described the deal as "insane" and "ridiculous," despite European pleas for him not to walk away.
Instead, Trump eyed a broader "deal" that would also limit Iran's ballistic missile programme and support for militant groups across West Asia.
"I think we will have a great shot at doing a much bigger, maybe, deal," said Trump, stressing that any new accord would have to be built on "solid foundations."
"They should have made a deal that covered Yemen, that covered Syria, that covered other parts of West Asia," said Trump.
"No matter where you go in West Asia, you see the fingerprints of Iran behind problems."
Macron admitted after meeting Trump that he did not know whether the US president would walk away from the nuclear deal when a 12 May decision deadline comes up.
"I can say that we have had very frank discussions on that, just the two of us," Macron told a joint press conference with Trump at his side.
Putting on a brave face, he said he wished "for now to work on a new deal with Iran" of which the nuclear accord could be one part.
Neither Trump nor Macron indicated whether Iran would get something in return for concessions on its ballistic programmes, activities in West Asia or extending nuclear controls beyond 2025.
Trump — true to his background in reality TV — teased his looming decision.
"This is a deal with decayed foundations. It's a bad deal, it's a bad structure. It's falling down," the US leader said. "We're going to see what happens on the 12th."
Trump's European allies have repeatedly tried to persuade him not to abandon the 2015 deal, which gave Iran massive sanctions relief and the guarantee of a civilian nuclear programme in return for limiting enrichment that could produce weapons grade fuel.
German chancellor Angela Merkel will renew those calls when she visits Washington on Friday.
Iran, meanwhile, has warned it will ramp up enrichment activities if Trump walks away from the accord, prompting Trump to issue a blunt warning.
"They're not going to be restarting anything. If they restart it, they're going to have big problems, bigger than they ever had before. And you can mark it down," he said.
Simmering tensions
For months American and European officials have been working behind the scenes to trying to find a compromise over Trump's demands to change the agreement.
Officials have toyed with the idea of a separate joint declaration: promising to tackle non-nuclear issues, while searching for a tougher successor agreement post 2025.
The challenge, they say, is to find a solution that allows the mercurial US president to claim a public victory, while keeping the deal intact.
More hawkish American officials accuse Europeans — particularly Germany — of putting business interests ahead of security, and of opposing a tougher stance against Iran to safeguard investments in the Islamic Republic.
That charge is sharply rejected by European officials, who are increasingly frustrated at spending time dealing with Trump's complaints rather than tackling Iran's behavior.
The disagreement threatens to plunge transatlantic relations to their lowest point since the Iraq War.
"It's quite possible that Macron successfully bought time to gin up support for a new accord," said Henry Rome, an Iran expert at the Eurasia Group, a consultancy.
But he predicted multiple problems that could scupper Macron's efforts.
Trump comments contrasted markedly with the red carpet roll out that the French leader received at the White House.
Earlier on Tuesday both men waxed lyrical about shared heroes of yore — from the Marquis de Lafayette to Alexis de Tocqueville — as they listened to strains of "La Marseillaise" and "The Star-Spangled Banner."
"The wonderful friendship we have developed over the last year is a testament to the enduring friendship that binds our two nations," Trump glowed.
In the Oval Office, Trump offered another, slightly awkward sign of their intimacy.
"We have a very special relationship, in fact I'll get that little piece of dandruff off," Trump said, swiping something off Macron's jacket. "We have to make him perfect — he is perfect."
Observers are uncertain that Macron can translate the privileged relationship into concrete results.
There are also problems in the economic sphere, with Macron and Merkel both trying to secure a permanent exemption for Europe from US steel and aluminum tariffs.
Trump complained about having to do trade "deals" with the European Union as a bloc, rather than individual states like France.
PESHAWAR - Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan here Friday demanded merger of Fata into KP and warned if the matter was delayed it would increase miseries of tribesmen, besides providing militants with chances of germination and reorganisation.
Addressing a press conference at the chief minister's house, Imran Khan said the fate of tribal people must be decided before 2018 general elections, giving them chances of due representation in the elected forums to raise their issues.
He said governing system of Fata has been in limbo and the only option available at present is its merger with KP for which the province is fully prepared. He said the merger would introduce local government system in Fata that would pave the way for mainstreaming of tribal areas.
He asserted the tribal people who face hardships after military operations and displacement deserve solution to their problems immediately.
He pointed out massive corruption is underway in Fata that has led to misuse of funds allocated for tribal people, adding KP is economically and administratively fit to govern the tribal areas.
The PTI chief said if the decision of merger was delayed, it would produce negative implications, including chances for the enemies to germinate.
To a question, he said they support the Fata parliamentarians who have planned a sit-in in Islamabad on October 9.
He said PPP and PMLN should avoid naming candidates for the slot of NAB chairman as both the parties have been involved in corrupt practices.
He hoped the parliamentary committee would consider the name among the persons submitted by PTI for the slot.
On this occasion, Mufti Sajjad of JUI-F announced joining PTI, reposing confidence in the leadership of Imran Khan.
Provincial Information Minister Shah Farman who was present on the occasion faced embarrassment when some of the journalists complained he was not cooperating with media persons.
At the outset of the press conference, Peshawar Press Club President Alamgir complained of the behaviour of the provincial government, especially the CM and the information minister, and said their problems were being ignored. He said nobody in the provincial government listened to their problems and priorities.
Supporting PPC President, Arif Yousafzai and Tariq Afaq warned to boycott activities of PTI in the province if the PTI leadership did not mend their ways. They told Imran Khan that the KP information minister always skips journalists whenever they approach him for seeking comments of the government on various matters.
ANP DEMANDS FATA'S MERGER WITH KP: Awami National Party Parliamentary Leader in KP Assembly Sardar Hussain Babak has asked the federal government to merge Fata with the province prior to the forthcoming general elections so that tribesmen could elect their representatives for the provincial assembly.
He said various important steps which are prerequisite to make Fata part of the province should immediately be taken by the federal government, adding time has come to remove the line drawn by the British rulers just to divide Pakhtuns.
The ANP leader said there is no justification to enforce the FCR law in Fata, which had been done just to have a tight control over the people of the region. This law should be replaced with the regulations being exercised in Pakistan.
Talking to various delegations of the party that called on him at Bacha Khan Markaz here on Friday, he said ANP Chief Asfandyar Wali Khan has also announced to launch a struggle for amalgamation of Pakhtun-dominated areas in Balochistan with the province.
Bringing all Pakhtuns living in Pakistan at a single platform, he said he would give strength to them in making policies and decisions in the future.
He announced ANP would fully participate in the protest rally to be held in Islamabad on October 9 to force the federal government to implement Fata reforms package immediately. Babak said there is no viable option other than merger of Fata with KP.

You'll have to clear a little extra space on your wife's dresser for Kim Kardashian's new fragrance . . . because it's shaped like her BODY.
She says, “The next fragrance I have coming out in May, KKW Body, is so amazing. It is a sculpture, basically, of my body. It's really cool.
“The scent is so good, I'm so proud of it. It smells to me like what I would think golden smells like, even though that's a color and something that's just luminous.”
It's feeding time at Brad Felger's farm in Washington's Skagit Valley. And he's about to feed 40 hungry falcons.
Yes, falcons.
They're an important, albeit often unseen, part of farming in some states, used as a defense mechanism to keep away pesky birds like starlings, which love to eat berries and apples.
Since age 12, Felger has had a self-described love for everything with feathers, scales or tails.
"Falconers are, what's the word I'm looking for ... eccentric," Felger says.
Now he runs Airstrike Bird Control as founder and CEO.
His business? Raptor abatement.
It's different than traditional falconry because rather than hunting quarry, he uses his falcons to scare off birds that can be bad news for crops.
In 2017, he employed about 30 falconers and used over 100 falcons (only about 25 of those are Felger's) to control troublesome crop-eaters.
According to research in the journal Crop Protection, in 2011 in Washington state alone, honeycrisp apple farmers lost nearly $3,000 per acre to birds eating their produce.
While nets can secure fruit trees and noisemakers can scare birds, there are drawbacks to each tool. Nets can be expensive, and birds can get used to noise-scare tactics.
But falcons?
"It's using nature against nature. And it's something birds never get used to," Felger says. "They never get used to an aggressive falcon flying toward them."
Felger's operation is non-lethal for the birds that the falcons scare away.
He flies his falcons all along the U.S. West Coast. In Washington, he starts with blueberry farms in May, then travels east, ending with vineyards in the Yakima Valley and Columbia Basin through the fall.
His operation is gaining popularity, especially with organic and eco-friendly farms.
Patricia Thompson is the falconry manager for the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. This season she permitted nearly 300 recreational falconers in the state. Thompson says she's noticed an uptick in this style of pest control.
"It feels like more people are getting into abatement falconry," Thompson said. "And it does seem to be more ecological to haze the birds off, rather than using pesticides."
Thompson isn't sure how many of those falconers practice abatement since the state doesn't offer those permits. That permit comes at the federal level through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
All states except Hawaii allow falconry. In other states, abatement falconers also work with landfill sites, golf courses and warehouses where birds can be a nuisance.
Thompson is quick to point out how intense falconry can be. It starts with a two-year apprenticeship, followed by an exam, and even a site visit where wildlife department officials examine facilities. She calls it a real lifestyle because the birds take so much time to care for and are in hunting-working relationships with their falconers.
At Fegler's farm, breeding season has already started. Next month, Felger is hoping to add 40 baby falcons to his cast of the hardworking birds of prey. Soon these little birds will start training to become the next generation of fruit-saving predators, maybe protecting a blueberry field or apple orchard near you.
This story comes to us from Washington-based member station Northwest Public Broadcasting. You can hear the original story here.
UNITED NATIONS - UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres Sunday assumed his functions as the world body's head, with an impassioned call for promoting peace through steps like dialogue to resolve outstanding political differences among nations.
"On this New Year Day, I ask all of you to join me in making one shared New Year Resolution: Let us resolve to put peace first,' he said in his first statement as world's top diplomat. Let us make 2017 a year in which we all -- citizens, governments, leaders -- strive to overcome differences," Guterres, who replaced Ban Ki-moon of South Korea, said.
"From solidarity and compassion in our daily lives, to dialogue and respect across political divides ... from ceasefire on the battlefield to compromise at negotiating table to reach political solutions ... Peace must be our goal and guide.'
He said one question weighs heavy on his heart. “That is: how can we help the millions of people caught up in conflict, suffering massively in wars with no end in sight?” Having been formally appointed by the UN General Assembly on 13 October 2016, Guterres, aged 67, will serve for a five-year period from today to 31 December 2021. He was Prime Minister of Portugal from 1995 to 2002, and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees from June 2005 to December 2015.
Guterres faces a hostile incoming US administration led by Donald Trump who thinks the world body's 193 member states do nothing except talk and have a good time. He told reporters after being sworn-in as secretary-general on Dec. 12 that he will engage all governments - "and, of course, also with the next government of the United States" - and show his willingness to cooperate on "the enormous challenges that we'll be facing together.
"But Trump has shown little interest in multilateralism, which Guterres says is "the cornerstone" of the United Nations, and a great attachment to the Republicans' "America First" agenda.
So as Guterres begins his work facing conflicts from Syria and Yemen to South Sudan and Libya and global crises from terrorism to climate change, U.S. support for the United Nations remains a question mark.
And it matters because the U.S. is a veto-wielding member of the U.N. Security Council and pays 22 percent of the U.N.'s regular budget and 25 percent of its peacekeeping budget.
Immediately after the United States allowed the Security Council to condemn Israeli settlements in the West Bank on Dec. 23, Trump warned in a tweet: "As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th," the day he takes office. Trump followed up three days later with another tweet questioning its effectiveness.
"The United Nations has such great potential but right now it is just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time. So sad!"
Last month, the Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs, Tariq Fatemi, paid a courtesy call on Guterres, and conveyed congratulations to him on behalf of Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, with the hope that the fruitful cooperation between Pakistan and the UN would further enhance under his leadership.
The signs which were available about the decline in the influence of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Gujarat's rural areas during the state assembly elections have been substantiated by the drubbing which the BJP has received at the Congress's hands in the by-elections in Rajasthan, where the saffron party is in power.
Earlier, the Congress had shown that it might well be on the comeback trail by its success in the Chitrakoot assembly by-election in another BJP-ruled state, Madhya Pradesh. In all these by-elections, it was not so much the Congress's victory which was noteworthy as the impressive margins of its success.
Although it is too early to say whether these election trends point to an ebbing of the saffron tide after the overwhelming nature of the wave in 2014 and again in Uttar Pradesh last year, there is little doubt that the BJP has reasons to be concerned.
In fact, the emphasis placed on the rural areas in the latest budget is an indication that the party has taken its setbacks in the Gujarat countryside seriously and is trying to make amends by reaching out to the vulnerable sections.
The proposed health insurance cover for 500 million, 40 percent of the population, is not unlike the previous government's food security programme for 67 percent of the people.
More than what happened in Gujarat, where at least the urbanites stood behind the BJP, what the Rajasthan outcome has shown is that all the sections have voted against the ruling party.
The widespread nature of the discontent underlines a deep and extensive popular unhappiness with governance although a minister has sought to explain the party's defeats by referring to the grievances of the Rajputs over the "Padmaavat" film.
But that can only be one of the reasons. What must have also undermined the BJP's prospects is the violence unleashed by either cow vigilantes or individuals railing against the minorities.
While the lawlessness of the gau rakshaks was exemplified by the lynching of a Muslim cattle trader although he was carrying the required permits for his trade, the psychopathic wrath of anti-Muslim elements was evident in the killing of a migrant labourer from West Bengal.
Both these heinous crimes were filmed and repeatedly shown on television, but while the murderers of the cattle trader, Pehlu Khan, have gone scot-free because of the inability of the police to provide credible evidence although the lynching took place in broad daylight in front of cameras, at least the killer of Afrazul Khan, the migrant labourer, was arrested.
While any other government would have expressed deep shock and dismay over the horrific incidents, the Vasundhara Raje government in Rajasthan has largely remained unperturbed, a trait of indifference to near-anarchic conditions demonstrated by several other BJP-led governments.
What cannot but be worrying for the Narendra Modi-Amit Shah duo is that the virtually unchecked violence of saffron groups like the gau rakshaks or the opponents of love jihad is beginning to take its toll on the BJP's electoral fortunes, notwithstanding all the talk about "Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas" or development for all.
The popular disquiet about the rampaging mobs might have been assuaged if prompt and effective police action was taken and the criminals were put behind bars. But if the absence of such deterrent steps is proving costly for the BJP, the reason is that it is not only the Muslims - or the Christians who have also been targeted by Hindutva outfits in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh - who are feeling insecure, as then vice-president Hamid Ansari pointed out, but the ordinary citizens are also distressed by the prevailing intolerance and intimidation.
Moreover, this atmosphere has been building up virtually from the time the BJP assumed power at the Centre and in several states as was highlighted by the return of national awards by a number of luminaries in the last two years in protest against the deteriorating situation. A recent open letter written by retired bureaucrats also referred to the "deeply disquieting trends" in the public sphere.
It is obvious that unless the governments at the Centre and in the states run by the BJP deal firmly with such rowdy elements, the party's hope of a repeat run of the last general election in 2019 and even improving on its tally, as Amit Shah hopes, will not be fulfilled.
As is not uncommon in India, it is the failure of governments which usually leads to their fall rather than any efforts of the opposition. This tendency is again evident in Rajasthan where the Congress had just to wait in the wings to reap the electoral benefits of its opponent's missteps.
After the humiliating setback in 2014, the Congress is showing signs of revival. But it will be making a mistake if it hopes to make electoral gains solely on the basis of the BJP's inability or unwillingness to control its militant followers.

“When is another generation of Pokémon coming to Pokémon GO?!”
It's a question that the game's players (including myself) have been shouting since… well, pretty much immediately after the game launched.
We've finally got an official answer: “later this week”.
The once oh-so-shaky servers have stabilized. The game is now available in most of the world. And now, about seven months after the game's initial launch… it's finally time for a bunch of new Pokémon.
Niantic tells me that players will be able to find “over 80” new Johto Pokémon (those from 1999's Pokémon Gold and Silver games, otherwise known as “Generation II”) within the next few days.
I asked for a date more precise than “later this week”, but the company declined to get more specific. When asked whether the new Pokémon would be added all at once or rolled out gradually, though, a rep replied that they would all “be discoverable as soon as the update goes live.”
Better news: the 80 they mentioned will all be discoverable “in the wild”, as they should be — not just from eggs, unlike the handful added in December.
A few other things the company confirmed:
New “evolution” items required to make certain Pokémon evolve are being added. Niantic tells me that evolution items will come from PokéStops, much like eggs/Pokeballs/etc. I wish they'd gotten a bit more creative there — it's a good opportunity to add some sort of new gameplay mechanic.
Two new types of berries are coming: Nanab berries, which make Pokémon slower and thus easier to hit, and the Pinap Berry, which doubles the amount of candy you get if your next catch attempt is a success.
New avatar items — new hats, shirts, and pants are mentioned specifically.
They mentioned new “encounter gameplay”, but they didn't shed too much light on what that means
They also released this trailer:
Though there's not much in terms of new encounter gameplay mechanics on display there, worth noting is the new berry shortcut button at 0:16, that the backpack is seemingly now a dedicated Pokéball drawer, and that the camera button got moved up to the top of the screen (until 0:29, at which point it's suddenly back at the bottom right. Whoops!)
Also worth noting: from 0:20 to 0:26, people are very clearly shown playing the game in mountains, woods, etc — the sorts of areas that the game has notoriously been pretty bad at populating, instead dumping lots and lots of Pokémon in Walmart parking lots. Wishful thinking by the trailer directors, or something more?
Alas, not mentioned thus far with regards to this update: a better tracking system, trading, or player-versus-player battling.
Anyway: this is by far the biggest batch of Pokémon added to the game since launch — we got Ditto back in November, a goofy little Pikachu in a Santa hat in December, and a handful of baby Pokémon that you could frustratingly only get from eggs (read: walking + random luck + maybe some premium items to speed up the process).
“But wait, Greg! Didn't Generation II originally add 100 Pokémon, not ~80?”
Yeah, thats where things get a little fuzzy. Niantic tells me “over 80” are being added, which leaves 20 sorts of up in the air. 8 of those remaining 20 are the aforementioned babies(/their evolutions), and are already in the game. That leaves 12 — some of which will probably require those evolution items so Niantic isn't counting them as discoverable “in the wild”, and 6 of which are presumably the Gen II “Legendary” Pokémon. Based on what we've seen with Gen I's (still absent) Legendaries , those seem to be poker (Poké?) chips Niantic is hanging onto for later plans.
How exactly it'll all break down, though, will be figured out as soon as the players (Shout out to Silph Road and r/PokemonGo!) actually get their hands on the new content. That sense of discovery as everyone works together to catalog everything is half the fun.
Will this update spark the same level of insanity that was seen with the game's initial launch? Probably not. Does it need to? Nah. It'll bring back a chunk of players who dropped off because they ran out of things to do, for sure — but striving for that same degree of ubiquitous and game-breaking popularity would be a fool's errand.
And for the folks who've made it this far and thus might care about the nitty-gritty, a few things I noticed in some screenshots they sent over:
1) Sup, Murkrow?
2) That's the new berry drawer, as teased in the trailer
3) Looks like berries can be purchased now, given the Shop icon in the upper right
1) Pokémon in GO seem to have genders now, with an icon marking which gender-variant you're looking at.
2) That silhouette on the “Evolve” button, assuming it's part of the final release, suggests the button will now show what a Pokémon will evolve into when it's tapped. With the addition of evolution items allowing one Pokémon to have multiple possible evolutions, this should help prevent any surprises.
Here's Mike Sobel's Friday, October 6, 2017 early morning weather forecast for Edmonton, Alberta and the surrounding area.
At least four people died after consuming toxic liquor within the jurisdiction of Saddar police today.
Sources said that four people identified as Shahbaz, Waqeel, Kaif and Munir allegedly died after drinking poisonous alcohol while two others Muhammad Riaz and Tanveer were in a critical condition in the area of Thairi Sansi, area of Gujranwala.
According to the relatives of the victims, all of them had consumed toxic liquor three days ago and were shifted to Lahore in precarious condition where four of them passed away.
Islamabad-The Senate Standing Committee on National Health Services and Regulations (NHSR) has grilled the officials of Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) for poor presentation of central admission policy and approving the new fee structure of private medical and dental colleges. The meeting of the committee was held here in the chair of Senator Sajjad Hussain Turi.
The committee discussed the issue of ‘The Prohibition of Smoking and Protection of Non-Smokers Health (Amendment) Bill, 2017', 10 per cent miscellaneous charges by the Shifa International Hospital and a public petition on non-functional nursing schools in Balochistan.
The situation was embarrassing for PMDC representative Maj Gen (Retd) Abdul Khaliq Naveed when he failed in giving detailed presentation on the agenda to the senate body.
The chairman committee said that PMDC has not prepared the central admission policy and has come with an old presentation to present before the committee. The situation was humorous when the PMDC representative said that details are given in the hard copy but are not available in the computer presentation. The Federal Minister for NHSR Saira Afzal Tarar annoying on the PMDC representative said to inquire the matter and informed the committee on agenda.
She said that a four member committee comprising Dr. Abid Farooqi, Dr Eice Mohaamad, Dr Abdul Khaliq Naveed and Ejaz Hassan Khan had negotiated with Private Association of Medical Institutions (PAMI) for the admission policy and increase in the fee. As per new fee structure, the private medical colleges will charge Rs800, 000 annually and take five cheques of guarantee from the students. She said that the private medical institutions have been directed to make the procedure transparent by uploading the details of applicant for admission online before the merit list is uploaded.
However, the committee members including Senator Ashok Kumar, Attique Sheikh and Nauman Wazir Khattak remained unsatisfied with the steps taken for the admission policy and regularisation of fee structure of medical colleges. Senator Ashok Kumar said that PMDC allowed private medical institutions to increase the fee without taking committee into confidence.
The minister said that the fee was not raised since 2011 and as per the policy PMDC was bound to allow the institutions.
“Allowing the colleges to increase the fee from legal procedure will close the backdoor channels from where they were profiteering,' she said. She also said that a ‘Grievance Committee' in every province will be established which will be responsible to address the complaints filed by students. The minister said that approval of new fee structure will be given by the federal cabinet.
However, the committee was not convinced and decided to formulate a consensus committee for further deliberation. On the question of charging 10 per cent ‘miscellaneous charges' by the Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad, the DHO under the Commissioner Office briefed that these were service charges whch were being charged by the private hospitals and a survey had been conducted by his team to determine its validity.
Senator Attique Sheikh raised the issue of contaminated fresh milk being given to households of Islamabad. He showed deep concern on the matter and requested the chairman to send call letter to the Pakistan Dairy Association for clarification.
The representative from the Commissioner Office responded that two sets of laws were workable in this regard; the first was the Adulteration Act and second was Municipal Laws under the custody of CADD. He suggested that there was room for further legislation to expand the jurisdiction of the Commissioner's office for wider effective implementation in the matter concerned.
The consideration of ‘The Prohibition of Smoking and Protection of Non-Smokers Health (Amendment) Bill, 2017'was dropped due to consecutive absences of the mover, Chaudhry Tanvir Khan.
The committee agreed with the briefing provided by the Manager Tobacco Company that available laws already covered the amendments introduced by the Senator and there was no need to legislate on the matter further. The meeting was attended by Chairperson Senator Sajjad Hussain Turi, Senators Hamza, Naseema Ehsan, Dr Ashok Kumar, Kalsoom Perveen, Nauman Wazir Khattak, Mian Muhammad Ateeq Shaikh, Dr Ghaus Muhammad Khan Niazi, and Khalida Perveen as members and Minister of State for National Health Services, Regulation and Coordination, Saira Afzal Tarar.

Cannabis in Ghana is illegal without license from the Minister of Health,
The police at Juaso have seized 15,790.81 grams of marijuana at Asankare in the Asante-Akim South Municipality and arrested one man, Kwame Agyei.
This large quantity of psycho-active drug was being carried on a VIP bus from Accra and Wankyi, a farming community in the municipality, was the destination.
Agyei was on Monday put before the Juaso Circuit Court and ordered to be held in prison custody.
He has been charged with possessing narcotic drug without lawful authority.
Police Detective Inspector Princeton Peasah Darkwah told the court, presided over by Mr. Yusif Asibey, forensic laboratory examination had confirmed that the dried leaves, was marijuana.
It was intercepted whilst in transit and this was based upon a tip off.
The leaves had been compressed into 21 parcels and concealed in Agyei's travelling bag and he was arrested together with the bag, immediately he got down from the bus at Asankare.
The accused pleaded guilty to the offence but told of the court, he was unaware of the contents of the parcels he was carrying.
He would be making his next appearance on May 02.
The exit of a second dean at USC's Keck School of Medicine over inappropriate behavior brought shock and outrage to the campus Friday and demands that university leadership explain what went wrong.
A number of physicians, researchers and scholars at the Keck School of Medicine said they were stunned to learn that Dr. Rohit Varma, who was removed Thursday as dean, had been disciplined 14 years ago after a sexual harassment and retaliation complaint by a woman fellow he supervised.
Varma's departure came a little more than a year and a half after Dr. Carmen Puliafito stepped down. Puliafito was the subject of a Times investigation that found he regularly abused methamphetamine and other drugs and associated with addicts and prostitutes.
A Keck administrator described the school as “completely in shock” over the Varma revelations. She said many on campus learned of the dean's departure from colleagues who whispered the news or forwarded a link of The Times' story on the resignation.
“It's sad because a bulk of the folks who work here do great stuff, but this has sullied that,” said the administrator, who like others requested anonymity because USC has asked employees not to speak publicly on the matter.
In a letter to colleagues Thursday, Varma wrote that he “felt it was in the best interest of the school for me to step down at this time.”
In a statement to The Times released Friday, Varma added: “While I am disappointed that I will no longer be serving as dean of the Keck School of Medicine, I am proud of the many accomplishments I have made together with students, residents, the staff and faculty of both the Keck School and the USC Roski Eye Institute and look forward to continuing my work at USC as a member of the faculty.''
USC disciplined Varma in 2003 after allegations that he sexually harassed the young researcher while he was a junior professor, according to confidential personnel records reviewed by The Times and interviews with people familiar with the university investigation.
As The Times was preparing to publish a story disclosing the case, USC announced Thursday afternoon that Varma was no longer dean.
USC Provost Michael Quick said in a letter to the campus community Friday that Dr. Laura Mosqueda, Keck's chair of family medicine, would serve as interim dean while the university searched for Varma's permanent successor.
Quick acknowledged the widespread anger over the latest black eye to Keck. “I understand how upsetting this situation is to all of us, but we felt it was in the best interest of the faculty, staff, and students for all of us to move in this direction,” he wrote in a Thursday letter.
At a packed town hall meeting in Mayer Auditorium on Friday, university administrators heard from a large crowd of angry students, many in scrubs and white doctor coats.
“I really want to talk about the culture that's being propagated at the highest levels of USC leadership, and it seems to be a culture that values money above all else, especially ethics,” said one male student, according to a recording of the meeting reviewed by The Times.
Both former deans were known as financial rainmakers for USC. Puliafito claimed to have raised $1 billion while leading Keck — a number USC now disputes. The National Institutes of Health sent more than $60 million in grants to USC for Varma's projects, according to federal databases.
The deans present at the meeting tried to allay fears that the scandals could affect the medical school's reputation or the careers of the students. One administrator told the students they would be given written talking points to use during residency interviews “so you feel like you'll have a little security in your back pocket.”
A female student demanded action by USC President C.L. Max Nikias and the university's Board of Trustees.
“We need to have the freaking trustees, we need to have Nikias, we need to have Quick in here, and we need them to apologize,” she said.
In July, The Times published a lengthy story that detailed the 66-year-old Puliafito's partying with much-younger drug abusers while he was dean. He resigned as dean in March 2016, but USC allowed him to remain on faculty and continue to treat patients.
University leaders later said they were unaware of Puliafito's drug use, although Varma told a gathering of students that his predecessor's excessive drinking was known to administrators. After The Times' investigation was published, USC barred Puliafito from campus and began the process to fire him. He is under investigation by the Medical Board of California.
A committee headed by Quick selected Varma as Puliafito's replacement last year from a pool of more than 140 applicants from across the nation, according to USC. The candidates included academics from top universities. After winnowing the field to 15, USC interviewed the candidates and chose Varma.
On Tuesday, The Times informed USC of the newspaper's findings on the sexual harassment case involving Varma and asked the university for comment. USC on Wednesday told The Times the incident had been addressed nearly 15 years ago and that it remained confident in Varma's leadership. In meetings with faculty members Wednesday, Varma told colleagues he had the support of USC leadership, according to two Keck employees knowledgeable of the conversations.
Less than 24 hours later, USC reversed course and said Varma was out, citing The Times' reporting and “previously undisclosed information.”
A university spokesman said Friday that “USC's investigation led to new disclosures of employment incidents that caused it to lose confidence in [Varma's] ability to lead.” He declined to elaborate.
Senior faculty members at Keck said they were stunned by the developments over the last two days.
“I am absolutely floored,” said one official.
Others feared for school's reputation. “It's not that we've lost [Puliafito and Varma], but that these individuals were ever appointed,” another faculty member said.

The BBC'S latest weather graphics have got a stormy reception - from BBC veteran Bill Giles.
Giles, 78, who led the BBC weather team for 17 years until 2000, got in a blue funk about the new-look forecasts.
He said delicately-shaded maps and graphics brought in February were hard to decipher.
Thundering they were “as ­disappointing as a downpour in high summer” he urged viewers seeking “clean, clear graphics” to turn to Channel 5 at 7pm.
(Image: BBC)
Giles said hitches included the map, now “a lot smaller”, the blue background colour and limited place names.
He explained: “I find the distinction between cloud and sunshine almost impossible to detect.
"On some national broadcasts we see just a list of the four capital cities with a symbol and ­temperature, fine for residents of London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. What if you live elsewhere?”
(Image: Daily Mirror)
As for how the graphics handled the Big Freeze, his words were chilling.
“If you wanted to get a clue of how cold it would be, you had to stare very hard at the screen. Why highlight below-freezing temperatures with a thin blue line beneath the number? Surely it would be better to flag it up like we used to with negative temperatures in blue?”
(Image: Andy Kyle / SWNS)
Giles, who lives near Southampton, told Radio Times: “The old weather maps were better, more fit for purpose.”
Blaming the BBC's move to work with ­MeteoGroup rather than the Met Office, he went on: “Has the move from the Met Office ‘to secure the best value for money,' been a success? I think not.”
Last night the BBC said the new deal would save “millions of pounds” while providing a more detailed forecast.
A spokeswoman insisted: “BBC Weather has a more realistic map which presenters can customise. We talked to audiences to pinpoint the best possible ­improvements. We are confident people will appreciate the new features.”
A Sioux City man who was taking his brand-new truck to be detailed today will end up requiring more than a wash and wax on the pickup.
Police Sergeant Scott Hatting says the 73-year-old man was pulling into “Hitches, Trailers and More” around 11 a.m when something went wrong. He says the man accidentally step on the gas instead of the brake as he was pulling in to park and the truck went through a window of the building and struck an employee who was working inside.
The employee was taken to the hospital as a precaution with minor injuries. Hatting says since the accident happened on private property the truck owner would not be cited. “But clearly he's at fault. The damage to his vehicle is probably around eight thousand dollars I would guess just for paint. And the building — substantially more — just because a lot of property was damaged inside as well,” officer Hatting says.
The unidentified driver was not hurt and had just bought the 2018 pickup Tuesday.

Gold had been on a positive trajectory since the beginning of the year, nearly recovering half of its losses during the July to December selloff. On February 9, retail prices jumped further to hit a record high of Dh150.25 per gram, up by 7.7 per cent from the beginning of the year.
Trump's renewed talk of tax cuts, however, later dampened gold's momentum. On Monday, the bullion fell 0.31 per cent to $1,230.22 an ounce. Trump had announced that he would make an announcement over the next two or three weeks that will be "phenomenal in terms of tax." "Gold is reacting to a stronger US dollar and uptake in equities market. Gold continues to be volatile while the US government finalises their economic policies," Karim Merchant, CEO and managing director of Pure Gold Jewellers, told Gulf News on Monday.

Perth (Australia)
Australian firebrand Nick Kyrgios opened the new year in fine style on Sunday with a powerhouse win over Spaniard Feliciano Lopez at the Hopman Cup in Perth.
But unfortunately for Kyrgios, he and team-mate Daria Gavrilova, the defending champions in the mixed teams tournament, were upset 2-1 by Lopez and Lara Arruabarrena, allowing the Spaniards to clinch the tie.
World number 66 Arruabarrena had earlier levelled the tie after securing an unexpected straight sets win over Gavrilova.
The clash with Lopez was Kyrgios's first official match since the 21-year-old was banned from the ATP tour in October after a tanking controversy in Shanghai, although he played in the International Premier Tennis League in December.
Kyrgios, ranked 13 in the world, came out firing against the 35-year-old Lopez, gaining an early break and rifling six aces past the Spaniard in his first three service games.
He served 14 aces in all and Kyrgios only faced one break point on his serve for the entire match, winning 6-3, 6-4 in 65 minutes.
Kyrgios said he was surprised with his sharp form, which he believed reflected work on both his physical and mental strength—the latter one of the terms of his ban applied by the ATP.
“I felt like I was going to be a bit rusty, but I played really well and it was surprising,” he said.
“I haven't been doing that much on the court and I've been trying to get into a good headspace.”
Kyrgios said he had been working hard with former Watford fitness coach Martin Skinner in recent months.
“I've never really had a good strength conditioner in my team and that was one area where I could develop and take my game to the next level,” he said.
Kyrgios didn't appear restricted by strapping on his lower left leg, and said it was the result of an injury sustained while playing basketball earlier in the week.
After Kyrgios gave the Australians the lead with his win over Lopez, the 25th-ranked Gavrilova was expected to secure the tie by beating Arruabarrena, ranked 66th.
But the Spaniard belied her ranking with an impressive 7-5, 6-1 win.
The Spanish pair then claimed the deciding mixed doubles—played under the Fast Four format—triumphing 4-0, 4-2.
Earlier, the United States opened their Hopman Cup campaign in style with a 3-0 win over the Czech Republic.
The American pair of Jack Sock and Coco Vandeweghe won both their singles matches to clinch the tie and then made it a clean sweep with a victory in the mixed doubles.
After Vanderweghe beat Lucie Hradecka 6-4, 6-2, Sock then edged past Adam Pavlasek in three sets.
The dead mixed doubles rubber was a relaxed affair and the US came from a set down to win 2-4, 4-2, 4-1.—AFP
Dan Haberman (Photo: Handout)
Birmingham attorney and entrepreneur Dan Haberman this week launched his campaign for Congress, seeking the Democratic nomination and to ultimately succeed retiring GOP Rep. Dave Trott.
“I'm running because government has ceased in its ability to function,” Haberman said in an interview.
“My background outside of government as a regular citizen and small-business guy has been to effectuate change within government,” he added. “If I'm able to have that much success outside government … then I feel it really important to work to be inside government to be inside government and it get it functioning again.”
Haberman, 43, has not previously held public office but helped lead the statewide campaign to ban smoking in public spaces, which was signed into law in 2009.
He also successfully challenged the state law prohibiting alcohol sales on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and on Sunday mornings, arguing it was an unconstitutional. That change took effect in 2010.
“We hear a lot about complaining government regulation is bad,” Haberman said. “What I learned is bad regulation is bad and good protection is good.”
In his emotional campaign announcement video, Haber speaks about a bomb threat made against his daughters' Jewish preschool and how the children were corralled into a gymnasium where parents' couldn't reach them temporarily.
“It's crystal clear why this is happening now,” Haberman, who is Jewish, says before the video moves to footage of the Charlottesville white supremacist rally and a clip of President Donald Trump saying the media had treated the supremacists “unfairly.”
“People have a choice of how they're going to contribute to make things better,” he says in the video. “The options are to be silent and do nothing, complain and do nothing, or stand up and fight back. And I think a lot of people are standing up and fighting back, and that's where I find myself.”
Haberman's grandparents started Haberman Fabrics. He graduated from the University of Michigan and Georgetown University Law School before returning to Michigan to serve as general counsel to his brother Jeremy's live music venue, the Magic Bag. The pair also opened a lounge called The Bosco next door before Jeremy passed away in 2014.
Haberman now maintains a limited entertainment and real estate law practice, as a boutique co-working space called Byte & Mortar Offices.
Haberman left the hospitality industry for more family-friendly hours about five years ago when he opened a boutique co-working, space in Troy, Byte and Mortar Offices, which services more than 100 companies.
Trott, who is serving his second term, said last month he would not seek reelection in 2018. The open seat in Michigan's 11th District has been rated a toss-up by Cook Political Report and other political handicappers.
On the Democratic side, two Democrats previously declared in the 11th District – Haley Stevens, former chief of staff to Obama's Auto Task Force, and Fayrouz Saad, Detroit's former director of immigration affairs.
“I think that you're seeing that more Democrats are trying to work the business outsider perspective, given the success of Donald Trump,” said Susan Demas of Inside Michigan Politics, offering another example in Ann Arbor entrepreneur and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Shri Thanedar.
Demas said the test for Haberman will be whether he can prove a serious candidate through fund-raising and boosting his name recognition in the district.
“Obviously, a lot of people don't know him, and there's already two Democratic candidates who have been in the race for some time,” she said. “So he has burden of explaining the need to run and why he wasn't running before when there was an incumbent in the race.”

Indiana lawmakers prompted debate at the Statehouse Thursday over potential conflicts of interest for local officials who approve large wind energy projects.
County commissions and planning boards approve wind farm developments in Indiana. Rep. Dave Ober (R-Albion) says in some cases, those commissioners have also signed lease agreements with developers and would benefit from a project's approval.
“I see a very large issue with that and I hope we can work on that issue next year,” Ober said to start the hearing.
One such commissioner is Benton County's Bruce Buchanan, who testified before the committee.
“It was good for the county and I was all for it,” Buchanan says.
Benton and White counties generate the most wind energy in Indiana. Buchanan also says revenue from the county's wind developments is crucial to its budget.
“We would not have paramedics today if it were not for wind mills,” says Buchanan.
The committee heard from dozens of Hoosiers about how wind farms affect—or don't—property values, health, and county budgets.
Three Indiana school districts also asked the committee to exempt schools from a bill passed earlier this year that changed the state's so-called net metering rules.
Starting next year, new solar panel owners will receive less money for selling energy back to the electrical grid.
But schools around the state are starting to invest in solar to defray energy costs and direct more money to educating students, says Mill Creek Superintendent Jim Diagostino.
“We will save our tax payers just under $1 million dollars, and the savings to the environment are priceless,” says Diagostino.
Officials from Tri-Creek School Corporation in Lake County and Center Grove School Corporation in Johnson County also testified before the committee.
The districts also asked – if the legislature doesn't exempt schools from the law – to extend the date it goes into effect, beyond December 31.
Tri-Creek Superintendent Deb Howe also asked the committee to remove local zoning hurdles to building solar arrays on school property, a problem her district encountered.
“We've managed to get through all these because, in the long run, the school district and the community believed this was in the best interest of our students,” Howe says.
The legislative committee will meet once more this month before issuing a report to the general assembly.
Sometimes choosing sunglasses could be difficult. There are those which looks cool but when worn they don't fit right. It would take a longer time before you can catch the right one. But here's how you can settle for good enough. The name is Skelmet.
Skelmet makes getting the pair of the perfect sunglasses for you easier. It ensures the one looking for a good and comfortable pair of sports sunglasses by providing fully customized 3D-printed sunglasses. Do you have a big nose and uneven ears? Please don't get mad. Whether you are an adult one or a kid Skelmet's innovative Falcon 1 sunglasses are made to fit your head perfectly. This is a complement of scanning software and a 3-D printer, 3D Print reported.
Skelmet COO Rain Wang told Digital Trends that it includes every single person because there is no such thing as sizes. "Whatever your head looks like, that's what the product is going to be like", he added.

According to Digital Trends, Skelmet uses a process called 3D fit technology to obtain the perfect custom sizing. The 3D scan analyzes 86 key points on a person's head. Your phone can help by using Skelmet's app, but Skelmet still studying if they should let people scan themselves because it might lead to inaccurate glasses.
Skelmet prints custom sunglasses because there are so many different shapes of heads. Since those people who are looking for nice sunglasses go to stores, Skelmet partners with stores. This will further provide better quality scans.
Say for example when cyclists go to a bike shop which is a partner of Skelmet, or a hiker goes to an outdoors shop, a trained associates will take care of the scans. When Skelmet surveyed over 500 people including cyclists and motorcyclists, they found out that over 75 percent would want to go somewhere to get it done, or ask someone come to their home and do the scan. Scans certainly will be good enough.
An EOS P110 3D printer uses nylon plastic powder to form the frames once the scan is ready. Then, a laser fuses the material together and a custom pair of sunglasses are formed. It would weigh only 17 grams. This makes the Falcon 1 the lightest sunglasses available and 30 percent lighter than the comparable Oakley Flak Jacket glasses.
Skelmet is also partnering with Essilor, the world's largest lens supplier for best frames with quality lenses. Skelmet may recommend suggestions based on customer's needs or it would let people pick the lenses they want. Available lenses are polarized, tinted, mirrored, single vision, progressive, or transition. They are also interchangeable.

As the world's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency is responsible for ensuring nuclear energy is used for peaceful purposes. That has rarely been easy.
Established as an agency of the United Nations in 1957, the IAEA has been at the center of one of the world's biggest nonproliferation crises — in Iran, where its inspectors are monitoring the 2015 nuclear deal. They are barred from the other, in North Korea, which kicked the agency out in 2009.
Director-General Yukiya Amano, a Japanese diplomat, has led the agency since 2009 and was recently elected to a third term. In a recent interview, he defended the IAEA's inspections program in Iran and said worries over weapons distracted attention from constructive applications of nuclear energy. Here are excerpts from the conversation.
Are you disappointed when critics of the Iran deal question the IAEA's ability to monitor Iran's nuclear program?
We are a technical organization and I am discharging my responsibilities based on rules, based on the IAEA standard safeguards practice. We simply keep on working and monitoring and verifying the nuclear-related commitments made by Iran under the [nuclear deal] in an impartial, objective and professional manner. So, whatever happens, we keep on working.

Are you inspecting Iranian military sites?
When we identify the need, we seek access to the locations. We don't make a difference between civilian and military locations, [but] we don't discuss details of where we go.
Iranian officials insist that military sites are off-limits, when you're saying that isn't the case. Are those comments unhelpful?
We hear many remarks, not only from Iran, but from other countries too. But our job is to analyze the facts. Facts mean nuclear material and facilities related to nuclear material. The function and objective of the IAEA is not to analyze remarks.
The IAEA has produced seven reports on Iran's compliance with the nuclear deal, but critics say you're being too soft on Iran and not providing enough details.
The information collected by inspectors must be kept confidential. These people complain that they don't have information related to Iran, but they don't have information about Germany, Japan or Kenya either. It's like a doctor. People go to a doctor with the understanding that he won't disclose sensitive information.
Explainer: What the Iran nuclear agreement means »
But you have the discretion to decide what to release. If the Iran inspections are going smoothly, why not disclose more information to respond to your critics?
Discretion means when I have a good reason. It doesn't mean the director-general can do whatever he likes to do. When there is concern of a violation, and when there is a U.N. resolution, yes. But it is not the practice that some countries ask more and I say, “Let's give more,” or, “Let's give less.”
If President Trump puts more pressure on Iran, will IAEA inspectors lose the access they currently enjoy?
It's very difficult to foresee what will happen. As we are a technical organization … speculation does not make sense for us. We have cameras, we have [electronic equipment] seals, we have inspectors, so we are factual and impartial and that is our advantage.
What is the IAEA doing in North Korea, where the last inspectors were thrown out in 2009?
We are observing the North Korean nuclear program through satellite imagery and collecting open source information. I decided to establish a small team in August with the objective to enhance our capability to monitor the North Korean nuclear program and enhance our readiness to go back to North Korea. I don't mean that I see an immediate opportunity. It's obvious the situation is very serious and grave. Their nuclear program is making progress. Therefore, we need to update the training of our inspectors, procure the necessary equipment and make a verification plan … so that if we are authorized, we can send our inspectors at short notice.

Nuclear power produces less carbon than fossil fuels. How can it help combat climate change?
The amount of carbon dioxide emissions that the use of nuclear energy can reduce — it's equivalent to the amount emitted by India or Russia. That is a huge amount. Thirty countries use nuclear power for the time being, and about 30 more are interested. In countries where people feel the effects of climate change, where we need to develop new plant varieties, if we apply gamma rays, we can accelerate plant mutations and identify the right crop varieties that are resistant to disease. Ocean acidification has become a huge problem all over the world, but if you observe radiation coming from isotopes, you can diagnose the health of oceans and that is very helpful to establish the response.
But in your home country, Japan, the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi disaster turned public opinion against nuclear energy. What needs to happen to restore public confidence?
There was a belief in Japan that a serious nuclear accident would not happen. Preparedness and response were not enough. The independence of the regulatory body was not enough. It has been reformed. A lot of measures were taken both in Japan and globally. All the countries that use nuclear power undertook stress tests to review if their plants would withstand severe natural hazards. They have taken measures where needed, and a lot of safety standards have been reviewed and strengthened.
We need to tell the public that nuclear energy can be very useful and can make a huge difference for the lives of ordinary people. Yukiya Amano, director-general, International Atomic Energy Agency
How does the agency promote nuclear power for uses people don't often consider, such as medicine?
Nuclear technology is very useful to achieve the U.N.'s sustainable development goals, for human health and animal health. Nuclear technology was helpful to diagnose Ebola and Zika, and nuclear medicine and radiotherapy are essential in certain medical areas, such as diagnosing foot-and-mouth disease in cattle. Just recently, we organized a seminar on how nuclear technology can diagnose early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. It allows us to look inside the human body with precision.
Is it a challenge to focus attention on those issues, when the world is worried about weapons programs?
We should pay maximum attention so that nuclear materials are not used for weapons purposes. That is our basic purpose. We need to tell the public that nuclear energy can be very useful and can make a huge difference for the lives of ordinary people.

CLOSE Karissa Matheson, a sr. at William Penn High School, created a way to collect, grow and learn about bacteria last year by collecting samples from chickens at the school. Her discovery is now used to teach students in microbiology. Jennifer Corbett/The News Journal

Margaret Adenusi focused her gaze on the chicken's feathery, feces-smeared derrière and tightened her grip on the long-handled cotton swab in her right hand.
She took a deep breath, preparing herself for what she had to do next.
This is not what the 17-year-old thought she'd be doing when she signed up for the Allied Health program at William Penn High School.
"No," she said, shaking her head.
Regardless, Adensusi was about to take a sample from the chicken's cloaca, the single posterior opening for a bird's digestive, urinary and reproductive tracts, used to both expel feces and lay eggs.
"It's not something you get to do every day," student Lizzy Simmons said, wrinkling her nose slightly but smiling. "I was kind of excited when I heard we were going to do it."

The class planned on taking bacteria found on the chickens' rear ends and growing it in the lab. Once the bacteria multiply, the students will be able to observe them under a microscope and identify them.

Allied Health teacher Jordan Hudson expected to see species like salmonella and E. coli, which can cause zoonotic diseases. The term refers to infections and illnesses that can be transferred between animals and humans.
Every year, tens of thousands of Americans get sick from such diseases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People may come into contact with animals carrying harmful bacteria at county fairs, farms or petting zoos, but animals are also a major source of food and provide meat, dairy and eggs.
In September, a Sussex County girl got swine flu after petting a pig at a Maryland county fair.

About one in 6 Americans gets sick from eating contaminated food, according to CDC. The agency warns against unsafe products, such as unpasteurized milk, undercooked meat or eggs, or unwashed fruits and vegetables, which can be contaminated with feces from an infected animal.
Hudson said the hands-on lab helps demonstrate the dangers of ignoring CDC recommendations and guidelines.
"They always say you should cook your chicken all the way, but why?" she said. "This just reaffirms it."

Her students seemed to get the message. They donned thick, rubber boots and waded into the school's onsite chicken pen to catch their test subjects, before gingerly collecting their samples.
Lauren Sleitweiler, 17, was one of several students to actually handle the chickens and said her test subject kept flapping its wings.
"When I signed up for lab, like, you never think you're going to be out on a farm looking at chickens," she said. "But it was really fun and it was a great experience and helped me further my knowledge on microbiology."
The lab itself was inspired by Karissa Matheson, a senior, who took similar samples for an end-of-year project last spring. As part of the school's FFA team, she won honors at both the state fair and National FFA Agriscience Fair.
Buy Photo Brian North, 17, a junior at William Penn High School, covers his face while taking a sample from the anus of a chicken while learning about bacteria growth in his microbiology class. (Photo: Jennifer Corbett, The News Journal)
"I wanted to do a cross-curricular thing," she said. "My teacher thought since it was a relatively easy project and was really-hands on ... that she would just make it into an actual class."
Hudson said in addition to learning about microbiology, her class will prepare detailed lab reports for the school's agriscience students.
If it turns out the chickens have any rare bacteria or diseases, they'll be treated appropriately, helping secure the health and future of the whole flock.
That's just one example of the real-life applications sampling chickens has, Hudson said. The lab also provides hands-on experience to health students interested in becoming veterinarians.
"We do have students that have a foot in both worlds," she said.

Duran is accused of entering false warnings in a computer system that tracks border crossings, including notations that the Mexican man was known to carry guns or was linked to drug traffickers. The warnings caused border authorities to stop the man several times as he crossed, sometimes with his family, prosecutors said.
A New England Patriots fan saw his dream come true Sunday morning.
Bill Duggan, who served his community as a volunteer firefighter in New York for more than four decades, will be attending Super Bowl LII in Minneapolis in February.
NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell stopped by the Tarrytown Fire Dept. on Sunday to present Duggan with four tickets to the Super Bowl.
Duggan is battling Stage 4 brain cancer, and one of his friends started a GoFundMe page in an effort to raise money for his Super Bowl ticket. With the tickets, Duggan gets his chance to live out his dream as he continues his fight.
"I am a big patriot fan," told WABC-TV in New York. "But I just want to go to the Super Bowl."
ISLAMABAD, Jul 4 (APP):The world's first fee-free university will be operational next month in Pakistan with 600 students enrolled for three different master degrees.
Dr Mohammed Amjad Saqib, executive director of Akhuwat, a micro-finance firm offering interest-free loans (Qarz-e-Hasna) in Pakistan, told Khaleej Times that the institute will be opened in Kasur district, near Lahore, on August 14, 2018.
“We are establishing the first fee-free university in Pakistan where students will not have to pay any fee. This is some kind of long-term Qarz-e-Hasan. First you get education and pay after 5, 10 or 20 years, when you are able to return it; because remember that you got education but didn't pay for it; but now when you have a job you can pay so that somebody else can also benefit,” he said.
Dr Amjad Saqib added that “education is ultimate solution of our problems. We can't progress and compete with international community unless we are ahead in education. But it is a pity that a boy coming from a poor family may be able to complete 10-year education but can't receive higher education. We are not doing justice with our talent”.
He pointed out that this residential university will be a national institute where 20 per cent of students will come from each province of Pakistan.
Akhuwat is already running a fee-free college in Lahore, housing more than 300 students from all provinces.
It offers pre-medical, pre-engineering and ICT courses.
To get entry into the college, a student must obtain 75 per cent marks in matriculation examination followed by an examination conducted at the college.
After spending three years in Finland with the TPS Turku organization, Russian goalie Alexander Georgiev was signed to an entry-level contract in July by the New York Rangers. In this exclusive interview, Georgiev talks about his move to North America, his prospects in New York and his early career.
The Hockey Writers reached the Russian goalkeeper in Turku where he is practicing for the upcoming season.
“I just started practicing on ice, earlier it was just off-ice training,” Georgiev explained. “I am not sure about the exact date that I will fly to New York. Most likely in late August.”
He was also open about his plans for the summer: “Before leaving for New York, I will practice with my personal trainer. Many Finn players from the NHL practice in Turku. But not only, also players from the Finnish Elite League. For example [Rasmus] Ristolainen, [Patrik] Laine, [Lauri] Korpikoski, [Mikko Rantanen]. More or less everyone who is willing to pay (laughs).”
First Steps in Hockey
Georgiev liked to talk about his childhood. “I was born in Bulgaria, but my parents left almost right away for Russia. When I was five, my parents decided to get me involved in sports, and they chose hockey.” The goalie recalls very well his first reaction to the sport: “It was love at first sight!”
He started playing hockey for the local team Penguins, the same team that developed Tampa Bay prospect Alexander Volkov. He didn't play goalie at the start though. “At first, we just skated all together, no one had a true role. Then when we were six or seven years old the coaches asked each kid who wanted to play in goal, and I wanted to give it a try.”
The goalie then moved to Voskresensk and started playing for the local Khimik junior team, once a strong team that hasn't managed to get back to its heydey (their alumni include Andrei Markov, Vladislav Namestnikov, and Slava Kozlov). After playing in kids leagues, Georgiev spent a full season in the MHL without being iced a single time. “It was very hard for me. The team had two older goalies, one older than me by four years, the other one by three and the coaches decided to bet on them.” (Note: both already quit playing). At the end of the season, Georgiev left his native Russia to start a new chapter in his life and career.
Moving to Finland
“At the end of my season in MHL, I had a chance for a tryout in Finland. I was very happy about it and decided to try.” The Bulgaria-native said that at those times he wasn't interested in seeking other opportunities in the domestic market.
In his new home, he found differences almost right away: “In the training process, there were some obvious differences. In particular, a different approach to the offseason. And also, there are different exercises in the off-ice practice. For example, I first met the ‘power clean' practice in Finland. In Russia, we ran a lot more during the offseason. Each morning we would be ordered to run for eight kilometers. And that was just the warm-up.”
There were many things to adapt to in hockey, but for his off-ice life he had some helping hands: “I had three persons in the main team who knew Russian, two Czechs and one Lithuanian. In the junior team, however, no one was talking in Russian. But I talk a good English, therefore, I had no problems.”
After playing three years in Finland, and representing Team Russia at the 2016 WJC in Finland, Georgiev was signed by the New York Rangers to an entry-level contract. But rather than an achievement, this is a new starting point for the netminder: “[Signing with the Rangers] I got a lot closer to fulfilling my dreams,” he said.
During the July rookie camp, Georgiev had a chance to work directly with the team's goaltending coach Benoit Allaire. “I worked with him only a few days, but he managed to give me some good precious advice regarding my technique. I can't wait to start working with him again, I'm sure that he'll have a lot of interesting stuff to teach me.”
Georgiev and the New York Rangers
Georgiev is truly thrilled about being part of the Rangers organization. “On the one hand, it's maybe better not to get drafted at all, as you can freely choose the team to play for. But on the other hand, if you get drafted the team is somewhat expecting you and will then try to prepare you to fit their team.”
Playing in the AHL doesn't scare Georgiev: “I will start next year playing in the AHL. I'm ready to play in that league, play well and waiting for my chance in the NHL.” The goalie also said he did not have any offer from KHL teams. “I haven't heard from [KHL teams]. And also right now I'm only thinking about the Rangers.”
Earlier, the New York-based team signed the defenseman Alexei Bereglazov, and the lineup also features Russian forward Pavel Buchnevich and defenseman Sergei Zborovskiy. “I befriended Alexei Bereglazov during the development camp. And I also knew Sergei Zborovskiy, with whom I played at the WJC. He is also under contract with the Rangers. I haven't met Buchnevich yet.”
At this point, Georgiev is probably just a couple of years from making the Rangers' lineup. As King Henrik is getting older, it's vital for them to explore new goaltending options.

India completed a comprehensive whitewash over Sri Lanka at Pallekele More
As expected, Sri Lanka failed to put on even a semblance of a fight on the third day of the final Test, stumbling to an innings defeat to complete a humiliating whitewash. After another big first innings score, much like the first two Tests, the Indian bowlers hardly gave the Lankan batsmen a chance to survive.
India unearthed a new gem in Hardik Pandya, while proven stars like Ravichandran Ashwin, Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane strengthened their reputation by stitching strong performances away from home.
Here are all the numbers from the final day of the series:
0 - Before today, Sri Lanka had never lost two consecutive Tests by an innings at home.
1 - This is the first time India have whitewashed the opposition in an away Test series of 3 or more matches.
2 - This win (innings and 171 runs) is India's second biggest away win. The previous best was against Bangladesh (innings and 239 runs), at Dhaka 10 years ago.
2 - Virat Kohli is now second on the list of captains with the most wins after their first 29 Tests at the helm. In comparison to Kohli's 19 wins, Ricky Ponting and Steve Waugh had 21 Test wins each.
2 - This was only the second time that Sri Lanka have been whitewashed at home. The previous instance was against Australia in 2004.
3 - This is the third time no individual has scored a 50 in a home Test for Sri Lanka. The previous instances were (at least one completed innings):
vs Pak, Kandy, 1986
vs SA, SSC, 1993
4 - This was the fourth instance that Sri Lanka had lost a home Test inside three days. The last time it happened was against Pakistan at Kandy in 2006.
5 - India have now managed to win their last five Tests in Sri Lanka. However, Sri Lanka are yet to win a Test match in India.
5 - This is the fifth whitewash by India in a Test series with three or more Tests.
8 - This is the eighth time a visiting side have whitewashed the hosts in a series featuring three or more Tests. The last time it happened was when Australia humiliated South Africa in 2006.
9 - With nine wins, India (24 games) are the most successful away Test side in Sri Lanka, beating Pakistan's record of eight wins.
37.53 - Sri Lanka's difference of 37.53 between batting and bowling averages is the highest for them in a home series (2+ Tests). The previous was 30.14 versus Pakistan in 1994.

African national oil companies (NOCs) need to evolve for the future in light of a challenging and disruptive environment: PwC analysis
African countries that have for decades depended on their national oil company as a key source of revenue will need to rethink business models and strategies to avoid being captive to a single energy source and to allow them to rebalance budgets.
NOCs across Africa have an enormous opportunity to secure a more sustainable future by transforming into “national energy companies” (‘NECs'), escaping the economic trap of a lower oil price and embracing the disruptive forces unleashed by climate change and a lowcarbon world.
A new era of lower oil prices is challenging business models that have long relied largely on exploration and production of hydrocarbons, particularly ‘black gold' oil. This is likely to prompt African countries that have for decades depended on their NOC as a key source of revenue to rethink the “nation-building” role that their NOCs have played.
In turn, the sustainability of NOCs will depend on their ability to transform into NECs, responding to the demands placed on them by consumers, governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to respond to climate change and a new energy future.
Chris Bredenhann, PwC (www.PwC.com) Africa Advisory Oil & Gas Leader, says: “Globally, the energy sector is experiencing significant change and upheaval. Whether it is in oil & gas or utilities, we are witnessing tectonic shifts in strategies, business models and ways of working.”
“Whether we are talking about fledgling NOCs with limited hydrocarbon resources or established NOCs sitting on large reserves, all of these companies will need to work out how to seize the opportunities emerging from this disruption.”
These are some of the highlights from an analysis by PwC titled ‘The new Nation Builders: Creating the African national oil company (NOC) of the future' released today. In this paper, we look at the challenges of disruption facing African NOCs, what it means to them and how they should position themselves for a sustainable future.
“After all, not only do African NOCs have to navigate this disruption and tackle the challenges of uncertainty, as do their international oil company (IOC) counterparts, but given their sovereign importance as nation builders they must also identify the future pathways to evolve,” says Bredenhann.
African NOCs: from nation builders to national energy companies
African countries that have for decades depended on their national oil company as a key source of revenue will need to rethink business models and strategies to avoid being captive to a single energy source and to allow them to rebalance budgets.
However, in most cases, the new low oil price environment is likely to force many governments to consider what the most appropriate mandate should be for an NOC. Some projects may not proceed as originally planned due to the lower oil price environment.
Accordingly, NOCs will have to carry out assessments of where their strengths may lie and of potential revenue streams. This will become an increasing priority with the emergence of social and political challenges amid slowing regional economies.
According to our analysis, we think it is still possible to stay true to a nation-building mission, while adapting business models to the current environment.There is an opportunity to reinvent the NOC – whether established or fledgling – as a national energy company and in the process reinvent what nation-building itself can mean for the energy sector in Africa.
The report identifies three key factors which established NOCs should consider in order to diversify and grow beyond the historical reliance on oil: rapid moves globally towards an increasingly low-carbon energy industry; meeting the burgeoning demand for domestic power; and a need to meet crude and refined product requirements through storage and transport in domestic African countries.
To move towards this vision, NOCs may need to adopt partnership models to transform and operate successfully as NECs. In a budget-constrained environment with reduced access to resources and capabilities, partnering with IOCs will be key to delivering change. NOCs will also need to engage more widely with regulators and governments in order to ensure that they are playing an active role in the industry.
1. Low carbon
NOCs might profitably focus on ensuring a supply of energy from multiple lowcarbon sources. The shift towards lower carbon is already taking place in a number of mature western markets. Similarly in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia has implemented a number of initiatives to boost the country's non-oil revenue. In some instances, gas may be a bridge to a cleaner and more sustainable source of energy. Gas has been discovered in abundance across the African continent, and some NOCs are already exploiting it.
2. Domestic power needs
While African economies have slowed in the past two years, the medium and long-term needs for domestic power generation are enormous. The report recommends that where gas exists as a resource, NOCs should consider forming internal and external partnerships to guarantee gas offtake for national power production. Significant shifts to move towards gas have recently taken place in countries like Nigeria, Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire.
3. Storage and transport
Another potential role for NOCs outside the upstream and downstream space lies in midstream. NOCs should think about investing in storage facilities or pipelines. They need to also contemplate forming equity partnerships in large projects rather than taking on all of the risk themselves.
For fledgling NOCs, the above factors make it all the more important that their sponsor governments carefully assess the rationale for establishing and developing national champions in oil & gas – and find the right model for this new environment.
The report highlights six NOCs at various stages of maturity in Namibia, Ghana, Nigeria, Algeria, Angola and Mozambique.
The role of digital in reshaping business models
African NOCs should think about where and how best to invest in digitisation as they redefine their business models. Digitally-enabled technology systems are expected to substantially reduce the cost-per-barrel of future hydrocarbon resource exploitation.
It is notable that the sector has been slower than other industries to adopt digital solutions and has tended to focus rather on increasing production and recovery throughout the years. However, the new era of low oil is now forcing operators to shift focus from top-line to bottom-line growth, towards improving cost structures and margins in order to be competitive in current conditions and prioritising efficiency gains over production growth.
Digital also has a role in renewables and in shifting towards a lowcarbon energy industry. “Digital is no longer an enabler but a game changer,” Bredenhann adds. “African oil & gas organisations that respond to the need for reshaped business models by building digital capabilities will be well-positioned to win in the new market reality.”
Preparing for the future
As NOCs go through this major period of disruption, they will need to assess their current business models and strategies in order to build a sustainable NOC of the future. “In addition, they should consider partnering with international oil companies to develop the kind of capabilities that best complement their strategies,” Bredenhann comments.
Lucknow: A CBI team on Saturday arrested a Central good and Service Tax (CGST) commissioner from Kanpur along with six others in a bribery case, officials said.
The commissioner named Sansar Chand is accused of taking bribes from businessmen on a monthly and quarterly basis.
Police said other than the accused official, some inspectors and a group of private persons used to exert pressure on some institutions and businessmen and fleece them for money.
In its report, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said that others who operated with Sansar Chand included Ajay Srivastava, Aman Shah, Rajiv Singh Chandel all three from Kanpur, and Amit Awasthi (from Rohini, Delhi), Aman Jain (Shivaji Park, Delhi) and Chandra Prakash (Punjabi Bagh, Delhi).
Wife of the arrested official Avinash Kaur has also been made an accused by the CBI. The agency has also accused the CGST commissioner of accepting highly expensive items, electronic goods at his Delhi residence from businessmen.
A source informed IANS that apparently the complaint was filed by a detergent manufacturer who was being asked to pay Rs 2 lakh per month to the commissioner.
Sansar Chand, a 1986 batch Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officer, resides in the Customs Colony in Gujaini area of Kanpur. He was arrested from Faizabad district of Uttar Pradesh while the others were arrested from the union capital. The CBI has also arrested office staff Saurabh Pandey and a private operator Manish Sharma in the case.
The CBI has alleged that Chand and other officials were part of organised and systematic collection of illegal gratification.
The excise officials contacted various people through middleman Awasthi for extorting illegal gratification.
These payments pertained to either monthly or quarterly payments as protection money for omission of action by the Central Excise Department on such private parties, the CBI said.
The money was collected by public servants and were transferred systematically through hawala channel to Delhi through Aman Jain.
In certain instances, the bribe would be in form of items like "mobiles, refrigerators and expensive TVs".
The probe agency has booked them under the charges of criminal conspiracy of Indian Penal Code and provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act.
Escalation Protocol is the new ritualized public event arena coming to “Destiny 2.” The new arena, which is centered on the Hive entombed on Mars, is part of the Warmind DLC releasing next month, Bungie design leads Ben Wommack and Jacob Benton unveiled during a live-stream Tuesday.
Like the Archon's Forge feature in the original “Destiny,” Escalation Protocol is designed for continuous play — something players can jump into and challenge themselves with several waves of encounters, each with a specific boss battle that will rotate weekly. Armor, perks, and weapon rewards for the activity are unique to Escalation Protocol, offering players greater incentive to participate in timed events happening in the game world.
The activity presents a greater challenge than past public events in “Destiny 2,” calling for the sort of coordination and pre-planning usually reserved for raids. Escalation Protocol is the first new endgame mode revealed for the Warmind expansion.
Tune into the live-stream or watch archived clips at twitch.tv/bungie.
Tuesday during a live-stream on Twitch, which began at 1 p.m. Eastern, developers at Bungie and Vicarious Vision unveiled Warmind, the second expansion for “Destiny 2.” The Warmind DLC is slated for release on May 8, 2018, and will kick off the game's third season of content updates. According to Bungie's current development roadmap for the game, Season 3 will introduce a reworked loadout system and randomized weapons — two changes regularly asked for by the community — as well as features called “gear collections” and “records.”
Police are warning drivers that using new gin and tonic ice lollies to cool off could land them in hot water.
The lollies, in gin and tonic, prosecco and peach bellini, have become more popular as the British weather hots up, but each has an alcohol content of around 4.5%.
With the same content as your average pint, police officers are warning drivers that they need to make sure they stick to the legal limits – like they would with alcoholic drinks.
The lollies are a new trend for the summer and officers who see the devastating effects of drink driving are concerned that in ice form, drivers could be lulled into a false sense of security.
The reminder comes as part of a national summer drink and drug drive campaign.
Acting Inspector Harry Simpson from the Cleveland and Durham Operations Unit said: “These lollies are becoming really popular and it's easy to forget that they contain alcohol and aren't just flavouring.
"On a hot summer's day it is easy to lose count of how many you have, and then get behind the wheel of a car.
“If you wouldn't consider drinking a gin and tonic or cocktail when driving, then you shouldn't consider having one of these lollies.
"We always recommend that drivers refrain from any alcohol as the effects differ depending on age, weight and metabolism and to check packaging to understand if there is any alcohol in what they are eating or drinking.”
Fourteen Rastafarians have been arrested in Mchinji for protesting the arrest of fellow Rastafarians who were found cultivating cannabis sativa.
Mchinji police publicist Inspector Kaitano Lubrino said police on January 31 acted on a tip-off and arrested two members of the Rastafarian religion for cultivating Indian hemp in their respective gardens.
He further said the arrests did not go well with the Rastafarian folks who later in the next morning of February 1 went to the Police Unit to rescue their member.
“A commotion started as the grouping removed the police flag and replaced it with their Rastafarian flag at the Police Unit.
“This prompted the police from the parent station to beef up manpower to the Unit and in the process twelve irate people were arrested for the offence of misconduct at a police station,” said Lubrino.
The publicist further said one of the suspects identified as Ras Meshach Banda (52) who also act as the eldest of the religious gathering in the area argued with the police that there is no problem using Chamba.
He further said using marijuana staff either through smoking, eating as relish or drinking as tea is their key for exaltations and sacrifice for Jah.
In Malawi, according to regulation 4 (a) of dangerous drugs as read with section 19 subsection 1 of Dangerous Drugs Act, it is an offence to cultivate or to be found in possession of cannabis sativa and this act provides a maximum penalty of K5 000 000 fine or 14 years imprisonment with hard labor if one is found guilty.
The suspects are expected to appear before court soon to answer charges of cultivating chamba and misconduct at a police station respectively.
The suspects are; Mishack Banda aged 52, Yohane Boniface, 25, Daniel Zulu, 21, Simioni Mwale aged 27, Zambika Masoadyera aged 25, Langizo Siliya aged 24, Chadza Phiri aged 23, Patrick Mmango aged 22, Gelesomo Chemili, 35, Kabungwe Mwale aged 35, Meshach John aged 24, Jonathan Sakale aged 22, John Biliati aged 20 and Mathews Sitolo.

UPDATE: This launch has been moved and is now targeting the backup window of Wednesday, December 13 at 8:24 AM PST (11:24 AM EST). The live stream will be available 15 minutes prior to that time above.
SpaceX is launching a space station resupply mission later this morning, with an instantaneous launch window opening at 8:46 AM PST (11:46 AM EST) from its LC-40 launch site at Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force base.
The mission is a historic first for SpaceX – it's the first time that the private space company will launch a refurbished, previously launched Dragon spacecraft using a Falcon 9 first stage booster that has also already been flown before. In other words, it'll be the closest SpaceX has come yet to its vision of totally reusable space launch operations.
The Falcon 9 booster being used today few during a previously ISS resupply mission, CRS-11 earlier this year in June, and the Dragon was flown in 2015 during another commercial resupply effort. The cargo today is around 4,800 pounds of supplies and scientific experimentation support material for research being conducted on the ISS.
Dragon will stay at the ISS for around a month docked for unloading and reloading with return cargo from the ISS, before returning to Earth, and SpaceX will also try to recover the Falcon 9 first stage once again with a landing at its LZ-1 facility at Cape Canaveral.
There's a backed window set for 8:24 AM PST (11:24 AM EST) tomorrow, should the launch today need to be postponed. The live stream above should begin around 15 minutes prior to the scheduled launch window, or at around 11:30 AM PST.
LONDON — British police declared a major incident Wednesday after a man and a woman were exposed to an unknown substance close to the city of Salisbury, where a Russian former spy and his daughter were poisoned with nerve agent four months ago.
Emergency services were called to the town of Amesbury in Wiltshire county in southern England, after the pair, both in their 40s, were found unconscious in a property Saturday evening.
“They are both currently receiving treatment for suspected exposure to an unknown substance at Salisbury District Hospital. They are both in a critical condition,” Wiltshire Police said in a statement.
Police said the two were initially thought to have used heroin or crack cocaine from a contaminated batch of drugs, but that more testing was now being carried out to determine the nature of the substance.
British tabloid newspaper The Sun reported that the two were poisoned and that samples were sent to Porton Down, the nearby government laboratory, for testing.
The Sun reported that security chiefs fear that they could have been poisoned with same batch of Soviet-developed nerve agent used on Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, who were found unresponsive on a bench about 10 miles away in Salisbury on March 4.

London's Metropolitan Police Service said that counterterrorism officers were working with local police on the investigation, “given the recent events in Salisbury."
The places the Amesbury pair — whose identities weren't immediately released — frequented before they became ill have been cordoned off in Amesbury and Salisbury as a precaution and police patrols have increased. The Sun reported that they are not known to have any links to Russia or security services.
Public health officials said there is not believed to be a significant health risk to the public, but this “will be continually assessed as further information becomes known.”

Britain says the Skripals were poisoned with Novichok nerve agent and blames Russia. The Kremlin denies any responsibility. Sergei Skripal was jailed in Russia in 2006 for passing state secrets to Britain. He was released as part of a spy swap in 2010 and moved to Salisbury.
That poisoning incident has soured relations between Russia and many British allies including the expulsion of hundreds of diplomats on both sides.
Yulia was discharged from Salisbury District Hospital in April and her father was discharged from the same hospital in May. Both were taken to an undisclosed location for their protection.

A clemency case handled by a Ballard Spahr LLP attorney is the subject of a documentary that won an Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival.
Attorney Marjorie J. Peerce, a while-collar defense partner in the firm's New York office, was in charge of a team that handled a clemency petition for Cindy Shank, a pro bono client who sentenced to 15 years in prison for a first-time, nonviolent drug-related offense, according to a press release.
The documentary, “The Sentence”, is about Shank's incarceration, its impact on her three daughters and the family's efforts to lobby for sentencing reform. It is directed by first-time filmmaker Rudy Valdez, Shank's brother. Valdez began making the film as a way to record his nieces' childhoods while Shank was in prison, according to the release
The documentary also has a deal with HBO for U.S. television and streaming rights, Variety reported.
Peerce also appears in the film and was a part of a working group that created Clemency Project 2014, a reform effort under the Obama administration that addressed mandatory sentencing laws of the 1990s and 2000s.
More than 100 Ballard Spahr attorneys represented pro bono clients as part of Clemency Project 2014. It filed petitions for 81 clients, of which 29 were granted, the firm said.
What started out as a lighthearted interaction turned into something that left one driver inspired and two hitchhikers with a little more money in their pockets, even if they weren't any closer to their final destination.
Dwayne Gaulding was in Troutman, N.C., last week on his way to Virginia. That's where the former NASCAR team owner crossed paths with a pair of hitchhikers.
One of the hitchhikers was carrying a sign that read "77 South," while the other was holding a ukulele. Gaulding, the father of NASCAR Monster Energy Cup Series driver Gray Gaulding, stopped to "have a little fun with these guys," he wrote on social media.
Gaulding documented the interaction with a video, which he shared on Facebook.

"Got a couple of guys here laughing, having a good time," Gaulding said to the camera while talking to the hitchhikers, who told him they were from Georgia, originally, but were looking to get to Greenville. "You've got a sign that says 77 South. I'm headed north, to Virginia, so I'm no help to you guys."
While the hitchhiker with the ukelele was about to move along on what was clearly a bright, hot day, Gaulding offered a counterproposal.
"But, I don't know if y'all know a little 'Wagon Wheel?' If you play a little 'Wagon Wheel,' I might be able to help you with a little ... money."
On Facebook, Gaulding said that "Wagon Wheel" is his father's favorite song. So when these two disheveled, sweaty hitchhikers delivered a melodic and sweet rendition just for Gaulding, he was more than pleasantly surprised.
"Trust me they killed it!" Gaulding wrote.
He did more than offer the hitchhikers praise. He gave them some money for the roadside performance.
"Best 20$ I have spent in a long time!" Gaulding posted, adding a request for his followers. "Share this so these guys can inspire more people!"
As of Tuesday evening, the video had been viewed more than 36,000 times, while garnering thousands more shares, reactions and comments.
"With all the things going on in today's world, it's like give somebody a helping hand and good things will come back to you," Gaulding said of meeting the hitchhikers, according to wcnc.com. “Just be kind to people, show your love in your heart and good things go a long way."
One of the most wide-open and unpredictable awards seasons in memory came into slightly – but only slightly – sharper focus with the nominations for the Golden Globes.
A number of this year's early Oscar front-runners, including “The Shape of Water,” “The Post,” “Lady Bird,” “Dunkirk” and “Call Me By Your Name,” made strong showings, while potential contenders like “Get Out,” “All the Money in the World” and “I, Tonya” also received a boost.
“The Shape of Water,” a love story between a mute woman and a fish-man, led the pack with seven nominations, including best picture in the drama category as well as nods for stars Sally Hawkins, Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins and director and co-writer Guillermo del Toro.
Director Steven Spielberg's timely Pentagon Papers drama “The Post” and writer-director Martin McDonagh's dark morality tale “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” followed closely behind with six nods each.
But the Golden Globes can always be counted on to deliver their share of surprises, and the nominations announcement Monday morning by the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. brought a few — including a strong showing for director Ridley Scott's kidnapping drama “All the Money in the World,” which earned three nods, including one for actor Christopher Plummer, who replaced Kevin Spacey in the role of industrialist J. Paul Getty just last month in the wake of Spacey's sexual misconduct scandal.
On the television side, HBO's limited series “Big Little Lies” led the field with six nominations, including five nods for series cast members Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon, Shailene Woodley, Laura Dern and Alexander Skarsgard. FX's “Feud: Bette and Joan” followed with four.
Freshmen contenders were among the most nominated series, including three nominations for Hulu's Emmy champ “The Handmaid's Tale” and two each for Amazon's “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” and Showtime's “SMILF.”

With 2018 getting closer every day, so too is Marvel's Black Panther. That's all some people need to carry them through the holiday season and into the New Year, but if you need a little bit more motivation or just one more look at Ryan Coogler‘s highly anticipated superhero film, this new Japanese trailer is the thing to do it. It answers the question of why Wakanda has remained a hidden civilization for generations and why some would seek to turn its culture and technology to their own ends. Oh and this new video features a bunch of looks at Wakandan tech, weaponry, vehicles, buildings, and straight-up style. Enjoy!
Starring Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker, and Andy Serkis, Black Panther opens in theaters on February 16, 2018.
Check out the newly released Japanese trailer for Black Panther below:
Here's the official synopsis for Black Panther:
Marvel Studios' “Black Panther” follows T'Challa who, after the death of his father, the King of Wakanda, returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation to succeed to the throne and take his rightful place as king. But when a powerful old enemy reappears, T'Challa's mettle as king—and Black Panther—is tested when he is drawn into a formidable conflict that puts the fate of Wakanda and the entire world at risk. Faced with treachery and danger, the young king must rally his allies and release the full power of Black Panther to defeat his foes and secure the safety of his people and their way of life.
And for more on Black Panther, be sure to get caught up with our previous write-ups:
WINNIPEG — Today's technology should have us feeling more connected than ever before; but one therapist says in many ways we are disconnected. When it comes to romantic relationships there are common habits that do more harm than good – such as looking up an old flame when things aren't going smoothly with your significant other.
“Social media is a way to disengage from a relationship,” Carolyn Klassen, family and marriage therapist said.
“What that does be it pulls you out of being with the person who's right in front of you.”
RELATED: The good versus the bad: Technology's place in the lives of millennials
A panel of millennials interviewed by Global News said they've noticed the effects of constant phone use with all types of relationships.
WATCH: Panel of millennials answer questions about their generation
“We recognize that when we go out for dinner, we need to have that face-time and put the phones down,” Evan Bergen, Red River College student said. Bergen's wife sitting beside him laughed.
“He's on it a lot. And more than I would like. And it does cause tension in our relationship,” Tedi Gil Martin said.
RELATED: ‘I don't think it's fair': Millennials react to generational stereotypes
Klassen works with dozens of different clients and sees the results of spending too much time on social media, especially when it comes to comparing yourself to what others are doing online.
“It's very normal to have a life of ups and downs and sometimes there's not much happening,” Klassen said. “What social media does is it has people share the very lowest and the very highest. We see these points and we think people live in there.”
Millennials admit that constantly being exposed to their social network's highlight reels does affect how they value their own lives.
“I end up feeling really sad about my life a lot because I see friends travelling and feel I should be doing that too,” Gil Martin said.
However, one of the millennial panelists insists many positive results have come from his use of social media.
“Personally, I've found it really helpful in my life. I used social media and the motivation of seeing people transformation stories to lose a bunch of weight,” Taren Gesell, owner of P05t said.
With shiny screens and releases of dopamine constantly at the tips of their fingertips, Klassen said this hinders the millennial generations ability to relax.
“I think often without realizing it, if we have uncomfortable or painful feelings it's really easy to numb those feelings or distance ourselves from those feelings by going on social media or checking our phones,” Klassen said.
She recommends that in a time when social media is so prevalent, millennials should try being more deliberate about being mindful. Taking time to slow down, unplug and listen to your thoughts.

Mumbai: Banks' unsecured loan book has grown four times the bank credit during the past three years, helped by a rise in discretionary spending, technology-driven
disbursements and lower interest rates, says a report.
Unsecured loans are the loans where individual exposures are smaller and more distributed and given without any collaterals but banks get higher margins. Typically personal loan, education loans and credit card spend fall under this category of loans.
"Between fiscals 2015 and 2018, unsecured credit - comprising personal, small and medium enterprise (SME), and credit card loans - clocked a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27 percent, or almost four times growth in bank credit," Crisil said in a report on Wednesday.
As of March 2018, outstanding unsecured loans stood at around Rs 5 trillion, accounting for 26 percent of retail lending, compared to 21 percent three years ago.
Growth in unsecured loans is on account of a surge in discretionary spending, increased the availability of customer data, faster disbursements driven by technology, and lower interest rates in some segments.
The report said financiers are expected to focus more on this segment due to attractive yields.
Return on assets are 2.5-3 percent for personal and SME loans, and 3-4 percent for credit cards, compared to under 2 percent for home loans and new passenger vehicle loans, it said, adding rising competition has led to lower rates in some segments such as personal loans.
In unsecured SME loans, rates have remained sticky, but average tenure and commissions paid to direct selling agents have increased, it said.
Pak said she expects the summit to go forward because Trump is so invested, and the North Koreans are so determined that it happen. "Kim Yong Chol will dangle just enough in front of Pompeo [so] that he can go back to Trump and say, without lying, they're sincere," Pak said.
Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions said Monday that "too much has been read into" President Trump's statement Saturday amid violence at a protest in Charlottesville, Va., related to the removal of a Confederate monument.
Sessions told NBC's "Today" that Trump had "explicitly condemned" violence and that "he totally opposes" the values espoused by white supremacy organizations such as those that launched the protest. Trump had initially referenced violence "on many sides."
An excerpt of the interview was aired Monday.
Sessions said he expects Trump to say more, saying, "I think you'll hear that again today." He noted that the White House had expressly condemned white supremacy-driven violence in a statement Sunday.
Sessions told the network, "I think he will do what is correct. ... Facts have come out in the interim."
Sessions also said that he and FBI officials have a meeting scheduled with Trump on Monday, saying "we're on this case."
The same month that a viral video depicted a United Airlines passenger being dragged from his seat, complaints against airlines in the U.S. soared 70%.
A U.S. Department of Transportation report Wednesday showed that 1,909 complaints were filed in April against airlines flying in the U.S., up from 1,123 complaints in the same month last year.
Although flight delays and cancellations increased somewhat in April, the most likely cause of the complaint surge was the public reaction to the bloody incident April 9 that put a focus on the treatment of passengers by the nation's airlines.
David Dao, a passenger on a flight from Chicago to Louisville, Ky., was dragged from a seat and down the airplane aisle by airport security officers after refusing to give up the seat, which United wanted for an airline crew member. Dao suffered a broken nose, a concussion and lost two teeth in the incident.
United and Dao's attorneys reached a settlement over the incident but both sides declined to disclose the terms.
Paul Hudson, founder of the passenger rights group Flyersrights.org, said the Dao incident may have emboldened passengers to speak out about how airlines are treating them.
“A lot of people have realized that things are bad and that they can complain about it,” said Hudson, whose group has more than 60,000 members.
The biggest number of complaints filed in April were against American Airlines (324), followed by Delta Air Lines (297) and United (265), the federal report said. Low-cost carrier Spirit Airline had the highest rate of complaints, 7.2 complaints for every 100,000 passengers, compared with 3.04 complaints for every 100,000 passengers for United Airlines.
Most complaints were about flight problems such as cancellations and delays. Those complaints more than doubled in April, to 753 from 372 the year-earlier period, the federal agency said. Complaints about overbooking also more than doubled, to 89 from 42 in April 2016.
In April, 78.5% of all flights by U.S. carriers arrived on time, down from the 84.5% on-time rate a year earlier. The rate of canceled flights rose to 1.6% of all scheduled domestic flights from the 0.9% cancellation rate posted in April 2016, according to the agency.

New Delhi: The Railways is expected to post a 10 percent increase in total revenue this fiscal, according to its Member (Traffic). This would be possible due to a spike in coal loading and strong “showing” in passenger category.
So the Railways is expected to earn a total revenue of Rs 1.8 lakh crore in 2017-18. Two figures should put this number in perspective: First, total revenue in 2016-17 for the Railways was Rs 1.65 lakh crore, widely off the mark compared to the revenue target set out at the beginning of that fiscal year at Rs 1.89 lakh crore. This translated to a shortfall of about Rs 24,000 crore.
Second, even if the current fiscal's target as set out by Member (Traffic) is met, that would still be over 10 percent short of the initial target for the current fiscal at Rs 1.89 lakh crore. So the Railways is merely following its own trend of raising hopes at the beginning of the fiscal and then falling short of the targets it sets for itself. Another interesting point: The total revenue the Railways hopes to earn in 2017-18 would still be short of the target set for previous fiscal, a number it should have earned by March 2017 itself.
The gap between the earnings target the Railways has been setting itself and the actual receipts comes even when, after 90 years of a separate Railway Budget, this practice was discontinued from the current fiscal. The thinking behind this move: a separate Railway Budget led to excessive populism, especially in the matter of fare fixation and selection and funding of projects. Besides, a separate Railway Budget had failed to achieve commercialisation of the Railways for generation of adequate funds for projects or making it accountable for delivery of services. No separate budget also means the Railways does not have to pay an annual dividend to the government. So the continued shortfall in Railways' receipts versus annual targets this fiscal, despite the removal of dividend payment, is a matter of concern.
Though the Railways is known as the largest domestic transporter for Indians, ferrying well over 22 million people each day, freight carriage is the mega revenue earner since it accounts for 65 paise of every rupee earned. This means the transporter must make incremental revenue by carrying goods to continue subsidising passenger fares.
Now, freight earnings have been declining as the Railways' freight rates remain unattractive compared to other modes of transport like roadways. Besides, bulk of the freight traffic has been restricted to 10 commodities and the basket is only now being expanded to almost 40. The ET report shows that the Railways is betting on carrying 115.5 crore tonnes of freight this fiscal, which is a significant improvement over tonnage last fiscal but still one crore tonnes short of the target for 2017-18. The state of the Indian economy is partly to blame for lower than expected tonnage of freight but then, picking out which freight makes more money for the Railways has to be done better.
In the absence of any robust growth in freight earnings, it is but natural that even last fiscal, the lower revenue target was met partially through a 72 percent jump in non-fare revenues.
Obviously, non-fare revenues cannot cure all the ills plaguing the Railways. While Railways' efforts to generate non-fare revenue from advertisements on trains, parking and catering etc are commendable, it needs to do much more to uplift its core services of passenger and freight transportation.
In fact, a Parliamentary Standing Committee on Railways which examined the ministry's demand for grants for 2017-18 said that the Railways had first projected revenue earnings from passengers at Rs 51,012 crore in its Budget estimates for 2016-17.
This figure was later revised to Rs 48,000 crore and what has actually been earned is Rs 46,279 crore. The same committee report said the budget estimate for freight earnings for 2016-17 was Rs 117,932.75 crore , which was revised down to Rs 108,900 crore. The actual earning has been even lower at Rs 104,310 crore. In other words, the Railways earned Rs 150,589 crore from passenger and freight segments against its revised target of Rs 156,900 crore, a decline of over 4 percent. In 2016-17, non-fare earnings jumped to Rs 10,181 crore from Rs 5,928 crore in the previous fiscal.
The standing committee report quotes a Railway official as saying “Our freight rates are very high rates and that is how freight is moving to road. Our average cost of service is Rs 0.99 per 10 kilometers whereas I am charging from my users around Rs 1.60 which I use for cross-subsidising my passenger traffic where I am charging around 50 percent of cost of our service. This trend is not good for the economy in the sense that goods are used for production, consumption and if the cost of transportation of goods which ultimately is the logistic cost, which is perhaps highest in India at around 13 percent of the cost of the goods as against developed countries is only around 4 to 5 percent. There is enough justification for reducing the freight charges. Today I am not able to do it because I have to match the budget and crosssubsidise the passenger traffic which are at substantially lower rate”.
This essentially means that the Railways has been charging an over 60 percent premium on transporting freight across its network whereas passengers are subsidised as they are merely charged half of the cost of transporting them across the Railway network. And this cross subsidisation is the nub of the Railways' earning woes. As has been said countless times earlier, not only does the Railways need to bump up total passenger and freight earnings, it also quickly needs to reduce the subsidisation of passenger fares through freight earnings.
Coming back to lower passenger fares, this piece in Business Standard quotes a senior Railway Board official to say that one of the major reasons for the increase in passenger revenues in 2016-17 over the previous fiscal was the launch of flexi-fare system across select trains which generated Rs 260.31 crore in revenue. While implementing flexi fares and other smart ticket pricing ideas, the Railways needs to rapidly also increase passenger fares to remain in business. Now that a separate Budget is not being announced, why not bite the bullet on passenger fares in the coming fiscal?
During 2016-17, Railways' freight earnings declined 4.5 percent over 2015-16 due to carrying larger volume of low fare freight. This clearly shows not only is there a need to raise freight tonnage, the focus must also be on high fare freight.
John Podhoretz: “For years, under the radar and likely with the guidance of his political guru Roger Stone, Trump built a powerful and loyal following through what could be called—yes, I know this is going to sound condescending and elitist, but what can I say, I'm condescending and elitist—the proletarian media.”
“I'm talking about Alex Jones and Infowars, the conspiracy-theory radio-show/website on which Trump has appeared for years; the radio show has 2 million listeners a week, and Jones was said in 2011 to have a larger online presence than Rush Limbaugh or Glenn Beck. I'm talking about the WWE, which televises wrestling and which, in 2014, could claim a weekly audience of 15 million and on whose programs Trump intermittently served as a kind of Special Guest Villain in the manner of a villain on the 1960s Batman show. I'm talking about American Media, the company that owns the National Enquirer, the Star, the Sun, and the Weekly World News run by Trump's close friend David Pecker; the combined weekly circulation of its publications is well in excess of 2 million. Trump helped make the birther issue a major one for a month in 2011 by talking about it on Meet the Press and Good Morning America, on network television. But he was surfacing an issue that had been roiling in the proletarian media, stirred and shaken constantly by his political guru, Roger Stone.”
“Talk about flying under the radar. These media institutions have no cultural purchase whatsoever except for the contempt they breed… By paying them heed, Trump was not only feeding his inexhaustible maw for attention. He was reaching a group of disaffected Americans entirely on the margins of American life, politically and culturally and organizationally.”

* Swedish firm banks on growing demand for battery-driven tools
* Drive to sell more robotic mowers in the U.S.
* Operating profit jumped 18 percent in 2017 (Adds CEO comment, background, shares)
By Anna Ringstrom
STOCKHOLM, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The chore of pushing a mower around your lawn may become a thing of the past as householders sit back and watch robotic lawn mowers take the strain, helping to lift the performance of Swedish outdoor power tools group Husqvarna.
Husqvarna's full-year operating profit jumped 18 percent last year helped by strong growth in Europe for robotic lawn mowers and other battery-driven products such as trimmers.
The company, which makes a broad range of products for forest, park and garden maintenance, produced its one millionth robotic lawn mower last year and says its Automower is the world's best-selling robot lawn mower.
Robotic lawn mowers, a common sight in Husqvarna's home market, use rechargeable batteries and mow within boundaries that the mower detects with its sensors.
While traditional petrol-driven mowers, trimmers and chainsaws still account for a large chunk of Husqvarna's sales, the company is betting on strong demand growth for automatic mowers as well as battery-driven handheld tools that are greener, less noisy and vibrate less.
The group, which does the bulk of its business around the peak gardening season in Europe and the United States, posted a 3.8 billion crown ($483 million) operating profit and nearly reached its 10 percent profit margin target - 9.6 percent against 8.9 in 2016.
Husqvarna has warned that sales by its Consumer Brands division, which sells lawn mowers and handheld outdoor tools for householders and does the bulk of its business in the United States, would take a 1 billion crown hits in 2018 due to the scaling back of business with a big U.S. client.
CEO Kai Warn told Reuters that initiatives to get Consumer Brands back on track would include a push in the United States for its robotic mowers, which are currently in demand mostly in Europe.
The company, a rival of Stanley Black & Decker, Deere and Toro, proposed a larger than expected 15 percent rise in its dividend to 2.25 crowns a share, driving its shares up more than 2 percent to their highest since last July.
Warn said he expected the company to hit its margin target in 2018 helped by around 5.5 percent organic sales growth combined at its Husqvarna, Gardena and Construction divisions, which accounted for around a third of sales in 2017.
In the fourth quarter - Husqvarna's seasonally slowest - operating losses were smaller than expected at 70 million crowns, boosted by a 55 million crown one-off gain, against a year-ago 108 million loss.
A Calgary man convicted of killing his neighbour nearly four years ago will remain behind bars for at least another night.
The victim's family told Global News they are outraged to hear Nicholas Rasberry was allegedly drinking and breaching conditions of his release.
“Really they should revoke his bail. This is major,” Craig Kelloway's mother Monica said Tuesday.
“He thinks he's above the law. He's making a mockery of the justice system.”
In October 2015, Rasberry was convicted of manslaughter in the death of Kelloway, a Calgary teacher.
Watch below from December 2015: Nicholas Rasberry, the man convicted of manslaughter in the death of Craig Kelloway, was sentenced to seven years in prison on Friday. Nancy Hixt reports.
Global News has confirmed Rasberry was arrested Monday morning in Canmore and charged with three counts of breaching conditions of his release, as well as one count of resisting arrest.
He had been out on bail pending a decision by the Alberta Court of Appeal and is scheduled to appear in Canmore court again Wednesday morning.
Court documents allege Rasberry was intoxicated and refused to provide breath samples to the RCMP. It's also alleged he attempted to shut the door on officers at a hotel.
“It frustrates me, it makes me mad to see he's enjoying life,” Monica said.
“My son is in a grave.”
Kelloway was stabbed 37 times in Rasberry's Auburn Bay home on May 4, 2013.

Last November, the prosecution asked a panel of appeal court justices for a murder conviction, while defence proposed Rasberry be acquitted.
The Crown pointed to the fact that three knives were used as proof it was not self defence, suggesting Rasberry made a choice to “put Mr. Kelloway down.”
Defence argued Kelloway was threatening to rape Rasberry and that he was provoked.
Watch below from October 2015: A disturbing 911 confession was played in court from a man accused of murdering his neighbour, a Calgary teacher. Nancy Hixt reports.
The original trial judge found Rasberry was not acting in self defence, but also said he didn't feel there was an intent to kill.
In December 2015, Rasberry was sentenced to seven years in jail. With credit for time served, he was left with five years and four months in his sentence.
Soon after, the Court of Appeal granted Rasberry bail pending the appeal.
The victim's family has told Global News they want a new trial.

An historical Alberta sexual assault case that was stayed last month has not yet been put to rest.
Global News has confirmed the Crown will be appealing a Jordan Decision granted on Nov. 21 that stated the Jorden Van Voorthuizen case took too long to make its way through the court system.
READ MORE: Charges against former Taber man stayed in historic Alberta sexual assault case
Van Voorthuizen, a former Taber man, was originally charged in 2011 with the alleged sexual assault of two young boys between 1995 and 2001.
He was convicted following a trial in 2013, but that decision was overturned by the Alberta Court of Appeal in 2016.
“The appeal was launched as there was a legal error in the jury instruction that necessitated a new trial,” Katherine Thompson, communications advisor for Justice and the Solicitor General explained in an email to Global News.
READ MORE: Supreme court creates new timely-trial framework
The new trial was scheduled for last month, but on Day 1, defence lawyer Greg White filed a Jordan application.
The Jordan decision states a trial in Court of Queen's Bench must be heard within 30 months after charges are laid.
READ MORE: Alberta prosecutor says court delays force Crown to toss criminal cases ‘on the trash heap'
Alberta Justice told Global News the Crown believes the judge made several legal errors in his approach to granting the stay of charges, prompting the appeal of the Jordan ruling in the Van Voorthuizen case.
This matter will be heard in the Alberta Court of Appeal in Calgary. A date has not yet been set.
OTTAWA — A private member's bill aimed at ensuring Canada's laws are in harmony with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples has earned the approval of the House of Commons.

President Trump's preferred candidate in the Alabama Senate primary Tuesday faces an uphill battle in a contest that could set the tone for other Republican Party skirmishes ahead of the 2018 midterm election.
Trump endorsed Sen. Luther Strange, who should have had an easy lock on a seat he took over when Jeff Sessions, the state's longtime senator, resigned to become the Trump administration's attorney general.
But the race has become an early test of Trump's power to persuade his most dedicated supporters. Trump's approval rating remains sky-high in Alabama, but that enthusiasm has not spilled over to Strange, who is also favored by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).
Strange is trailing fiery former judge Roy Moore, according to recent polling.
The outcome could foreshadow a deepening feud between the GOP's base voters and party leaders in the months to come.
Some voters will surely be inspired by Trump's endorsement of Strange. But others still have doubts about how Strange was appointed to replace Sessions and his ties to McConnell and other Republican leaders, who have grown increasingly unpopular among many in the base.
“They're confused,” said Terry Lathan, chairwoman of the Alabama Republican Party.
With no candidate likely to emerge with a majority from a field that started with 10 Republicans, the top two vote-getters are expected to compete in a runoff in September.
More troubling for “Big Luther,” as the towering 6-foot-9 Strange is known locally, is that Moore has held steady in polls and would be a formidable opponent if the two faced off next month.
Moore is a colorful and well-known figure in Alabama, the former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court who was removed for refusing to get rid of a Ten Commandments display. He was later reinstated by voters only to be suspended after not conforming with the U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding same-sex marriage.
Despite such setbacks, Moore at times seems more Trump-like in his outspokenness and popular support than Strange, the candidate Trump has supported through tweets and a robo-call.
“Luther has a tough battle on his hands,” said Brent Buchanan, president of Cygnal consulting in Alabama, which is not working with any of the candidates. “You have to tear down Moore, but nobody's every figured out the effective formula to do that.”
Democrats see almost zero chance to make inroads in Alabama, which has remained a Republican stronghold, though strategists in Washington are keeping tabs on developments.
But more telling will be the outcome for Republicans, who are facing several spirited primary campaigns leading up to a midterm election they once hoped would put Democrats on defense.
Two Republicans, Sens. Dean Heller in Nevada and Jeff Flake in Arizona, have long been known to be heading toward tough reelections in 2018. But now both are expected to face noisy primary campaigns with challengers from their right flank, testing their loyalty to Trump and to conservative issues.
As money has poured in for Strange, including $4 million from McConnell's aligned Senate Leadership Fund, the message being sent to challengers is that the official channels in Washington are sticking with the incumbent.
The group has been pounding the airwaves with ads critical of Moore, as well as another candidate in the race, Rep. Mo Brooks, hoping to ensure Strange can at least make the runoff.
A National Republican Senatorial Committee affiliate poured in $200,000 for Strange on Monday.
“Sen. Luther Strange has done a great job representing the people of the Great State of Alabama. He has my complete and total endorsement!” Trump tweeted last week. He followed up with another tweet Monday.
Voters, though, have had other ideas. Some are skeptical of Strange because of the way he was appointed to the job. As the state's former attorney general, he was selected by a governor who was facing investigation and impeachment proceedings for possible wrongdoing related to a reported affair. He has since resigned.
Others are still inspired by Moore for his strong stands, particularly on social issues.
Brooks also retains a strong following as a conservative member of the House Freedom Caucus who was initially critical of Trump as a candidate, preferring Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. He has been criss-crossing the state on a “Drain the Swap” bus tour.
Strange's backers are counting on Trump's tweets of support to push him to the runoff, and ultimately to election.
“It showed that the president is willing to engage in the Senate races and spend some of his political capital to achieve the outcome he wants,” said Steven Law, a former McConnell aide now running the Senate Leadership Fund. “That suggests he will take seriously his power and potential to impact the 2018 elections.”

Netflix, Inc. beat earnings estimates for the first quarter, but shares of the streaming media company took a hit in after-hours trading Monday after it reported weaker-than-expected new subscriptions for the period.
The slowdown came despite the release of popular new titles, including the superhero-themed “Marvel's Iron Fist” and the kid-oriented “A Series of Unfortunate Events.”
Netflix beats Wall Street estimates For the quarter ended March 31, Netflix reported earnings of 40 cents per share, beating analyst estimates and the company's own guidance. Revenue came in at $2.64 billion, which was in line with expectations. Analysts estimated Netflix would earn 37 cents a share, up from 6 cents a share in the same quarter last year. Revenue was projected to increase 35% year over year to $2.64 billion in the first quarter. Netflix shares have been trading at near record levels. However, investors have been closely watching for signs of a slowdown in growth as the company reaches nearly 100 million subscribers.

Slowdown in subscriber growth The Los Gatos, Calif.-based company reported net subscription additions of 4.94 million for the quarter, falling shy of its guidance. The streaming giant had forecast an addition of 5.2 million new subscribers from January through March 2017, compared with 6.74 million added during those three months last year. Other new titles to debut in the quarter included “Santa Clarita Diet” and the reality series “Ultimate Beastmaster.” The last day of the quarter saw the debut of the millennial-focused dramatic series “13 Reasons Why.”

This year was one to forget for the Ottawa Senators, finishing second-to-last in the NHL after a promising playoff run the year before. As the free agency period has gotten underway, there are many questions that still need to be answered. The Sens have already addressed one question, placing right winger Alex Burrows on waivers to buy him out and free up some cap room ahead of free agency.
With the team surrounded by rumors, here are the three biggest questions to be addressed this offseason.
What's Happening With Erik Karlsson?
Erik Karlsson is the face of the Senators' organization. For the past nine seasons, he has become one of the best players in the NHL. He has won two Norris Trophies as the NHL's best defenseman, been named to the NHL First All-Star Team four times and has helped the Sens reach the playoffs five times. His 518 points in 627 games don't hurt either.
NHL All-Stars are not easy to come by, and it looks like the Sens might lose theirs. Karlsson's contract ends after the 2018-19 season and the club reportedly offered him an $80-million contract extension on July 1. With no deal in place just one day later, the Senators granted other NHL teams permission to speak with the veteran.
There have been numerous teams looking into Karlsson, with the Vegas Golden Knights initially looking to be the front-runner, reportedly willing to take on Bobby Ryan's $7.25 million contract in a trade. That should be an intriguing inclusion for the Sens. After losing John Tavares, the New York Islanders also look to be in talks to acquire the defenseman. The Isles would greatly benefit from landing Karlsson, not just for his skills on the ice, but for a fanbase in need of some good news. In addition to those clubs, the Dallas Stars have come on recently as a frontrunner to acquire Karlsson.
With the 28-year-old's contract nearing its end, the Sens' captain could become the highest-paid defenseman in NHL history. The Swedish defender has become one of the league's best players and with the salary cap going up year after year everyone has eyes on the potential 2019 free agent's negotiations.
Los Angeles Kings rearguard Drew Doughty recently signed his extension worth just under $11 million over eight years, setting the bar for Karlsson in his contract discussions. With the Senators offering $10 million over 8 years, expect interested teams to offer deals similar, if not higher, to Doughty's.
Will Craig Anderson Be the Starting Goalie?
In an unexpected move, goaltender Craig Anderson asked to be traded. While surprising, the 37-year-old's desire is understandable given that the Sens are just starting to rebuild.
More buzz out of Ottawa 👀.https://t.co/d8CUXAkFiR — Sportsnet (@Sportsnet) June 22, 2018
The fact that his two-year, $9.5-million contract kicks in next season may make it difficult to move him, but many teams are looking for a goalie this offseason, including the Islanders, who have been kicking the tires on the availability of the Sens' most successful goalie of all time. That said, the Islanders did sign Robin Lehner on July 3.
However, Dorion has made it clear in the Karlsson discussions that he won't be making a deal if the return isn't to his liking. Anderson is a clear-cut starter in the NHL, and Dorion will be looking for a fair trade in return. If he can't find a deal, expect Anderson to be wearing red in October.
With many of the free agent goaltenders signing July 1, the options looking thin for Ottawa, especially with Lehner, an ex-Senator, signing with the Islanders after not receiving a qualifying offer from the Buffalo Sabres. Last year, Lehner went 23-26-8 with a GAA of 2.68 and save percentage of .920. While these numbers are not remarkable, they'd do well for a rebuilding team.
On the trade front, the Red Wings are reportedly dangling Jimmy Howard who has only one year left on his contract. A trade is even more likely after Detroit signed Jonathan Bernier to a three-year deal. Similar to Lehner, Howard may not be the goalie he once was, but is still a starting-caliber goaltender.
What doesn't appear to be an option, is looking internally. Behind Anderson is Mike Condon, who fans will remember going 5-17-5 last season with a 3.25 GAA. Even for a rebuilding team, those aren't the numbers of a starting goaltender. Whichever avenue Ottawa takes with Anderson, this will be an intriguing story through the offseason if Dorion can make a deal happen.
Can the Sens Move Bobby Ryan?
The Bobby Ryan saga may come to an end this offseason. After an injury-riddled season and a rebuild underway, the Sens should be looking to get out from under the four years and $29 million left on his contract. That is easier said than done though.
Ryan looked like an All-Star with the Anaheim Ducks, putting up at least 31 goals and 57 points in four of his six years there. Those two seasons he scored less were his rookie year and the lockout 2012-13 season. In Ottawa, he hasn't hit either of those numbers, falling to just 11 goals and 33 points last season.
The Sens might have difficulty moving a contract like Ryan's, but if the Toronto Maple Leafs were able to unload David Clarkson, anything is possible. The most likely scenario would be for Dorion to bundle Ryan with another asset or take on a bad contract in return, which isn't ideal (see the Marian Gaborik trade).
As David Pagnotta of The Fourth Period suggests, Ryan could be packaged with Karlsson, with at least the Golden Knights and one more team open to that possibility (while the New York Rangers were initially reported to be interested, they now appear to be out of the equation). This would lessen the amount the other team has to send back but would unload a sizable amount of cap space for the Sens.
As we've mentioned over past few days, VGK, NYR and at least one more team has expressed interest in acquiring both Karlsson/Ryan. There are 6-7 other teams after just Karlsson. Told NYI is among them. — David Pagnotta (@TheFourthPeriod) July 2, 2018
If Dorion and company are serious about the rebuild and a Karlsson deal happens, it's likely that Ryan is on his way out of the nation's capital with him. Come October, there may be a very different core group in Ottawa.
Mother of 11-month-old found dead charged with improper disposal of human remains
CHESTERFIELD, SC (WOLO) – Investigators say Breanna Lewis, the mother of the child found dead, has been charged with improper disposal of human remains.
Officials say an autopsy of the child has been completed but the results are unavailable.
Chesterfield County Sheriff Jay Brooks says Lewis is also being charged with falsifying a report.
11-month-old Harlee Lewis' body was found in a diaper box about a thousand yards from her home Tuesday (5/29). According to the Sheriff's Office, the child's mother lied about an attack and kidnapping while checking her mail.
An Amber Alert was issued for Harlee, but called off when investigators found her naked body in a diaper box less than a mile away from the home.
In 2014, the greater part of the population infected in West Africa got wiped out through contact with the disease called Ebola. Though Typhoid Mary was the most superspreader, which has infected 51 individuals, and three of whom passed in the vicinity of 1900 and 1907.
As indicated by the findings published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers are now studying how Ebola spread during the 2014-2015 epidemic in West Africa and said that the superspreaders assumed a greater part than was previously known. Researchers said, in the event that 'superspreading' had been totally controlled, just about 66 percent of the contaminations may have been avoided, according to The Washington Post report.
The review in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences shows such superspreaders can be extremely risky with regards to infectious disease outbreaks. It has more than 28,000 confirmed, probable and associated cases with Ebola were accounted for in West Africa during the outbreak, including more than 11,000 deaths, as indicated by the World Health Organization.

Yahoo News reported that according to Benjamin Dalziel, an assistant professor in College of Science at Oregon State University, it was the cases that did not see what truly drove the plague, especially individuals who died at home, without seeking health care. He added that there was not a considerable measure of transmission once individuals reached hospitals and care centers.
By utilizing a mathematical method, the researchers reproduced the transmission system to perceive what extent of cases were brought about by superspreaders. The researchers estimated about three percent of individual infected were ultimately in charge of contaminating about 61 percent of cases.
Ebola spreads basically through contact with bodily fluids. During the epidemic, superspreaders were referred to in various news stories about Ebola's spread. Frequently, transmission happened during caregiving at home and during burial services, washing and touching the dead bodies in particular.

Three siblings of a notorious family kicked out of their council house when it was found decked with luxury items have walked free from court over a vicious pub brawl.
Two men, aged 49 and 29, were injured after mum-of-seven Samantha Gabriel, 37, and her brothers Shane, 29, and Gavin, 28, became embroiled in a Wild West-style fight.
Pint glasses were thrown as one victim suffered cuts to the back of his head while the other had a black eye and a gash on his forehead.
The Gabriel family became notorious in 2004 when they were evicted from their council home in Padiham, near Burnley, Lancs.
They were removed from the property after investigators found it decked with a swimming pool, sauna, and jacuzzi, plus a four poster water bed and a £3,000 42-inch plasma screen TV.

It was claimed they inflicted "21 years of anti-social behaviour" on their neighbourhood.
Family matriarch Janis Gabriel, then 49, and herself a mum-of-seven living on benefits with her late husband John was later jailed for six months after police said the luxuries were financed by crime - but she was cleared on appeal.
At the time housing officials claimed members of the Gabriel family had threatened to blow up neighbours homes and made threats to kill them.
They later abandoned the house after dismantling all of the fittings, including the toilet, bath and shower, switch sockets and kitchen cupboards - causing an estimated £12,000-worth of damage.
Gavin and Shane - who lived at the property with their parents - subsequently clocked up a string of convictions for violence and later the family designed its own logo: "Its a Gabriel thing - you wouldn't understand" based on the novelty clothing range - and posted it on their Facebook pages.
(Image: Cavendish Press)
At Burnley Crown Court on Thursday, Shane was given a community order for 12 months and Gavin received three months jail suspended for six months.
Both men admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
Samantha who has seven children aged between 10 and 18 by different dads admitted affray but was conditionally discharged for 12 months after a court heard she was "reliant" on benefits.
The fight occurred in the Nags Head Pub in Accrington on March 22 in 2016 after a local, known only as Joe, made apparent offensive remarks to a pub regular.
Another drinker is said to have intervened but Joe fell onto a fruit machine - causing the fight to spread through the bar.
Gavin was seen to hit one of the injured victims up to three times in the brawl.
The court heard Gavin had four violence convictions whilst Shane has 15 offences on his record including a weapons charge and assault.
Last year Shane was jailed for 10 months for dangerous driving following a police pursuit.

Defending fork lift truck driver Shane, Brendan O'Leary said: "He lost his work through injury, found himself unable to work, his father passed away and he took to drink and drugs, particularly crack cocaine.
"I'm told by his family he now presents physically as a much healthier person. He's determined, upon release that he hopes is in the near future, to go back to employment.
"But last week he had a dream about crack cocaine and it scared him."
For Gavin, Mark Stuart, said: "He has been out of trouble since this incident He should have kept out of the fracas but he went to assist his brother."

A probation report for Samantha said: "She is a single mum to seven children who range from 18 to 10.
"The two oldest are 18 and 17 and are independent, they don't live with her. Then the others 16 to 10 live at home and are all at school.
"The teenagers are giving her a bit of trouble but she's coping. The fathers are not really on the scene but have never been hands-on even though there is contact.
"She has worked on and off but hasn't worked the last ten years. One of her children suffers from ADHD but that's stopped. She wants to get into the caring profession. She's reliant on benefits."
(Image: Cavendish Press)

Sentencing Judge Beverley Lunt described the family's behaviour during the fight as "madness and completely stupid".
She told the two brothers: "There was no reason for you to get involved in this. Neither of you started it, why you got involved in it is behind belief."
Janis' trial in 2004 was told she and her disabled husband and their family were receiving £2,000 a month in benefits but paid no council tax or rent on their three bedroomed semi.
When police raided the property they found £10,000 in £20 notes under the mattress of the water bed plus electrical goods, DVD machines, video recorders, the home cinema system and numerous CDs.
The court was given a "guided tour" of the house by video taken by police when they raided the property last year.
A four-poster water bed was provided for the master bedroom, with a Jacuzzi and bidet in the ornately tiled bathroom.

The living room was equipped with a plasma TV, a large mahogany fireplace, chandelier and leather suite. As well as having a new kitchen fitted, the couple's conservatory had a heated indoor swimming pool and sauna.
The family also owned two cars, a motor scooter, a number of bicycles, several mobile phones, various camcorders, DVD players, stereos and televisions, and had boxes full of expensive electrical items.
The entire property was monitored by a CCTV security system and of the Gabriel's four bank accounts showed Janis had paid in £4,000 over five months.
Janis claimed her husband was a "penny-pincher" and said she got the money playing bingo and fruit machines but was found guilty of possessing criminal property.
She was cleared in 2006 after an appeal court ruled the trial judge's summing up was "flawed."
Dad-of-seven Mr Gabriel - known as Gabby - died aged 63 in 2013.
As Metro Vancouver gears up to build a pair of mega-transit projects, one business group is issuing a call to protect small businesses from unintended effects.
It's part of a new report from the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) titled Paving a Smoother Road: Helping small businesses survive infrastructure work.
And with construction on the horizon for Surrey light rail transit (LRT) and a Broadway subway, the group says its concerns are more relevant than ever.

Spokesperson Amber Ruddy said in Vancouver, there's still a sore spot over how Cambie Street businesses were affected by SkyTrain construction a decade ago.
“We've had a series of complaints, especially with the Canada Line going in, and how different businesses have been impacted,” she said.
“In our report, we found 46 per cent of businesses that have had construction impacts have lost sales. We've had 21 per cent say they had to rely on their personal savings to keep their business afloat.”
Canada Line construction involved the cheaper but more disruptive tunneling technique known as “cut and cover” in which crews dug a trench for the line, then filled it over. TransLink's more recent Evergreen Line was built using a tunnel boring machine.

The CFIB says Canada Line construction cost the average small business owner about $112,000, and that many were forced to move.
“These municipalities have billions of dollars invested in these light rail transit and different lines to get people to work. But we also have to think about how is the small business owner impacted,” she said.
The CFIB report found strong support among small businesses for a “coherent construction mitigation policy” among local governments, one which would include compensation for businesses that face losses due to construction.

It pointed to examples such as Brussels, where small merchants that are forced to close for a week or more get $117 per day in compensation, or Seattle which put aside US$15 million to compensate businesses affected by LRT construction.
In addition to compensation, the CFIB says such a plan would include a “no surprises” rule, with regular “state of infrastructure” reports so that businesses know what is coming down the pipe.
It also calls for a more comprehensive planning process, in which the phasing and timing of projects are carefully laid out, as well as better contracting and the creation of a city business liaison officer.

Matt Sciota hit an infield ground ball in game two of the doubleheader with Avon on Sunday. He hustled down the first-base line to beat out the throw, and when his foot hit the bag, his knee gave out.
After catching the first game of the doubleheader, Josh Panarella suited up once again, and took Sciota's spot behind home plate. Sciota wasn't the only player injured on Southington's roster, as Tyler Cyr and Brandon Kohl had sustained injuries before coming into Sunday's game as well.
Never mind coming out of the first week of the summer season with just one win in four games. Post 72 is just trying to survive. However, Southington coach Marc Verderame isn't too concerned…thanks to the team's bullpen.
“Pitching wins ballgames, especially in this wood bat league, and we have great pitching,” the coach said. “We're going to get better and go on a little run here.”
This year will be very similar to 2016. Last summer, Southington assembled a solid bullpen for the first time in years, as much of the team's success came from the mound. Post 72 is likely to see that again this summer.
Southington won't have ace, John Mikosz, from the high school team. But in order to make a second-straight appearance in the postseason, Post 72 will need help from its arm-ada of Connor McDonough, Bailey Robarge, and Ryan Sheehan.
“We're going to excel on the pitching front,” said Verderame. “We have three or four starters, and three guys that can come out of the bullpen. We play about five games a week, so it's important to have that.”
A great bullpen helped carry the Blue Knight baseball team during much of the spring as well, but pitching isn't the only part of the field that is carrying over from the high school season to the summer season. The Knights struggled at the plate with inconsistent hitting, and it has already been an issue for Post 72.
“We're seeing that early right now, and we made some adjustments,” the coach said. “We're working hard in the cage, but we have to execute and run our offense with steals and bunts.”
Putting the time into swinging in the cage is one way of fighting a hitting slump. Simply getting used to the transition from medal bats during the high school season to wooden bats during the summer season is another, which could be the answer these Southington baseball players are looking for.
“Swinging with a wood bat is a completely different than swinging with a medal bat,” said Verderame. “You just have to practice it over and over again. I've been coaching for 10 years, and we've seen a little lag in the beginning of every season. But we always pick it up.”
Post 72 will be back on the diamond this week with games against Wolcott (3-1), Torrington (1-4), Unionville (0-4), and Simsbury (3-1). Southington is currently 1-3 overall and seventh out of nine teams in the Zone 1 standings. Avon is in first.
Loss vs. Bristol
JUNE 8—Post 72 opened its summer season by failing to put up a run in a 3-0 shutout to Bristol at home on Thursday.
With one out and the bases loaded in the third inning, Cory Fradette drew a walk to give Bristol a 1-0 lead. A batter later, Zach Marquis drove in a pair of runs with a base hit to cap off the win for Bristol. Southington mustered just four hits, as Brayden Cooney went 2-for-3 with a double.
Robarge (0-1) started on the mound and went three innings with a strikeout, allowing four hits, three earned runs, and three walks. Justin Verilli relieved Robarge to go two innings, and McDonough and Vinny Viturale each threw an inning as well.
Win vs. Terryville
JUNE 9—Southington bounced back from its season-opening loss by flipping the script to earn its first win of the season, blanking Terryville, 3-0, at home the next day.
With one out in the first, Jonathan Gray and Jake Babon each got on base with a pair of singles. A couple batters later with two outs and the bases loaded, Jeremy Mercier gave Southington a 2-0 advantage after driving in Gray and Babon with a base hit.
Babon capped off the victory by stealing home to score the team's third run in the sixth. Those three hits by Gray, Babon, and Mercier were the only three hits Southington registered in the game.
Nick Borkowski (1-0) threw a complete-game shutout with three strikeouts, allowing just four hits.
Doubleheader vs. Avon
JUNE 11—Following the first win on the year, Post 72 fell right back into the loss column after dropping both games of a doubleheader to undefeated Avon at home. Avon took game one by a hefty count of 10-3.
The score was knotted at 1-1 after the second inning, but Avon pulled away with nine runs in the fourth and fifth innings combined. Southington's rally fell short with a pair of runs in the sixth, finishing with seven hits and two errors. Mercier went 2-for-4, as Southington stranded 12 runners on base.
Sheehan (0-1) started on the mound and went three and two thirds innings, allowing five walks, four hits, and three earned runs. Viturale and Jake Weed saw some action on the mound as well, and Verilli closed.
Game two was a lot closer, but Avon still managed to edge Southington by a pair of runs, 2-0.
Avon scored their lone two runs of the game off a pair of base hits with two outs in the fourth and sixth innings. Southington mustered just three hits and committed two errors.
McDonough (0-1) started on the mound and went five innings with six strikeouts, allowing two hits and a walk. Weed closed.

Esha Deol, who was on a baby-moon in Santorini with husband Bharat Takthani, shared a picture perfect moment from her getaway. The 35-year-old actress not only planned the entire holiday but also engaged a photographer to capture a few precious moments on celluloid. The star had shared a handful of beautiful pictures from her quiet holiday. In a chat with Mumbai Mirror, Esha revealed that it wasn't easy to get the perfect shot. She said, "Tourists come to the sunset points hours in advance to get themselves a good perch and the best possible view and selfies. But since it can get a little too crowded then, our photographer advised me to catch the sunrise instead, pointing out that at 6.30 am the light is best."
Esha also revealed that as it was a holiday for two, hubby Bharat helped her get ready for their shoot by ironing her gown, carrying her bags and turning handy man when required. "I would suggest that every parents-to-be get a maternity shoot done to smile over with their child in later years," she said.
The 'Dhoom' actress even came across many other pregnant women who asked her about the gender of her baby to which she said, "I'd say we were waiting for the baby to arrive to know its gender, explaining that sex determination tests are banned in India because of the high incidence of female infanticide. They were shocked to learn that in our part of the world the girl child is not always welcome. It makes me sad too. I hope that one day soon, this discrimination ends."
Esha and Bharat will welcome their first child later this year.

Waste It's Electrifying! « Previous Arturo Santiago • June 14, 2017
I've been telling you about the idea of running fleet vehicles on electric power; specifically collection trucks. The good news now is that the concept is not only moving forward, it's evolving at tremendous speed and with a lot of torque. The City of Los Angeles' sanitation department, LA Sanitation (LASAN) started a four month pilot project in January of this year with a class six battery-electric refuse truck that was developed by BYD and Wayne Engineering. The truck was operated on the same routes as LASAN's regular collection vehicles. That means the electric truck delivered up to four tons per day to the landfill on a single charge without experiencing any major mechanical or performance issues.

Covering publicity, education, engineering, long-term planning, and landfill gas waste-to-energy . Download it now!
In all, it drove up to 108 miles a day, averaging a range of 99 miles and totaling more than 5,200 miles throughout the demonstration according to BYD.
Ron Cole is the fleet manager for LA Sanitation. He says, “As stewards of the environment, LASAN always looks forward to opportunities for testing and evaluation of new technologies that will help minimize our carbon footprints and other environmental impacts. LASAN worked closely with BYD during the testing to ensure the electric vehicle met our operational requirements and the outcomes of the testing are satisfactory. This will pave the path for LASAN to move to zero emission collection fleet as part of Mayor Eric Garcetti's Sustainability pLAn.”
Macy Neshati is the senior vice president of BYD Heavy Industries. She thanked LA Sanitation for its leadership with the project. “BYD set out to prove that our battery-electric refuse trucks reliably achieve 100 miles of range in everyday operating conditions, and we achieved that goal with a record-breaking 99 miles per charge over a four month time frame,” said Neshati. “This demonstration with LA Sanitation proves to other municipal refuse fleets that electrification is possible today. Additionally, these battery-electric trucks can provide significant operational cost savings.”
And the CEO of Wayne Engineering, Kevin Watje says, “We've been designing and manufacturing innovative equipment for the waste management sector for half a century, and that has all been a buildup to this project with BYD and LA Sanitation, bringing cutting edge electric technology to refuse hauling, which can easily be a zero-emission operation.”
Again, the idea of electrifying fleets as opposed to cars is that on the whole, cars don't use as much gas as trucks; they're already fairly clean compared to trucks; and the cost for making electric cars is significantly higher than it is for making ones that run on gas. The economics become more and more compelling when you consider that collection trucks use exponentially more fuel and on top of that, combine regenerative braking technology with an electrified truck and there are significant cost savings on maintenance.
I'd like to hear from the fleet managers and operators and what you think about running collection fleets on electric power. How would an electric fleet affect operations?
Iowa senior lineman Keegan Render has been named to the Rimington Trophy Preseason Watch List, the Boomer Esiason Foundation announced today.
The Rimington Trophy is awarded to the nation's premier center in college football and is presented annually by the Boomer Esiason Foundation.
Render started in all of Iowa's 13 games in 2017. The Indianola, Iowa native saw action at center, right guard, and left guard last year, while playing in every offensive down in five of 13 games. Render was part of two 50-point offensive outputs, as the Hawkeyes gained 487 yards of total offense against Ohio State and 505 yards of total offense against Nebraska.
The Rimington Trophy winner will be announced on Jan. 12, 2019, at the Rococo Theatre in Lincoln, Nebraska. The center with the most first team votes will be determined the winner.
Render and the Hawkeyes open their season on Sept. 1 against Northern Illinois.
It must be summertime because Baden's Cruizin' at the Pond is revving up for another season.
This popular event, starting June 6, is the largest weekly car show in Waterloo Region, averaging 250 classic cars in attendance each Wednesday night throughout the summer.
When organizers Ron and Marlene Weber first moved the event to the Foundry Street location nine years ago, they only averaged 60 cars a week.
“We don't have enough room anymore,” laughed co-organizer Rockin' Ron Weber. “ We put them up the street and in behind the senior centre now.”
He speculates that the success of the show might be that it is a perfect, short drive to Baden from many urban areas that culminates in a beautiful setting to show off the cars. Occasionally, they have drivers from as far away as Windsor, Welland and Barrie.
Weber and his wife work hard to keep the event fresh every year.
“This year we have the North Easthope Tractor Club back on June 27 to show their antique tractors. We invite anyone else with a vintage tractor to bring it out as well,” he said.
On June 20, the weekly DJ is off on a holiday and the band the Villagers takes the stage to donate an evening of live music. They are a 60s and 70s cover band with local ties to St. Agatha.
The show moves over to Petersburg on Father's Day to partner with the Petersburg Optimists' Father's Day breakfast. Approximately 400 cars will be on display and 2000 breakfasts are planned to be served.
Weber is expecting between 20 to 40 electric cars to be on-site Aug. 15 when the Waterloo Regional Electric Vehicle Association arrives in Baden.
The 20-foot juvenile gray whale that showed up in Newport Harbor last week is making itself at home in the Back Bay, officials said Monday.
The whale was most recently seen in the Back Bay on Sunday, where it has been hanging out since Friday, according to the Orange County Sheriff's Department Harbor Patrol.
Harbor Patrol officials said they still don't plan to try to coax the whale back into the ocean.
Officials with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration advised the Harbor Patrol to let the whale swim around on its own until it finds its way out of the harbor.
Newport Coastal Adventure captain Taylor Thorne, who was among the first to see the whale just before noon Thursday as it cruised up the main harbor channel toward Lido Isle, said he suspects it's the same whale that was seen in Dana Point Harbor on Tuesday and that it's trying to make its way up the coast.
Gray whales, which have the longest migration of any mammal, usually spend the summer feeding on plankton off Alaska. In the fall, they migrate to warmer waters off Baja California.
It's not clear why this one stopped in Newport Beach when most of its fellow whales already had made their way through the area.

Detroit Tigers ace Justin Verlander apparently isn't worried he might be tipping his pitches.
The right-hander tweeted "working on my tipping" Monday with a GIF of himself drinking a beer in a pool.
Verlander matched a career high by allowing nine runs Saturday in the Indians' 13-6 win over the Tigers. He gave up 11 hits in four-plus innings, including home runs by Carlos Santana and Lonnie Chisenhall. The 2011 AL Cy Young Award winner and MVP also gave up nine runs against the Chicago White Sox on April 6, 2008, and versus Texas on May 25, 2014.
Manager Brad Ausmus said Verlander and catcher James McCann changed their signals throughout the game as a precaution against signs being stolen.
On Sunday, McCann strongly hinted that he believed Verlander was tipping his pitches.
"We use multiple signs with nobody on base. We change our signs often. It's got to be something other than that," McCann told reporters, according to mlive.com.
"For a day where I thought he had his best stuff all season, they seemed to be on quite a few pitches," McCann said. "What that is, I don't know. We're going to study film and see."
Indians manager Terry Francona said his team wasn't stealing signs.
"I'm just happy when our guys get our signs -- and I'm being serious about that."
Asked if he thought Verlander might be tipping his pitches, Ausmus told reporters: "Could be."
"Hitters are always trying to find an edge on pitchers. And looking for a pitcher tipping is standard operating procedure. I can't tell you whether it is or isn't. Only the Indians could tell you that, and they probably won't," he said, according to mlive.com.

LONDON-Great Britain is in the top 10% of areas for harbouring alien species, according to a study. Animals that have moved in from afar include the grey squirrel, rose-ringed parakeet and the noble false widow spider. The UK also has more established alien plants than elsewhere in Europe, such as Himalayan balsam. Scientists say islands and mainland coastal regions are global “hotspots” for alien species.
They are calling for more effective measures to stop further introductions of plants and animals into vulnerable ecosystems. “We need to be much better at trying to prevent the introduction of species that can be harmful in the first place,” said Dr Wayne Dawson of Durham University, UK. “Prevention is better than cure with invasive species.” Alien species are plants or animals that are non-native (or alien) to an ecosystem and whose introduction is likely to cause harm. International researchers studied data on eight groups of plants and animals across 186 islands and 423 mainland regions. They found: Great Britain is 29th out of 540 regions (countries, states or island blocks) in terms of established alien species (of which a subset is invasive). The top three global “hotspots” for alien species are the Hawaiian Islands, the North Island of New Zealand and Indonesia's Lesser Sunda Islands.
Hawaii has high numbers of alien species in all eight groups studied, including fish such as guppies and mammals such as feral pigs.
New Zealand is not far behind Hawaii, with about half of plant life being made up of non-native species. Many native birds have suffered from predation by mammals such as rats, cats and possums.
Among coastal mainland regions, Florida in the US is the top hotspot, with invasive ants and reptiles such as the Burmese python.
Islands and mainland coastal regions are thought to have higher numbers of established alien plants and animals because they contain major points of entry such as ports.
These areas should be a focus for preventing further introductions of alien species, say scientists.
Measures include stepping up biosecurity measures at entry points to detect stowaway species and careful vetting of species proposed for introduction to an area.
RIO DE JANEIRO(Reuters) - Leaders of Rio de Janeiro's heavily armed drug gangs agree on at least one thing with the head of Brazil's army: An ongoing military intervention cannot solve the soaring crime and violence that is roiling the seaside metropolis.
“Will the army break this cycle of violence?” asked a leader of the Red Command, Rio's most powerful drug gang, on a recent weeknight as deputies weighed marijuana and cocaine on a digital scale in a slum from which they operate. “Not a chance.”
The comments, made to Reuters during a rare visit to leaders of Rio's two most influential drug gangs, come two months after President Michel Temer deployed 30,000 troops here, saying organised crime had “taken over Rio de Janeiro.”
The gang leaders are admitted criminals wanted by police for their role in drug violence.
Their viewpoint, which Reuters sought in an effort to understand both sides of Rio's violent divide, reveals organizations that are unapologetic for their criminal activities but not likely to attack a military they see as a temporary inconvenience, at worst.
“Nothing will change,” said a leader of the Pure Third Command, Rio's second most powerful gang and the arch rivals of the Red Command. He said he may lie low during the intervention but his foot soldiers will keep selling drugs.
“I will return and get back to work when they leave,” he added.
Two months into the army's 10-month deployment, this metropolitan area of more than 12 million people is even more tense than before – riven by the recent murder of a prominent city councilwoman and, days later, police killings of eight young men in Rocinha, Rio's largest slum.
The killings add to a mounting toll of homicides that spiked after a recent recession gutted Brazil's economy and Rio's public security budget. In just three years, as police went unpaid and ill-equipped, violent deaths here surged 35 percent, according to state figures.
Although violence has plagued Rio for decades, the rate is the grisliest of many indicators once again despairing locals. Before the recession, many thought Rio had finally turned a corner, booming with offshore oil and successfully hosting the most recent summer Olympic and World Cup competitions.
Now, even the head of Brazil's army, General Eduardo Villas Boas, says Rio should not expect a quick fix for violence that pits underfunded police against drug gangs and paramilitary militias that control large swathes of the metropolitan region.
In March, the first full month with the army in charge of security, 191 violent deaths were reported within Rio city limits, a 24 percent increase from February. Police killings of suspects jumped 34 percent in the same period.
While the military will work to restructure police ranks and root out pockets of well-documented corruption, real solutions must be “extremely long term,” the general said during a March briefing. Rio's problems stem from “decades and decades of neglect and not meeting the population's basic needs,” he added.
“NO REAL IMPACT”
Nearly a fifth of Rio's population live in favelas, sprawling slums where many go without basic water, sewerage or garbage services. Favelas are home to millions of law-abiding citizens but also, because of the lack of state presence, Rio's most powerful drug gangs.
Despite their role in the drug trade, which ravages communities and spawns bloody turf wars, the gangs have long provided authority where the government does not. The gangs are tolerated, even welcomed, by many residents fearful of what they see as trigger-happy police.
The March shootings in Rocinha were typical of the grim contradictions that often surround Rio law enforcement operations, many of which are never fully investigated. While police claimed the young men were drug traffickers, their families denied any gang connections.
Reuters recently spent three days and nights in the redoubts of the Red Command and, separately, the Pure Third Command. Their leaders, who spoke on condition of anonymity and that their precise locations not be disclosed, discussed the military intervention and the large social divide that in many ways empowers them.
They did not discuss specific crimes or recent incidents.

Scores of subordinates, armed with pistols and AR-15 style rifles, guarded streets around both hideouts. Neither soldiers nor police, who retain responsibility for most street patrols and other day-to-day law enforcement, were anywhere nearby.
The Red Command leader, who started as a gang lookout three decades ago at age 11, said he expects little interference during the intervention. Deployments in 2014 and 2016, when soldiers supplemented police forces while Rio hosted the World Cup and Olympics, barely affected business, he recalled.
“They tried before,” he said. “There was no real impact on violence or our ability to operate.”
That is in part because the gangs, who often have superior armaments to police forces, hail from and are the de facto rulers of many of Rio's roughly 1000 favelas. They not only control the drug trade but have the authority, especially in moments of conflict, to order businesses and schools to close.
“To truly attack us, they have to turn this into an urban war,” the Red Command leader said. “The gangs, no matter which, are part of the favela. We come from it and blend into it, are part of the fabric. How are they going to pull that apart without a slaughter?”
“ON OUR OWN”
The Pure Third Command leader, speaking to Reuters in a favela 25 kms (16 miles) away from the Red Command-controlled slum, said the previous deployments made it clear to gangs that they, after frequent armed clashes with police, are more seasoned combatants than troops.
After all, Brazil's army has not waged war in nearly 150 years.
“Soldiers are inexperienced kids who have seen a lot less fighting than we have,” he said. “They do not really want to come after us.”
Brazil's army did not respond to requests for comment beyond those already made by the general.
But security experts not involved in the intervention agree with the gangs' assessment. At most, they say, the army can help Rio authorities analyse the problems of a police force known as corrupt, violent and ineffective.
“The best thing that can come from this is that the army gives a comprehensive diagnosis of the challenges,” said Paulo Storani, a former Rio police commander who now works as a security consultant.
In the chaotic streets of favelas where the gangs operate, the challenges are not hard to see. Trash piles up along pothole-filled roads, where a din of engines and high-pitched horns blare from motorcycles dodging pedestrian traffic.
In the slum where Reuters met the Red Command leader, a group of young boys, shirtless and shoeless, chased each other. They held makeshift pistols carved from white foam packaging.
A few yards away, a group of teenage boys brandished the real thing. Some straddled Kawasaki motorcycles, others leaned against cars, Glock 9 mm pistols holstered to their hips.
“We are left on our own here,” said Flavia Rocha, a 26-year-old mother of two who runs a small grocery store nearby.
She lamented the quality of government across Rio, a city and eponymous state where every governor elected in the last two decades has been convicted of corruption, faces criminal charges or is under investigation. “And people wonder how criminals came to dominate these areas,” she said.

As Rio's institutions have crumbled, the gang leaders said, their factions have grown stronger. Not only have they been able to reclaim territory that police forces had occupied before the recession, gangs no longer feel on the defensive.
“If the police come in, we are stronger than before and can combat them with even more force,” the Pure Third Command leader said.

RAWALPINDI, Aug 14 (APP): Chief of Army Staff (COAS) on Monday visited
forward troops deployed at Line of Control (LoC).
According to an Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) statement issued
here, the COAS was apprised of the recent abnormally frequent Cease Fire Violations from the Indian side and effective response by Pakistani troops.
The Army chief was told that the only restraint faced by Pakistani
troops was the professional ethos of Pakistan Army which barred them from responding in kind when Indian troops target innocent civilians along the LoC.
He lauded the motivation and spirit of the troops stating that there was
no better way to celebrate independence than defending the country.
The COAS said that the Indian Army's atrocities had not been able to
deter the spirit and sacrifices of the brave Kashmiris in Indian Occupied Kashmir.
“We will always stand with them in their just struggle against
repression,” he added.
Earlier, on arrival, the COAS was received by Commander Rawalpindi Corps, Lieutenant General Nadeem Raza.
The NDP promised tolls on bridges would come off at the end of the summer, so with that deadline looming, the big question is “when.”
“It's coming soon, there is some financial paperwork to deal with, it has a huge financial impact,” said Jobs Minister and Surrey Whalley NDP MLA Bruce Ralston.

Surrey Mayor Linda Hepner said she thinks everyone in Surrey is excited about that prospect.
“I'm very happy to see the removal of tolls until we have a more definitive understanding of how we should be pricing this region.”

Meanwhile, Social Development and Poverty Reduction Minister Shane Simpson said he believes they are getting close to an announcement.
“I know there is analysis being done,” said Simpson.
According to Ralston however, there is no avoiding job loss at the company that collects the tolls.

Day one into public hearings on Montreal's massive new spending budget, the capital works budget, and already, many questions are emerging.
Some city councillors sitting on the finance commission that studies the $6.383-billion budget are wondering whether this is merely an academic exercise.
Westmount Mayor Christina Smith is concerned this budget is being introduced very late.
“To go out for these projects is late. It will only be approved in mid-February,” Smith told Global News at Montreal city hall.
The $6.383-billion budget outlines Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante's spending priorities for the next three years.
The agglomeration council — which includes suburban cities and towns — is responsible for more than one-third of that amount.
Some of the members fear they won't get their bank for their buck.

“When I look at what we asked for and what is in the budget for 2018, obviously we didn't get anywhere near what we would have liked to see,” Beaconsfield Mayor Georges Bourelle told Global News.
Nearly $35 million is earmarked for upgrades to two downtown parks; Place du Canada park and Dorchester Square park.
Taxpayers living in the de-merged cities are on the hook to pay for some of the renovation work.

The same is true for $50 million to build new bike paths or improve existing ones on the island. Westmount is hoping to get some of that money.
“There was a commitment for some investments into the bike path along de Maisonneuve (Boulevard) to make it safer. I mean, that is like a bike auto-route there so we do need to invest in that,” Smith said.

The $6.4-billion capital works budget is almost the same as last year. One big difference — a lot more of the money this year will be borrowed. And that could cost everyone.
“If we're paying more in interest, then correspondingly, there will be less money available for services to residents. So I think there is a need to cap the debt and take measures to reduce the debt rather than spending willfully without having any concerns of what the debt will do,” Saint-Laurent Borough Mayor Alan DeSousa told Global News.
The finance commission has scheduled six days of hearings for the budget. After that, it will be voted on by the entire city council.
United Launch Alliance will lay off 48 people at Vandenberg Air Force Base, a move that comes as rival SpaceX ups the competition in the launch services market.
The joint venture between aerospace giants Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. said the layoffs will take place June 1, according to a notice filed in late March under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. Most of those affected are aerospace technicians.
United Launch Alliance said last year that it would initiate two rounds of layoffs — one in 2016 that eliminated about 350 positions and one this year — to accomplish its “business goals.”
“United Launch Alliance continues to transform our company to provide cost-effective solutions for our customers, while we maintain our focus on mission success,” the venture said in a recent statement. “We appreciate all of our team members' contributions and understand the difficulty and stress that workforce reductions place on the impacted employees and their families.”
The company launches rockets from three pads at Vandenberg.
The venture has faced increased competition for military launch contracts after Hawthorne-based SpaceX was certified in 2015 by the U.S. Air Force to launch national security satellites, breaking up a long-standing and lucrative monopoly held by United Launch Alliance.
Since then, SpaceX has been awarded two Air Force satellite launch contracts, the most recent of which came in March.
At the same time, the U.S. has largely finished replacing Cold War-era spy satellite constellations with newer satellites, meaning there will be fewer national security satellite launches in the years to come, said Loren Thompson, aerospace analyst at the Lexington Institute, a think tank that receives money from Lockheed and Boeing.
“On the one hand, the Air Force has now replaced many of its most sensitive satellites,” he said. “And on the other hand, SpaceX is competing successfully to win some of the business that's left.”
Vandenberg is a military and commercial satellite launch site for both ULA and SpaceX, which launches Falcon 9 rockets from a pad on base.
The base is home to the 30th Space Wing, which manages space and missile testing for the Department of Defense, as well as the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile force development evaluation program.
Vandenberg also houses at least four interceptors for the U.S. Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system, which is capable of intercepting long-range missiles from North Korea, Thompson said.

Metrolinx is looking at ways to integrate all transit fares across the GTHA. One proposal would link the fare paid to the distance travelled. Richard Lautens / Toronto Star ) Order this photo
How much should it cost to ride the TTC? According to a new policy under consideration by the province's regional transit agency, it should depend on how far you travel. Metrolinx, the provincial organization that oversees transit for the GTHA, is considering a fare model for the area's transit operators that would see all passengers on buses, streetcars, subways, and GO Transit pay by distance. A report on the issue will be discussed at Friday's Metrolinx board meeting, as part of its ongoing fare integration project that aims to standardize the pricing policies of GO and the region's nine municipal transit agencies. The fare-by-distance model was made public Tuesday, and joins three other proposals that were already under consideration. “It would be system-wide and be a very major dramatic change,” said Leslie Woo, chief planning officer for Metrolinx, “but it would enable greater consistency in fares (across the region) and it would better reflect the cost of the length of the trip.”
Article Continued Below
Woo said more work needs to be done to determine which model is best. The three original options are: a modified version of the status quo that would provide discounts for riders crossing between the TTC and GO; a zone-based system that would charge riders more for crossing defined boundaries; and a hybrid that would have a flat rate for local bus travel but charge by distance or zone for subways and regional rail. While two of the previous options included some form of distance-based charge, the new proposal would charge all riders a per kilometre rate. Similar systems are used in places like Hong Kong, Singapore, and the Netherlands.
The dollar value of the per kilometre charge hasn't been determined, but Woo said it could vary depending on the transit agency, and whether passengers were travelling by bus, subway, or regional rail. Like the other options, the fare-by-distance proposal is dependent on the full implementation of the Presto fare card system across the TTC and the other transit agencies in the region. The TTC currently charges a flat rate for trips of any distance, which agency leaders have frequently described as a major selling point for Toronto's transit system. In an email, TTC spokesperson Brad Ross acknowledged that there would be some advantages to switching to fare-by-distance, but that the existing structure is very user friendly. “One of the benefits to customers is that they know how much a ride is going to cost them before they travel,” he said. “Another is that no matter how far you travel you pay the same fare.” Asked Tuesday about Metrolinx's latest proposal, Mayor John Tory said it was too early to endorse any fare model. But he said that the current GO price structure is “unfair” for people travelling within Toronto and “should be fixed.” GO currently charges a high base fare plus a distance component. According to a 2016 city report, that discourages trips on the GO network within Toronto by making short journeys too expensive. Passengers coming from outside the city to Union Station pay much less per kilometre than passengers who board within the city limits. A per kilometre charge would likely render short trips within Toronto cheaper by comparison. That would be critical for attracting riders to Tory's SmartTrack rail plan, which is being implemented on GO lines within Toronto. Metrolinx is expected to finish preparing its business case for fare integration in the third quarter of 2017. There is no timetable for when a new fare model will be put in place.
Drivers stole two Los Angeles police cruisers and led officers on a winding chase Wednesday night, authorities said.
The pursuit came to an end after both cruisers — yes, both — crashed and the drivers were apprehended, said Officer Tony Im, an LAPD spokesman.
During the chase, an officer following the stolen vehicles also crashed an LAPD cruiser, Im said.
It's unclear when or how the two marked cruisers were stolen, but officers located the vehicles about 9:30 p.m. in the 400 block of East 61st Street, Im said.
A pursuit began, and one of the police cars crashed at 77th and San Pedro streets. The driver was taken into custody.
The chase continued and a pursuing officer's cruiser crashed at Gage Avenue and Broadway, Im said.
Other officers continued following the stolen vehicle, which crashed at Adams Boulevard and Central Avenue.
Im said it was unclear whether either driver of the stolen vehicles or the officer was injured, and their names were not immediately available.

The cliffhanger that closes out Margaret Atwood's 1985 feminist dystopia novel, “The Handmaid's Tale,” has mystified Bruce Miller, the showrunner behind Hulu 's television adaption, ever since he read the book in college not long after the book's release.
Set in Gilead, a near-future America in which theocratic extremists have taken control, Atwood's main narrative concludes as June/Offred, the story's rebellious handmaid heroine, is whisked away in a van by soldiers for what appears to be her role in the resistance.
June's destination and future are unknown — all she has to pin her hopes on are the reassuring words of her secret lover, the driver of her “Commander.”
The first season of the series ended on the same suspenseful note.
So, what happens next? Will June escape Gilead? Or has her confidant been conspiring against her all along — leading June to her punishment?
Fans of the book and series will see what Miller, whose imagination was boosted with the aid of a team of writers and Atwood's input, has come up with when the Emmy-winning drama returns for its second season Wednesday with two new episodes. (Subsequent installments will be released each week).
“It really came from what would really happen,” Miller, 53, says over lunch on a recent day in Beverly Hills. “That was our go-to all the time.”
The new installments pick up right where Season 1 left off, with a pregnant June's destination revealed. Now moving past the narrative of the book, the next 13 episodes delve deeper into the dystopian setting — viewers will learn more about the historical events that led to the creation of Gilead and get a glimpse of the not-previously shown Colonies, the badlands outside Gilead where prisoners, known as unwomen, essentially go to die.
But a central theme of the season is motherhood, and the complications that arise when bearing a child in this world.
“When I describe Season 2, I usually say, ‘It's a ticking time bomb,'” Miller says. “It's ‘I'm pregnant — and what does that mean?' In Gilead, it is, ‘How am I going to bring this kid into this world? Also, it's kind of protecting me, but not forever.' Just the idea of Gilead is all about babies. What happens when you get a baby?”

When I describe Season 2, I usually say, ‘It's a ticking time bomb.' Bruce Miller, showrunner of Hulu's "The Handmaid's Tale."
Careful not to spill anything on his blue suit jacket while seated at a restaurant inside the hotel where he's doing press for the show, Miller is in that period before a wave comes barreling in. In a few hours, the first two episodes will premiere at the TCL Chinese Theatre, and in less than a week, they will be up on Hulu.
There are a lot of expectations riding on the new episode. There's inherent pressure that follows a successful show in its second season — all the greater for “The Handmaid's Tale” as it extends the story past the novel.
Far from anxious, Miller is eager: “That's the nicest part, to have people finally watch,” he says. “Because we've been sitting with it for so long.”
Not everyone would be so calm. “The Handmaid's Tale,” which is produced by MGM Television, makes its return after a blockbuster debut. Headlined by Elisabeth Moss (“Mad Men,” “Top of the Lake”), the drama instantly earned acclaim among viewers and critics for its deft depiction of women stripped of their rights and sparked countless think pieces about the current political and culture climate. It went on to win a heap of accolades, including five Emmy Awards — most notably for outstanding drama series, making Hulu the first streaming service to win in the category.
The hoopla made Miller, who won an Emmy for his writing on the series, one of TV's most powerful showrunners. And, yes, you'd be right in noting the paradox of a man helming an adaptation of a woman's story about the oppression of women, and it's not lost on him.
Long interested in adapting the novel, Miller watched as attempts to translate it for TV fell through — including at Showtime with Ilene Chaiken (“The L Word,” “Empire”) set to write. When MGM started discussions to bring it to Hulu, the goal was to find a woman to lead its charge.

“They were looking for a female showrunner, wisely,” Miller says. “And I was completely on their side. I waited patiently. If they had succeeded, I would have tried to get on the show in any capacity. When I finally went in and talked to them, I talked about the show that I thought we should make and they were excited by it. I had 30 years to think about it.”
Atwood, referencing the first two scripts Miller submitted, was pleased with his vision for the series and the way he sought to enhance the book.
“We had a few earlier gos with other people,” she says in a telephone interview. “Bruce's was very strong, very cinematic. It got us right into the story. And it seemed to be respecting the parameters of the book… I've worked in film and television in the '70s quite a bit. And I worked with men a lot, because it mostly was men. They're individuals. So some of them I worked very well with, and others not so well with. And Bruce is an individual who I can work well with.”
Moss, who is also a producer, was impressed too.
“Bruce understands this material,” the actress, who won an Emmy for her portrayal of Offred/June, wrote in an email. “And he's also man enough to know that there are things he will never understand by not being a woman. He relies heavily on his female writers and producers, myself included, to provide that unique voice… Telling this story from a feminist and female point of view is probably more important to him than anyone. Hence why he's the human for the job. We'll forgive him for being born a man. Nobody's perfect.”
“The Handmaid's Tale” has placed Miller in the top ranks of TV producers following an unspectacular, though steady, resume.
Bruce is an individual who I can work well with. Margaret Atwood, the author of "The Handmaid's Tale"
Originally from Stamford, Conn., Miller developed an interest in writing while in high school. As a dyslexic, he felt drawn to the challenge of trying to figure out how to get a story from his head onto the page when getting anything on a page felt Herculean. Motivated by the works of Stephen King , John Irving and Kurt Vonnegut , he'd take fiction writing classes at Brown University, which was where he first read “The Handmaid's Tale.”
“There was a semester where I didn't take a writing class and I was like, edgy,” Miller recalls with a chuckle. “I realized, ‘Shoot, now I've got to keep doing this.' ”
Two weeks after graduation, Miller moved out to Studio City, where he lived with five people in a cramped apartment, and pursued a career in writing movie features while working at a local bookstore. Not long after realizing his movie work was failing to make an impression, he turned his attention to television.

After working on a number of TV movies and the little-seen cable series “Higher Ground,” starring Hayden Christensen (“Star Wars: Episode II — Attack of the Clones”), Miller scored his most high-profile credit in 2002 when he joined the writing staff of NBC's “ER” during the show's ninth season.
It was a dream come true for Miller, a fan of the series. But he acknowledges he faced a steep learning curve in settling into a well-oiled machine with a sprawling cast.
“I stunk when I got there,” Miller says. “I wasn't good yet. I wasn't good at producing. I wasn't good at writing. But I learned a ton.”
He wasn't asked to return after his two-year deal was up. But he credits the show for teaching him how to write for television.
“He came in during a particularly tough time on the series — we were in the midst of changes to our central cast,” says “ER” executive producer John Wells by phone. “There was a lot of pressure from the network about what we were doing. One of the many things that's wonderful about Bruce's writing is he takes a novelistic approach, he's very character-driven. When ‘The Handmaid's Tale' took off, I couldn't have been more pleased for a human being.”
Miller is direct about his career: Though he worked on several shows, including “Everwood,” “Medium” and “Men in Trees,” the stints wouldn't last long. He blames his inability to figure out how to make himself useful on a show.
He finally found his footing on Syfy's “Eureka,” a show about a small town sheriff in a town of scientific wonders — eventually becoming co-showrunner. He'd run other shows — “Alphas” and “The 100” — before landing his bucket list gig with “The Handmaid's Tale.”
Charlie Craig, who was the showrunner who hired Miller onto “Eureka” and would work with him again on “The 100,” praised Miller's big-picture outlook. He referenced a mini-retreat they took to examine what had worked, and hadn't worked, on the show.
“He's someone that likes to take a step back before talking about where the story should go,” Craig says by phone.
Miller, who still calls Studio City home and is married with three children, says he learned about the kind of showrunner he wanted (and didn't want) to be in that period, emphasizing the importance of listening — particularly now as he oversees a majority-female writing staff on a show about what it means to be a woman whose rights are taken.
“I did realize at some point that my listening skills weren't too good — that instead of listening, I was just waiting for my turn to talk,” Miller says. “As a showrunner, you can't do that because you shut everybody out. Our writers room [on ‘The Handmaid's Tale'] has to be honest. Not only for people willing to share things, but also feel safe when other people are asking questions respectfully and out of genuine curiosity that you need to know for the show.”
The result is an unflinching examination of a patriarchal nightmare and the growing resistance to it-- a portrayal that has drawn comparisons to the current momentum of the #MeToo movement.
“I wish it wasn't relevant at all,” Miller says.
Blessed be the wish.

A memorial service is scheduled for Wednesday for Vanguard University professor Sherilyn Rae Benvenuti, a former dean of students and co-founder of the Costa Mesa university's Global Center for Women and Justice. She died Feb. 8 at age 64.
Benvenuti, an Assemblies of God minister for more than 45 years, was a professor of social ethics at Vanguard from 1995 until fall 2016, the university said. She also served as dean of students and vice president of student affairs from 2001 to 2005.
Before that, she was dean of students and vice president of student affairs at Life Pacific College in San Dimas.
Benvenuti began her long association with Vanguard in the late 1980s and early '90s when she earned a bachelor of arts degree and a master's in religion and biblical studies from the university. She obtained a doctorate in social ethics from USC in 2000.
Her extensive background in social ethics made her a model professor at Vanguard, said university President Michael Beals.
"There's a kindness to her that really affected everything and everyone," Beals said. "I think it's part of why she was regarded highly. She was genuinely kind and cared about people."
In 2003, Benvenuti co-founded the university's Global Center for Women and Justice, which aims to advance the status of women through research, education and advocacy.
She also wrote and published the book "When Life Happens: An Honest Look at the Stuff That Comes Along" in 2010.
Vanguard alumna Heather Schwartz said Benvenuti helped foster her career as a teacher at Life Pacific College.
"She was so patient listening to my young-adult drama, which seems so silly now," Schwartz said. "Benvenuti was influential in demolishing my fears of becoming a woman in ministry."
Benvenuti is survived by her brother Thomas E. Benvenuti Jr.; nephews Johnathan and Anthony Benvenuti; niece Nicole Allison and great-niece Saxon Benvenuti.
Wednesday's service will be held at 6:30 p.m. at Newport Mesa Church at Vanguard University, 55 Fair Drive. Donations are requested to the William J. Seymour Endowed Scholarship, which Sherilyn Benvenuti established in 2005 to help increase diversity on campus. To make a donation, visit vanguard.edu/honorsheri.

Asaram rape case verdict LIVE updates: The verdict in the rape case involving self-styled godman Asaram will be delivered today. The judge is expected in Jodhpur jail shortly where the case will be heard. Expecting a repeat of the Panchkula violence during Dera Sacha Sauda's leader Ram Rahim verdict, officials beefed up security in three states. Unlike the Dera Sacha Sauda sect leader's verdict, where thousands of supporters slept on pavements, the pro-Asaram group is conspicuously invisible.
According to News18, Ram Rahim's supporters were organised and led by wing leaders. In Asaram's case, there does not seem to be any central leadership on the ground. The police in Jodhpur seem to be much more vigilant, combing all hotels every four house and sealing entry, exit points.
Around 1,500 police personnel are deployed around the Central Jodhpur Jail premises, railway stations, roadways bus stand and court premises. The trial court judge, who will pronounce the judgment on Wednesday, has arrived at the Jodhpur Central Jail premises.
Security has been stepped up in Jodhpur Central Jail ahead of Wednesday's trial court verdict in the alleged rape of a teenager by self-styled godman Asaram who faces a minimum term of 10 years if convicted.
Apprehending a threat to law and order, the Centre asked Rajasthan, Gujarat and Haryana governments to tighten security and deploy additional forces as the three states have a large number of followers of the 77-year-old Asaram.
In a communication, the Union Home Ministry told the three states to beef up security and ensure that no violence takes place after the judgment on Wednesday. The three states were also told to deploy additional forces in sensitive places, a Home Ministry official said.
As per the directions of the Rajasthan High Court, the trial court will deliver its verdict in the Jodhpur Central Jail premises where Asaram has been lodged for the past over four years.
"We have made all arrangements for the judgment day,” DIG Jail Vikram Singh said.
“The magistrate along with court staff, Asaram and the co-accused along with the defence and prosecution counsels will remain present in the courtroom in the jail premises,” he said.
Asaram is accused of raping a teenage girl from Shahajahanpur in Uttar Pradesh, who was studying at the godman's ashram at Chhindwara in Madhya Pradesh. Asaram has denied the rape charges.
The victim had alleged that Asaram called her to his ashram in Manai area near Jodhpur and raped her on the night of 15 August, 2013.
"I have full faith in the judiciary and am confident that Asaram will be given the severest form of punishment," said the victim's father.
Security was also stepped up around the victim's house in Shahajahanpur.
"The security for the victim's family is continuously being monitored... Two more constables will stand guard outside her house in addition to the five policemen already deployed there, and a strict vigil is being maintained on all the visitors using CCTV cameras," Superintendent of Police KB Singh said.
A vigil was also being kept outside Asaram's ashram at Rudrapur, he said.
The Union Home Ministry's advisory was sent in view of the fact that large-scale violence was witnessed in Haryana, Punjab and Chandigarh after a special court in Mohali convicted Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim in 2017.
Final arguments in the Asaram case had been completed by the special court for SC/ST cases on 7 April and the court had kept the order reserved for 25 April.
Asaram was arrested in Indore and brought to Jodhpur on 1 September, 2013. He is under judicial custody since 2 September, 2013.
The chargesheet against Asaram and four other co-accused Shiva, Shilpi, Sharad and Prakash was filed by the police on November 6, 2013 under various sections of the POSCO Act, Juvenile Justice Act and IPC. If convicted, Asaram could be jailed for a minimum of 10 years or awarded a maximum life term, according to prosecution lawyers.
Asaram is also facing a rape case in Surat in Gujarat in which the Supreme Court earlier this month gave five weeks time to the prosecution to complete the trial.
"We have imposed section 144 of CrPC in the city from 21 April and it would remain effective till 30 April. Besides this, we have been keeping a sharp eye on Asaram's ashrams and checking all hotels and guest houses as well as the bus and railway stations,” DCP (East) Aman Deep Singh said in Jodhpur.
“We will also seal the jail on the day of judgment and would not allow anyone to get close to the jail premises,” he said.
Asaram unsuccessfully moved 12 bail applications, of which six were rejected by the trial court, three by the Rajasthan high court and three by the Supreme Court.

Prediction
These teams are so similar, it's difficult to think any result would be surprising. Either team can blow out the other. Either team can win a close battle. An argument can be made for any result, and given how many weeks both teams have had to prepare, anything is possible. If Penn State wants to win, it will have to start better than it has during the regular season. If USC wants to win, it will have to finish better. Both teams have a ton of momentum. Both have changed their seasons after slow starts. They key to who will keep that momentum going lies, as it so often does, in the play of the quarterback. Great as Sam Darnold has been for USC, Penn State's Trace McSorley has consistently come up with bigger plays, in bigger moments, all season long. Penn State won the better conference. Penn State beat the better teams. It should come out with a victory in its biggest game in years.
Penn State 34, USC 27

The City of Edmonton is in need of a new mayor of Commonwealth.
On Friday afternoon, the Edmonton Eskimos announced they had traded popular star defensive end, Odell Willis, to the Ottawa Redblacks in exchange for international defensive lineman, Jake Ceresna.
BREAKING: The #Esks acquire international DL Jake Ceresna from the Ottawa Redblacks in exchange for international DL Odell Willis. pic.twitter.com/KmQDeOpSVi — Edmonton Eskimos (@EdmontonEsks) February 2, 2018
Willis played five seasons for the Eskimos. He played 86 games, recording 46 quarterback sacks, including eight in the 2017 season.
He was named a Western Division All-Star in 2014 and helped the Eskimos to a Grey Cup championship in 2015 in a win over the Redblacks.

Ceresna will be entering his second CFL season. He played in 14 games last season, recording 18 defensive tackles, two quarterback sacks, and 11 quarterback pressures.

Willis was later traded by the Redblacks to the B.C. Lions for a fourth-round pick in this year's CFL Draft and a player off the Lions' negotiation list.
Week 14 is wrapping up and chaos continues to roll on. Backfields continue to turn over and the new realities the NFL reveals constantly remind us not to cling to our conceived notions. It's a reminder that pain is always present in the joy that is fantasy football. Now we must look forward to options to assist in beefing up our fake teams to move forward, whether it be long-term replacements or a streamer just to get by.
It's just this sort of symptoms that the Deep Dive is prescribed to help alleviate. NFL Fantasy's editorial overlord Alex Gelhar dutifully attacks the waiver wire to give you the top adds for the coming week in hopes of bolstering your roster. However, in this arena, we'll look at options to help those of you looking to go a little bit further down the rabbit hole, whether you play in a deeper format or are at the mercy of your incredibly sharp league-mates who scour the waiver wire relentlessly. A player can only qualify for the deep dive if they're owned in less than 10 percent of NFL.com leagues. With that, here are 11 players you can consider adding before Week 15 either as deep FLEX plays or simply as bench stashes.
RANK 1 Nick Foles, QB, Eagles
Carson Wentz is out for the year with a torn ACL, because life is merely a futile exercise in pain and misery. Nick Foles will take his place at the helm of a high-powered Eagles offense flushed with playmakers. Philadelphia gets a sweet schedule to close the fantasy season with matchups against the Giants and Raiders in Weeks 15 and 16. If you're in desperate need of a streamer, Foles could help you in New York this week. The Giants have allowed seven touchdowns of 20-plus yards since their Week 8 bye.
RANK 2 Tion Green, RB, Lions
Tion Green didn't provide any sort of encore to his Week 13 debut where he scored a touchdown. He posted just 15 rushing yards against the Buccaneers on Sunday, despite Ameer Abdullah being a healthy scratch. However, the Lions did not commit to Abdullah as their starting back, which means Green could continue to get work. He's worth holding on to for another week in pure speculation.
RANK 3 Rod Smith, RB, Cowboys
Alfred Morris is entrenched as the starting running back through and through, but Rod Smith is providing juice as a big-play change-of-pace back. Smith has four touchdowns in his last three games and finally turned his passing game usage into a massive 113-yard receiving line against the Giants. Ezekiel Elliott will return in Week 16 but Smith and Morris will get one last week of run against the Raiders this coming Sunday night.
RANK 4 Austin Ekeler, RB, Chargers
The rookie back hasn't turned into a standalone fantasy option and has single digit touches in each of his last four games. However, Austin Ekeler fits right in with the type of handcuff back you want to hold during the fantasy playoffs. If something happens to Melvin Gordon, Ekeler would be the presumptive favorite to inherit the starting job for a team that is red hot on offense right now. The Chargers finish the season with matchups against the Chiefs, Jets and Raiders.
RANK 5 Wayne Gallman, RB, Giants
Orleans Darkwa appealed to have a strong grip in the top running back job in New York before Sunday when rookie Wayne Gallman popped back up to lead the backfield in carries (12) while drawing nine targets. We have three possible explanations for Gallman's sudden show of relevance. Ben McAdoo, now fired, was always seemingly a big Orleans Darkwa fan. The New York brass may want to get a look at their rookie back as the team's meaningless 2017 season unwinds. Lastly, Darkwa fumbled in the Week 14 loss. No matter for what reason, Gallman saw more work and that puts him back on the deep dive fantasy radar.
RANK 6 Charcandrick West, RB, Chiefs
After a stretch of struggles, it appears the Chiefs offense is starting to heat back up again. Kansas City has scored 57 points over their last two games and cleared 400 yards in each. If this offense is even close to the high-flying unit from the early months of the season, we should be stashing the backup running back in case Kareem Hunt misses time before the close of 2017.
RANK 7 Matt Brieda, RB, 49ers
Jimmy Garoppolo has the 49ers winning and the offense moving once again. Matt Breida has been on our shortlist of running back deep adds all season. However, the running back spot becomes much more appealing in an offense run by a true starting-caliber quarterback. Breida should be on rosters of teams still alive in the playoffs just in case he turns into a usable fantasy asset before the season ends.
RANK 8 Keelan Cole, WR, Jaguars
We've highlighted rookie playmaker Dede Westbrook in this space before and he paid off with over 80 yards and score in Week 14. However, fellow first-year receiver Keelan Cole has made noise of late too. It's a thin play, as Cole has just three targets in each of his last two games but he's also scored in both. Cole gets plenty of deep game work and averages over 16 yards per reception this season. The Jaguars take on the poor Texans defense in Week 15.
RANK 9 Chris Moore, WR, Ravens
With Breshad Perriman a regular on the inactive list, Chris Moore is now the Ravens No. 3 receiver. A depth wideout on a middling, at best, offense isn't exactly a fantasy must-have, but Moore bears watching. He was a college deep threat and found the end zone in Week 15.
RANK 10 O.J. Howard, TE, Buccaneers
After his two-touchdown reappearance, Cameron Brate fell quiet again in Week 14 with just a single catch for 11 yards. The Bucs may want to get more looks to their rookie tight end as their season comes to a close. O.J. Howard's snaps have gone up in each of the last three games with 53, 55 and 56. Howard has gone over 50 yards and scored a touchdown in two of his last four games. The Bucs will play the Falcons on Monday night in Week 15.
RANK 11 Jesse James, TE, Steelers
Jesse James popped up for a season-high in catches and yards on Sunday Night Football in Week 14. Vance McDonald also had his best game in a Steelers uniform with four catches for 52 yards, following up a Week 13 performance where he scored a touchdown. With the Pittsburgh offense looking like the unit we've always dreamt of over the last month, these two tight ends can find their way onto the streaming radar. The Steelers will take on the Patriots in an ultra-important and likely high-scoring affair in Week 15.

Wed, May 30: Residents in Fall River, N.S., are calling on the municipal government to allow a proposed housing development for seniors. Steve Silva reports.
There were more than a few surprises during the first week of the playoffs -- and a thus a lot of movement in the playoff power rankings:
Rookie Jake Guentzel rocks. The injury-riddled Penguins have pushed a very good Columbus Blue Jackets team to the brink with three consecutive wins -- thanks largely to the previously unheralded 22-year-old's four-goal, one-assist outburst.
The Blues might not be the better team in this first-round matchup with the Minnesota Wild, but they have the hottest goaltender on the planet in Jake Allen, who has stopped 114 of 117 Minnesota shots to give the Blues a commanding 3-0 series lead.
How many of you had the Predators shutting out the powerful Chicago Blackhawks twice in a row at the United Center to start this series? David Poile, you don't count. This series has been the surprise of the playoffs so far. Kudos to Pekka Rinne for his strong play in net to pace the Preds.
Did you wonder whether Connor McDavid and the Oilers would wobble after they lost their first playoff game since 2006 in overtime? Well you shouldn't have. Edmonton has rebounded for two consecutive wins -- including a gritty 1-0 shutout on Sunday in San Jose -- to take a 2-1 series lead.
The Calgary Flames haven't won in Anaheim since Lord Stanley was in diapers (OK, they've actually just lost 29 consecutive games there, but still). So it's no surprise that the Ducks are up 2-0 in this series -- even if they are hurting on defense and have been outplayed for long stretches.
The Canadiens are another team that rebounded impressively after dropping the playoff opener. Alexander Radulov, playoff hero. Who would have guessed?
This series has been lightning-fast, with the Toronto Maple Leafs evening things with a double-overtime goal in Game 2. But the Caps are still loaded -- and a force to be reckoned with -- as the series shifts to Toronto knotted at one win apiece.
Too young to compete? Don't tell the Leafs, who have earned this spot after a split in Washington. Defensive issues and lack of production from Auston Matthews are concerns for Toronto.
The Sens continue to push back when adversity strikes, and their comeback win thanks to Dion Phaneuf's overtime winner on Saturday was yet another example. A tip of the stick to Senators winger Clarke MacArthur for his perseverance.
The Bruins are banged-up, and they'll need Tuukka Rask to improve in net if they are to get the better of the never-say-die Senators.
The Rangers' surprisingly tepid effort in their Game 3 loss at home is a concern. And some offense would help take the pressure off Henrik Lundqvist to be perfect between the pipes.
The compromised offense -- and health -- of key contributors Joe Thornton and Logan Couture are major reasons the Sharks have fallen behind an Edmonton team that seems to grow more confident by the day.
Will the Flames take solace in the fact that they played well in Anaheim, or does fact that they couldn't take advantage of their strong play suggest this series will be over in a hurry? Over to you, Calgary.
Editor's Picks Lundqvist-Price battle too close to call Carey Price vs. Henrik Lundqvist was one of the most anticipated matchups of the first round. The Canadiens are leading the series 2-1, but it's not all on Lundqvist.
Why the West should fear the Predators Heading into Game 3 against the Chicago Blackhawks, the Nashville Predators have looked dominant. Here's why that's not a surprise -- and why they could make a very deep run this spring.
Andersen just what Leafs need The kids get all the hype, but there's little doubt the Toronto Maple Leafs would not be putting a scare into the Washington Capitals if it wasn't for the calming influence of Frederik Andersen. 2 Related
Hello? Anyone home? The Hawks scored zero goals to start this series at home and now head to Nashville, where the crowd will be rocking. I still don't think anyone believes this is over, though.
The Blue Jackets' discipline has been an issue, as they have yet to find an answer to the Penguins and face being swept out of the tournament. Columbus needs more in net from regular-season star Sergei Bobrovsky.
Three goals in three games? No wonder Minnesota's frustration is in the red zone. The Wild are staring at an improbable first-round sweep at the hands of Allen and the resilient Blues if they don't get it together.
With six words penned to his local newspaper, serial killer Todd Kohlhepp gave voice to the fears of investigators and anyone else worried that a missing loved one had become a victim of South Carolina's infamous murderer: “Yes there is more than seven.” The sentence was a chilling part of a prison letter Kohlhepp sent to the Spartanburg Herald-Journal last week — more than a year after a woman who had been summoned to Kohlhepp's property to clean was found chained by the neck inside a large storage container. The investigation led authorities to identify seven other victims. Three had also been lured to the property under cleaning gig pretenses. Their bodies were buried in shallow graves. Another four were victims of a quadruple murder that hadn't been solved for 13 years. In May, Kohlhepp pleaded guilty to avoid the death penalty and was sentenced to seven lifetimes in prison, plus 60 years.

But he apparently wants people to know — or at least wonder — about other possible victims. “I tried to tell investigators and I did tell FBI, but it was blown off,” he continued in his letter to the Herald-Journal. “It's not an addition problem, it's (a) multiplication problem. Leaves the state and leaves the country. Thank you private pilot's license.” It's plausible that there could be more murder victims. Some of Kohlhepp's previous murders had been unsolved for more than a decade. He was a gun enthusiast and, as he points out in his letter, an amateur pilot. Authorities told the media they confiscated an “arsenal” of weapons from the Woodruff property where the woman was found and Kohlhepp's home some 10 miles away.
A Coalhurst, Alta. fire official told Global News a train derailment that occurred in the town on Friday saw six cars carrying crude oil go off the tracks.
One of the cars is leaking, according to Fire Chief Mat Conte.

A new community speed watch scheme is being launched in a North Lincolnshire village today.
Residents in Thornton Curtis have volunteered to work with Humberside Police, North Lincolnshire Council and Humberside Police and Crime Commissioner Keith Hunter on a three-week pilot scheme to monitor motorists' speeds.
Officers will help to establish and train a volunteer group, who will use cameras to record speeding motorists.
The volunteers will work alongside local community policing teams and have access to the latest equipment to monitor the speed of motorists and anyone found to be speeding will receive a warning letter.
Police are aiming to use the trial to see if there is a way to continue making a positive change to drivers' behaviour and if successful, further schemes could be rolled out across the Humberside force area.
Chief Superintendent Darren Wildbore from Humberside Police said: "Joining the Police and Crime Commissioner and local authority in helping our residents in towns and villages to reduce speeding motorists on their streets is something I am happy for us to support.
"We have supported the volunteers in their training and will continue to do so throughout this pilot scheme.
"As with all neighbourhood schemes that help to reduce crime and antisocial behaviour we support the trial wholeheartedly. Once the trial has been completed we can look at the findings and see what the best course of action going forward is.
"These volunteers are residents who want to make a difference in their village and we are working with them to make their community safer and stronger for everyone living there."
Mr Hunter said: "There has always been a persistent problem with drivers speeding in all our towns and villages but particularly in rural areas. Communities tell me time and again how this inconsiderate behaviour blights their lives and how they want to help the police to reduce it.
"I have always said I want more power passed to communities and this trial looks to give residents what they have been asking for.
"We have received numerous requests for a speed watch scheme in other towns and villages so I will be monitoring the results of the trial to see if it makes a difference and if it should be rolled out further."
Councillor Richard Hannigan, the council's cabinet member for safer, greener and cleaner places, said: "I'm pleased to be joining forces with Humberside Police and the Police and Crime Commissioner on this great initiative that will give residents ownership of the scheme which will ultimately help cut the number of speeding motorists and accidents.
"We will see how the pilot goes and if it is a success, will look to roll this out to other areas. Residents in the pilot area are helping make a real difference and their support is invaluable."
A man will appear in court in connection with a letter sent to a force's most senior officer which caused concern for the safety of councillors and election candidates.
A 39-year-old man from Lanchester, near Durham, has been charged with one offence of "malicious communications."
Durham County Council's main base at County Hall in Durham.
It follows letter which was sent to the Chief Constable of Durham, Mike Barton, which arrived at the force's HQ in Aykley Heads on February 28.
The force has said that within the letter, there were the names of 57 Labour Durham County Councillors.
The letter stated that “contracts” involving varying sums of money had been taken out on each of them, this also applied to any other prospective candidate standing for the Labour Party at the forthcoming May elections.
In the aftermath of the letter's arrival, Durham Constabulary said: "Inquiries are taking place to trace the person responsible for the letter and we are liaising with Durham County Council to offer reassurance to those named."
The man, who has not been named, has been bailed to attend Peterlee Magistrates' Court at 2pm on May 16.

Rick Peterson, former leadership candidate for the Conservative Party of Canada, has announced he is seeking the Conservative nomination for the Sturgeon River – Parkland by-election.
The riding is facing a by-election after former Conservative MP Rona Ambrose vacated the seat. Jamie Mozeson, a Spruce Grove local who worked at the Prime Minister's Office during Stephen Harper's tenure, has already announced her candidacy for the Conservative nomination in the by-election. Now, Peterson, a businessman and investor who has lived in British Columbia for approximately 30 years and is in the process of moving with his family to Spruce Grove, has arrived to challenge Mozeson.
“Our choice of coming here to Spruce Grove is just a fundamentally good choice for our family and we're going to live here win or lose the nomination race,” Peterson said in an interview with the Reporter/Examiner. “Whatever we do in politics is ancillary to establishing roots in the community, to living here, to being here, and we're thrilled.”
Peterson said he believes he is the right type of candidate to replace an influential MP like Ambrose.
“The party members here aren't going to be satisfied with anything less than somebody who is as strong as she was,” he said.
Peterson said one of his biggest priorities if elected as the MP for Sturgeon River – Parkland would be to make the riding the “economic engine of Canada.”
“This riding is the epitome of the best of what Canada is. We're urban, we're suburban, and we're rural, so as the MP for the riding, I would be pushing hard for policies that, number one, lower taxes for everybody here in Sturgeon River - Parkland,” he said.
One of Peterson's key platform planks in his Conservative leadership campaign was a promise to lower corporate income taxes to 0 per cent. He said that if elected he would push to be an influential voice within the Conservative party on matters of policy, in part to advocate for his tax policies.
“Canada right now is uncompetitive on a corporate income tax level, and I will be, as the MP in the riding, a strong voice inside the Conservative caucus, keeping in mind that we have a convention next August in Halifax, and the policy platform that's decided then will be the one that we take into the 2019 election,” he said. “I want our voice and our riding to be there driving down taxes, zero corporate income tax and a 15 per cent flat tax across the board for every individual in Canada. We're going to see Sturgeon River - Parkland to be a strong voice for driving down taxes, creating jobs, creating a strong economy.”
Another way to strengthen the local economy is to ensure the construction of new oil and gas pipelines to the coast of British Columbia, according to Peterson.
“I'm going to be the strongest proponent for pipelines supporting our economy, getting our oil to foreign markets,” he said.
Peterson said another priority of his is to keep Sturgeon River – Parkland safe, citing the fentanyl crisis and current handgun regulations as pressing safety issues for the area.
He said he would like to see a “bounty system” for turning in fentanyl dealers.
“Turn in somebody who is a dealer in fentanyl, turn in somebody who is distributing fentanyl, have a high bounty on that and share the rewards with everybody who helps turn them in,” Peterson said. “Young kids have to understand that recreational drugs right now are dangerous, and as a father of four children I can tell you that I will be a vocal proponent of whatever it takes with the membership here to raise that up. This opioid crisis is one of the biggest things that is sweeping across Canada right now, and we've got to be on top of it.”
Peterson said he would relax handgun restrictions.
“We need to have a farmer who's out farming near Onoway or Morinville, and he's out in the fields, he needs to be able to carry a handgun if he comes across a grizzly bear. A recreational hunter needs to be able to carry a handgun, a concealed handgun, and they can't,” he said.
No date has been set for the by-election, but according to Elections Canada rules a date for the by-election must be announced by Dec. 31.
Southern California this weekend is getting a preview of this season's Santa Ana winds, the National Weather Service said.
Starting Friday and ending Saturday night, vegetation in Los Angeles-area mountains will dry out as warm, dry air blows across the landscape at 15 to 20 mph with occasional 40 mph gusts, said Stuart Seto of the National Weather Service.
The winds won't be strong enough to be official Santa Ana winds, but their effect is the same — they increase the risk of a brush fire exploding out of control.
A red flag warning was issued for the Los Angeles and Ventura county mountains through 8 p.m. Friday, the weather service said.
Temperatures Friday and Saturday downtown will hover in the mid-80s and in the 90s inland, Seto said. The region will see about a 10-degree dropoff in temperatures starting Sunday.
From Sunday through the middle of next week, temperatures will be in the 70s at the beach and only a few degrees warmer downtown, Seto said. The dry winds will remain, he said.
An advisory issued from Friday to Sunday night is warning beachgoers of 3- to 6-foot surf with 7-foot waves and dangerous rip currents. Visitors should avoid standing on jetties or other places where they can be swept away by a sneaker wave, Seto said.

Greater Trail RCMP confirms a report about an assault on a minor hockey referee in the Rossland arena was filed Saturday afternoon. (Photo by Matthew Fournier on Unsplash)
Berating a 15-year-old hockey referee then getting hands on with the senior official who intervened is outrageous, a thirtysomething Trail referee recounted.
But the worst part?
He says it's the parents who stood by in the Rossland Arena Friday night and either heckled or did nothing.
“I've been involved in Greater Trail Minor Hockey going on 30 years,” the ref told the Trail Times. “I've never seen anything like this and I think this story needs to be told because what happened is crazy – and it happens way more than it should right across the country.”
The misconduct began during a Bantam house game between Trail and Castlegar in the early evening of Jan. 26.
The senior referee showed up to officiate a later Bantam game – Greater Trail Minor Hockey Association held a Bantam tournament last weekend – when he noticed a group of spectators being verbally aggressive from the stands.
“They were yelling, giving the kids a rough time,” he explained. “So I hung around for a bit instead of getting ready.”
Then something happened on the ice, some pushing or shoving.
“The two young linesmen and one referee, all of them 15-years old, dealt with it,” the ref recalled. “They were at the penalty box doing their thing so I thought they had it all under control and the crowd was quiet.”
With only 20 minutes left before the next game start at 7:30 p.m., the man went to lace up in the ref's dressing room which is located close to the ice entrance/exit.
Shortly after, he could hear a very loud voice.
“I could hear the teams coming off the ice and I could hear some really loud elevated shouting right outside the (dressing room) door,” he continued. “By what this person was screaming, I knew he was yelling at the young referee himself.”
When the older official went into the corridor, he says the young ref was backed up against the wall with the parent screaming at a hair's breadth from the teenager.
“So I got myself between this guy and the young referee, I told the kid to go into the dressing room, then I proceeded to scold this man,” the ref said. “I wanted this guy to switch his focus to me and we exchanged words.”
The situation took an even uglier turn when the parent got physical with the senior official.
“He straight armed me to the throat because I wouldn't let him by to give the young fella more words” the ref told the Times. “And I wasn't going to let that happen.”
What happened next, rather what didn't happen next, is especially unsettling.
“All the while a large group of parents from Trail and Castlegar stood there and watched and none of them came to help,” he added.
“Several of them even heckled me for scolding this man, they said I was out of line.”
After the situation calmed with new players and parents arriving in the Rossland rink, the ref was left visibly shaken. Yes, he was disappointed with what had just transpired, but mostly, he was angry.
He reported the incident to BC Hockey and then on Saturday, to police.
“I am a full grown man and I can take care of myself so I am not going to press charges,” said the ref, who is also a father. “But they wanted documentation and that's why I filed a police report. All I could think about was what if there was another 15-year-old kid coming to ref the next game and not me – I mean how would you like it if someone yelled at your 15-year old like that?
“These are kids.”
Sgt. Darren Oelke from the Greater Trail RCMP confirmed a report was made to the detachment the afternoon of Jan. 27.
“The victim did not want criminal charges pursued in the matter,” Oelke said. “Basically the parent was reported to be verbally aggressive toward a 15-year-old linesman (sic) and when the head referee intervened he was pushed by the parent. It is being investigated by the BC Minor Hockey Association.”
Oelke says it's important to keep in mind that in minor hockey, the referees and linesmen are often only slightly older than the kids on the ice.
“Many rinks have adopted a yellow card policy where zero abuse by fans/parents will be accepted,” he said. “I understand the parent in this matter was banned from the rink in Rossland. Our file is concluded.”
David Flanagan, West Kootenay Lead for BC Hockey, says he was made aware of the incident shortly after it happened and immediately corresponded with all officials involved.
“I have gathered statements from all the officials that were affected by this incident and I have been corresponding with Greater Trail Minor Hockey providing them with written statements from the officials involved,” Flanagan said, clarifying a full investigation is underway by GTMHA.
“Further action includes liaising with Greater Trail Minor Hockey, West Kootenay Minor Hockey, and BC Hockey to ensure the appropriate discipline will be handed down to this parent, implementing steps to prevent a future similar situation, and communicating with all the officials involved to make sure they are supported after this negative experience.”
Still visibly upset but stressing this kind of conduct will not be tolerated in Greater Trail, the ref asked not to be identified. He plans on staying active as an official, and was concerned about whispers between the young players themselves.
“I am still going to be a referee and this guy might have more kids so I don't want to be , ‘that (expletive) who got my dad in trouble.”
The bottom line, he stresses, is that this was a Trail dad at a Trail game with Trail officiating.
“And no one came forward to help,” he said. “So I think the punishment is not enough. He will be banned for the remainder of the year at minimum for all greater Trail minor hockey events.
“But I think his kid and all of those parents should be banned for the rest of the season as well,” he concluded.
“Because really, is this something we want in hockey?”

TIRANA-In Albania, legend has it that staring into the almond-shaped eyes of the Balkan Lynx renders you blind. But today, sightings of the rare wildcat have become so unlikely that conservationists have raised a red flag about its future.
Only about 40 individuals of the animal still roam the mountains of Albania and neighbouring Macedonia, according to estimates by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which in 2015 classed the “Lynx lynx balcanicus” as critically endangered. Since 2006 a regional initiative has been under way aimed at preventing the lynx from becoming extinct. Now, Albania, Kosovo, Macedonia and Montenegro are all part of the programme to expand protection zones for the Balkan Lynx, raise awareness, especially among youngsters, and combat deforestation and poaching. It is a challenge, but there are signs of hope.
“This lynx was spotted on April 16 at 3:50 a.m.”, says Aleksander Trajce, head of Protection and Preservation of Natural Environment in Albania. Examining the photograph of what looks like a big spotted cat with very pointed ears walking in the snow through the night, his excitement is obvious. The image was captured, he explains, by dedicated cameras, set up on the mountain of Munella, in northeastern Albania. The possible sighting of the Balkan Lynx - an adult female - is encouraging for those fighting to save it. “All proof documenting the presence and the reproduction of lynx, little or adult, is a hope for the survival” of the species, said Dime Melovski, of the Macedonian Ecological Society. The Balkan Lynx “is the most jeopardised lynx in the world”, he added. The population is currently concentrated in Albania and Macedonia. “Two, or even possibly three, individuals have equally been spotted in the mountains of Kosovo,” Trajce said.
But he added that it was not possible to say if they originated from among those already known about in Albania and had wandered across, or were a separate line of reproduction.
And Melovski said it was “currently considered unlikely” for there to be any Balkan Lynx in Montenegro and Greece.
The number of Balkan Lynx has been falling strongly “for years”, said Elvana Ramaj, the Albanian environment ministry's official in charge of biodiversity.
She said it had now reached a “critical” point for the animal's existence.
In the 1970s, the region had had about 280 individual Balkan Lynxes, according to biodiversity experts.
But the impact of civil unrest, an unstable socioeconomic transition, poaching and habitat destruction have all taken a toll.
Albania suffered rampant deforestation in the 1990s, destroying the habitat and hunting ground of the lynx.
Poaching has been another factor in its demise, although in Albania it is becoming increasingly rare and much less socially accepted.
In March 2015, a baby lynx was killed by a hunter in the Munella mountain forest, sparking a strong reaction throughout the country.
As well as the IUCN, the Bern Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats has also reinforced the level of protection for the Balkans Lynx since March.
In a zoo on northern Albania's Shkodra Lake, a yowling male Balkan Lynx is testimony to the injury that humans can inflict on animals.
Trailing its left leg, whose tendons were cut in a trap nine years ago, it limps around its cage.
In the wild, “he would be dead, he would not feed himself, nor withstand the cold,” said Sokol Kota, the 37-year old zookeeper.
Apart from behind the bars of a cage, or on the face of Macedonia's five denar coin - the animal is the Macedonian national symbol - it is difficult to see a lynx.
As well as their rarity, the felines usually only venture out in the evening or at night to feed on squirrels and rabbits.
During the day, they sleep, safely hidden away in western Macedonia's mountainous national park of Mavrovo and Albania's Munella peak.
But to protect the species, it is also necessary to observe it in order to understand its movements.
For that reason, Albanian researchers in March set up a trap to capture a lynx in the Munella region so they could put a transmitter collar on to track it.
They hope to be able to intervene and rescue it, if necessary.
In February last year, a female lynx named Maya was tagged - as a result, Macedonian scientists have been able to confirm that she gave birth the following spring.
BARCELONA - Cristiano Ronaldo scored and was sent off as Real Madrid beat a Barcelona side missing Neymar by winning 3-1 in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup on Sunday. Ronaldo, only introduced as a second-half substitute, was shown two quickfire yellow cards after blasting Madrid into a 2-1 lead with 10 minutes to go.
However, Real extended their advantage with 10 men thanks to a sumptuous late strike from Marco Asensio. Earlier, Lionel Messi's penalty had cancelled out Gerard Pique's own goal as Barça failed to get the early season boost they needed from Neymar's departure for Paris Saint-Germain.
The sides meet again in Madrid for the second-leg on Wednesday. "I am proud of the players because even with 10 men they played great," said Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane, who was hopeful Madrid could appeal Ronaldo's red card to free him up for the second leg.
The World Player of the Year was booked for taking off his shirt in celebration after scoring and just two minutes later saw a second yellow card when referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea adjudged he had dived in attempting to win a penalty.
However, Ronaldo could be in more trouble as he pushed the referee in the back after being shown the 10th red card of his career. "He didn't feign anything at any moment," protested Madrid captain Sergio Ramos. "You have to appeal because to send off a key player with 10 minutes to go in a Clasico (the referee) had to evaluate the situation in a different way."
Without Neymar, Barça struggled to find their rhythm going forward as Gerard Deulofeu failed to impress in the role alongside Messi and Luis Suarez up front. "It's a very adverse result and we have to accept that they are the favourites now," admitted new Barça boss Ernesto Valverde as his reign started in disappointment. "But we need to play the second game. Everything doesn't just come to an end after one defeat."
The game exploded into life after the break, following an uncharacteristically quiet first 45 minutes. Madrid immediately upped a gear at the start of the second period and were rewarded with the opening goal in a manner that would have delighted most Real fans.
Pique is often Madrid's chief aggravator, but the Spanish international was left embarrassed as he turned Marcelo's delivery past the helpless Ter Stegen into his own net. Only an incredible goal line clearance from Jordi Alba then prevented Dani Carvajal from doubling Madrid's advantage seconds later as the game began to open up.
Ronaldo had been kept in reserve by Zidane, having missed most pre-season after his participation in the Confederations Cup with Portugal, but was finally introduced for an action-packed cameo appearance on the hour mark. With Mateo Kovacic also replaced by Asensio, Messi was given more licence to create and led Barça back into the game as Sergio Busquets somehow blazed over from close range before Messi stung the palms of Keylor Navas.
The Argentine eventually got on the scoresheet from the penalty spot after Navas brought down Suarez inside the area 13 minutes from time. However, Madrid took just three minutes to retake the lead in stunning fashion as Ronaldo cut inside Pique before curling into the top corner.
And with Barça pushing forward, Madrid picked the hosts off on the counter-attack when Asensio blasted into the top corner from the edge of the box as the game entered stoppage time to all but assure they will lift the Super Cup for a 10th time.
Tens of hundreds of school children waving the national flag welcomed INS Chennai to the Chennai port on Saturday. Commissioned into the Indian Navy in November last year, the ship was making her maiden visit to the city she is named after.
INS Chennai, which was commissioned into the Indian Navy last November, is equipped to fight under nuclear, biological and chemical warfare conditions.
The 163 metre-long ship with a displacement of 7,500 tonnes can rightfully be regarded as one of the most potent warships constructed in India. The ship is propelled by four powerful gas turbines, capable of achieving speeds in excess of 30 knots.
INS Chennai has enhanced stealth features resulting in a reduced radar cross-section achieved through efficient shaping of hull, full beam superstructure design, plated masts and use of radar transparent materials on exposed decks.
The ship was open to the public on Saturday and Sunday. Chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami is scheduled to visit the ship on Monday for the dedication ceremony which will be conducted on board INS Chennai.
More than 5,000 people, including 2,000 students, visited the warship INS Chennai over the weekend.
The visit of INS Chennai gives a chance to the people of the city to bond with the ship. INS Chennai, presently undergoing sea trial, carries 330 sailors on board, besides 40 officers.

islamabad - While the plagiarism case of COMSATS acting Rector Raheel Qamar still remains undecided, another research paper in which his name has been included as co-author has been found plagiarised, The Nation learned on Monday.
The Higher Education Commission (HEC's) plagiarism checking software ‘Turnitin' detected 59% similarity of index in the research paper ‘The Genetic Characterization of Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pakistan'.
The research paper was published in 2011 in the national Journal of Basic and Applied Sciences. The similarity index of the research paper was 59%, while 26% was plagiarised from a single source.
Meanwhile, the HEC policy and guidelines while writing a research paper state that the overall similarity of index should be less than 19% and from a single source less than 5percent.
“If the report has similarity index <=19% then benefit of doubt may be given to the author, but in case, any single source has similarity index >=5% without citation then it needs to be revised,” said the Turnitin guidelines.
According to the report available with The Nation, the research paper co-authored by acting rector COMSATS has been found similar to another research article named ‘A common polymorphism decreases low-density Lipoprotein receptor exon 12 splicing efficiency and associates with increased cholesterol' published in 2007.
The research paper was published in the journal Human Molecular Genetics and authored by Haiyan Zhu, H. Michael Tucker, Karrie E. Grear1, James F. Simpson, Alisa K. Manning, L. Adrienne Cupples and Steven Estus.
Meanwhile, ‘The Genetic Characterization of Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pakistan' in 2011 was authored by Sobia Rafiq, Nuzhat Ahmed, Ann Soutar and Raheel Qamar.
According to the reports the primary source of the content with 26% similarity index was accessed from hm.oxfordjournals.org. 5% was accessed from repositorio.insa.pt, 4% from www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov and 4% from Tosi, I. “Genetic defects causing familial hypercholesterolaemia: Identification of deletions and duplications in the LDL-receptor gene and summary of all mutations found in patients attending the Hammersmith Hospital Lipid Clinic”, Atherosclerosis, 2007-09”.
According to the ‘Turnitin' report, 24 other primary sources with less than 4% were also accessed for writing the said research paper.
According to the HEC policy for plagiarism regarding the co-author, he/she is ‘deemed to be equally responsible for any plagiarism committed in a published paper presented to or published in a journal or presented at a conference'.
The major penalty for any researcher found guilty of plagiarism includes blacklisting of his name and dismissal from service.
Earlier, 65% plagiarism was reported in the research paper ‘Wheat Genomics: Challenges and Alternative Strategies, co-authored by acting rector COMSATS Prof. Dr. Raheel Qamar.
HEC and Executive Director (ED) HEC Dr. Junaid Zaidi had formed two separate inquiry committees to determine the plagiarism of the acting rector.
Meanwhile, ED COMSATS Dr. Junaid Zaidi talking to The Nation said that he was out of the country and the committee has not submitted its report to him till now.
“The committee was given seven days however I have not received the report till now,” he said.
Registrar COMSATS University, Dr. Faheem Quershi on behalf of the institution said that “we have thoroughly checked the paper and the similarity exists only in using the ‘terms'.
Most of the similarity is that of scientific terms which are very hard to change.
Prof Raheel Qamar's work is based on human genetics where material and methods can show little high similarity as compared to others because similar techniques are used by the entire geneticist to get the population specific genetic data. Prof. Qamar facilitates the author to use the techniques to analyse the data.
Dr. Faheem responded that proper citation has been done in the said research paper. “Its a duly-sided citation,” he said.
He also said that the guidelines of the plagiarism policy need to be revised as quantum of knowledge in the world is being doubled after every 13 months.
He said that the current policy is being used as a tool for defaming researchers because of professional rivalry.
“Authorities should consider revising the policy,” he said.
HEC spokesperson Aayesha Ikram responding to a query sent by The Nation said that it is informed that COMSATS has already initiated inquiry and we have to wait for the outcome of that committee.
The same year there was a hiring freeze at Hamilton-Wentworth Detention Centre in 2014, 38-year-old inmate Trevor Burke died in hospital.
These were details discussed during a coroner's inquest Tuesday into eight inmate deaths that occurred at the Barton Street jail.
Hamilton-Wentworth Detention Centre Sergeant Michael DuCheneau testified that resources were stretched and managerial staff was diminished. When burn-out happens, he told the jury, you see performance levels drop.
READ MORE: Coroner's inquest hears testimony from former inmate about Barton Street jail conditions during labour disruption
James McIlveen, assistant to the deputy superintendent at the time, testified the lack of staff prompted the jail to reach out to Hamilton police to help fill guard duty at the hospital where Burke was receiving care for an infection on his leg.
Burke was to receive 24-hour surveillance. It's a task that correctional officers receive training for, the inquest heard. DuCheneau explained it involves information about different restraints, a scenario-based approach to learning, as well as mentorship through senior officers.
The job of a community escort officer in hospital also involves documenting observations of an inmate, such as their activities, movement and general condition. It's documented hourly in a logbook, according to McIlveen, so that the correctional officer coming in to provide relief is informed.
Sgt. Michael DuCheneau reviewed one log entry before the jury from when Burke was being watched, saying it lacked important details, such as the name or badge number of the nurse on shift.
The jury also heard from McIlveen that once per 12-hour shift a supervisor is supposed to visit the hospital and review the logs. After a review of documents pertaining to Burke, DuCheneau could only find one sign-off by a supervisor between the time Burke was admitted in early March and March 24, 2014, when he was found in distress.
READ MORE: Contraband search protocols examined at Barton Street jail inquest
In addressing questions from the jury, Ducheneau said, in his experience, there are a couple other practices in relation to guarding Burke that fell short.
The first pertains to the surveillance. Two correctional officers have testified they were watching Burke from outside the hospital room door. DuCheneau said he would have been at the foot of the patient's bed while another officer watched from the hall, communicating any activity.
Burke was found with a syringe of hyrdromorphone on March 24, 2014, and later pills, the inquest has heard. An agreed statement of facts showed the only search to be documented was done after Burke was transferred to ICU.
Correctional Officer Craig Fournier testified to the challenges a strip search would present in that setting. DuCheneau, however, testified that he believes it could have and should have been done.
It's not a policy or escort guard training issue, DuCheneau told the jury, but rather one of managerial motivation. Ensuring correctional staff maintain a “threshold of performance” was affected by staffing issues in 2014.
“We are coming out of the darkness now,” DuCheneau said in regard to the hiring freeze, adding his recommendation for more managerial training would still be tough to accomplish depending on the immediate needs of the operation, he said.
JONNY BAIRSTOW is confident England can finally put all the off-pitch distractions behind them in order to hit back against Australia and go on to retain The Ashes.
The current tour Down Under seems to have created as much media interest for what has gone on off the pitch as on it, as Yorkshire's Bairstow knows only too well to his cost.
As if the furore over his ‘headbutt' on Cameron Bancroft in Perth before the Test series had not been enough, the weekend's revelations concerning Lions tour party member Ben Duckett pouring a drink over James Anderson's head gave the collective press, TV and internet media plenty more material to chew over ahead of this week's third and, possibly, deciding Test in Perth.
Duckett, 23, has since been suspended for the remainder of the England Lions tour of Australia and received a final written warning over his conduct.
But, coming on top of Bairstow's bizarre ‘coming together' with Bancroft in a Perth bar and the much-publicised pre-tour incident in Bristol concerning all-rounder and vice-captain Ben Stokes – currently keeping his eye in playing some 40-over cricket over in New Zealand – it has led to an unprecedented level of scrutiny on what England's players do once off the field of play.
Bairstow admits it has been difficult to avoid all the negative publicity over the past few weeks – of which he has formed a central part – but believes only by getting their game right out in the middle can England start to create headlines and take up air time for the right reasons.
HAVE WE MET BEFORE? Jonny Bairstow and Cameron Bancroft out in the middle during the first Test in Brisbane. Picture: Jason O'Brien/PA Wire.
“There's been a lot of stuff spoken about since we've been over here,” said Bairstow, speaking ahead of the third Test at the WACA, which starts on Thursday. “We knew it was going to be tough coming to Australia, the cricket is always going to be tough.
“But that's what we can control and we need to control more of that. I'm sure you can imagine what the toughest part of the tour has been. Naturally, it's been everywhere and all that anyone has been talking about – whether it's right or wrong, true or false. It is what people have been talking about.
“But we need to just put all that to the back of our minds when we get on the pitch – go out there and try and do something special.”
At 2-0 down and with three Tests to play heading to a venue that has brought only one win in 13 matches for England – even then against an Australian side severely depleted after the exodus to Kerry Packer's controversial World Series – it does not augur particularly well for Joe Root's side.
Yes, it is frustrating, but we have a group of players who can win games here and we still have three chances to put things right. Yorkshire and England's Jonny Bairstow
But Bairstow is having none of it and is almost boastful in his belief that England can hit back from defeats in Brisbane and Adelaide to square the series.
“As a group, there's no way we see this series as being over,” said Bairstow. “We've lost two games, but we've been in both of them for decent periods of time. We just need to do what we've been doing for longer and do it in the key periods of the games where we've come unstuck.
“So, yes, it is frustrating, but we have a group of players who can win games here and we still have three chances to put things right.”
One reason Bairstow appears so confident that England can turn things around over the next three weeks or so lies in his faith in Yorkshire team-mate and England captain Root.
Still a relative rookie when it comes to international captaincy, the Sheffield-born batsman has impressed since taking over the reins from Alastair Cook earlier this year. Naturally, in the more intense heat of an Ashes battle. his tactics and decision-making were always going to come under a bigger spotlight in Australia.
For example, some have queried Root's decision to field first in Adelaide after winning the toss, with some critics suggesting he had handed a significant advantage to the hosts at a ground where many observers felt the conditions favoured England more.
Ultimately, Root's players were left dispirited by a second heavy defeat, the 120-run loss coming hot on the heels of a 10-wicket pounding in Brisbane. But while there may be critics outside the dressing room, Bairstow revealed that Root has the total backing of his players.
“I think Joe's captaincy has been brilliant – there aren't many things that you can fault with what he's done,” added Bairstow.
“He's still learning as a captain, but if you're captain of England you're going to be learning for a while.”

MZUZU-(MaraviPost)-Athletics Association of Malawi (AAM) has organized regional races on Saturday which aim at identifying athletes who will compete in the National Cross Country race slated for February 17, 2018 in Mzuzu.
In an interview on Friday, AAM's President Godfrey Phiri said the association was set to host the regional competitions on Saturday.
Phiri further said the regional competitions will help to identify athletes that will participate in the forthcoming national cross Country as well as African Championship slated for August, 2018.
“As an association, we are ready for the regional competitions on Saturday. The central idea behind these regional competitions is for the clubs to identify the best athletes who will compete in the forthcoming National Cross Country slated for this month at Mzuzu Golf Club,” said Phiri.
He added: “We want to use the National Cross Country as a platform to identify the best athletes who will carry the Malawian flag in the Confederation of African Athletics (CAA) Championships.”
In March 2017, Malawian athletes participated in the World Cross country competition which was held in Uganda where they displayed a lackluster performance.
According to the Energy Information Administration's Electric Power Monthly, a bit more than 10 percent of all electricity generated in the US in March came from wind and solar power (including both distributed residential solar panels and utility-scale solar installations). That's a record number for the country, and it reflects continuing effort to install more renewable capacity across the nation.
The EIA shows that eight percent of total electricity generation that month came from wind, and the other two percent came from solar. The administration also predicts that wind and solar will contribute more than 10 percent of the total electricity produced in April, although numbers for that month aren't out yet.
Renewables have tended to hit records in spring and fall—often called shoulder seasons—because wind is plentiful and the northern hemisphere receives a more even amount of sunlight during those seasons than it does during winter. In addition, electricity consumers tend to use less during the shoulder seasons (mild weather means they're usually not running air conditioners or space heaters, for example). That means overall energy use is low and peak-demand fossil fuel-burning plants don't need to come online. All these factors together make it easy for renewable energy to shoulder a larger and larger share of the work.
Further Reading California gov to work with China on clean energy tech, defying US reversal Although solar electricity generation usually increases considerably in the summer, the EIA doesn't expect that increase to compensate for the reductions in spring and fall wind power this year.
In a separate study, GTM Research and the Energy Storage Association also found that stationary energy batteries have had a booming first quarter of 2017 as well. Batteries go hand in hand with intermittent resources like wind and solar because they can smooth out some of the times when those renewable sources can't provide electricity.
In the first quarter of 2017, a record 234 MWh of storage appear to have been installed around the US. The surge was partially caused by a mandate from California regulators that utilities in that state install batteries after a massive methane leak prompted the shutdown of the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility. Tesla, AES Energy Storage, and Ice Energy all completed contracts in the first quarter of 2017 pursuant to California's mandate.
However, the study suggested that this first quarter may be the largest for energy storage in 2017 because few additional storage projects are currently planned for later in the year.
For now, the EIA says the renewable energy number to beat is seven percent, which is the percentage of electricity that was renewably generated in the US throughout 2016. Last year, Texas accounted for the most wind on the US grid, with California trailing Texas in wind and almost making up the difference in solar.
“As a share of the state's total electricity generation, wind and solar output was highest in Iowa, where wind and solar made up 37 percent of electricity generation in 2016,” the EIA wrote. Part of Iowa's high percentage of renewable energy has to do with the state's electricity needs being comparatively low. California and Hawaii are two states that have aggressive renewable goals, too. If we include geothermal, biomass, and small-scale hydroelectric power in addition to wind and solar, California sourced 27 percent of its energy from renewable sources last year, and Hawaii hit 26 percent.

Mexico and the United States enjoy one of the most important bilateral relationships in the world today, with profound implications for the prosperity, well-being and security of both nations. No country touches the daily lives of more Americans than Mexico, and no country touches the daily lives of more Mexicans than the United States. In the more than two decades since NAFTA's approval, our two countries have been converging as societies and as economies.
This complex and productive partnership is facing dire challenges as a result of Donald Trump's demagoguery, nativism and anti-Mexico bashing, both during the campaign and in the first weeks of his administration. Unsurprisingly, a Mitofsky poll published a month ago found that, between January 2016 and February 2017, favorable perceptions of the U.S. in Mexico collapsed from 44% to 22% and negative perceptions skyrocketed from 11% to 41%. While a recent Gallup poll found that favorable perceptions of Mexico in the U.S. have actually risen to 64% from 59% in 2016 – most likely as a counter-reaction to Trump's use of Mexico as an electoral piñata — it will take time and effort to heal these wounds.
Canada, the third North American partner, was never in the crosshairs of the 2016 campaign. But the onslaught against the North American Free Trade Agreement and the general tone of the campaign also hurt U.S. relations with Canada.
We therefore must foster, as we have sought to do in the past, an understanding that each society in North America is a stakeholder in the success of the other. And as it happens, the soccer federations of Canada, Mexico and the U.S. recently engineered a potent symbol of our interconnectedness: They presented a joint North American bid to host the 2026 World Cup.
A joint tournament would...send a message that the U.S. is not 'fortress America'
Many Mexicans, Americans and Canadians may object either to the logistics or desirability of such an endeavor; Mexicans and Canadians may rightly complain that the plan calls for the U.S. to host the lion's share of the games: 60; while Mexico and Canada would each host just 10 early-stage games.
But a joint World Cup would be immensely practical, and our three nations would come out winners regardless of who wins the tournament. The three North American nations combined boast a huge and enthusiastic fan base. Stadiums already exist in key cities, and would likely only need upgrading, averting the temptation or need for costly new behemoths. Existing air connectivity between Mexico and the U.S., and the U.S. and Canada could be rapidly expanded, and would facilitate tourism in the short and long term. Key infrastructure, airports and border crossings in all three countries could certainly benefit from investment and upgrading, a boon to our economies and to our global competitiveness.
More important, a joint tournament would be a public diplomacy boon for the three countries. It would send a message that the U.S., which has garnered opprobrium around the world thanks to President Trump's proposed travel ban and the construction of a border wall, is not “Fortress America.” It would also help to highlight, among other assets, Mexico's millennial history and creative industries as vital sources for economic growth and to underscore Canada's soft power and its core values regarding immigration and refugee policy.
Bill Shankly, the legendary Liverpool manager of the early 1970s, once deadpanned that while some people thought soccer was a matter of life and death, he knew it was much more important than that. Soccer is never just about soccer. It reflects the cultural and social crosscurrents of the world at a given time.
For Mexico, the U.S. and Canada, a joint bid for the 2026 World Cup would also be about more than just soccer. It would be about shifting mutual perceptions first and foremost, about the three nations becoming better neighbors and about creating a sense of common purpose. It would send a powerful message to our respective peoples – and to the rest of the world – regarding the nature and promise of our ties.
Arturo Sarukhan was Mexico's ambassador to the United States from 2007 to 2013. He promoted the idea of a joint Mexico-U.S. World Cup bid during his time in office.

On the eve of the first summit between President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the White House late Tuesday appeared to back away from the long-standing U.S. advocacy of a so-called two-state solution for peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
"A two-state solution that doesn't bring peace is not our goal that anybody wants to achieve," a senior White House official said in briefing reporters ahead of the Netanyahu meeting.
U.S. policy, and that of most international groups, for decades has considered a two-state solution, where Israel and a Palestinian nation live side-by-side, as the essential basis for peace in the troubled region. But the official, who spoke to reporters under rules that did not allow him to be identified by name, cast doubt on the Trump administration's commitment to such a policy.
Asked whether peace didn't equal a two-state solution, the official said, "Maybe, maybe not."
"It's something the two sides have to agree to," the official added. "It's not for us to impose that vision."
"Peace is the goal, whether it comes in the form of a two-state solution, if that's what the parties want, or something else. If that's what the parties want, we're going to help them," the official said.
The statements were the latest fluctuation in what seems to be an evolving Middle East policy for the new administration.
Initially, Trump took hard-line positions regarding Israel, refusing to condemn the expansion of settlements in West Bank land claimed by the Palestinians and vowing to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
Relocation of the embassy is controversial because both Israelis and Palestinians claim Jerusalem, or parts of it, as their capital.
Trump also said he would turn over the Israeli-Palestinian portfolio to his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a longtime supporter of Israel. He has nominated as his ambassador to Israel one of his lawyers, David Friedman, a passionate financial backer of settlements, which much of the world considers illegal and an impediment to peace.
More recently, however, the administration dropped talk of moving the embassy, at least in the short term, and issued a statement that was critical, albeit mildly, of settlements.
Trump has said he wants to make peace in the long conflict the "ultimate deal." Administrations over the years have been stymied in similar goals.
Peace talks have been at an impasse for three years, and there have been continuing calls from Israeli politicians to formally annex parts of the West Bank, which has been under Israeli military occupation since the 1967 Six-Day War.
This month, Israel's parliament approved a controversial bill giving the government authority to retroactively legalize thousands of homes in West Bank settlements and dozens of unauthorized hilltop outposts that sit on privately owned Palestinian land.
Netanyahu, whose government has approved 6,000 new homes in existing settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since Trump's inauguration, has recently avoided reiterating support for a Palestinian state.
Even some Palestinians have suggested that the only way out of the deadlock might be a one-state solution. The idea would be to try to force Israel to give Arab residents full voting rights, jeopardizing the Jewish identity upon which Israel was created in 1948, or risk being under permanent sanction by the rest of the world.
“If the choice is one state, Israel can either be Jewish or democratic — it cannot be both — and it won't ever really be at peace,” former Secretary of State John F. Kerry warned in December.
Both Trump and Netanyahu are eager to show an improved relationship following eight frosty years with the Obama presidency. But experts have also warned that Trump should be careful not to risk provoking Arab states, whom he needs in the fight against the Islamic State extremist group and as a counterweight to Iran.
The White House official said Trump and Netanyahu, in their summit Wednesday, will discuss settlements, an embassy move and Iran.

Serena Williams might have dominated in the French Open on Tuesday, but, apparently, the tennis pro didn't have as much luck during that rumored royal wedding reception round of beer pong earlier this month. In fact, Serena Williams didn't actually play beer pong at the royal wedding reception at all. Why? According to Williams herself, that particular post-royal wedding tale was "not even remotely true." Plus, she doesn't drink beer.
The beer bong chatter has been circulating ever since Prince Harry and Meghan Markle (who, by the way, happens to be an old pal of Williams', which is how the tennis star snagged a coveted invite to both the ceremony and reception) tied the knot during their much-anticipated wedding ceremony at St. George's Chapel on May 19. Speaking at a press conference following her triumphant Grand Slam victory earlier this week, Williams finally addressed the beer bong buzz. According to New York Times sports columnist Christopher Clarey, who tweeted Williams' response to the rumors Tuesday afternoon, Williams was clear:
Among other things, Serena insists that "there was no beer pong" at the royal wedding. "I don't even drink beer," she says.

As much as the world has loved fantasizing about what it'd be like to watch Williams wax victorious over a beer pong table at Frogmore House, news of its fictitiousness shouldn't come as too much of a surprise. After all, the fact that a game of beer pong was even mentioned in conjunction with perhaps one of the grandest weddings of all time seemed a little far-fetched from the start. It's pretty hard to imagine any one of the reception's stacked roster of A-list invitees getting their hands dirty (as in, literally dirty) over a round of beer pong while dressed to the nines in their fanciest royal wedding attire.
For those who missed Williams' killer ceremony and reception ensembles, those gems have been archived via the superstar athlete's Instagram account. Thankfully, that means fans can still relive the true majesty that was Williams' floor-length Valentino gown and sneakers to match, which she wore to the glitzy private reception.
But even though Williams' shoes might have been beer pong appropriate, that particular royal wedding reception rumor has been officially debunked. That being said, according to a Tuesday report by the Daily Mail, Williams said she and husband, Alexis Ohanian (who was also in attendance during the royal wedding festivities), shared "a big laugh" over the beer pong reports.
Matthew Stockman/Getty Images Sport/Getty Images
The rumors about Williams playing royal wedding beer pong stemmed from a source who spoke with The Sun after the wedding. According to The Sun's report, an unidentified "reception insider" told the publication:
"Sere­na Williams played beer pong like it was tennis. Everyone had so much fun with it, there were even fireworks."
Debunked beer pong chatter aside, Williams has been pretty busy this week. On Tuesday, the record-setting tennis superstar turned heads when she beat out Kristýna Plíšková at this year's French Open. Her big win marked Williams' powerhouse return to the tennis courts since giving birth to her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian, Jr., about nine months ago.
So, for anyone who thought Williams might have been indulging in some frat-party-like drinking games just days before making her triumphant Grand Slam resurgence, think again. Though Williams does probably wield the physical aptitude necessary to dominate most people in pretty much any recreational activity, the tennis champ has her eye on the prize. In this case, that prize seems to be Williams' next hopeful Grand Slam title, not winning a royal wedding reception round of beer pong.
ABBOTTABAD, Dec 11 (APP):Deputy Speaker and General
Secretary PML-N Khyber Pahktunkhwa, Murtaza Javed Abbassi Monday said the government
of PMLN has fulfilled most of the election promises and provided better
facilities of life to the masses.
He was addressing a public gathering after inauguration of
government higher secondary school (GHSS) Satora.
Murtaza Abbassi said that government took concrete measures
for eradication of load shedding from the country that resulted in speeding up progress
and stability.
He said former prime minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif started
the historical China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and through roads
developments in the country, improved the economy which was also admired by the
experts and shown by the economic indicators as well.
The PTI leadership has to change its behavior for the progress of the democracy in the country, Abbassi maintained .
The GHSS would be constructed with an estimated cost of 50
a million rupees, Murtaza told the gathering and announced construction of PCC
roads from Sumba Thara to Gohra would cost of 7.5 million rupees.
Tehsil Nazim Havelian, Sardar Arsal Pervez and PML-N
parliamentary leader in KP Assembly Sardar Aurangzeb Nalota were also present
in the public gathering.
Odell Beckham isn't letting his ongoing rehab or lack of a new contract keep him in a self-imposed exile away from the Giants.
New York Giants coach Pat Shurmur confirmed to reporters that the talented wide receiver was in the team facility Tuesday for the start of voluntary minicamp. Beckham, however, won't take part in the program since he's still recovering from surgery to repair the fractured ankle he suffered in October.
Shurmur also told reporters that Beckham "absolutely" will be part of the Giants in 2018 -- a statement that might help further dissolve any lingering speculation about the three-time Pro Bowler being traded this offseason.
"He's an excellent player, he's part of our team and he's a very valued member of our team," Shurmur said. "Everybody that's out here, I'm planning on them being here."
While Beckham hasn't been shy in his desire to catch a long-term deal with the Giants, his appearance at the team facility is yet another goodwill gesture on his part. He also attended the start of the team's voluntary workout program earlier this month.
SEOUL - South Korean President Moon Jae-In called Monday for calm in the standoff with North Korea, saying there should never be another war on the peninsula.
Tensions have flared since US President Donald Trump, responding to the North's latest missile tests, warned it of "fire and fury like the world has never seen". The North in turn threatened to test-fire its missiles towards the US Pacific island of Guam.
The war of words has sparked global alarm, with world leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping urging calm on both sides.
Moon, a left-leaning leader who has previously advocated dialogue with the North, urged it to "stop all provocations and hostile rhetoric immediately, instead of worsening the situation any further". He also indirectly urged the US - the South's key ally and security guarantor - to resolve the crisis peacefully.
"Our top priority is the national interest of the Republic of Korea (South Korea) and our national interest lies in peace," Moon told advisers in a meeting.
"We cannot have a war on the Korean peninsula ever again," he said. The 1950-53 conflict cost more than a million lives, left cities in ruins and perpetuated the division of the peninsula.
"I am confident that the US will respond to the current situation in a calm and responsible manner in line with our policy direction," Moon said.
Moon Monday also met General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, who is visiting Seoul as part of a trip which will also include China and Japan.
According to Moon's spokesman, Dunford said in the meeting that the US would only consider military action against North Korea if all diplomatic and economic sanctions failed.
"He said everyone was hoping to solve the current situation without a war," spokesman Park Su-Hyun said, adding that Dunford stressed Washington would closely coordinate with Seoul over any future action.
The latest US and North Korean sabre-rattling has sparked concern that a miscalculation by either side could trigger a catastrophic conflict, although many analysts voice doubts over such a prospect.
Any conflict between the North and the US could have devastating consequences for Asia's fourth-largest economy, with Seoul within range of Pyongyang's vast conventional artillery forces.
Also within range are many of the 28,500 US troops stationed in the South.
The latest bout of tension was sparked by the North's two intercontinental ballistic missile tests last month, which appeared to bring much of the US within range.
The tests are seen as a milestone in the North's quest to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the US mainland.
Since then the North and Trump have locked horns in fiery exchanges, with Trump saying on Friday that US troops were "locked and loaded" in case a military solution became necessary.
The Tourism Industry Association of New Brunswick (TIANB) is frustrated by the provincial government's decision not to implement a tourism levy they say would help attract travellers from regions across the country.
TIANB has been asking the Gallant government to look at creating legislation that would add a 3 per cent levy to hotel room bills in the province. It would collect extra money to support tourism marketing initiatives and tourism development in New Brunswick through the creation of a Destination Marketing Fund.
The fund would put New Brunswick on the same page as Nova Scotia, Quebec and other jurisdictions across the country where the levy is charged.
Dan Myers, chair of TIANB's board of directors, said the organization is requesting a meeting with the premier to discuss their views. While there is a meeting scheduled between industry and representatives from the premier's office, the organization wants a direct meeting.
READ MORE: New Brunswick tourism industry frustrated by decision on levy
Myers said Gallant had been clear since 2016 that the current government would not implement a levy under their current mandate, but he said with the upcoming election and a new mandate if the Liberals take office again, TIANB was under the impression Gallant would be open to conversation about enabling legislation if re-elected, under the new mandate.
The government confirmed in a news release on April 6 it would not be implementing a levy.
“It's really frustrating, and blindsided because we were not expecting it. We've had one meeting with the minister to say that we plan to pursue this… and we request his support. We were led to believe that we did have his support and the government's support on the initiative and they came out with the announcement a couple weeks ago, really did blindside us as an industry,” Myers said.
Myers said the organization is now calling on the province's tourism minister John Ames to resign.
“Any kind of investment in tourism automatically generates a return. We have a $3.19 million return on investment on anything that's spent on marketing. A levy could be up to $6 million or more of additional marketing dollars for the province and that would put us on a competitive playing field with the other regions around our province. Nova Scotia has various degrees of it, P.E.I., Maine, Quebec, and there are a number of regions in New Brunswick doing it as well with great success,” Myers said.

He said there are levies in some regions of New Brunswick, but wants a provide-wide one to be legislated.
“We currently do collect in Saint John, Miramichi, Bathurst, Edmundston and Saint Andrews,” Myers said.
He said those communities use the marketing dollars to reinvest into their region and attract business.
Premier Brian Gallant said Tuesday the idea of putting a tourism levy would mean taking more money away from New Brunswickers.
Gallant said he believes over 50 per cent of hotels is occupied by New Brunswickers.
“We've just been very clear and very straightforward,” Gallant said. “They're asking for the minister to resign because they didn't get their way. I mean, that's a bit unfortunate and I would also underline that we've made commitments that have never been seen before of investments in tourism and our tourism infrastructure.”
Myers said the number of New Brunswickers staying in hotels and travelling across the province is actually only 43 per cent. He said of those people, 23 per cent are already paying it in different regions throughout the province and over half of them are businesses that are collecting the dollars back.
Myers said it's a very “small component” of New Brunswickers that would be paying it. He said those New Brunswickers who travel outside of the province to places like Halifax or Toronto are paying that marketing levy everywhere else they go, and said tourists who visit most parts of New Brunswick aren't paying it.
He said TIANB applauds the Liberal government's $100-million invest in tourism infrastructure upgrades and the department's goal to grow tourism-related GDP to $2 billion by 2025.
“As an industry, we know what we need in our region and this is our way of offering to help and partner, a true partnership with the department to drive tourism into the province,” Myers said.
Fredericton Chamber of Commerce CEO Krista Ross said they are on board with a levy and said it would benefit the industry,
“Basically the money that is collected from people who stay in hotels is then used to market the local region externally,” Ross said. “The return on that is very, very good for every dollar that's collected and spent on marketing they anticipate well in excess of $3 million in return.”
Ross said that could mean an extra $20 million in spending on tourism in the province that isn't currently happening.
“If other jurisdictions that we compete for tourism dollars with, people make choices as to where they're going to spend their money, so if we can market to those people then we have more of an opportunity to bring them here. So by not collecting this levy, and by not then talking to potential tourists we have a disadvantage over other communities and other provinces and other regions that are doing,” Ross said.

On the flip itself, there are three common mistakes being made by most swimmers. The first is that the knees are not tucked tight enough toward the chest, so the feet take too long to get to the wall. The second is that the swimmer rotates the body during the flip, so part of the rotation back to the stomach has occurred by the time the feet hit the wall. This also requires too much time. The third is that the arms are bent at the elbow over head when the feet hit the wall. This results in either a delay to get the arms back into the streamlined position, or a bad body position for the push off the wall, if the swimmer elects to straighten the arms as he pushes off. Let's discuss the first mistake.
If you have ever watched a figure skating competition, you may have noticed that the skater often ends with a twirl. The twirl usually begins with the arms either fully or partly extended and the revolutions occur at a slower rate. Then, when the skater tucks the arms up tight to the chest, the speed of the revolutions increases dramatically…often so fast, you cannot even see the details of the skater's face.
The Law Of Conservation Of Energy
The skater's angular velocity increases when he tucks his arms in, not because he is applying more force to the twirl, but because of the law of conservation of energy. That law states that the energy of a rotating system about one axis is related to its mass, the radius of the mass and the angular velocity squared. Therefore, if the radius of the mass is shortened or decreased, the angular velocity must increase accordingly, for a given energy in the system.
That same law applies to the diver on the ten-meter platform trying to do a quadruple summersault or to the swimmer making his/her flip turn. The smaller and tighter the tuck, the faster the rotation goes. Making the effort to bring the knees closer to the chest and creating a tighter ball makes a huge difference in the speed of getting the feet on the wall.
The fastest way to get the feet on the wall is straight over the top with the toes pointing toward the surface. Adding a little twist or rotation to the body during the flip just costs more time. There is no need to do that. All of the rotation back to the stomach can occur during the underwater phase after the push off the wall. So long as the body is kept in a straight line, the rotation of the body during this phase will not slow the swimmer down.
The George Bovell Style
I also like to teach swimmers to have one foot slightly higher than the other when planted on the wall, something I learned from watching Olympian George Bovell. I am not certain how much of difference it makes, if any, but it feels more comfortable to me that way.
Undoubtedly the most common mistake being made on the flip is what the swimmer does with the arms underwater. As the legs come over the top, swimmers use the force from their hands pulling downward overhead in the water to help get the job done. By the time the feet are planted on the wall, most swimmers have created a small to large bend in the elbows in an effort to gain more leverage for the flip. Unfortunately, they are now in a bad situation. They can either delay the push off the wall until their arms are back in the streamline, or they can push off the wall in this non-streamlined shape and straighten the arms as they go. Either way, they lose.
The Cesar Cielo Style
A much better idea, which I first saw done by Cesar Cielo, is to keep the arms straight on the pull back. Then, when the feet hit the wall, there is no need to delay the push off the wall and the arms are nearly in the streamlined position. The result is greater speed off the wall with no hesitation. I have also noted other great turners that bend the arms slightly on the pull back, rather than keeping them straight, but by the time the feet are planted, the arms are back in the streamlined position. Either way, the swimmer is assured of getting off the wall faster.
There is nothing easy about doing a fast flip to the wall. In fact, in every aspect a fast flip is harder than a slow turn. More core strength is required and more attention to detail. The only way that a swimmer is assured of doing these fast flips in competition well is by developing core strength and by doing them correctly in practice…over and over again.

VIENNA- (MaraviPost)-Malawi is now the Vice Chair of the Least Development Countries (LDCs) for the next three years, The Maravi Post has learnt.
This is an opportunity for the country to benefit on reliable connectivity and energy, capacity building in human development, technical skills and financial support.
Malawi was nominated during the just ended 7th edition of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) LDCs) Ministerial Conference took place on 23-24 November 2017, in Vienna, Austria, prior to the 17th UNIDO General Conference.
Under the theme “Building global partnerships: Enhancing Growth and Inclusiveness in LDCs” the conference's objective was to identify innovative schemes and mechanisms by enabling partnership building and resource mobilization for Sustainable Industrial Development in LDCs
The Minister of Industry Trade and Tourism, Henry Mussa led the Malawi delegation to the conference with the call for industrial support from developed nations.
In his acceptance speech while also chairing the high level session of the conference Mussa acknowledged the enormous challenges faced by the membership in the roadmap to graduate into the middle class economy category.
The Malawi Trade minister therefore pledged total support to the LDC to counter the hurdles.
“On my part, I commit to support fellow LDCs in our quest to Industrialize, Create Jobs, Produce Quality Products and Services, and Promote Innovativeness that would lead to expansion of high innovative technologies into improved productive capabilities,” the Vice Chair emphasized.
Mussa however observed from the discussions that it was clear that unless LDCs embrace the Industrialization, Digital Revolution and Value Chain Technologies, members are bound to continue lugging behind in their social and economic development.
He further called on member states to focus on prioritizing Provision of Infrastructure like reliable Connectivity and Energy, Capacity Building in Human Development, Technical Skills and Financial Support.” He added.
Mussa emphasized the need for Collective efforts and corroboration with all stakeholders including Private Sector, Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) and development partners both at regional and international level to support the quest for structural transformation in economic drive, value chain and appropriate Skills.
“We need to broaden and strengthen our Regional and International integration for mutual benefit if PPPs are to succeed. We need to tap and benefit from the emerging economies. Let us make use of the regional integration by capitalizing on our ready markets and cheap labor,” said Mussa.
The two-day conference also discussed the determinant role of multi-stakeholder partnership-building and the importance of investment promotion, as well as innovative financing solutions for LDCs' Industrial Development, to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 and beyond.
The opening session of the Conference was addressed by the Director General of UNIDO, Li Yong, and Director General of the United Nations Office at Vienna, Yuri Fedotov and the High Representative for the LDCs, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States (LDCSIDS) Ms. FekitamoeloaKatoa ‘Utoikamanu.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc's shares gave up early gains and tumbled on Tuesday on concerns that rising material costs following U.S. President Donald Trump's crackdown on steel imports would hurt its earnings in the coming quarters.
Those worries overshadowed its strong performance in the March quarter when both profits and revenues topped analysts' estimates, prompting the world's largest heavy equipment maker to upgrade its profit outlook for 2018.
The concerns were sparked by management's comments that strong performance in the first quarter was the "high watermark" for the year and the company would not have the same pricing power in the remainder of 2018 to pass on the increased material costs.
Shares in Caterpillar, part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average , were last down 6 percent at $144.81 on the New York Stock Exchange after gaining as much as 4.6 percent in early trade.
"It's a negative surprise because the indications had previously been that everything was okay on that front," said Lawrence T. De Maria, co-group head of Global Industrial Infrastructure at William Blair & Company.
President Donald Trump's crackdown on steel imports have constrained supplies in the domestic market, inflating the costs of the metal. Caterpillar said steel costs for the equipment industry were up about 15 percent in the March quarter.
OUTLOOK REVISED UPWARD
The Deerfield, Illinois-based company now expects the full-year profit to range between $9.75 to $10.75 per share, $2 above its range in January.
The company, which serves as a bellwether for global economic activity, has been benefiting from a global economy that is having its best run since 2011. With the International Monetary Fund predicting robust global growth for the next two years, demand for its equipment is expected to remain strong.
Caterpillar said its stronger outlook was primarily driven by better-than-expected sales volume as it saw higher demand across all regions and most end markets.
In the latest quarter, revenues rose 31 percent on year to $12.9 billion, above Wall Street's expectations, as strong commodity prices and increased construction activities in North America and China drove up sales of mining and construction machines.
Overall sales were also boosted by favourable currency impacts and improved price realization.
"The first quarter was an exceptional quarter for performance," said Amy Campbell, head of investor relations at Caterpillar.
While she said the performance would not be repeated, the company still expected "strong" operating margins for the full-year.
TRADE WORRIES
Caterpillar's 2018 forecast did not include any potential impact from future geopolitical risks and increased trade restrictions.
But in its annual report earlier this year, the company warned that "buy national" policies or retaliation against such policies could adversely impact its operations.
Threats of a global trade war pose the biggest risks for a company that sells more than half of its machines outside the United States.
The company reported a net profit of $2.74 per share for the quarter, above analysts' consensus forecast of $2.04 per share. Adjusted net profit was $2.82 per share.

Anyone who has been on a long-haul flight around the world will probably have had experience of jet lag , one part of travelling that most of us could really do without.
It's the sleepy, unreal grogginess that hits when you feel like you're starved of sleep , but often can't doze off, making travelling to another time zone for a holiday a bit of a trial sometimes.
The World Health Organisation warns that the effects are far greater than problems with sleep – jet lag can cause indigestion issues, disturbance of bowel function, blood pressure fluctuations and general malaise.
Luckily, symptoms tend to improve after a few days as your body gets used to the new time zone.
But who wants to have the first days of their holiday spoiled?
Here's everything you need to know to beat jet lag on your next holiday....
What is jet lag?
(Image: Getty)
When you cross time zones, the pineal gland – which controls your body's temperature and internal clock – is disrupted by the change in light, playing havoc with your natural rhythms.
It means we can react subconsciously to changes in our environment and know when we should sleep in the normal cycle of 24 hours.
Light and darkness naturally influence our sleeping patterns - which is no problem when we're working on our normal schedule.
But the body gets a bit annoyed when we go through speedy and sizeable changes in those environmental influences, which is what happens when we fly through several time zones.
What are the symptoms of jet lag?
Jet lag is what we call it when your body is reacting to these changes in your environment, which is basically your body taking time to adjust to its new place and time.
Symptoms include feeling sleepy during the day in your new time zone, but also having a troubled sleep at night.
You may also feel less able to concentrate or motivate, exhibit decreased mental and physical performance, perhaps have headaches and irritability, loss of appetite and gastro-intestinal problems such as constipation.
How can you beat jet lag?

If you're really worried, there are some measures you can take to help beat the severity of your jet lag.
We spoke to sleep expert Dr Nerina Ramlakhan to get her tips…
Before you fly:
1. Think ahead
Start preparing the week before you travel. Get good sleep, exercise regularly (preferably outdoors), eat healthily, avoid caffeine and keep hydrated.
2. Stay active
At the airport, move around as much as possible. Sitting around before you fly is the worst thing you can do – stay active before the flight and you won't feel as sluggish when you board.
Once on the plane, stretch and move around regularly as this will improve blood flow and stop you feeling too lethargic.

3. Eat well
On the day you're travelling, and once you arrive at your destination, eat a healthy meal with fresh fruit and vegetables. Avoid caffeine, refined sugars and heavily salted plane food if possible.
Take snacks on board with you such as oat cakes, nuts and dried fruit, crudités and fresh fruit.
On the plane:
4. Drink wisely
Stay hydrated and avoid stimulants. Take a large bottle of water on the plane with you, and herbal tea bags so you can have a caffeine-free hot drink. Avoid alcohol .

5. Meditate
Close your eyes and meditate on take-off and landing for 20 minutes each time. Breathe in deeply, and imagine putting down roots as you exhale.
Imagine those roots going all the way down to the core of the earth, anchoring you.
6. Relax
Watch a relaxing film, listen to music, or read. If you start feeling sleepy, switch the film off or put the book down, and prepare to rest rather than dozing off during an activity. If you have to work, do so for short amounts of time.
7. Rest
Put the emphasis on resting rather than sleeping. Dot lavender oils or eucalyptus on your flight cushion to help you relax, and use an eye mask and ear plugs.
Put a ‘DO NOT DISTURB' sign on your table if you don't want to be woken for meals or duty-free shopping trollies.
8. Go natural
Avoid medication to help you sleep as your body needs to naturally adjust to the time zone. If you can't sleep, think about having a rest – it's likely you will drift off anyway.
Once you arrive:
9. Don't nap
Try to hold off on napping as you need to synchronise your internal clock to your destination.
If you feel sleepy go for a walk. If you must nap, do it between 2-4 in the afternoon and sleep for a maximum of 20 minutes. Eat light food, as feeling too full will add to your tiredness. Stay hydrated and avoid alcohol.
10. Don't clock-watch
Change your clock to local time immediately and don't keep thinking about what the time is at home – this will only make you feel worse.

What do pilots do to help with jet lag?
Pilots deal with jet lag on a daily basis; so when they share their advice, we listen.
Mirror Travel caught up with pilot Tom Richards, 30, who is a Senior First Officer on the Airbus A330 for Thomas Cook Airlines .
He's been flying professionally for seven years, and regularly does long-haul journeys; so he's a pro at adjusting to different time zones.
He's revealed his personal tips and tricks for surviving jet lag exclusively to Mirror Travel, from the best things to do during the flight right through to the moment you've arrived in your destination.
Avoid sleeping during the day in your new time zone, go for a walk in the sunlight. Exercise, gently and frequently. Stay hydrated before, during and after your flight. Eat at meal times of your new time zone as soon as possible as it will help your blood sugar levels adjust. Avoid artificial light prior to going to sleep such as TV, phones. Have short 30-40 minute naps if you find yourself feeling tired.
Tom also answered some of the passengers' most common questions - check out his full interview here .
What affects the severity of jet lag?
(Image: Getty)
The number of time zones you cross has an impact on how you feel and, sometimes, so does the direction of travel.
Symptoms are commonly worse if travel is eastwards rather than westwards. Symptoms may also depend on whether you are a morning person or a 'night owl'. Age and gender are not thought to hve any effect on the symptoms of jet lag.
How does jet lag differ from travel fatigue?
(Image: Media Wales)
Travelling in a car, bus, train can be uncomfortable and make you tired and irritable, but these are temporary symptoms which clear quickly after you've stopped travelling.
Travel fatigue can happen after any long-haul flight, but you will only suffer from jet lag if you cross several (probably more than three) time zones.
You only cross time zones if you travel eastward or westward, so you won't suffer from jet lag if you fly more or less directly north or south, for example from the UK to Africa or from North to South America.
BOSTON -- Physically, Charlie McAvoy says that he feels "good" ahead of Game 7 against the Toronto Maple Leafs Wednesday night.
Whether or not you believe the young Bruins defenseman, there's no doubt that the dynamic blue liner has struggled to reach the high standards he set for himself on the ice earlier this season.
A smooth, puck-moving defenseman that tallied 32 points over 63 games in the regular season, McAvoy has played a key role in carrying the Bruins' offense through the neutral zone while averaging 22:09 of ice time per game.
So far this postseason, the minutes have remained the same for McAvoy (22:34 ATOI), but the overall production has dropped -- with the 20-year-old defenseman limited to just one assist over six games with just five shots on goal.
McAvoy has suited up in every playoff tilt for the Bruins over the past two weeks, but the BU product is still trying to get back up to speed after missing almost the entire month of March due to an MCL injury.
He returned on April 3 and played in four regular-season games before moving on to postseason play, but McAvoy admitted that it's still been a bit of a challenge over the past two weeks.
"There's ups and downs, and I knew it was going to be like that coming back," McAvoy said. "There are times with frustration and times where you want to make more of an impact and you want to play and make the plays you were making before you got hurt.
"But there's no sense in having that mindset. Medically I'm cleared and good to go. I want to get out there and I want to impact this team and do everything I can to help us win this game tomorrow."
Jumping back into the fracas that is playoff hockey is not an ideal scenario for any player, let alone a 20-year-old defenseman.
Bruins head coach Bruce Cassidy mentioned that the rust is still there for McAvoy -- who burst on the scene last year with a strong showing in the 2017 Stanley Cup Playoffs (six games, three assists, 26:12 ATOI).
"Obviously I don't think he's playing with as much confidence as he did last year," Cassidy said of McAvoy. "We have to try to get him back to that place, but he's a young guy. It doesn't happen overnight. Sometimes the easiest message for those guys is simplified it. Make the easy play, don't try to do too much. When the puck finds you, because you're a good player, in those moments, he'll make that play. We hope that's tomorrow."
McAvoy still might not be up to speed, but Cassidy added that the team is not taking away any of his responsibilities as a top-pairing defenseman. With the season on the line Wednesday, McAvoy is still going to be counted on to kill penalties, push the pace and log plenty of minutes.
As expected, the young defenseman is excited about the challenge.
"I know these guys have my back," McAvoy said of his teammates. "They always do and they always will. It starts with (Zdeno Chara) and it goes up and down the whole lineup. We all got each other's backs. I feel good, that's the thing. I feel good. So i just need to continue to play simple hockey, skate, get my feet moving and do everything I can tomorrow to help us get out on top."
Shari Redstone suggested in a legal filing on Tuesday that she may be willing to relinquish control of the bulk of her father's media empire.
National Amusements Inc., which was built by her ailing 95-year-old father Sumner Redstone, controls 80% of the voting stock of both Viacom and CBS and has for months been embroiled in a boardroom war between Shari Redstone and CBS chairman-CEO Leslie Moonves over her plan to merge the two companies into a single entity.
In her cross-complaint against CBS, Moonves, and 10 independent board members filed on Tuesday, Redstone suggests that the merger would allow her to sell the combined company at a better price. The suit states that Redstone told Moonves of this plan at a meeting on Jan. 16.
“Ms. Redstone discussed NAI's long-term plans for CBS, focusing on a two-step process starting with a merger with Viacom that would strengthen both entities, and continuing thereafter with a sale or merger of the stronger combined entity, with NAI open to the possibility of relinquishing its voting control as part of that second transaction,” the suit states.
Redstone also told Moonves that “she was looking forward to being able to focus more on her family and her other business and non-profit interests,” according to the suit.
Both Redstone and Moonves declined comment.
CBS sued NAI two weeks ago, accusing Redstone of abusing her power over the company at the expense of public stockholders. Redstone's suggestion that she might be willing to sell off her family's stake could be a legal tactic, aimed at downplaying her ambitions and countering CBS' depiction of her as a power-mad heiress.
In any case, Redstone's expression of interest in a sale appears moot for now, as the merger is off the table. A CBS special committee resolved to oppose the deal, which it said was not in the best interests of shareholders. Redstone has said she would not force the deal against the board's will. In Tuesday's filing, she went so far as to suggest that she had come to the same conclusion earlier, and had informed the Viacom board that she no longer supported the merger.
Both sides continue to square off in a Delaware court over the CBS board's move to strip Redstone of control over the company through a stock dilution. On May 17, the board voted 11-3 to reduce Redstone's voting control from 80% to 20%. NAI argues that the move was unprecedented and invalid under Delaware law.
The legal process is expected to last at least a few months, during which time Moonves and Redstone will be in an uncomfortable standoff.
It is possible that Moonves could negotiate an exit from CBS which would resolve the dispute. Moonves' contract provides for a substantial severance payout, which NAI pegs at $180 million. In the cross-complaint, NAI alleges that the pay package was adopted “without discussion or approval of the full Board, with the intended purpose of entrenching Mr. Moonves in his position as CEO,” and NAI reserves its rights as controlling stockholder to contest the payout.
Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner suffered a broken left wrist after he was hit by a pitch in a spring training game on Monday night.
Turner was hit by a Kendall Graveman pitch in the first inning of the Dodgers' 3-1 win over the Oakland Athletics.
There is no timetable yet for Turner's return.
Slated to bat third in Los Angeles' lineup this season, Turner is coming off a 2017 in which he hit 21 homers and produced a slash line of .322/.415/.530.
Turner is in the second year of a 4-year, $64 million deal with the Dodgers.

The Adventure of the Seas cruise ship is set to bring relief supplies to Puerto Rico on Friday morning, and then begin regular sailings Saturday from the island hit hard two weeks ago by powerful Hurricane Maria.
“[San] Juan has told us that the port is open with no restrictions,” Cynthia Martinez, director of corporate communications for Royal Caribbean International, wrote in an email Thursday.
Since the storm hit Sept. 20, about 90% of the island remains without power as of Thursday, though many grocery stores and gas stations have reopened, according to StatusPR.
Upcoming weeklong Royal Caribbean cruises sailing from Puerto Rico are scheduled to depart Saturday, Oct. 14, 21 and 28. (Itineraries can change depending on conditions, weather, etc.)
Earlier this week, Adventure of the Seas arrived at Port Everglades, Fla., with “3,400 evacuees, 102 dogs, 20 cats, 3 birds, 1 hamster and 1 guinea pig,” the cruise line's Facebook page said. The company pledged to continue relief efforts for Caribbean islands most ravaged by Hurricanes Irma and Maria.
“We wish all evacuees safe travels to their destinations, and swift recovery of their homes,” the post said. “The Caribbean is our home, and we stand behind those islands affected.”
Thirty-four people died in Puerto Rico during and after the hurricane hit. President Trump visited the island Tuesday to meet with officials and review relief efforts.

Even the all-conquering Red Bull Racing (RBR) will need to follow Walkinshaw Racing's lead and join forces with an overseas powerhouse to be competitive in Supercars, team owner Ryan Walkinshaw says.
Walkinshaw Racing (WR) is set to become a heavyweight again, with IndyCar outfit Andretti Autosport and McLaren Formula One chief Zak Brown's United Autosports confirming they will buy into the once mighty Holden team from 2018.
In a game-changing call, from January 1, the team will be known as Walkinshaw Andretti Autosport, pending Supercars' approval.
WR team boss Ryan Walkinshaw and Andretti will be equal stakeholders, with Brown - once touted as the man to take over from Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone - holding a minority share.
Suddenly, the forgotten former factory-backed WR outfit, which had once boasted Peter Brock, Craig Lowndes and Mark Skaife, has all the resources in the world to return to Supercars' summit.
Andretti admitted fellow US motorsport great Roger Penske's move into Supercars, taking over Dick Johnson Racing (DJR) in 2014, had sparked his interest in the category.
And he suggested IndyCar greats Chip Ganassi Racing might also follow suit.
"I'm sure Chip is going to be watching this," five-time Indy 500-winning team owner Andretti said.
Walkinshaw said all Supercars teams would need cross ownership with an overseas partner to remain a contender - even RBR, whose drivers had won seven of the past nine Supercars championships.
"Since Penske have come in and got their act together with DJR, I genuinely believe it's going to be very, very hard - even for Triple Eight (RBR) - to beat those guys in championships going forward," he told speedcafe website.
"That's because of the resource, infrastructure and personnel experience that DJR Team Penske can leverage off the Penske organisation over in the US.
"You just can't compete with that."
Penske has turned Ford's Dick Johnson Racing into a dominant force since taking over three years ago and rebranding it DJR Team Penske.
This season, their drivers Scott McLaughlin and Fabian Coulthard are first and third respectively in the drivers' standings ahead of Sunday's Bathurst 1000.
McLaughlin has a maiden Bathurst title in his sights and will start from pole position in Sunday's race. He broke the Mount Panorama lap record on Friday in practice and again on Saturday to win the top-10 shootout.
Despite those undeniable results, RBR boss Roland Dane baulked at Walkinshaw's suggestion that every Supercars team would need to look overseas for backing in future to thrive.
"I think having the financial powers of some of these people is definitely useful, but I think we're very able technically at a local level," he told speedcafe.
Dane still welcomed WR's news, saying he was licking his lips at the challenge.
"I think it's fantastic for the sport for the Andretti name to be here," he said.
"You've got an international contingent coming in, and it helps validate the series, so I think it's really good news for all of us."

New Delhi: A minor, who was on the run, was apprehended on Sunday in connection with the mysterious death of a Class 9 student in northeast Delhi's Karawal Nagar, police said.
Tusshar (16) was found unconscious by some students in his school bathroom and was taken to a hospital on 1 February. He was later referred to the GTB Hospital where he was declared brought dead.
Three students were apprehended in the case on Saturday, while one juvenile was on the run. The fourth juvenile was apprehended on Saturday evening from Khajuri Khas, they said. CCTV footage revealed that some students went after him in the washroom, the police said.
They allegedly punched him in the neck and face. It was suspected that the student died of internal injuries sustained during the scuffle, they said. Three of the students with whom he had a fight were apprehended, a senior police official said, adding that they were minors.
Police said they are probing whether there were other students involved in the scuffle. The family members of the deceased alleged that he was thrashed by the students, the official said.
On the basis of a complaint by the boy's family, a murder case was registered on Saturday.
At Google I/O earlier this month, the company announced Cloud Anchors, a tool that shares with the cloud 3D data captured by a user's smartphone — and can match that data with another user to create a shared AR experience where each person's phone is seeing the same things in the same places.
Today, Google is rolling out Cloud Anchor functionality to its AR drawing app called Just a Line, which it released a couple of months ago. Just a Line is hardly a breakout hit for Google, but the simplistic app that lets users paint the 3D world with a white line offers a nice testbed for early AR functionality that's just as experimental.
What will likely differentiate Google's offering from whatever Apple ends up shipping is that Cloud Anchor is cross-platform. The Just a Line app is available on both Android and iOS, and with today's update users on both platforms will be able to collaborate and view items in a shared space.
What's generally important about multiplayer AR experiences is making the process simple enough for users to sync their spatial map with another user so they see the same digital objects in the same physical locations. What Google has built seems a bit cumbersome, with each user needing to stand next to each other to pair their environments. It also seems that the functionality is limited to two people at the moment.
Just a Line isn't the most high-stakes place for Google to be dropping this feature, so there is clearly room for the company to keep updating what they've got as they see what early usage looks like.
Islamabad - Quaid-i-Azam University (QAU) has refused to drop the recently imposed degree fee to be charged from students of affiliated colleges in the city.
Talking to The Nation, Controller Examination QAU, Sardar Babar said that university administration held a meeting with principals of the colleges and it has not reversed its decision.
“University decided to charge Rs 3479 as degree fee from affiliated colleges and the sessions will have to pay the fee,” he said.
Students have been asked to pay degree fee for the sessions of 2012-14 and 2014-16.
Sardar Babar said that the fee has been imposed after the approval of syndicate and the student who will not pay fee will not get the degree.
“QAU was never awarding degree without fee, students enrolled at university also pay the charges,” he said.
He also stated that colleges affiliated with QAU could not be compared with Punjab University (PU) because of its limited jurisdiction.
“There are only 12 affiliated colleges with QAU while Punjab University has a much bigger number as compared to it,” he said.
He added that all degree awarding institutions charge fee and the segments opposing the fee are only doing politics.
Before current degree fee, university was charging Rs 2000 as registration fee and Rs 2500 as examination fee, while Rs 2000 were being charged for supports fund.
Students of H-8 College have also held a protest recently against the newly introduced degree fee on students. And college administration has assured them of solving their problems.
Talking to The Nation, a college principal seeking anonymity said that the colleges had started facing problems since their affiliation with QAU from PU.
After the 18th amendment affiliation of federal degree colleges was shifted to QAU from PU.
“QAU initially had stated that it is a research institute and cannot take graduate examinations,” he said.
He also stated that around a dozen degree awarding colleges, in the disciplines of commerce, bachelors of arts and sciences more than 1500 students are enrolled.
The principal said these students belong to underprivileged class and it is not easy for them or their parents to bear extra charges.
“A large number of students enrolled in degree programs of college belong to rural areas and affordability of fee is a challenge for them,” he said.
He said that already university is charging amount from students in means of examination, sports and registration fee, it was not required to impose degree fee on students.
“There is difference in public and private sector and students take admission in government colleges because they cannot afford expenses in private sector,” he said.
Meanwhile, a group of students from H-8 College in conversation with The Nation said that new degree fee is not acceptable for students because it is being charged unfairly.
According to them, PU is not charging any fee from students in this regard from students and expense of degree fee is being collected from other charges paid by students.
Students said, educational boards didn't take fee for intermediate sheets and degrees at intermediate level and this was being practice till the colleges were affiliated with PU.
Opposing the decision of QAU, students said they will raise the issue on all concerned platforms.
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's main opposition Congress party on Monday elevated Rahul Gandhi, the scion of the country's most fabled political dynasty, as its president, preparing to challenge the dominance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of national polls in 2019. Rahul Gandhi, Vice-President of India's main opposition Congress Party, is garlanded by supporters during an election campaign meeting ahead of the second phase of Gujarat state assembly elections, in Dakor, December 10, 2017. REUTERS/Amit DaveIn a long-awaited move, Gandhi, the great-grandson of India's founding prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, was elected unopposed to head the party. He will take the reins from his mother Sonia, the party's longest-serving president who was elected in 1998. Calling it a “historic occasion”, the Congress party said Gandhi would take charge as president on Dec. 16. Television broadcast images of party supporters celebrating and distributing sweets outside Congress offices in the capital, New Delhi, and the financial hub of Mumbai. Gandhi's ascent coincides with state polls in Modi's western home state of Gujarat that are shaping as a test for the prime minister, who has been facing criticism for softening economic growth and poor implementation of a nationwide sales tax. The Congress hopes a round of state elections offers the party, and Gandhi, a shot at revival ahead of the next national elections, due in 2019. Modi's depiction of Gandhi as an undeserving “prince” has helped sideline Gandhi since the last national election, during which time Congress has suffered some of its worst results in local elections. The Nehru-Gandhi family has ruled the country for most of its 70 years since independence from Britain. Gandhi's father and grandmother were both prime ministers, and both assassinated. GANDHI VS MODI FILE PHOTO: Rahul Gandhi, Vice-President of India's main opposition Congress Party, is pictured during an election campaign meeting ahead of the second phase of Gujarat state assembly elections, in Dakor, India, December 10, 2017. REUTERS/Amit Dave/File photoFollowing Congress' defeat in the 2014 polls, Gandhi struggled to convince voters, as well as many within his party, of his leadership skills. But senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said Gandhi was now ready for the next challenge. “The entire country has lots of expectations from Rahul Gandhi,” Azad said. “Much before he was elected he has shown his mettle. He knows his responsibility.” Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swiftly dismissed Gandhi's election, saying he had become president only on the basis of “dynastic principle”. Slideshow (4 Images)“The new India is loath to (accept) dynastic principle and the family character of the Congress further diminishes its appeal,” BJP spokesman G.V.L. Narasimha Rao told Reuters. Gandhi, until now a vice-president of Congress, is widely seen as a prime ministerial candidate if the party returns to power one day. The 47-year-old has increasingly gone public in slamming Modi's governance since the last national polls, as he looks to shed the reticent image that has for years been synonymous with his political dynasty. But he has also faced political backlash. In 2015, for example, he took nearly two months of leave, prompting Modi's party to accuse him of “holidaying” while parliament was in session. Modi still trumps Gandhi in popularity rankings, however. Nearly nine of 10 Indians have a favourable opinion of him and more than two-thirds are satisfied with the direction in which he is taking the country, a Pew survey found in November. Modi's favourable rating was 30 points more than Gandhi‘s, it showed.

After tying 1-1 after regular time, England beat Colombia 4-3 on penalty kicks. Farewell Colombia and good-o on England, though I hate seeing matches decided by penalty kicks.
Here's the schedule for the quarter finals. Not many people who entered our World Cup contest are still eligible to win:
The Tata Group, comprising over 100 companies, has roped in veteran diplomat Subrahmanyam Jaishankar to oversee the group's global strategy development. A Tata Sons statement said: “In his new role [S Jaishankar] will be responsible for the Tata group's global corporate affairs and international strategy development. Dr Jaishankar will work with Tata companies to help them strengthen their business presence and positioning in their respective geographies globally.”
For his appointment, the Tatas, it appears, could convince Prime Minister Narendra Modi to waive-off a mandatory, one-year, cooling-off period stipulated for bureaucrats seeking to join the private sector.
But why Jaishankar?
Jaishankar may not be able to influence bottom lines as such, experts told Firstpost. The Tatas, they said, are looking to tap the career diplomat's expertise in navigating the power corridors in countries of interest to the conglomerate, which raked in around two-thirds of its revenue from outside India in financial year 2016-17.
Prior to leading India's foreign ministry, Jaishankar worked in North America, across Asia and in eastern Europe -- all key markets for the salt-to-software conglomerate. He served as the Indian ambassador to the United States, China and the Czech Republic, and also served as high commissioner to Singapore.
Three firms in the Group -- TCS (17 percent), Tata Motors (43 percent) and Tata Steel (17 percent) -- contribute over 77 percent of the conglomerate's revenue, according to a Credit Suisse report, and, incidentally, the top markets for these firms are the US, China, and Europe respectively.
Camaraderie
The fact that Prime Minister Modi cancelled the cooling-off period in Jaishankar's case speaks volumes about his rapport with the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), and the Tata Group want people who matter in power, said Kris Laxmikanth, CMD, The Head Hunters India.
Jaishankar reportedly enjoys Modi's trust, acting as his unofficial foreign policy advisor. He has accompanied Modi on foreign trips that secretaries usually aren't a part of. “When it comes to an overseas acquisition or negotiations, the Tata Group could not have hired anyone better than Jaishankar, who can open doors for them,” Laxmikanth added.
The Tatas will benefit from Jaishankar's deep understanding of geopolitics and international political economy, according to management consultant Harish HV. “He cannot be seen as a lobbyist as, by that yardstick, the Group will have to hire a lobbyist in every country. Jaishankar will not have much of an impact on the Group's bottom lines but the Group will be able to draw in on his deep experience in foreign affairs and use that to its advantage,” Harish added.
The government's loss is the Tata Group's gain, opined Arvind Singhal, Chairman, Technopak Advisors. The government doesn't have to let go of its top civil servants when they reach retirement. But, as the “Group has made significant investments globally, Jaishankar will be able to guide the group. He is an expert on China and could advise the Group on further investments in China,” said Singhal.
What's important is that Jaishankar will have a well-defined role, as president for global corporate affairs. “He is not a glorified lobbyist,” added Singhal.
IT push
The global IT industry is witnessing a technological transformation. Artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, robotics and automation are taking the sector by storm. These changes are impacting the way Indian IT firms do business, outside and within India. Furthermore, protectionist policies are also forcing IT firms to tweak their delivery models.
For instance, US President Donald Trump's stand on outsourcing has been well-documented. Indian IT firms have been pulled up for, allegedly, not hiring enough foreigners for foreign jobs. In such ‘delicate' situations, Jaishankar could help the Tata Group navigate pitfalls, the experts added.
Jaishankar isn't the Group's first exceptional hire. Previously, the Tatas hired former Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) CEO Madhu Kannan, who served as Group Head of Business Development and Public Affairs until October 2016 and was also a member of the Group Executive Council.
In 2009, with Ratan Tata at the helm, the Tatas hired Alan Rosling, who was a special adviser to former UK Prime Minister John Major.
Australian scientists in collaboration with researchers from Japan on Thursday announced the world's first accurate blood test for Alzheimer's disease which can detect the illness up to 20 years before any symptoms occur.
The test, which spots the illnes at an accuracy of over 90 per cent, identifies the build-up of a protein called amyloid-beta, which is an early indicator of the disease, Xinhua news agency reported.
Up until now, the only way to determine if a patient had Alzheimer's was by highly invasive and expensive methods, including brain scans and lumbar punctures.
But the breakthrough by the University of Melbourne's Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health will mean diagnosing the disease will become far easier.
"In the first instance, it will be an invaluable tool in increasing the speed of screening potential patients for new drug trials," said Colin Masters, Professor at Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health.
"Progress in developing new therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease has been disappointingly slow," Masters said.
"New drugs are urgently required, and the only way to do that is to speed up whole process," he added.
At the moment due to the long time spans involved in pharmaceutical studies, companies require extremely accurate predictions of who is most at risk before going ahead with trials.
This means rigorous patient selection is essential, and with the new test the process should improve exponentially.
Worldwide, Alzheimer's costs $818 billion per year, with 20-40 of the population over 70 considered to be "at risk" of developing the disease at some future point.
The buildings were about 60 years old and had reached the end of their usefulness, the city says. Firefighters were working out of a single-wide trailer onsite because the old station had fallen out of code, and library staff was making stopgap repairs to its building.

QUETTA - Balochistan Chief Minister Nawab Sanaullah Zehri has said that the United Nations discarding Indian resolution actually is an acknowledgment of Pakistan sacrifices in war against terrorism.
Commenting on Indian resolution against Pakistan in UN reflected the nefarious designs of Indian government which met a disgraceful fate in guise of rejection by the world, said the chief minister in a press statement issued on Sunday.
The UN admitted Pakistan's unrivalled sacrifices in war on terror by rejecting Indian baseless resolution against Pakistan, noted the CM.
The Indian resolution was aimed at diverting world focus from brutalities and tortures being inflicted upon the innocent people in occupied Kashmir and part of his decades-long negative propaganda against Pakistan, asserted the chief minister.
Nawab Zehri chided the Modi government for not only accelerating the proportion of forces against Kashmiri people, but also launching a campaign against Pakistan.
Indian hands in subversive activities was evident from the terrorists which he was patronising and funding in Balochistan and other parts of country to destabilize it through sabotaging attempts, articulated Zehri.
Mentioning reference of nailed Indian Navy officer Kulbushan Jadhav and other operatives of his networks in Balochistan, the chief minister declared Indian involvement in terror activities in Balochistan was an inalienable prop and plotting to disrupt the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project.
He added India cannot see CPEC go functional which would usher in a new era of prosperity and development not only in country, but also in region, and hatching conspiracies through agents to sabotage it; however, they terribly failed in their despicable designs.
Welcoming Pakistani bid to present props of Indian terrorism and intrusion to UN, Nawab Zehri said the time came to expose Indian terror campaign in Balochistan before the world with an aim to apprise world of his role in Balochistan to prevent him from sponsoring and funding terrorists.
Republicans in the Iowa House have voted to take the first step toward giving Iowans the opportunity to add a gun rights amendment to the state's constitution.
The same proposal would have to clear the legislature in 2019 or 2020 before Iowa voters could decide whether to add the gun rights language to the state's constitution. If adopted, it's requiring courts to strictly scrutinize any gun laws.
Representative Skyler Wheeler, a Republican from Orange City, dismissed what he called “lawyer talk” criticizing that part of the proposal.
“Whether you like it or not, we do have a fundamental individual right to keep and bear arms,” Wheeler said. “…And I like having a way to ensure that I keep that freedom against those who wish to strip that from me.”
Representative Liz Bennett, a Democrat from Cedar Rapids, called the proposal “extreme.”
“Making it harder to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them instead of working for gun safety,” Nelson said. “When we're talking about life and liberty, why aren't we talking about the life and liberty of kids who have died in the classroom?”
Representative Mary Wolfe, a Democrat from Clinton, said the proposal would open up a “Pandora's box” of litigation.
“And (it) would, in my opinion, result in the finding that a lot of our current gun safety laws are, in fact, unconstitutional,” Wolfe said.
Representative Matt Windschitl, a Republican from Missouri Valley, said the proposal will put a halt to “government over-reach” when it comes to gun regulations.
“If you just want to think I'm some crazy, gun-loving kook, fine. Have at that, but think about this: Voting ‘no' on this here tonight is denying Iowans an opportunity to have their voice heard in what they want to have in their state constitution,” Windschitl said.
After three hours of debate, the House passed the proposal on a 54-42 vote. All 54 “yes” votes came from Republicans. Two Republicans — Representatives Dave Heaton of Mount Vernon and Andy McKean of Anamosa — joined all the Democrats in the House in voting no.
Eight provinces and all three territories will share $2 billion in federal funds to help them cut their greenhouse gas emissions over the next five years.
Environment Minister Catherine McKenna has scheduled a news conference Thursday in Ottawa, where she will finally unveil details of how the Liberal government's promised Low Carbon Economy Fund will work.
READ MORE: Carbon tax not going to be only climate policy from Ottawa: Catherine McKenna
Manitoba and Saskatchewan, neither of which has signed the Pan Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change, will not be eligible for any of the money.
The fund was first created in the 2016 federal budget to help provinces fund initiatives which significantly cut greenhouse gases as Canada races to meet its targets under the Paris climate change accord.
Canada must cut almost 200 million tonnes of emissions by 2030 to meet its target of reducing greenhouse gases to 30 per cent below 2005 levels. That's the equivalent of taking more than twice as many cars off Canada's roads as are even in the country.
The fund was initially to be a two-year program, with the $2 billion equally divided between 2017-18 and 2018-19, until it became clear early in the negotiations that the provinces and territories needed more time to find the best uses for the money.
The money was reprofiled over five years in this year's budget, starting with $250 million in 2017-18. There will be $500 million available in each of the next three years and the final $250 million in 2021-22.
READ MORE: Sask. premier describes federal carbon tax plan as a ‘ransom note'
The funds will be allocated for projects that significantly reduce emissions, prioritizing those that reduce the most emissions most cheaply. Initiatives must also be in addition to existing projects or those that are already planned.
A spokeswoman for McKenna told The Canadian Press recently the fund would only be available to “support serious action on climate change for those who have committed to the Pan Canadian Framework.”
Thus far, the promise of a piece of the $2-billion pie has not been enough to lure either Saskatchewan or Manitoba to sign the framework.
Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall is adamant he will never sign the framework as long as it requires him to introduce a price on carbon. He is threatening to sue Ottawa if it tries to impose a carbon tax on the province.
READ MORE: It's not a carbon tax, it's a ‘behaviour-changing measure': government officials
As part of the framework, Ottawa requires every province to implement a minimum $10 per tonne price on carbon by the spring of 2018, or Ottawa will do it for them. The price has to rise by $10 per tonne per year until it hits $50 per tonne by 2022.
Ottawa pledges any revenue raised by a carbon tax directly will stay within the province it came from, although only those with their own carbon price program will get to decide how to spend it.
The federal government will decide how to allocate the money raised by carbon taxes it imposes, and is looking at giving at least some of it back in direct grants to individual families and small businesses.
Manitoba chose not to sign the framework in an attempt to leverage more money for health care. It is less opposed to a price on carbon, but reports say the province may prefer a federally imposed carbon tax to force Ottawa to wear the political fallout.

UK prime minister Theresa May has agreed to accept a proposal by British lawmakers to ensure they have more oversight in the process of severing ties with the European Union.
Several legislators, including members of the governing Conservative party, had challenged the premier over plans to copy and paste EU rules into British legislation under the EU Withdrawal Bill. They argued it would give ministers power to change laws without the agreement of parliament.
Downing Street announced on December 11 it would now accept an amendment giving the House of Commons new rights to demand votes when ministers use powers dating back to the reign of Henry VIII to rewrite law.
In an interview with Sputnik, Professor Aileen McHarg, a constitutional expert at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, said it was the right thing to do as the government potentially faced defeat over the issue.
"The EU (Withdrawal) Bill confers a number of powers on ministers, via secondary legislation, to adjust the statute book in the light of Brexit and to implement the eventual withdrawal agreement. Although there is general agreement that such powers are necessary given the timetable for Brexit, as initially introduced, the breadth of these powers and the inadequacy of the arrangements for Parliamentary scrutiny was the subject of widespread criticism, including by the cross-party Commons Procedure Committee," she told Sputnik.
The professor revealed there was a good chance that the Bill would have been amended as it passed through the Commons or the Lords. Accordingly, the government has pre-empted the possibility of a defeat by accepting the amendments proposed by the Procedures Committee, he added.
"The effect is to allow MPs to decide what level of parliamentary scrutiny particular pieces of secondary legislation should be subject to, thus reducing the risk that the government's powers will be used to introduce important policy changes or changes that go further than is strictly necessary. It is, clearly, a good thing," she added.
The proposal will now add an extra layer of parliamentary scrutiny to proposed changes from EU law as they are moved into British law.
He's a 25-year-old Disney kid-turned-"mature" pop star. She's a 35-year-old Bollywood actor-turned-Hollywood small-screen leading lady. So, um, how did Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra meet, exactly? The reportedly new couple first got tongues wagging when they attended the Met Gala together in 2017 — a date they claimed was purely platonic — but, according to the Indo Asia News Service, they were originally introduced before that night by a famous mutual friend.
When Jonas and Chopra showed up at the 2017 Met Gala together, fans were like, *screeching brakes*. The relatively unusual pairing even attracted the attention of Jimmy Kimmel, who asked Chopra about her date for the Gala during a May 10, 2017 interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live.
"What's going on, are you dating Nick Jonas? Isn't he like 11 years old?" Kimmel pointedly asked the Quantico star. "We were both wearing Ralph Lauren," Chopra explained, "and we decided to go together, and it was fun."
Kimmel, clearly not buying it, replied, "Really? Interesting." He and Chopra then joked about Jonas' age — during which time you can almost feel Chopra blushing — and she briefly mentioned that they'd know each other before. The actor didn't mention how they'd first met, but Jonas may have spilled the details a few months later.
Jimmy Kimmel Live on YouTube
According to the Indo Asian News Service, Jonas reportedly said in a statement in December 2017, "[Chopra and I] met through a mutual friend, who she did Quantico with — this guy Graham — and we met up like, in New York the first time, and the same day I think we found out that we were both going to the Met Gala with Ralph Lauren."
It's probably safe to assume that "this guy Graham" who Chopra did Quantico with is none other than her co-star, Graham Rogers. In fact, you don't even have to dig any further than Rogers' Quantico cast bio to discover the connection. In listing some of Rogers' notable credits, it says right there in black and white, that he was in the film, "Careful What You Wish For, where he appeared alongside Nick Jonas." Tah-dah!
On May 29, reports first starting surfacing that Chopra and Jonas were an item. (Bustle reached out to reps for Chopra and Jonas for comment, but did not receive a response.) "They are dating and it's brand new," a source told Us Weekly. "It's a good match and they are both interested in each other." A source for People added that they're "very casual" right now, and "[they're] flirtatious and have been hanging out and text all the time."

Neither one of those statements are particularly illuminating, nor do they offer up much proof. According to Just Jared, however, Chopra and Jonas were reportedly spotted watching Beauty and the Beast Live in Concert at the Hollywood Bowl together on May 25, and were reportedly seen at a Los Angeles Dodgers game on May 26, as well.
“They walked in together just before the performance was starting," a source told Us Weekly of their Hollywood Bowl date night. "They looked great together, but no hand-holding or obvious PDA." The onlooker added, "[Chopra and Jonas] were seen heading to the concessions stand during intermission before returning to their seats to finish taking in the show. They snuck out right as the show was ending."
But, wait! There's more! Twitter user @JickNonasNews (as per Just Jared) unearthed two photos — although, it's unclear where they came from originally — that appear to show Chopra and Jonas looking awfully cozy on an apparent Memorial Day boat trip. This boat trip was also randomly attended by Wilmer Valderrama, Chord Overstreet, and Jack McBrayer, among others, so, there's that.
Of course, neither Chopra nor Jonas have confirmed their supposedly budding romance, which gives fan some time to come up with a worthy couple name. Jopra? Nickyanka? The possibilities are endless.
In 2013: BC Liberal Mike de Jong won handily, taking more than 50 per cent of the vote. This is a safe Liberal seat.
In 2009: Liberal Mike de Jong won the riding by over 3,500 votes over NDP challenger Taranjit Purewal, 56-32 per cent, his 5th straight election win.
History & Geography: A riding created in 2009 to deal with population growth in the Fraser Valley, Abbotsford West encompasses the western suburbs of Abbotsford, the core of the city north of Old Yale Road and the Mt. Lehman area to the west. The riding now includes parts of the former Fort Langley-Aldergrove riding.
This is a riding south of the Fraser between Surrey and Hope, and no such riding has ever gone to the NDP outside a by-election.
Candidates
BC Liberals' Mike de Jong first took this area in 1994, winning a historically pivotal by-election in Matsqui over then-Social Credit leader Grace McCarthy, which effectively ended that party's relevance. A cabinet minister for all 16 years that the BC Liberals have been in government, he currently sits as Finance Minister.
NDP's Preet Rai is a three-term Abbotsford school Trustee. Rai is a chartered accountant with a long history of community service. Originally from India, he lived in the UK before coming to Canada in 1995.
Green Party's Kevin Eastwood works as a grower in a Native Plant Nursery in Aldergrove. He was VP of inaugural class at Quest University and sits as a Council Member in the BC Institute of Agrologists.

While everyone (or just about everyone) knows to avoid the Bermuda Triangle if you're flying or sailing, there are other spots in major bodies of water around that world that have similar reputations for allegedly causing large numbers of shipwrecks, disappearances or accidents. If you'd like a list of them, the government or NASA are not the first places to go. A better plan would be to contact an insurance company that covers the shipping industry. A German newspaper did just that and found that the new Bermuda Triangle is off the coast of southern China, primarily in the South China Sea. If you think YOUR insurance rates are high …
This revelation comes from the German newspaper WELT which recently analyzed loss documents from Allianz subsidiary Global Corporate & Specialty, a major German insurance company with clients worldwide, primarily in the marine and aviation businesses. The records showed that, of the 85 large freighters lost in 2016, one quarter of them occurred in the waters off southern China, Indochina, Indonesia and the Philippines. The next most dangerous areas were the eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea.
A typical wreck was that of the container ship TS Taipei, which lost power on March 10 off the coast of Taiwan's New Taipei City and broke in half two weeks later, spilling some of its 70,000 gallons of fuel, oil and wastewater. The crew was rescued, spillage eventually cleaned up and fines paid.
If you think that doesn't sound like a typical mysterious Bermuda Triangle accident, you're right. The mysterious causes of these wrecks is not something strange in the water or even turbulent water conditions … it's located at the headquarters of the shipping companies operating the vessels. The insurance company found that these companies are dangerously increasing the size of their ships and overloading their cargos while decreasing the level of maintenance and safety checks and hiring inexperienced crews for low wages. With the amount of marine traffic off the southern China coast, it's no wonder it leads the world in shipwrecks.
In other words, a picture of this South China Sea Triangle would have three cut corners.
While this area has often been called the Devil's Sea or the Dragon's Triangle and some of the wrecks, like those in the Bermuda Triangle, have been blamed on paranormal activity or methane gas releases, the bean counters at the insurance company know the real reason why shipping policies cost so many tons of beans. The real devil in this triangle is the same one that causes most of the problems in the world … greedy humans.
Paris: Serena Williams brought out her 'Black Panther' catsuit again at the French Open on Wednesday, teaming with sister Venus to beat Japan's Shuko Aoyama and Miyu Kato 4-6, 6-4, 6-1 in doubles.
The sisters, who were champions in 1999 and 2010, towered over their opponents.
Venus and Serena, at 6ft 1in (1.85m) and 5ft 9in (1.75m) respectively, cut imposing figures standing next to Aoyama and Kato, 5ft 1in (1.54m) and 5ft 2in (1.57m).
As well as the height difference, it was Serena's black catsuit which caught the eye after she debuted it in her opening 7-6 (7/4), 6-4 singles win over Kristyna Pliskova on Tuesday.
The 36-year-old American said the suit was inspired by the Black Panther movie blockbuster and made her feel like a 'superhero'.
However, 70th-ranked Pliskova questioned the legality of the outfit when she talked with Czech media.
"I was wondering if it was in the rules," the Czech said.
"I don't even know what material it is, it looks like neoprene.
"They should follow the rules, otherwise play in the nude."
However, there is no indication that the suit breaks any tournament regulations.
Williams said the catsuit was crucial for her health and well-being, claiming it prevented the return of blood clots which left her life in danger after she gave birth to daughter Alexis Olympia Ohanian in September last year.
Williams, a three-time singles champion in Paris, will face Australia's Ashleigh Barty in the second round on Thursday.
“It's truly fun to know when I'm done playing the game of basketball to know that I played against some of the greatest teams that ever played, ever been assembled — and this is one of them,” James said. “You know, it's just like whoever they kind of suit up or whoever they decide to be a part of what they've got going on over here is just a really, really high IQ basketball player and knows how to play the game of basketball. At what chapter will the LeBron versus Warriors fit into my book? I have no idea.”
Multinational television group, Discovery has announced that 11 of its channels will disappear from StarHub, one of Singapore's two principal cable network operators. The dispute emerges from recent carriage renewal talks and hinges on a disagreement over fees.
“StarHub is not prepared to pay fair value and have announced their decision to cease transmission of all 11 Discovery channels on their platform,” Discovery said. Seven Discovery channels will no longer be available on StarHub after June 30. Four channels from the legacy Scripps contract will cease after August 31.
Channels affected include: Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, TLC, Discovery Science, Discovery Asia, Eurosport and Setanta, HGTV, Asian Food Channel, Food Network, and Travel Channel.
“All we are asking for is the equivalent of a cup of coffee per customer per month,” Discovery said in a letter circulated on Wednesday. It also urged viewers to voice their displeasure to StarHub's customer relations staff.
Regional TV trade publication Content Asia speculated that Discovery is looking for $8 million a year, while StarHub is offering $4 million. That disparity appears to reflect the crunch between a large legacy channels bundle and the city-state's shrinking pay-TV market. Cord-cutting and, despite Singapore's reputation as a law-abiding country, high levels of piracy have taken their toll.

StarHub hit back quickly, first contradicting Discovery's version of events, then getting in some retaliatory threats of its own. “We are in renewal negotiations with Discovery and we are doing everything possible to arrive at a deal,” StarHub said in its statement. “Concurrently, we are acquiring fresh replacement content in the event that negotiations prove unsuccessful. If we are unable to agree on a renewal, … we will announce the launch of several new channels to ensure our customers will continue to enjoy access to a good range of education and lifestyle channels. This will be carried out in the coming weeks.”
StarHub also said it will be offering its viewers a month of free access to 28 other channels, many of which are in the same education, wildlife and lifestyle bracket as Discovery's channel roster. They include BBC Earth, BBC Lifestyle, Disney Channel, Love Nature, MTV Asia, Nickelodeon, Smithsonian Channel and Sony Channel.
Discovery's Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, TLC, Discovery Science, Discovery Asia, Eve, DMAX, and Eurosport remain available on Singtel, StarHub's competitor.
Purolator is expanding and creating 85 new jobs over the next five years with the expansion of it's Business Services Centre in Dieppe.
As e-commerce continues to grow, officials with the company say more employees are needed to schedule appointments, track orders and deal with complaints,
“That's both business-to-business e-commerce, which is our core strength. as well as business-to-consumer e-commerce, which is certainly the fastest growing area with online shopping and residential deliveries increasing,” explains Ken Johnston, vice-president of Purolator's human resources department.
The New Brunswick government is supporting the project by providing payroll rebates. The company is eligible for an investment of up to $560,000 from Opportunities NB, a Crown corporation that attracts and supports new and existing business.
“These are major businesses, there's no doubt about it, but that means they have choices. They have other provinces and other states that they can go to, so we have to put financial incentives on the table. In many cases we always do so in a way that we're protecting taxpayers' money, and you can imagine that's always at the forefront ,” said Premier Brian Gallant.
The rebates are performance-based and are only given to the company when it shows proof of salary levels and employment. Because the rebates are provided annually and based on the number of jobs hired and maintained that year, the total amount provided from Opportunities NB to Purolator could vary.

“Jobs need to be created when these incentives are given. New Brunswickers get their money back by having a payroll that's increased by having taxes that are being paid by companies also by individuals, so it's a win, win, win situation,” explains Treasury Board and Post-Secondary Education Minister Roger Melanson.
Melanson says it's a move that could see an additional $1.8 million in provincial tax revenue over the next five years.
Laguna Beach High School has its new principal.
The Laguna Beach Unified School District board on Tuesday approved hiring Jason Allemann, Dana Hills High School's current principal.
Allemann begins his new role July 1, and will take over for Chris Herzfeld, Laguna Beach High's current principal. Earlier this year Herzfeld announced he would step down because he wants to teach in Laguna Beach Unified.
Allemann worked at Dana Hills for six years and was principal at Katella High in Anaheim for four years, the Dana Point Times reported in 2011.
He also has served as an assistant principal and counselor in the Anaheim Union High School District, according to a Laguna Beach Unified news release.
“I am honored and excited to work at such an innovative school and district that has an amazing network of support from the greater school community,” Allemann said in the release.
Laguna Beach Unified considered Allemann a good match based on student, parent and staff surveys and meeting feedback, according to the release.
“Dr. Allemann has demonstrated leadership in uniting students, parents, and the community for continued success in academics and the growth of a positive school family, and we are excited for him to bring those skills to Laguna Beach,” Laguna Beach Supt. Jason Viloria said in the release.
Under Allemann's leadership, Dana Hills High expanded career technical education opportunities for students and has experience working with students with diverse needs, including English-language learners, according to the release.
Allemann earned a bachelor's in psychology from San Diego State University a master's in social work from California State University Long Beach and a doctorate in educational leadership from the University of Southern California.
Allemann's annual salary will be $176,334, according to a district staff report.

Police have said their reaction to a hoax bomb threat which affected at least 12 schools in North Lincolnshire would have been "very different" had the threat been credible.
The schools were among 20 in the Humberside Police force area and more than 400 nationally to receive an anonymous email this morning saying a bomb would be set off within three hours if a $5,000 payment was not made.
After co-ordination between local police and UK counterterrorism officers, the email was labelled a hoax.
Officers from Humberside Police moved to reassure parents earlier today and confirmed 12 North Lincolnshire schools had been affected, although the force did not name the individual schools.
Now, the force's Detective Superintendent Tony Cockerill has said: "Our primary concern is ensuring that everyone is safe and that schools are given guidance, up to date information and reassurance.
"Communication with parents is a matter for the individual schools and head teachers, through their established communication channels such as text alerts and websites.
"If this had been thought to be a credible threat, we would have dealt with this matter very differently."
According to reports, the messages sent to schools across the country are believed to have originated from the USA.
An image of the email was posted on Twitter earlier today.
The message reads: "This is a message to EVERYONE. We have sent in a student with a bomb. The bomb is set to go off in 3 hours time. If you do not send $5,000 USD to payments@veltpvp.com
"If you do not send the money! We will blow up the device. Our site has all the information needed (veltpvp.com).
"If you try to call the cops we WILL blowup the device on the SPOT! ANY attempt at defusing it your self will cause it to explode."
Earlier this morning, Detective Superintendent Cockerill had said: "We have been liaising with our counterterrorism colleagues across the country and it is not believed that the threats are credible.
"We have spoken to all schools who have contacted us, reassured them that there is no need to evacuate and offered them security advice."

Sometimes the right tool for the job is a command-line application. A command-line application is a program that you interact with and run from something like your shell or Terminal. Git and Curl are examples of command-line applications that you might already be familiar with.
Command-line apps are useful when you have a bit of code you want to run several times in a row or on a regular basis. Django developers run commands like ./manage.py runserver to start their web servers; Docker developers run docker-compose up to spin up their containers. The reasons you might want to write a command-line app are as varied as the reasons you might want to write code in the first place.
For this month's Python column, we have three libraries to recommend to Pythonistas looking to write their own command-line tools.
Click
Click is our favorite Python package for command-line applications. It:
Has great documentation filled with examples
Includes instructions on packaging your app as a Python application so it's easier to run
Automatically generates useful help text
Lets you stack optional and required arguments and even several commands
Has a Django version ( django-click ) for writing management commands
Click uses its @click.command() to declare a function as a command and specify required or optional arguments.
# hello.py
import click
@ click. command ( )
@ click. option ( '--name' , default = '' , help = 'Your name' )
def say_hello ( name ) :
click. echo ( "Hello {}!" . format ( name ) )
if __name__ == '__main__' :
hello ( )
The @click.option() decorator declares an optional argument, and the @click.argument() decorator declares a required argument. You can combine optional and required arguments by stacking the decorators. The echo() method prints results to the console.
$ python hello.py --name = 'Lacey'
Hello Lacey !
Docopt
Docopt is a command-line application parser, sort of like Markdown for your command-line apps. If you like writing the documentation for your apps as you go, Docopt has by far the best-formatted help text of the options in this article. It isn't our favorite command-line app library because its documentation throws you into the deep end right away, which makes it a little more difficult to get started. Still, it's a lightweight library that is very popular, especially if exceptionally nice documentation is important to you.
help
version
Docopt is very particular about how you format the required docstring at the top of your file. The top element in your docstring after the name of your tool must be "Usage," and it should list the ways you expect your command to be called (e.g., by itself, with arguments, etc.). Usage should includeandflags.
The second element in your docstring should be "Options," and it should provide more information about the options and arguments you identified in "Usage." The content of your docstring becomes the content of your help text.
"""HELLO CLI
Usage:
hello.py
hello.py
hello.py -h|--help
hello.py -v|--version
Options:
Optional name argument.
-h --help Show this screen.
-v --version Show version.
"""
from docopt import docopt
def say_hello ( name ) :
return ( "Hello {}!" . format ( name ) )
if __name__ == '__main__' :
arguments = docopt ( __doc__ , version = 'DEMO 1.0' )
if arguments [ '' ] :
print ( say_hello ( arguments [ '' ] ) )
else :
print ( arguments )
At its most basic level, Docopt is designed to return your arguments to the console as key-value pairs. If I call the above command without specifying a name, I get a dictionary back:
$ python hello.py
{ '--help' : False,
'--version' : False,
'' : None }
This shows me I did not input the help or version flags, and the name argument is None .
But if I call it with a name, the say_hello function will execute.
$ python hello.py Jeff
Hello Jeff !
Docopt allows both required and optional arguments and has different syntax conventions for each. Required arguments should be represented in ALLCAPS or in , and options should be represented with double or single dashes, like --name . Read more about Docopt's patterns in the docs.
Fire
Fire is a Google library for writing command-line apps. We especially like it when your command needs to take more complicated arguments or deal with Python objects, as it tries to handle parsing your argument types intelligently.
Fire's docs include a ton of examples, but I wish the docs were a bit better organized. Fire can handle multiple commands in one file, commands as methods on objects, and grouping commands.
Its weakness is the documentation it makes available to the console. Docstrings on your commands don't appear in the help text, and the help text doesn't necessarily identify arguments.
import fire
def say_hello ( name = '' ) :
return 'Hello {}!' . format ( name )
if __name__ == '__main__' :
fire. Fire ( )
Arguments are made required or optional depending on whether you specify a default value for them in your function or method definition. To call this command, you must specify the filename and the function name, more like Click's syntax:
$ python hello.py say_hello Rikki
Hello Rikki !
You can also pass arguments as flags, like --name=Rikki .
Bonus: Packaging!
Click includes instructions (and highly recommends you follow them) for packaging your commands using setuptools .
To package our first example, add this content to your setup.py file:
from setuptools import setup
setup (
name = 'hello' ,
version = '0.1' ,
py_modules = [ 'hello' ] ,
install_requires = [
'Click' ,
] ,
entry_points = '''
[console_scripts]
hello=hello:say_hello
''' ,
)
Everywhere you see hello , substitute the name of your module but omit the .py extension. Where you see say_hello , substitute the name of your function.
Then, run pip install --editable to make your command available to the command line.
You can now call your command like this:
$ hello --name = 'Jeff'
Hello Jeff !
Rafa Benitez has challenged his Newcastle United players to right the wrongs of Newcastle United's damaging defeat at Portman Road.
Ipswich Town deservedly beat Benitez's second-placed side 3-1 yesterday.
And the result has left Benitez and his players looking over their shoulders at Reading and Huddersfield Town in third and fourth place respectively.
Huddersfield's 1-1 draw against Derby County saw Championship leaders Brighton and Hove Albion – who beat Wigan Athletic 2-1 – promoted to the Premier League.
United, however, still have a lot of work to do in their three remaining games.
Benitez said his team was “not focused and mentally ready” for the Ipswich game, which followed a 1-1 home draw against Leeds United.
Asked why they were not ready, Newcastle's manager said: “It is difficult to explain. We will analyse, but that is the reality.
“I am not a manager that will be blaming players here in the press conference.
“We know what I told them at half-time and at the end. We know that something was wrong.
“Now we have to analyse this and change quickly. We have played so many good games during the season – now we have to get back to playing at the level we were playing at before.”
Benitez said he and his players must share the responsibility for what happened at Portman Road, where Daryl Murphy netted against his former club.
“We all have to take responsibility,” said Benitez, whose side is seven points behind Brighton.
“We win together and we lose together, and now we have to be sure that in the next game (against Preston North End on April 24) we will win together.
“Brighton have been in this situation challenging for promotion four times in the last five years. This is the fifth time that they have been in this position. Does that make a difference? It is simple.”
Asked if it had been United's worst performance under his tenure, Benitez said: “To be honest, I don't know.
“We lost, and that is it. We are disappointed because of that.
“I thought at half-time that we could do it, even though we were 1-0 down. I had confidence, because so many games have proved we can do it.”

PRIDE – The goal to change the culture and build a winning program does not come fast, but it can bring some encouragement along the way.
It proved to be the case for Port Allen in its 42-34 win over Northeast in the District 7-2A opener on Friday, Sept. 29.
Pelicans improved to 2-3 and 1-0 in district action. The loss marked only the second of the season for Northeast High School, which went into last week's game as one of the sleeper hits of the season in the Greater Baton Rouge area.
The team and coaching staff knew Northeast's reputation going into the game, Port Allen head coach Don Gibson said.
“We understood what Northeast brought to the table from the football standpoint as a solid program, but we wanted to make sure we did what we need to do to play good, hardnosed football,” he said. “I think they wanted to focus on Port Allen, and that was the most important thing.”
The Pelicans rolled to a 15-8 lead at the end of the first quarter, but Northeast proved itself a formidable foe by rallying for two touchdowns in the second quarter, but trailing 28-22.
Port Allen continued its pace, but so did the Vikings, who stayed within reach of the Pelicans who led 35-28 going into the final stanza.
The Pelicans rolled up 290 yards in the win, led by senior Norisse Cummings, who had two touchdowns and carried 15 times for 94 yards. Quarterback Harold Jones scored twice and amassed 52 yards on 12 carries.
Teammate Edward Wilson tallied 65 yards on 16 carries, Jacoby Howard had two carries for 58 yards and one TD.
Donald Johnson led the receivers with four catches for 72 yards and one touchdown, including a 58-yard scoring pass from Jones.
“We ran the ball well, but I have to give a lot of the credit to the offensive line,” Gibson said. “If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't have been able to run as effectively against Northeast's defense.”
Standouts on the offensive line included Trevon Sheperd, Treylin Johnson, Justin Louis, Jermaine Jarvis and Jaylin Davis.
Brenton Brown and Rashawn West were among the standouts on defense.

Since Volkswagen Group owns Volkswagen, Audi, and Porsche, it would be easy to assume that all three companies feel like they're in this ongoing diesel scandal together. But it sounds like Porsche is far from happy that it has been dragged into this mess. Its solution? Ask Audi to pay for everything.
Citing the German newspaper Bild, Reuters reports that Porsche wants its sister automaker to cover the cost of the diesel emissions scandal. Audi's 3.0-liter diesel V-6 was programmed to illegally cheat emissions tests and was used in around 80,000 Volkswagens, Audis, and Porsches, including the Cayenne SUV. Since Audi developed the engine, Porsche reportedly wants to be compensated for the cost of fixing the affected vehicles, offers it made to appease customers, and payments to lawyers.
According to the report, that comes to about €200 million, or $235 million at the current exchange rate.
Whether Audi will actually pay to cover the cost of Porsche dealing with the scandal, though, still remains to be seen. It appears that Porsche has made an official request for compensation but has not filed a lawsuit to force payment, nor is it clear what Porsche will do if Audi refuses. We contacted Porsche for a confirmation of the story and more information, but we have yet to receive a response.

“Whether it is around a campfire, in an exam room with a sick kid or behind my keyboard,
I just love to tell stories. God has blessed me with a robust life to use as a foundation.”
Will Dabbs
For over 10 years, Will Dabbs of Oxford, Miss., has engaged readers with his passion for the science, sport and engineering of firearms. Will's father exposed him to the virtues of hunting and “art of fieldcraft” at an early age. He was immediately drawn to the mechanical merits of firearms.
After college, he married his passion for firearms and dream of being a soldier and served eight years as an Army helicopter pilot. He served as Commander of the U.S. Army Alaska High Altitude Rescue Team before resigning as a major in 1997.
To spend more time with his family, he began a medical career at 32 and opened an urgent care clinic. Dr. Dabbs dedicates 40 hours, three days every week to treating patients.
He also owns a business designing and building sound suppressors.
And he's a reserve deputy sheriff, too.
Major-Doctor-Deputy-Lecturer-Entrepreneur —and his most prized role, Dad— Dabbs attributes his skill to “hook words together” to his grandmother – one of very few professional women writers of her era.
“Whether it is around a campfire, in an exam room with a sick kid or behind my keyboard, I just love to tell stories. God has blessed me with a robust life to use as a foundation,” he shared.
Will believes the sense of family sets FMG publications apart from many: “[The magazines] are homey, warm and comfortable. Readers are not customers; they are friends. The latest issue of Handgunner has 11 pages of letters to the editor: Who else does that?

AMHERST, Mass. (AP)  A group representing gun owners says a "social bias" against firearms was behind a decision by the University of Massachusetts to nix a 4-H youth program that teaches competitive shooting sports.
A university center runs Massachusetts 4-H. University officials tell the Hampshire Gazette (http://bit.ly/2lKWvNY ) they decided against the program because they wanted to develop a broader youth development initiative that includes instruction in hunting and fishing.
Some version of the 4-H shooting sports program is offered in every state except Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Supporters say it emphasizes safety.
The head of The Gun Owners Action League of Massachusetts, Jim Wallace, says the program would not have cost UMass anything and would have served more than 1,000 young people. He says UMass has a bias against "gun-owning families and their children."

For those lucky enough to be in the market for a hypercar, there has never been a better time to purchase one with genuine Formula One pedigree. In a break from writing about the Halo, 'grid girls' and F1 launch dates, we take a closer look at the three F1-inspired hypercars set to hit the highways in the next two years.
Aston Martin Valkyrie
Aston Martin
F1 connection Valkyrie stats Engine: Cosworth-built 6.5-litre, naturally aspirated V12
Hybrid: Rimac-built KERS
Power: 1,130bhp*
Weight: 1,030kg*
BHP per tonne: 1,097*
Price: £2.5m
Production run: 150 plus 25 AMR Pros
*According to unconfirmed reports
When F1 design genius Adrian Newey became frustrated with Formula One's increasingly restrictive rule book, his Red Bull bosses agreed to let his talents loose on new projects. One of those projects was working with Aston Martin to build the ultimate road car, and the Valkyrie is the end product.
While road-going vehicles have to comply with crash tests and emissions regulations, the opportunity to experiment with aerodynamics -- Newey's forte -- is pretty much wide open. That much is evident in the remarkable shape of the Valkyrie's aerodynamic surfaces -- specifically its floor, which has been sculpted into two giant Venturi tunnels at the rear.
At the original announcement of the Valkyrie -- then codenamed AM-RB 001 -- Aston Martin claimed its new car would break the Formula One lap record at Silverstone, although that target now appears to be the aim of the track-only Valkyrie AMR Pro. Still, the performance of the 'standard' Valkyrie is likely to exceed that of any other car on the road.
Aston Martin
Verdict
The Aston Martin Valkyrie has parallels with the legendary McLaren F1. Back in the 1990s, McLaren's F1 completely rewrote the rules surrounding performance road cars and the Valkyrie promises to do the same. Legendary F1 designer Gordon Murray was the man behind the F1 and the Valkyrie looks set to create a similar legacy for Newey.
The fact it has a bespoke naturally-aspirated V12 only adds to the appeal at a time when the majority of performance car manufacturers look to forced induction to meet their power demands. With the advent of a new era of electric vehicles already upon us, the Valkyrie could prove to be the ultimate swansong for the internal combustion engine.
Mercedes Project One
Daimler
F1 connection Project One stats Engine: Brixworth-built 1.6-litre, single turbo V6
Hybrid: F1-derived MGU-K and MGU-H
Power: 1,000bhp plus
Weight: Approx 1,300kg
BHP per tonne: Approx 770
Price: £2.4m
Production run: 275
Car manufacturers often boast about the links between their motorsport endeavours and their production cars, but it's rare that they simply lift hardware from an F1 car and plonk it in a road-going vehicle. The reasons for that are clear: an F1 car is intended to be thrashed from the moment it starts to the moment it's shut down and each part of it is designed to last just a few miles longer than required under the regulations. A road car, meanwhile, is designed to be driven around town at low speeds, meet emissions regulations and last as long as the car is cared for.
Therefore, it is testimony to the engineering brilliance of Mercedes' world-beating turbo hybrid F1 engine that it can be adapted to run in a road car. There will be some changes to the engine -- the red line will be capped at 11,000rpm in the Project One compared to 13,500 in the F1 car and the fuel-flow limiter will be removed -- but the basic 1.6-litre V6 and its single split turbo will remain. The Energy Recovery System will actually be improved with a bigger battery and an electric motor on each of the front wheels -- capable of both recovering energy under braking and delivering 120kW of power under acceleration. In its most frugal engine setting, the Project One will be able to travel 25km on electric power alone and it will be by far the most efficient hypercar on the market when it hits the road in 2019.
Daimler
Verdict
Any road car powered by an F1 engine achieves instant legendary status. The Ferrari F50 had a V12 based on the Scuderia's 1990 F1 engine, the Porsche Carrera GT had an engine derived from a stillborn V10 project for Footwork (which eventually ended up in a Le Mans prototype), but it's incredibly rare to see an F1 power unit as complete as the Project One's make it onto the road. The new Mercedes is the closest you can get to driving a modern F1 car on public highways, and it achieves that with unprecedented levels of fuel efficiency for a hypercar.
McLaren Senna
The McLaren Senna will make its public debut at the Geneva Motor Show in March. McLaren Automotive
F1 connection Senna stats Engine: Ricardo-built 4.0-litre, twin-turbo V8
Hybrid: No
Power: 789bhp
Weight: 1,198kg
BHP per tonne: 660
Price: £750,000 (final example auctioned for £1.88m)
Production run: 500
It's perhaps unfair to pit the McLaren Senna against the other two cars on this list (it is roughly £1.65m cheaper than both!), but with that name it simply couldn't be ignored. The Senna name has been used with the blessing of three-time world champion's family and McLaren has promised to donate a "significant contribution" to the Instituto Ayrton Senna as part of its collaboration with the foundation.
The British manufacturer launched the Senna earlier this year saying it was the "personification of McLaren's DNA at its most extreme" and "the most track-focused road car we have ever built". Much like an F1 car, every surface has been designed to make it go faster on track, giving the Senna its aggressive -- if slightly ungainly -- looks. Like-for-like technology with an F1 car is limited -- it isn't a hybrid for starters -- but McLaren has approached the design of the Senna in the same uncompromising way it does with its race cars, making it one of the most outrageous production cars in existence.
The McLaren Senna has been designed specifically for the track. McLaren Automotive
Verdict
Naming a car after Ayrton Senna is brave. But McLaren's thinking was clear: this is the most track-focused road car it's ever built and Senna was the most intense racing driver it ever employed. Because of the name, the Senna has a hint of the Ferrari Enzo about it, but unlike the legendary Enzo, which was the ultimate Ferrari at the time of its launch, McLaren is already working on a car that will sit above the Senna in its range.
BP23 is the codename for McLaren's upcoming three-seater hypercar, which will be the natural successor to the McLaren P1 and the legendary McLaren F1 before that. With over 1,000bhp, the BP23 will be more powerful than the Senna, but being McLaren's ultimate road car it is unlikely to match the Senna's track-focussed performance on a flying lap. Perhaps the Senna's ability to set new production car lap records will justify McLaren's bold nomenclature, but with its divisive looks and the BP23 in the pipeline there's still a question over whether it's special enough to carry that name.
Aug 13, 2017; Charlotte, NC, USA; Jordan Spieth tees off on the 10th hole during the final round of the PGA Championship at Quail Hollow Club. Rob Schumacher-USA TODAY Sports
By Andrew Both
CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - A major season that began with the Masters favourite falling down stairs ended with one of the game's best young players capturing the PGA Championship, a reminder of the ephemeral nature of the most unpredictable of sports.
Dustin Johnson was the focus of the golf world on the eve of the Masters, coming off three successive victories, having ascended to the world number one ranking and for a few months an unstoppable juggernaut.
Four months later, Johnson is almost a peripheral figure and Justin Thomas is the talk of the town, though the latter barely figured in discussions on the eve of the PGA Championship at Quail Hollow which finished on Sunday.
Instead, the media was obsessed with Jordan Spieth's quest to surpass Tiger Woods as the youngest man to complete the career grand slam, while Rory McIlroy was the pre-tournament favourite, at least in the eyes of those who like to place money on the outcome.
But Spieth was never a factor at Quail Hollow, while McIlroy ended the week saying he might take an extended break in an effort to deal with pain in his back and left arm.
How do you make sense of it all? It's golf, a sport where almost every major offers a different cast of lead characters, and nobody takes the starring role more than occasionally.
“We won one of the majors,” said British Open champion Spieth, the 'we' referring to himself and his caddie.
“I understand that's a great year in the majors. If I did this every year, I would go down as the greatest player ever to have played the game.
“Winning them is so difficult you can have a fantastic year without winning a major. Look at what Tiger (Woods) did in 2013. He won five events, including a Players Championship (but did not win a major).”
Masters champion Sergio Garcia does not need to be told how difficult it is to win a major. The former teenage phenomenon was 0-for-73 until he beat Justin Rose in a playoff at Augusta.
“I did think about am I ever going to win one?” Garcia said after putting on the prized green jacket. “I've had so many good chances and either I lost them or someone has done something extraordinary to beat me. So it did cross my mind.”
Brooks Koepka blew away the field in the final round to win the U.S. Open at Erin Hills, while Spieth produced an astonishing finish -- five-under over a four-hole stretch -- to edge Matt Kuchar at the British Open.
The PGA Championship, which plodded along laboriously for three days, suddenly came to life on the back nine on Sunday, with five tied for the lead at one stage before 24-year-old Thomas emerged triumphant.
Golf fans must now wait eight long months for the next major, during which time the spotlight will turn again to Irishman McIlroy and his quest to become the sixth man to complete the modern grand slam.
So who will be the next player to join the major champions club -- Hideki Matsuyama? Rickie Fowler? Jon Rahm?
Maybe it will be one of that trio, but it just as likely to be someone barely on the radar right now. That's golf.

A statement issued through a spokesman Wednesday says Weinstein's lawyers decided there wasn't enough time to prepare him to testify. They say he learned the specific charges and the accusers' identities only after turning himself on Friday, with a deadline set for Wednesday afternoon to testify or not.
Looks like congratulations are in order for Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta stars Joseline Hernandez and Stevie J on the birth of their baby girl!
After a tumultuous year, Bonnie Bella was born on December 28, just a few days before 2017, and hopefully a new start for her parents.
The near-constant drama between Joseline and Stevie J pretty much needs no introduction if you watch Love & Hip Hop Atlanta online.
Or even if you don't watch it, in all likelihood.
To sum up: Joseline and Stevie were together for a long time. They were never married, even if they referred to each other as spouses.
Then they broke up this year … after Joseline said she was pregnant and Stevie is a deadbeat child molester who disavowed the baby.
She also said she took a polygraph to prove he watches gay porn. Yeah … things got so bad that Stevie threatened a defamation lawsuit …
… only to make peace with her last month.
In early December, he revealed he is in fact Bella's father, and was over the moon about it, in an Instagram post that was beyond touching.
And, typically for the couple, short-lived.
Not even 24 hours later,
“The plan would fund projects inspired by the island's unique features: its name; its “vantage point” amid an iconic bridge and two great cities, surrounded by an inland sea; its history as a site of innovation — a world's fair, an early nexus of commercial aviation, a military installation; and its environmental and ecological conditions. Projects will be solicited from local, national and international artists.”

Here's a gorgeous photo of clownfish, which just won the photographer, Qin Ling of Canada, an award in the Behaviour category at the Underwater Photographer of the Year competition (click to enlarge) – you can see all the winners here.
Ling's photo is entitled ‘Your home and my home'. Look closely at these Nemos. Look at their mouths. Those little eyes peeking out. They are not drawn on, as PCC(E) first suggested, nor are they Photoshopped. And they are not babies. They are isopods (like pillbugs or woodlice), which are parasitic. They eat the fish's tongue, and then replace it, sitting in there, presumably getting first dibs on the food as it comes in. They occasionally turn up on people's dinner plates when folk order fish and get a crustacean chaser.
The photography judge said: “Six eyes all in pin-sharp focus, looking into the lens of the author … this was one of my favourite shots of the entire competition.”
Isn't nature wonderful?

The NFL and American Football Coaches Association have reached an agreement to change the May 16th rule, a league source told NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport on Friday.
The new agreement, which comes into effect with the 2018 NFL Draft, permits all rookie players, whether enrolled in school or not, to begin their NFL careers on a mutually agreed upon date on or about May 16. The rule change allows all players to begin football activities with their respective NFL teams at the same time in an effort to create a more equal competitive environment.
NFL Network's Tom Pelissero first reported the anticipated agreement earlier this week.
According to league, players attending a Rookie Football Development Program, who are enrolled in school, and whose final examinations have not concluded, will be provided the following opportunities to continue their education.
» A rookie player who is enrolled only in online courses must be allotted sufficient time to continue and complete his course requirements (i.e., study, take exams, including any online final exams, and complete any required assignments).
» A rookie player who is enrolled in non-online classes must be allotted sufficient time to continue and complete course requirements (i.e., study, take exams, and complete any required assignments) and must be allowed to return to campus at least 36 hours prior to his first scheduled final examination. The player cannot return to the club until the completion of his final examinations.
» A rookie player who participated in the most recently completed college football season as a graduate student, or who graduates or completes his coursework early, may participate fully in any activities at a club's facilities beginning May 16.
The player's academic progress will be monitored jointly by the NFL club's player engagement director and the school's academic supervisors. Furthermore, a rookie player may elect to remain in school until the conclusion of his final examinations. No NFL club employee may indicate to the player that the Rookie Football Development Program is mandatory or attempt to persuade the player to leave school.
The NFL implemented the original rule in 1990 "to protect student-athletes who have remained in school to complete their schoolwork," rather than pressuring players to drop out of school and join their new clubs, according to the league's football operations website. However, none of the small number of players impacted last year was even enrolled in classes, one of the people said. The NFL and AFCA have been working together to find a sensible solution.
The NFL's operations website said players from six schools with exams after June 1 were affected last year: Stanford, Washington, Northwestern, Oregon, Oregon State and UCLA.

Reported Liverpool target Mohamed Salah is being pursued by "an English club", Roma sporting director Monchi has confirmed.
Egypt winger Salah has been heavily linked with a switch to Anfield and a second crack at the Premier League after his spell at Chelsea fell flat.
Monchi was speaking at the unveiling news conference of new Roma head coach Eusebio Di Francesco and was bullish over ensuring the former Sassuolo boss will have a strong squad to work with.
"Roma have no intention of selling players but want to build the best possible squad so Eusebio can achieve the best targets," he said when quizzed over the futures of Salah and Germany defender Antonio Rudiger – purportedly a prime target for Di Francesco's predecessor Luciano Spalletti in his new role with Inter.
"There is an interest from an English club and an offer for Momo and we'll decide what price to set depending on the circumstances.
"There are no offers for Rudiger and there's no chance that he'll go.
"As I've said before, Roma is not a supermarket. We're starting from the second place we just achieved, and we'll fight for our goals.
"If someone leaves, he'll have to be replaced well. There are no open talks apart from Salah."
On the coaching front, former Sevilla man Monchi is delighted that the recruitment process went perfectly to plan.
"For Roma and for me in particular it is a very happy day, the return of one of our own," he said.
"After Luciano said he would go away my goal was clear – Eusebio had to be here," he said.

A Harrogate charity has received a “wedge” of money thanks to the fundraising efforts of a Welsh golf society.
Disability Action Yorkshire is £3,665 better off following a year of the activity by members of the Talacre Beach Golf Society.
Formed in 2000, the club captain for the year has the privilege of selecting which charity they will be supporting via a host of activities, culminating in a golf day at Rhuddlan Golf Club, followed by an evening of entertainment including a raffle and auction.
This year's captain, Stephen Paul, chose Disability Action Yorkshire as his brother-in-law Ian Slattery is a long-standing resident of its Claro Road residential care home.
Items under the hammer included signed football shirts and a week-long stay in a lodge at the caravan park where all the members of the golf society first met.
Jackie Snape, Disability Action Yorkshire Chief Executive, said: We are incredibly grateful to Stephen and his Talacre Golf Society colleagues for choosing our charity and raising such magnificent sum for us. Like all charities, we rely on the generosity of grant giving organisations, businesses and individuals to help us continue with the work we do in supporting disabled people across the Harrogate District.

Lahore - Islamabad Police Green beat Islamabad Police Blue by 1-0 in a friendly football match held at the Police Line Headquarters.
According to information made available here on Tuesday, Inspector General of Police Jan Muhammad appreciated the efforts of Sports Officer Sub-Inspector M Ayub and Vice Sports Officer ASI Tahir Mehmud for holding the event in a successful manner. He hoped that such healthy activities will continue in coming days. “Sports activities are very crucial for a healthy society, which not only promotes environment of competition but also inculcates the spirit to counter tough situation, said IGP Jan Muhammad and added: “Policemen feel exhausted from long duties and such event will help entertain them and provide them opportunity to demonstrate their sports skills.”
Offseason stories are inevitably dominated by what's new: coaching changes, player acquisitions and draft picks. But the biggest area for growth on each roster comes from within. This week, I'll take a look at one homegrown talent from each team who could provide a huge boost by taking the next step in his development, beginning today with AFC clubs.
For the purposes of this exercise, I'll only look at players on their rookie contracts that each organization needs to step up.
Baltimore Ravens: Marlon Humphrey, cornerback
Outgoing general manager Ozzie Newsome's love for Alabama players could pay off again with Humphrey, the Ravens' 2017 first-round pick. After beginning his rookie season as the team's third cornerback, he capably stepped in for Baltimore's No. 1 cornerback, Jimmy Smith, in five starts down the stretch, allowing only six yards on nine targets in a game against the Steelers. Humphrey has a knack for breaking up plays at the last second, helping him to rank among the five best cornerbacks last season in passer rating, according to Pro Football Focus.
Unlike most of this list, Humphrey doesn't need to improve as much as back up his performance over an entire season. If he does that, he'll replace Smith, coming off a torn left Achilles tendon, as the team's top cornerback for good.
Buffalo Bills: Zay Jones, wide receiver
Jones' jagged rookie campaign has been trumped by a rockier offseason. Last year's No. 37 overall pick incurred a felony vandalism charge, which was later dropped, sandwiched between shoulder surgery and a knee surgery that will keep him off the field during OTAs.
This is usually the part of a fledging player's career where he gets buried on the depth chart and needs to earn his spot back on the field after getting 791 snaps on rookie scholarship. But the Bills need Jones to play because their wideout depth chart might be the NFL's worst. Once he's healthy, the East Carolina product will need to cut down on his drops and do a better job coming up with contested catches, two factors in why he finished with the NFL's second-lowest "catch percentage" in 2017 for anyone with more than 50 targets, per PFF.
Cincinnati Bengals: Joe Mixon, running back
No one runs quite like Joe Mixon, yet his 3.52 yards-per-carry average as a rookie could not look more pedestrian. Mixon learned the hard way that trying to turn every inside run into something worthy of a YouTube highlights compilation can be counterproductive in the NFL. (Especially when running behind a shoddy line.) By Week 17 against the Ravens, however, Mixon was finishing runs better and taking what the defense gave him more often.
Andy Dalton has proven he'll rise and fall based on the talent around him. Mixon has the undeniable game to make Dalton and the entire Bengals offense better.
Cleveland Browns: Jabrill Peppers, safety
Sashi Brown's final first-round draft pick, Peppers has most notably contributed to society as the subject of Twitter jokes about how deep he was asked to play last season.
Embattled defensive coordinator Gregg Williams is moving Peppers closer to the line of scrimmage this year at strong safety, which should better suit Peppers' skill set. He's the only holdover starter in a remodeled secondary, one more potential arrow in every Sashi Truther's quiver.
Denver Broncos: Garett Bolles, offensive tackle
All of John Elway's best-laid plans to improve the Broncos offense will fall flat if the team doesn't protect Case Keenum better than it did Trevor Siemian a year ago. The key might be getting better play out of Elway's first-round pick from a year ago.
Bolles was taken 20th overall to end the revolving door of left tackles for Denver this decade. He showed toughness in playing 1,106 snaps through injuries, but finished No. 73 out of 83 qualifiers according to PFF's pass-protecting metrics. Only one tackle in football drew more penalties. Already 26 years old, Bolles was selected so high in part because he was believed to be close to a finished product. The Broncos sure hope that's not true.
Houston Texans: Will Fuller, wide receiver
The sample size of games Deshaun Watson and Fuller started together is like me: small, yet intoxicating. Four games, 13 catches, 279 yards and seven (!) touchdowns. Extend that out for a season and Fuller would pass Randy Moss in the record books. Extend it out for six games with Tom Savage and Fuller didn't score or top 45 yards in a game again.
After two seasons, it remains an open question whether Fuller is anything more than a one-trick pony as a deep threat. (Or whether he needs to be when that trick is so valuable.) On an offense perilously barren of weapons after DeAndre Hopkins, the Texans need Fuller healthy and ready to take on the No. 2 mantle for an entire year.
Indianapolis Colts: Quincy Wilson, cornerback
The Colts made Wilson a healthy scratch for much of his rookie season, with defensive coordinator Ted Monachino openly calling him "immature." Wilson acknowledged he was not in shape last offseason and coasted in practice, per the Indianapolis Star. But when he finally played in December, Wilson did enough in four starts to make the Colts believers again. He should play because the Colts don't have other options and because this is a defense begging for someone, anyone to stand out.
Jacksonville Jaguars: Blake Bortles, quarterback
The rest of the Jaguars roster has already stepped up; they are just waiting for their quarterback to join them. Bortles made meaningful strides last season, but it wasn't his best year (that was 2015) and it wasn't remotely consistent. His breakthrough playoff games against Pittsburgh and New England were preceded by a crucial three-game stretch that included five interceptions and a completion percentage of 55.1.
The Jags' homegrown defensive picks like Myles Jack and Yannick Ngakoue made massive strides in 2017. The offensive line is far more stable. Even perennial fan punchline Marqise Lee earned a second contract. At times, it seems like the Jaguars believe in Bortles more than Bortles believes in himself. It's his turn to repay that belief because just running back his level of play from a year ago isn't going to be enough.
Kansas City Chiefs: Dee Ford, outside linebacker
The Chiefs found another budding star up front in defensive end Chris Jones. If Ford could provide another edge-rushing complement to Justin Houston, the maligned Chiefs defense would really be cooking with gas.
Ford, coming off back surgery, might only be on the roster because his $8.7 million salary was guaranteed for injury. Only one year removed from a 10-sack campaign, a revived Ford could be the biggest x-factor in Kansas City. There just isn't another player on the roster with the potential to provide what Ford can bring to the table.
Los Angeles Chargers: Dan Feeney and Forrest Lamp, guards
When the Chargers drafted these two interior linemen in Rounds 2 and 3 last year, a lot of football takesmen like me who wanted to sound smart lauded the approach. A commitment to the big uglies was just what this team needed!
Fast forward one year to find Lamp still recovering from a torn ACL and Feeney coming off a season where he graded well below average as a pass protector, per PFF. I want Philip Rivers to have nice things and getting more production up front from his young linemen would be a step in the right direction.
Miami Dolphins: DeVante Parker, wide receiver
Puff pieces about Parker's potential are as predictable as the summer solstice. That excitement often dissipates once the first nagging injury strikes, as Jarvis Landry and even Kenny Stills proved to be far more reliable receivers the last two years.
With Landry gone, the Dolphins are hoping that Parker's strong finish to 2016, when he was catching passes from a healthy Ryan Tannehill, was a sign of a great partnership to come. Parker and coach Adam Gase's entire offense is running out of time to look as good on the field as it regularly does in summer newspapers.
New England Patriots: Malcom Brown, defensive tackle
The Patriots' 2015 first-round pick is undeniably an asset. Bill Belichick drafted Brown to control the running game and he's improved every season as a solid starter. But Brown's pedigree, age (24) and stretches of brilliant play hint at much more being possible.
New England has a raft of young starters like Trey Flowers and Shaq Mason about to hit free agency. If Brown can raise his level to bonafide star status this season, the defensive tackle will make Belichick regret not using the fifth-year option on his rookie contract.
New York Jets: Darron Lee, linebacker
Lee was one of those players draftniks swooned over by saying he'd be a "plug-and-play starter" for the next decade. After two years of uninspiring play in pass coverage, it's hard to imagine the Jets signing up for another contract if Lee doesn't improve. He hasn't shown the ideal physicality for his position or enough athleticism to make up for it. He's serviceable, but the Jets expected more.
Still only 23 years old, there is time for Lee to evolve into the player Mike Maccagnan expected when he selected Lee one round ahead of Christian Hackenberg.
Oakland Raiders: Karl Joseph, safety
Joseph hasn't quite delivered yet on his pre-draft hype, especially as a big hitter. Undersized when he has to cover tight ends, it's believed that new defensive coordinator Paul Guenther will line up Joseph as a deep safety more often, like he did in college.
Guenther has a great track record coaching up the secondary, which is much needed for a Raiders group as unproven as any in football. They have some high draft picks like Gareon Conley and Obi Melifonwu, two players who are, like Joseph, still trying to translate some dazzling college tape to the pro level.
Pittsburgh Steelers: Bud Dupree, outside linebacker
Steelers fans and coaches have been waiting for Dupree to break out for years. I'm not sure whether to be more surprised that the Steelers picked up his fifth-year option for 2019 or that he has no real competition after a season where he finished ranked 106th out of 110 edge-rusher qualifiers in Pro Football Focus' grading.
The legacy of Pittsburgh's pass rushers over the last two decades hangs over Dupree, as do his occasional streaks of brilliance that get hopes up. The Steelers have supported Dupree's status through words and actions. They still believe they haven't seen his best.
Tennessee Titans: Corey Davis, wide receiver
Davis is not just the Titans' No. 1 receiver by default or by his draft status, although the team didn't take him No. 5 overall last year to sit on the bench. Davis should be Marcus Mariota's top target because there's no one else on the roster who can come close to combining Davis' ability to outleap defenders and then outrun them in the open field. It's asking a lot for a 23-year-old from Western Michigan with 517 career snaps to be the top target of an offense, but asking too much of young men is basically what the NFL is all about.

Dubai. What an adventure. It's definitely a grandiose and spectacular place.
Architecturally, you'd be hard-pressed to find a city so diverse and impressive, with the world's largest tower, malls, a Ferris wheel and an indoor theme park.

Dubai is also known for having the world's largest parade of horses, the longest urban zipline and the largest solar power project — essentially, it seems like everything has to be bigger and better.
All the same, it's what makes the city so impressive to see. The city is quite spread out, so visiting different attractions was almost like travelling to different cities.
It was difficult for me to fully grasp Dubai until my gyro-copter tour with Skydive Dubai — what a fantastic way to see the city and connect all its different parts.

Being an adrenaline junkie who loves to learn, the tour was just the right amount of excitement, though, at the same time, I felt like I was having tea in the sky with my driver, Frank.
It truly made me learn to love Dubai.
Here is the link if you want to join me in the sky:
Of course, during the trip I absolutely had to see all the main attractions.
We drove on the Palm Islands, where we saw the Atlantis Hotel and its aquarium. Completely man-made, the Palm is so sensational and impressive.
It has 73 km of beach (which is more than the actual coast) and houses, hotels, as well as a huge residential community.

Workers are now building the World Islands — a collection of islands made to resemble all the continents in the middle of the Arabian Sea.
There won't be a bridge, so I'm still unsure about how people will travel to-and-from the islands — maybe by submarine?
The Burj Al Arab – the Sail Hotel – was architecturally one of my favourites. It stands tall, alone and was so majestic.
Unlike Tiger Woods, I didn't get to hit golf balls from the heli-pad, though!

Kite Beach, which has a great view of the Sail Hotel, is a beautiful place to relax close to all the restaurants of La Mer.
Old Dubai, with its renown gold and spice souks, will bring you back in time and history to Dubai's origins.
Walking through the maze of shops, seeing all the gold and smelling the beautiful spices definitely heightens your senses — and your patience; you can't go a minute without someone trying to entice you into their shop to see their amazing souvenirs.
Luckily for me, two items on my bucket list are in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and I got to do both on this trip.

One was visiting the Burj Khalifa, the tallest tower in the world. I stepped onto the high-speed elevator, travelling 10 meters per second, and had tea in the lounge on the 123rd floor.
The view from so high up truly shows how the desert and city come together as one.
The second thing I wanted to do was an hour away in Abu Dhabi: the Sheikh Zayed Mosque.
It's one of the largest in the world and is a place of worship for over 40,000 people each day.

It was quite peaceful, surrounded by reflective pools where you can sit and take in the mosque's 82 domes, 1,000 columns and endless beautiful, intricate detail.
It also houses the world's largest handwoven carpet, which lies in the same room as three 24-karat gold chandeliers that have millions of Swarovski crystals.
Of course, a trip to Dubai is never complete without a day in the desert.
The thrill of quad biking through the red sand and dune bashing in a 4×4 is incomparable.
It's not for the faint of heart (or stomach!) but you can also sand board or enjoy a traditional camel ride.
The tour included dinner and entertainment in a Bedouin camp, which was the perfect way to end the evening — and my Arabian adventure.
Oh, and if you're ever feeling a little homesick, you can stop by a Tim Hortons — there are now three locations in Dubai!
Here are some fun Dubai facts:
A mill nearly as old as Canada must be sold if it is to survive, its owner says, since the spring flood has just washed through it, and through her hopes of creating a bed and breakfast.
The mill on Brennan's Creek in Old Killaloe has been there since 1870. Owner Anette Clough says it's part country home, part storehouse of history.
"It has a pile of stuff in there: Manual wooden planes, sickles, big wagon wheels, things that fit around a horse's neck." There is equipment for sending flour down a chute into bags, and flour sifters, all pushed to one side of the building.
The other side is renovated: a three-bedroom home on the top two levels, and a smaller apartment with a separate entrance.
She and her soon-to-be ex-husband bought it about four years ago. The couple eventually split; she moved out two years ago and her husband left last fall. The mill has been unoccupied since then.
"I would love, love, love to keep the place. It's an incredible building. I would really love to turn it into a bed and breakfast," she said Monday.
Previous owners blasted out bedrock and put in a 50-kilowatt turbine that generates electricity for sale to the provincial grid. At least it did until a flood three years ago. Clough figures the turbine itself is still fine, but the turbine room may need electrical repairs.
"We almost had it ready to turn on, we had all the electricals checked and cleaned, and then we got flooded three years ago. And that is because we didn't have enough stop logs pulled out of the dam," she said.
With the couple splitting up, she can't afford to invest more money in repairs that are needed in one foundation wall, or in putting the turbine system back into shape.
It's a lovely setting, with a pond behind the dam, walking trails and a foot bridge to the far side of the creek.
"I haven't put it on the market yet because I haven't been wanting to sell it because I really love it. But looking at what happened this year..."
Last week, the rising runoff water spilled past the dam and through the first floor of the mill, in one door and out another.
Clough said a structural engineer looked at the mill since then, recommending repairs to one foundation wall and an overall review of the building when water levels drop.
Stop logs work like plugs in a drain, meaning they can be dropped into position in a dam or lifted out to control how much water can flow through. They are intended to be lifted out in fall, so that the spring flood has an opening where it can rush right through. But the logs are heavy, and Clough and her husband couldn't remove them all last fall, so the dam was partially blocked. Then spring came.
The result is familiar to anyone who has tried to flush a blocked toilet: Water backs up and overflows. It's now receding.
The Killaloe Post, an online magazine that's largely the work of local photographer Lynn Flokstra, recently traced the history of the mill that was built by an Irish immigrant in 1849, and rebuilt after a major fire in 1870.
"At its peak the mill was powered by one wood- and one water-powered engine and was in operation 24 hours a day grinding the wheat harvest for local farmers," the Post notes. "When flour was no longer profitable they ground grain for livestock feed. With the rise of national commercial mills local grain milling became a thing of the past."
The mill had a second life sawing and planing lumber from the 1940s until 1968.
If no one maintains the building, Clough says, "it could get worse, and then the town and the area lose something that has been there forever and is really amazing."

Verizon will no longer be the exclusive U.S. mobile carrier for NFL games — instead, the telco is gaining rights to live-stream gridiron action to any mobile, web and connected-TV device nationwide under a new five-year pact with the league.
Verizon will pay the NFL more than $2 billion under the new deal, the Wall Street Journal reported. The renewed and expanded pact will run through the 2022-23 season. Under the prior deal, Verizon has paid around $250 million per year ($1 billion total over the four-year span).
The new Verizon-NFL deal covers all in-market and national games, including preseason, regular season, and playoff games — including the Super Bowl — available to anyone in the U.S., on any mobile carrier or network provider. The package includes live-streaming rights to the NFL's Thursday, Sunday and Monday Night Football games, and the Sunday day games that air on TV in viewers' local market.
Verizon's rights extend to mobile phones across all carriers and across Oath properties, including Yahoo, Yahoo Sports, AOL, and Go90. According to the company, its mobile and digital properties reach more than 200 million monthly unique users in the U.S. The new NFL deal also grants Verizon rights to sell select in-game ad inventory on its platforms.

Essentially, Verizon is getting U.S. multiplatform live-streaming rights to the entire NFL schedule — with the exception of Sunday afternoon out-of-market games. Those remain with AT&T's DirecTV, which has locked up the NFL Sunday Ticket package through the end of the 2022-23 season.
“We're making a commitment to fans for Verizon's family of media properties to become the mobile destination for live sports,” Lowell McAdam, chairman and CEO of Verizon Communications, said in a statement. “The NFL is a great partner for us and we are excited to take its premier content across a massive mobile scale so viewers can enjoy live football and other original NFL content where and how they want it.”
TV broadcast rights, however, are still where the NFL makes its mint. The league rakes in an estimated $7 billion per year from TV deals, including with CBS, Fox, NBC and ESPN, representing about half its overall revenue.
The full extent of the new Verizon-NFL deal won't go into effect until the 2018-19 season, but certain elements will roll out this postseason. Specifically, NFL postseason games will be available on Yahoo, Yahoo Sports, and Go90 (along with the NFL Mobile app) beginning no later than the conference championships on Jan. 21.
NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, in a statement, praised Verizon as a partner and emphasized that the deal will extend the league's games to any mobile device “regardless of carrier.” Verizon has carried NFL games on mobile since 2010.
In addition to the expanded availability of live games, the new NFL-Verizon agreement encompasses mobile access to NFL highlights, coverage of NFL throughout the week and year, and a set of jointly developed original content (like virtual-reality experiences). Verizon has global distribution rights to the on-demand content, while the live games are U.S.-only.
Under the pact, Verizon also will continue to be the official wireless sponsor of the NFL while the telco's media brands like Yahoo will become official NFL sponsor brands as well. Also, starting with the 2018 NFL season, Verizon will become the presenting sponsor of the Pro Bowl and the NFL Scouting Combine.
Verizon formed the Oath digital-media group this summer, combining AOL and Yahoo under one umbrella, after closing the $4.5 billion acquisition of Yahoo in June 2017.
The NFL has divvied up the rights to its crown jewels — the live games — across TV and digital partners for the last several years. This past season, it granted Amazon worldwide streaming rights to the 11-game “Thursday Night Football” lineup for a reported $50 million (after Twitter had “TNF” in 2016). And Verizon paid the league around $20 million to live-stream a single regular-season game (the Sept. 24 Ravens-Jaguars meeting in London), paying a premium because it wasn't broadcast nationally in the U.S.
Verizon's $2 billion NFL rights deal comes as tech players including Facebook, Amazon, and Twitter are looking to spend big bucks to bring more sports to their digital services. Facebook is said to be particularly aggressive: The social giant is seeking to hire an exec who will have a budget of a “few billion dollars” for sports-rights deals, Sports Business Journal reported last month.

Despite being with the Winnipeg Jets for a big portion of this season, Eric Comrie is increasingly on the outside looking in when it comes to the team's goaltending future.
The 22-year-old, in his third full season as a professional, has been called up three times by the Jets in 2017-18, spending a total of more than a month with the club.
Despite that, however, he's made just one start and his stock has fallen.
He's quickly gone from being considered the starter of the future to either an AHL starter or a guy who comes up just to warm the bench and wear a ball cap – and he's become not even the first option for that role.
Is this his fault, or is he simply a victim of circumstance?
It seems to be a little of both.
Scouts' Expectations for Comrie High
Comrie has drawn high praise from a variety of insiders and scouts.
“He's one of the best young goaltenders I've seen in the last five years. I want to put him right up there with a guy like Andrei Vasilevskiy,” former NHL goalie Steve Valiquette said last spring in an interview with TSN 1290 Winnipeg.
When Comrie played for the Tri-City Americans, he was touted by Kevin Won for his “aggressive style,” “competitive nature,” and “ability to make game-changing stops.”
Through Comrie's first two seasons with the AHL club, though, his numbers didn't really reflect the high praise he received. His goals-against average hovered around 3.00 and his save percentage was just above .900.
Those numbers can partly be attributed to the deplorable defense the Moose iced in front of him in their first two seasons since returning from St. Johns. The team was transient, very young, and regularly outclassed by their opponents, going 55-78-9-10.
Mason, Hutchinson, Hellebuyck's Resurgence and the Evolving Goalie Landscape
After Connor Hellebuyck and Michael Hutchinson's shaky 2016-17 NHL campaigns, it appeared the door was about to swing wide open for Comrie.
However, if the door was open, it was slammed just as quickly by Kevin Cheveldayoff, who went out and acquired Steve Mason on a two-year contract. That move signified another year in the minors for Comrie.
It looked like Comrie was pegged to be the indisputable AHL starter this season as a result, but he found himself locked in a battle for starts even there.
Michael Hutchinson, who was bitter about being sent down in the wake of Mason's signing, came down to the Moose with a chip on his shoulder. Despite doing his best impression of a mime and his refusal to talk to the Winnipeg media, Hutchinson put up video-game numbers with the Moose, going 15-2-1 with a goals-against average of under 2.00.
A Chance to Take the Crease in Florida
However, when Steve Mason – who's had a barrage of bad luck in his first year with the Jets – suffered a concussion against San Jose in late November and was forced onto the shelf, Comrie got called up.
He bided his time for nearly two weeks before getting his first start of the season – and the second of his NHL career – on Dec. 7 against the Panthers.
It didn't go well.
Comrie gave up 5 goals on 35 shots, couldn't control his rebounds, and didn't play a sound positional game in a 6-4 loss.
The old saying goes “you only get one chance to make a first impression.”
Comrie hasn't seen NHL game action since.
Back From Whence You Came
Comrie was sent back down after Mason returned in mid-December. However, he suffered an injury of his own and only started one game for the Moose in December, with Hutchinson getting the bulk of the work there.
Perhaps that's part of the reason that when Mason suffered another concussion, the Jets came calling for Hutchinson, not Comrie, despite the former's rocky relationship with Jets' brass.
Left behind, Comrie hit a rough patch but still managed to go 4-3 in January thanks to a much improved, high-octane Moose club first in the Central Division.
More Goalie Woes for the Jets
The goalie injuries continued to pile up for the Jets, though. Hutchinson also suffered a concussion, so Comrie, the last man standing, was recalled in February.
However, it was clear Comrie was simply a body on the bench, a last resort there only to play if every Winnipeg fan's worst nightmare came true and Hellebuyck went down too.
The Jets played six games during the time Comrie was up. He played in zero of them. Clearly, Paul Maurice has not been impressed enough with Comrie's game to consider him a legitimate number-two man in the NHL, instead choosing to ride Hellebuyck.
Comrie's with the Jets right now on his third call up – Mason suffered a knee injury and Hutchinson another concussion – but, once again, hasn't played any minutes. When either Hutchinson or Mason returns, expect Comrie to be the man on the other side of the glass again.
Eric Comrie's Contract and Career With the Jets
With Comrie's entry-level deal done after this season, his future with the Jets is cloudy at best.
He's a restricted free agent, but will the Jets re-up him? Will he even want to re-sign?
He was expected to push Hellebuyck for the starting role, but with Hellebuyck proving to be one of the NHL's top tenders, that's obviously no longer the case.
Comrie's future with the Jets really boils down to what the organization feels they have in their other two goaltenders apart from Hellebuyck and Comrie. For example, if they feel Steve Mason's frequent trips to the infirmary represent a one-off, bad-luck season or a recurring, deal-breaking issue. If they feel they can repair their strained relationship with Michael Hutchinson.
One thing's for certain: if Comrie does re-sign with the Jets this summer, he'll be donning a Moose uniform come fall.
His time as a prospect is quickly running out and so is his window to be a starting goaltender – at least in the Jets organization. He's been buried on the depth chart through a combination of his own inconsistency and circumstances beyond his control, and he may have to pack his bags if he wants an NHL career.
In an earlier article on the second postponement of US-India 2+2 dialogue, I had posited that it does not reflect a degradation in the current state of bilateral ties. The foundational pillars of this relationship — shared values, security interests and apprehensions — remain strong and immune from political interference. Ergo, to interpret the delay (likely a scheduling issue) as indicative of a "setback" or even a "snub" is premature and alarmist.
That said, if dovetailing of strategic and security interests ensure stability in bilateral relations, it has to be complemented by mutual goodwill at a political level for ties to remain wrinkle-free and grow progressively closer. This is especially true of relationships that still carry traces of past baggage and even more so with respect to India, whose behaviour on the international stage is still largely determined by the memory of its colonial past.
As Sumit Ganguly and Manjeet S Pardesi of Indiana University in Bloomington note in their paper Explaining Sixty Years of India's Foreign Policy for Taylor & Francis Online, "…the memories of colonial rule contributed to a political culture which privileged the concept of national autonomy. The desire to maintain the greatest possible independence in the conduct of India's foreign affairs was a sentiment that pervaded the country. Public opinion, to the limited extent that it was concerned with foreign affairs, would find any notion of deference to external powers to be intolerable…"
It is incumbent on both the US and India to contextualise this reality and weave it into a burgeoning and fruitful alliance, which means notwithstanding structural compatibilities, the relationship requires constant and intense political nurturing. As JNU professor Rajesh Rajagopalan observes in ORF, "even after the US and India began building a strategic partnership, India was extremely sensitive about the nature of the relationship. India was the high-maintenance partner and the US has generally been much more careful and considerate."
It is here that US-India partnership is headed for a period of short-term turbulence because unlike previous US administrations, the Donald Trump White House is not worried about the bigger picture. It has introduced new metrics into the relationship — such as reciprocal trade — and has sought to define partnerships (not just with India) solely through achievements on that scale without commensurate allowance for depth or convergence in other areas.
Author Alyssa Ayres, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former deputy assistant secretary for South Asia in the Barack Obama administration, writes in Hindustan Times: "Trump foreign policy can zero in on an arbitrarily-chosen economic metric, fixate on it, and no strategic concern or history of alliance strength can compensate."
This is why Trump has made a big deal out of US trade deficit with India, which — at $24 billion — is a pittance compared to Washington's trade deficit with Beijing. Reports say New Delhi's surplus has reduced by nearly $1 billion this year while overall trade has jumped by $13 billion to touch $125 billion in 2017-18. In the same period, US trade deficit with China grew by over $25 billion to about $375 billion.
In Trump's bipolar world, these caveats are meaningless. He has made US-made luxury motorcycles the focal point of his tirade and has mocked Narendra Modi repeatedly over high tariffs on these imports which in any case won't amount to even one per cent of bilateral trade. Harley-Davidson, the Wisconsin-based firm, was itself reportedly taken aback by Trump's truculent stand but that didn't stop the US president from taking an unflattering public stand against the Indian prime minister.
And herein lies the epicenter of temporal turbulence that now afflicts the ties. Not unlike Trump, Modi places a lot of emphasis in striking a personal chord with heads of states. It is simultaneously his personal trait and belief. Modi has assiduously developed an image of a "strong leader" and finds it easier to take foreign policy equations out of the ambit of rigid bureaucratic structures and place it within a malleable, personalised context.
Modi also considers personal chemistry a far more effective tool in addressing and untying geopolitical knots. In this respect, his behaviour is consistent with other heads of states who similarly perceive themselves as "strong leaders" — such as Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin or even Donald Trump.
It may not be purely coincidental that the Doka La crisis was resolved not very long after Modi had an impromptu meeting with Xi on the sidelines of G20 summit in Hamburg. Equally, the Wuhan "informal summit", which has been interpreted as India's outreach towards China to lower the temperature in bilateral relations, was essentially a 'get-to-know-each-other' exercise (keeping aside the diplomats) driven by a belief that trust and mutual understanding between Modi and Xi will percolate down the ranks and remove some misunderstandings.
"We have paid reciprocal visits, met on multiple occasions, and reached many important consensuses over the past three years, which acted as a guidance to the positive development momentum of bilateral ties," Chinese state news agency Xinhua had quoted Xi as saying.
Similarly, Modi's Russia visit was as much aimed at addressing undercurrents of drift as striking a personal bond with Putin — a job in which he appears to have been successful. The Russian president reportedly turned "emotional" as Modi struck a chord and bid the prime minister farewell at the airport in a rare gesture.
The Chinese outreach seems to be resulting in similar dividends with Beijing lowering barriers on some Indian exports and reducing tarrifs and even sending a high-level PLA delegation to India to "build trust".
Similarly, the Reserve Bank of India has issued a licence to Bank of China to operate in India, which analysts say is the result of a promise made to Xi by Modi.
RBI has apparently issued a license to Bank of China to operate its first branch. This was a commitment made by PM Modi to Chinese President Xi, as per sources. — Devirupa Mitra (@DevirupaM) July 4, 2018
Not to place too big a stress on it, personal chemistry lies at the front and centre of Modi's foreign policy. That's why he wouldn't have taken kindly to Trump revealing details about the telephonic conversation over Harley-Davidson bikes which Modi must have assumed would be kept private. He'd be even less impressed at the mocking tone adopted by Trump at a public forum.
Though Modi has been careful not to have reacted to it (at least publicly), his subsequent "unexpectedly vigorous outreaches to China and Russia this year," as The Economist puts it, is interesting. Also notable is the gap between Modi and Jim Mattis' speech at the Shangri La dialogue where the prime minister hit out at US protectionism, adopted a balanced tone and refrained from mentioning "Quad" in his keynote address, qualifying that "India does not see the Indo-Pacific Region as a strategy or as a club of limited members."
Here, Modi's behaviour is of greater interest than Trump's because world leaders are slowly learning to interpret POTUS tantrums as the 'new normal' and beginning to take it in their stride. Modi's subtle but unmistakable positioning is indicative of a chill that has replaced the earlier warmth in Modi-Trump relationship. This lack of amity at the highest political level and little interaction between ministers on both sides (delay in 2+2 won't help) may bring into sharper focus the headwinds that face both countries on Russia and Iran.
These are not earth-shattering issues and nothing that both sets of administrations cannot sort out and yet these demand a degree of engagement that is missing at the moment. The world's largest and oldest democracies could have done without these wrinkles.
Universal tries to get back into the classic-monster biz with the help of Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe in this Alex Kurtzman-directed adventure.
Some have noted that Universal must hate to be opening Alex Kurtzman's The Mummy in the second week of Wonder Woman‘s run, with that hit sure to suck millions out of its box-office haul. But Wonder Woman isn't all bad for the newly launched “enterprise,” dubbed Dark Universe, with which the studio hopes to exploit characters it introduced way back in the 1920-'50s: After all, it proves that such a series of interrelated movies (like DC's “extended universe”) can still succeed after the well has been poisoned by outings so terrible any executive with taste would have pulled the plug. Sure, it's hard to muster anything like desire for another Dark Universe flick after seeing this limp, thrill-free debut. But who knows? Maybe shifting gears to a female protagonist in 2019's Bride of Frankenstein will do the trick.
Then again, the fact that Uni's recent D.U. hype mentions only the Bride's groom, to be played by Javier Bardem, may show it's more heavily invested in big-name dudes than in making heroes of women. Dudes like Russell Crowe, whose Dr. Jekyll apparently will be the glue holding these pictures together as a series. Or like Tom Cruise, who gave his all to one long-running franchise by reviving Mission: Impossible, and, judging from The Mummy, should perhaps not be asked to do so again.
Weirdly out of place here, Cruise brings little daring and less charm to the film, though to be fair to the actor, his character's a stiff: Nick Morton, an Army sergeant who secretly loots antiquities from Iraqi war zones, might have been a charismatic antihero in Drafts One or Five of a script credited to David Koepp, Christopher McQuarrie and Dylan Kussman (with story by Jon Spaihts, Alex Kurtzman and Jenny Lumet). But what made it to the screen is a watered-down version of “irresistible rogue” with all the irresistibility trimmed away.
Accompanied by partner in crime Chris Vail (Jake Johnson), Morton is in Iraq pursuing treasures promised on a map he stole from archaeologist Jenny Halsey (Annabelle Wallis of Peaky Blinders). Halsey catches up to Morton around the time his misadventures expose an ancient burial site, and she's none too happy that he seduced her just to steal that map. After some low-stakes bickering, the two find themselves in the presence of a sarcophagus buried in, um, a giant pool of mercury. It's an Egyptian coffin, interred far away in ancient Mesopotamia, so that'd be big news even before the gang grasps the supernatural nature of the desiccated corpse residing within.
To summarize: The body is that of Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella), who was the sole heir to Egypt's throne before her Pharaoh dad found a second wife and had a son. Furious that she wouldn't be Queen, she vowed revenge, killing all three and making a pact with the bad-news Egyptian god Set. But before she could sacrifice a lover, who was to become the god's human embodiment, she was captured and “mummified alive.” The ceremonial dagger with which she intended to make the sacrifice was split into two parts, putting its magic powers on hold until the about-to-wake-up Ahmanet can put the pieces together again.
Over in England, one piece of that dagger has just been found in a crypt dating back to the Second Crusade. It is taken by Crowe's Jekyll, who seems to be the Dark Universe's version of the Marvel movies' Nick Fury: a behind-the-scenes player who has been fighting all kinds of evil for a long time, and who pops up when screenplays need exposition or a tease for the next film in the franchise. (Where Fury had secrets of a military-industrial-complex sort, Jekyll has a monstrous alter ego he must continually take drugs to subdue.)
Somewhere between the discovery of the sarcophagus and the moment its inhabitant crawls out to start devouring the living, Ahmanet's immortal spirit develops a fixation on Morton, deciding he's “my chosen.” She gets into the poor jerk's mind, forcing him to help her reassemble that dagger. If he understood that she planned to kill him with it, Morton might put up a bit more resistance to the mind-control.
It's no surprise that the action to come has vastly more in common with the CGI bombast of the Brendan Fraser-starring Mummy films than the quiet, slow-creeping horror of the version Karl Freund directed in 1932. What is surprising is that this film's action makes one slightly nostalgic for the 1999 incarnation, or at least prompts one to ask if it wasn't maybe more fun than we gave it credit for. So much of the action takes place in monotonous half-light; so little of it displays even the ambition to show audiences something new — unless we count the Mummy's eyes, which have two irises each, for no apparent reason other than somebody thought that would look cool on a movie poster. The most involving scene by far shows Morton swimming through underwater crypts, trying to save Halsey from Ahmanet before he either drowns or is destroyed by the zombie warriors swimming behind him.
But that sequence lasts just a minute or two, and is immediately followed by a Morton/Mummy standoff in which Cruise fails, rather spectacularly, to wring a laugh out of a kiss-off line one hopes neither Koepp, nor McQuarrie, nor Kussman would admit to having written. It's the kickoff of a climax that requires more heroic self-sacrifice from Morton than we have any reason to believe he's capable of. Unless, that is, we have a financial interest in the sequel set up by Jekyll's longer-than-necessary final voiceover.

A fun event will be held it Hartlepool to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the town's HMS Trincomalee and the story of a vessel that played a key part in the Battle of Trafalgar.
HMS Pickle sailed 1,000 miles to be the first ship to bring back the news of Nelson's victory and death at the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805.
HMS Trincomalee
The famous feat has provided the inspiration for a night of folk music and navy tradition when the town's National Museum of the Royal Navy. Pickle Night is one of the most significant dates in the Royal Navy calendar.
Similar events will be taking place all over the country, also to mark the historic event.
It coincides with the 200th anniversary of HMS Trincomalee, one of Nelson's last commissioned frigates, which now takes pride of place at the National Museum of the Royal Navy in Hartlepool.
Events organiser Rachel Shepherd explained how Pickle Night is a less expensive and more accessible celebration than Trafalgar Night, which is not open to the general public.
HMS Pickle in Hartlepool
She said: “Traditionally, Trafalgar Night was for officers and Pickle Night was for the lower ranks.
“We are mimicking that and are holding both events.
“Pickle Night is a new event for us. We decided this is the right year to hold it with it being our bicentenary of HMS Trincomalee. “If it is a success it is something we will be looking to hold annually.
“We hope it will appeal to folk music fans but also people interested in the navy and naval traditions. “It is something that everyone can come along to.”
The event on Friday, November 3, at 6pm, will take place in the Quayside Coffee Shop alongside HMS Trincomalee and will include performances by well-known folk bands the Silver Shantymen and three-piece female vocal group Storiella.
Award-winning local butchers and bakery, Blackwell's of Norton will be offering a pie and mash supper and drinks will be available to buy at the bar.
Places are limited to around 50 and tickets cost £22 and include both entry to the event and a pie and mash supper.
Guests will be able to make donations towards the upkeep of HMS Trincomalee if they wish.

Iowa State tackle Jake Campos is even more anxious for the new season to begin.
The former West Des Moines Valley standout entered last season as the Cyclones most experienced offensive lineman. But a broken leg in fall camp ended his season before it began and Campos hopes to lead an improved offensive line.
“We are coming together more than I have seen from our lines in the past”, said Campos. “This group is a real tight knit group and everyone feeds off each other in a very positive way. I think we are going to do very well.”
With experience at quarterback, receiver and running back Campos says the Cyclones have the skill needed to make major strides.
“It is great to have those people because we have got some of the best playmakers in our conference ands all we have got to do is give them a chance and they will make us look real good”, added Campos. That's a real good thing to have as an offensive line.”
Iowa State opens September 2nd against Northern Iowa.
A unique department at Western University will be able to develop and grow research and teaching thanks to a massive donation from its namesake.

Aubrey Dan is donating $5 million to the DAN Department of Management and Organizational Studies.
The department began as a program in 2006 that was developed thanks to a $5-million donation from Dan.
“The fact is that the university has been so receptive throughout the years of wanting to make changes,” said Dan.
“Most importantly it's an investment to the students of their future. If nobody's going to invest … I mean, the government's not going to do it to this degree, in fact, they're depleting their investment — so really, the way I feel is that it is my obligation.”

The entrepreneur, philanthropist, and Broadway producer notes that management and organizational studies is relevant to almost everyone.
“Everybody who wants to get ahead in life eventually needs to become a manager — they're going to become a boss. Where do they learn? Most people learn by fire. If you actually give them the tools and the education and train them, they can be great leaders.”
Of the $5-million donation, $4.5 million is being matched by Western for a total investment of $9 million to create three endowed research chairs in the fields of consumer behaviour, change and innovation, and corporate governance.

Feb 2 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp has too many stores and its prices are too high, Wall Street analysts are starting to agree, as they seek to explain the company's slowing U.S. growth.
The world's biggest coffee chain now has more U.S. locations than McDonald's Corp but it has been struggling for more than a year to lure the traffic needed to deliver the growth that investors have come to expect.
Executives last week warned that Starbucks' 2018 same-store sales growth would be at the low end of its forecast. The chain reported a 2 percent U.S. quarterly same-store sales gain that fell short of expectations on flat holiday traffic. Two years ago, those sales jumped 9 percent.
Starbucks itself has offered a laundry list of reasons for the deceleration in its domestic business, including weak retail traffic, changes to its rewards program, bottlenecks from a crush of mobile orders, and holiday merchandise and drink specials that failed to “resonate” with customers.
Executives concede that Starbucks' U.S. afternoon business has dragged down results in its most important market.
Still, they say that Starbucks - which had 14,163 U.S. locations at year-end, 25 percent more than five years ago and 127 more than McDonald's - is not cannibalizing its own sales or losing share in a market crowded with coffee sellers ranging from independent cafes to fast-food chains and convenience stores.
Analysts disagree. A recent analysis of restaurant industry trends, retail traffic and other factors led Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore to solidify her view that “excess unit growth, at a time when Starbucks is reaching a more mature stage of growth, is the root cause” of the company's domestic woes.
“Rather than a litany of excuses, we believe this is best explained by overcapacity in the industry,” said John Zolidis, president of Quo Vadis Capital, a Paris-based boutique research firm. “Starbucks is contributing to the problem by opening new units.”
Credit Suisse analyst Jason West said the brew of stepped-up competition combined with Starbucks' recent opening of roughly 700 U.S. stores a year, is weighing on its “ability to re-accelerate growth.”
Starbucks said on Friday its new cafes perform well and bring more business to all nearby coffee shops, not just its own.
Proliferation of stores is not Starbucks' only problem, according to analysts. Zolidis also sees another troubling sign: “We believe the company has raised prices too much.”
Starbucks did not immediately comment on pricing.
McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts, owned by Dunkin' Brands Group Inc, have been holding down drink prices, said Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson, who analyzes 10 markets in the U.S. Northeast, including New York, Boston and Washington.
McDonald's - now selling $1 coffee and $2 small espresso drinks - has kept prices mostly flat for the last two years. Dunkin' Donuts' has raised prices by roughly 1 percent per year, while Starbucks has raised prices by about 3.5 percent each year, said Anderson, who added that the rivals may be peeling off some of Starbucks' less-affluent customers.

Last month, Queen Elizabeth II postponed her annual holiday train voyage to Sandringham Hall due to illness.
The Queen and Prince Philip made the trip by helicopter 24 hours later, and the delay was downplayed by royal sources who claimed that the monarch was simply waylaid by a bad cold.
But now it seems the Queen's illness may be more serious than we've been led to believe.
The 90-year-old was scheduled to participate in her final royal engagement of the holiday season on Sunday – a church service at Sandringham – but she wasn't feeling well enough to attend.
“Her Majesty The Queen will not attend Sunday worship at Sandringham today,” a statement from Buckingham Palace released yesterday read.
“The Queen does not yet feel ready to attend church as she is still recuperating from a heavy cold.”
A Palace spokesperson later went into slightly greater detail in response to a query from People magazine:
“Her Majesty The Queen will not attend Church at Sandringham this morning,” the statement read.
“The Queen continues to recover from a heavy cold and will stay indoors to assist with her recovery. Her Majesty will participate in the Royal Family Christmas celebrations during the day.”

Comedian Catherine Tate will reunite with her former Doctor Who co-star David Tennant as she joins the cast of cartoon comedy DuckTales.
She will voice the villainous Magica De Spell, arch nemesis to Tennant's Scrooge McDuck, in Disney's reboot of the series next year.
The original animation first launched 30 years ago, with more than 100 episodes produced between 1987 and 1990.
Magica De Spell, also known as the Sorceress of the Shadows, first made an appearance in the earlier 1961 comic book, Uncle Scrooge.
The series will see her attempt to exact an evil and elaborate revenge by infiltrating Scrooge's family with the help of her niece, Lena (Kimiko Glenn).
Known for her wide-ranging skills in voices and accents in her hit sketch show, The Catherine Tate Show, Tate starred as the Time Lord's right-hand Donna Noble in the hit BBC sci-fi drama between 2006 and 2010.
Broadchurch star Tennant will take on his role as the animated "trillionaire" for the first time in a TV movie special, entitled Woo-oo! next month.
The full series will then air in 2018 as Tennant also stars in the hotly anticipated show, Good Omens.
DuckTales will launch in the UK in early 2018 on Disney Channel and DisneyLife, following Woo-oo! on November 13.

Prince, also known as “The Purple One” is finally getting his very own Pantone color. Pantone and Prince's Estate announced today (August 14) that the late singer has his own purple hue, “Love Symbol #2,” which is named after the iconic symbol the singer used as an emblem for his name.

“The color purple was synonymous with who Prince was and will always be. This is an incredible way for his legacy to live on forever,” Troy Carter, entertainment adviser to Prince's Estate, said.
“We are honored to have worked on the development of Love Symbol #2, a distinctive new purple shade created in memory of Prince, ‘the purple one,'” added Laurie Pressman, vice president of the Pantone Color Institute. “A musical icon known for his artistic brilliance, Love Symbol #2 is emblematic of Prince's distinctive style. Long associated with the purple family, Love Symbol #2 enables Prince's unique purple shade to be consistently replicated and maintain the same iconic status as the man himself.”

The Duggars have been scrutinized and criticized many times throughout their years in the spotlight, sometimes for very good reason, and sometimes because those very good reasons have put the public on high alert for the slightest sign that something is amiss.
In the 19 months since news of the Josh Duggar sex scandals went public, the family's every social media post has been dissected by skeptical followers in search of indications that Jim Bob and Michelle's many, many children are still being mistreated.
The latest possible sign of trouble involves one of the couple's lesser-talked-about kids – 11-year-old Johannah:
As you can see, Johannah appears to have suffered some sort of minor injury not long before this photo was taken.
The image was posted on Instagram by Johannah's older sister Jill in celebration of her birthday back in October.
Jill made no mention of the sores on Johannah's forehead in her caption, but many fans expressed concerns in the comments section.
The matter was mostly forgotten until last week, when a new photo of Johannah showed that the mysterious marks have not yet healed.
The above image was posted on the family's official Facebook page, causing Duggar fans to speculated about the cause of …read more

More than 200 people have been contaminated or infected with a potentially deadly strain of drug-resistant fungus during outbreaks at UK hospitals.
Some 20 separate NHS Trusts and independent hospitals detected Candida auris (C. auris) in patients, with three hospitals being forced to tackle "large" outbreaks of the pathogen that is "difficult to control".
First discovered in Japan, the family of yeasts can live on the skin and inside the body, causing complications in people with weakened immune systems.
Public Health England (PHE) said doctors at one hospital were still dealing with an outbreak of the fungus, which is resistant to a commonly prescribed fungicidal drug.
Medical staff have been issued with new guidance on detecting and dealing with the fungus, including the "intensive" disinfection of wards amid concern over the "increasing experience of the complexities" infections are posing.
Meanwhile a biosafety unit at Porton Down, the UK's chemical weapons lab, has been testing fungicidal activity of a variety of disinfectants and antiseptics.
"As at the beginning of July 2017, 20 separate NHS Trusts and independent hospitals in the United Kingdom had detected over 200 patients colonised or infected with C. auris," PHE said.
"Three hospitals have seen large nosocomial (within hospital) outbreaks that have proved difficult to control, despite intensive infection prevention and control measures, though two of these outbreaks have been declared over and one is seeing significantly fewer numbers of new acquisitions.
"Over 35 other hospitals have had patients known to be colonised with C. auris transferred to them."
PHE said there was no evidence that any of the infections had resulted in the death of a patient in the UK, although there were limitations to the data available.
Official guidance states that infections are usually minor, while serious infections are rare.
PHE said most cases detected in the UK have been of colonised patients, while around a quarter of cases have been clinical infections - including 27 patients who developed blood stream infections.
Complications arise when the fungus enters the body or blood stream during medical treatment, such as the insertion of drips of urinary catheters, or a wound.
C. auris is resistant to the first-line antifungal drug fluconazole and the species can rapidly evolve to develop resistance.
The fungus was first identified in the ear of a patient in Japan in 2009 and has since caused prolonged hospital outbreaks in India, Pakistan, Venezuela, and Colombia.
Knowing sheriff's deputies cannot physically be everywhere burglars and thieves decide to strike, La Cañada residents are mounting a solid defense against crime, with a little help from the city.
Since late October, La Cañada Flintridge has offered two rounds of rebates that allow homeowners to purchase video doorbell cameras through Ring.com. The first one, which provided $5,000 in city funding for 100 homes to be matched by the Santa Monica-based company, maxed out in just four days.
So last month, the City Council expanded the program, contributing another $7,500 toward the purchase of units for an additional 150 homes. That rebate lasted six days before being depleted Thursday evening, according to city staffer Christina Nguyen.
Now, with more than 250 video doorbells purchased through the rebate program and many more installed beforehand or made by other manufacturers, La Cañada residents are potentially increasing their neighborhood-watch capacity and awareness by spreading videos of package thieves and potential burglars.
Crescenta Valley Sheriff's Station Capt. Chris Blasnek said while there is not yet data on how many investigations may have been aided by the home surveillance devices, their capacity to let homeowners answer their doors remotely via smartphone, and record the footage to share online, provides some piece of mind.
“I find it very useful,” said Blasnek, who installed a device at his own home. “It's one more layer of protection for me and it does store videos and pictures very well.”
City Manager Mark Alexander told council members last Tuesday, when the second round of rebates was about to expire, that the city Public Safety Commission was considering expanding the program even further.
Public Safety Commissioner Marilyn Smith, who was chair when the first rebate program was recommended to the City Council, said Friday she's thrilled to see how enthusiastic homeowners are to aid in the defense of their homes by expanding neighborhood watch efforts and signing up for the Ring.com rebates.
“We initially wanted as much money as the city could put on it, because we all knew this would be a huge success,” Smith said. “This is what we wanted — something tangible. This is something that absolutely goes right to every potential resident in La Cañada.”
Smith said the commission hoped to discuss the matter further in an upcoming meeting, possibly as soon as next month.

rawalpindi - Regional Police Officer RPO Wisal Fakhar Sultan Raja on Wednesday ordered to depute Quick Response Force (QRF) to guard the Chinese engineers working on CPEC railway track between Gujar Khan and Jhelum.
Similarly, well-equipped commandoes of Elite Force have also been stationed around the residences and camps of Chinese engineers following the instructions of police high-ups.
According to details, the RPO has ordered to deploy QRF squads to shield the Chinese engineers and other workers working on CPEC railway track between Gujar Khan and Jhelum. He also instructed the authorities to deploy well-equipped commandoes of Elite Force at the residences of Chinese engineers to avoid any untoward incident. The official asked local police to enhance patrolling in sensitive areas and keep a vigil on suspects and anti-social elements.
The night felt like June or July or August, those glorious months when the Dodgers ruled the sport like preordained kings. But it was October, the proving ground for prospective monarchs, and that mattered all the more.
In the first game of the first round of 2017 playoffs, the Dodgers pulped the Arizona Diamondbacks early, galvanized a capacity crowd of 54,707 at Dodger Stadium and took a 9-5 victory Friday night.
A four-run, first-inning blitz against a jittery pitcher set the tone. Justin Turner bashed a three-run homer. Yasiel Puig licked his bat and cracked an RBI double. Handed the lead, Clayton Kershaw towed his team into the seventh inning before a fusillade ended his night.
Arizona walloped a quartet of solo home runs against Kershaw, the most given up by any Dodger in postseason franchise history. Two came in the seventh, on back-to-back pitches to shortstop Ketel Marte and catcher Jeff Mathis. He finished with seven strikeouts in 6 1/3 innings.
The barrage sent a scare through the ballpark, but could not offset the Dodgers' early charge.
The performance eased the mind of manager Dave Roberts. Roberts managed this season while harboring grief. Seventeen days before the start of the season, Roberts lost his father, Waymon, a 30-year veteran of the Marines who settled his family outside of San Diego in the 1980s. The loss was unexpected. Roberts spent a few days at home before rejoining the Dodgers to finish spring training.
On Friday morning, Roberts was writing in his journal when he started to think about his father. He broke down as he looked at family photographs. The outburst felt therapeutic, a few hours before entering the playoff crucible. “It felt good to get it out of my system,” Roberts said.
On the scoreboard during batting practice, a video package played highlights from the first five months of the season: Kyle Farmer's game-winning debut hit, Puig pegging runners at third base, a slew of blasts from rookie sensation Cody Bellinger. The plays looked like dispatches from another decade, from the halcyon days before the team went 1-16 to stumble toward the finish line.
So the first inning felt like a flashback. On the mound for Arizona was Taijuan Walker, a hulking, 25-year-old right-hander making his first postseason start. He admitted a day earlier that this was the biggest outing of his career — after he admitted he felt so nervous during Wednesday's wild-card game that he could not even watch.
Friday was far worse. A leadoff single by Chris Taylor opened the bottom of the inning. Corey Seager took a walk, passing on splitters inside and fastballs away. After a pitiable September, the patience shown by Seager offered encouragement for the rest of this month. So did what came next, from Turner.
Walker did not hold back. He challenged Turner with a cutter and a fastball at the waist. Turner fouled off both. He settled in to even the count. A 2-2 fastball hummed at Turner's thighs. Turner parked it 10 rows deep in the left-field bleachers.
On the mound, Walker muttered expletives. In the on-deck circle, Puig celebrated. The two would soon meet, after a single by Bellinger.
Puig saw nine pitches from Walker. He fouled off four of them. After one pitch sprayed out of play, Puig dabbed his tongue on the barrel of his bat. A moment later, he grimaced as the pine tar coursed through his taste buds.
As Puig experimented with different food groups, Walker stuck with fastballs. He left a 95-mph heater on the outer half of the plate. Puig ripped it into right-center field, setting Bellinger free from first base. Bellinger swam across the plate as Puig partied at second base to expand the lead to four.
It took Walker 38 pitches to record an out. He threw 48 pitches in the inning. He would not return from the dugout. Zack Godley, a potential Game 4 starter, replaced Walker.
Kershaw wobbled in the third. All evening, he flirted with trouble. His curveball was uncooperative. His slider stayed hidden. He leaned on his fastball, which touched 95-96 mph in the first inning. By the third, his velocity had dipped, ever so slightly, and Arizona outfielder A.J. Pollock smashed a 93-mph fastball into the left-field pavilion.
The offense eased Kershaw's tension in the fourth. Forsythe led off with a single against Godley. Kershaw bunted him to second base. After a walk by Taylor, Seager chopped a grounder to the left side of the infield. The baseball eluded the glove of Arizona shortstop Ketel Marte by inches. The distance proved large enough for Forsythe to jet home. Two more runs scored on a looping single by Turner and a groundout by Puig.
Kershaw needed the cushion. In the sixth, he hung a curveball to outfielder J.D. Martinez. The ball disappeared into the left-field seats. He finished the sixth with 92 pitches.
The five-run lead enticed Roberts to stick with Kershaw for one more inning. The decision backfired.
Marte laced an elevated slider over the left-field fence. Roberts stuck with Kershaw against Mathis, a light-hitting former Angels catcher with 13 home runs since 2013. Mathis swatted his first-ever postseason homer on a first-pitch fastball.
The Dodgers turned to the bullpen from that point, with Tony Watson and Brandon Morrow escaping more trouble in the seventh and eighth innings. Kenley Jansen worked the ninth, giving up an unearned run.
The slight girl in a turquoise headscarf held back tears as she recalled what happened when she fled to Malaysia from Myanmar's violence-hit Rakhine state. Just 12-years-old at the time, she was forced to wed a man she did not know, and who was more than a decade older than her.
The teenager, who is not being named by Reuters because she is still only 13, is like hundreds of Rohingya girls escaping persecution, violence and apartheid-like conditions in Rakhine, only to be sold into marriage to Rohingya men in neighboring Malaysia, migrant groups and community members said.
Separated from her family while escaping to Malaysia, she said she was caught by traffickers and held for weeks in a filthy and brutal jungle camp near the Thai-Malaysian border with dozens of others. Her captors told her a Rohingya man was willing to give her freedom if she agreed to marry him.
"The (trafficking) agent said I had been sold to a man and I asked, how could do they do that?... My heart was heavy and I was scared," the girl said in an interview in Kuala Lumpur.
Reuters could not independently verify certain aspects of her story but her mother confirmed she was held in the camp for weeks before being released.
The girl's plight is just one illustration of the hardships faced by many Rohingya Muslims, a minority group in Myanmar who are regarded by the nation's government as illegal migrants from Bangladesh, entitled only to limited rights.
Since 2012, violence and communal clashes have seen hundreds of Rohingya killed while tens of thousands have fled, seeking refuge in neighboring countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Bangladesh. In the most recent crackdown, security forces and police committed mass killings and gang rapes and burned villages in northern Rakhine, a U.N. investigation published earlier this month found.
MALAYSIA CRITICIZED
It has been common for Rohingya women escaping Myanmar to wed Rohingya men in the country they fled to, usually through marriages arranged between families, rights groups said. Some of these arranged marriages would be for underage girls.
But a growing number are becoming victims of human traffickers who sell women and girls to Rohingya men as brides.
Matthew Smith, executive director of the Southeast Asia-based migrant and refugee protection group Fortify Rights, said the group had seen a “significant” rise in the number of child brides following increased violence in Rakhine.
There are no official statistics on how many girls have been sold into marriage. In 2015, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said in a report it had identified 120 Rohingya child brides in Malaysia but it was unclear how many were trafficking victims.
Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has spoken out strongly in the past few months against Buddhist Myanmar over its handling of the violence in Rakhine and the Rohingyas' plight.
But rights groups say Malaysia, which has not signed the U.N. refugee convention, has been complicit in the abuse of Rohingya asylum-seekers because they are treated as illegal migrants with no official access to jobs, healthcare or education. They live in poverty working illegally in restaurants or construction sites.
The Malaysian government launched a project this month that enables 300 Rohingya people to be employed, a move welcomed by rights groups.
The Malaysian government did not return requests seeking comment for this story.
CHILD MARRIAGES ALLOWED
Child marriages are also tolerated in Muslim-majority Malaysia. Under Islamic law, Muslim girls under 16 can marry with permission from the Shariah court, though in the case of the Rohingya marriages in Malaysia there is no court involvement – Rohingya imams conduct them and while a marriage certificate is printed there is no indication it is a legal document under Malaysian law.
The girl who was married was taken to Kuantan, on Malaysia's east coast, where she said she quickly learned that her new husband was controlling and abusive. He confiscated her mobile phone and did not allow his family to see her. She was left alone for days in the house.
Eight months into the marriage, she reconnected with her parents and four younger siblings, and was rescued by her father, who had traveled to Kuantan to find her.
The girl's husband did not respond to calls seeking comment for this story.
She now lives with her family in a one-room shack in a small village on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur.
While she feels safer now, she said she was afraid that she may have to return to her husband, who has refused to grant her a divorce.
Sharifah Shakirah, a refugee herself and founder of the Rohingya Women Development Network, said Rohingyas have no legal status in Malaysia, and their marriages are not recognized. This can make it harder for law enforcement to intervene in domestic abuse cases, even when they involve children.
"To ask help from lawyers and police is not easy because they (Rohingyas) don't have legal status. Even when cases of child brides are reported, the police don't take action," said Sharifah, who provides help and counseling to Rohingya women.
'LIFE OF DIGNITY'
According to UN statistics, some 56,000 Rohingya are living in Malaysia, although migrant groups say the number is much higher as many are undocumented. The community is mainly spread across impoverished suburbs around the capital Kuala Lumpur.
For young men in this small, marginalized community, finding a partner and having a family is a way of elevating their social status and having a normal life, according to Rohingya men interviewed by Reuters.
The lack of eligible women in Rohingya communities in Malaysia has created a demand for brides, while some families see marriage as a way to reduce their financial burdens, said Belal Hossain Shamia, 32, a Rohingya father of three in Kuala Lumpur whose sister was a child bride.
A former trafficking agent, a Rohingya man identified only as Ali, told Reuters there is a growing demand for Rohingya brides. Smuggling syndicates can get up to 7,000 ringgits ($1,557.29) for each girl's release to their family or sale to a man.
Ali kept guard at a jungle trafficking camp near the Thai-Malaysian border. He said women and girls traveling alone or whose families were unable to pay the release fees were sold.
"There were girls there who were about 15 or 16. They have no choice..." he said.
Yasmin Zokir Ahmad, 18, recalled how her husband, a Rohingya who worked as a grass-cutter in Kuala Lumpur, paid a trafficking agent 3,500 ringgits to marry her two years ago.
This was after a harrowing nine-month journey to Malaysia, which included a voyage by sea and a long period in a Thai jungle camp where she was often denied food or water.
"I didn't have a choice. I needed to marry him because I need support and protection, and I want to live a life of dignity," Yasmin said. Her husband declined to comment.
The first-ever bitcoin future jumped after it began trading Sunday as the increasingly popular virtual currency made its debut on a major U.S. exchange.
The futures contract that expires in January surged more than $3,000 to $18,580 eight hours after trading launched on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. The contract opened at $15,000, according to data from the CBOE.
The CBOE futures don't involve actual bitcoin. They're securities that will track the price of bitcoin on Gemini, one of the larger bitcoin exchanges.
The start of trading at 3 p.m. Pacific Time overwhelmed the CBOE website. “Due to heavy traffic on our website, visitors to www.cboe.com may find that it is performing slower than usual and may at times be temporarily unavailable,” the exchange said in a statement. But it said the trading in the futures had not been disrupted.
Another large futures exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, will start trading its own futures Dec. 18 but will use a composite of several bitcoin prices across a handful of exchanges.
The price of a bitcoin has soared since starting the year below $1,000, hitting a peak of more than $16,858 on Dec. 7 on the bitcoin exchange CoinDesk. At nearly 7 a.m. Pacific Time on Monday, it was at $16,345.76 on Coindesk.
Futures are a type of contract in which a buyer and a seller agree on a price for a particular item to be delivered on a certain date in the future. Futures are available for nearly every type of security but are most famously used in commodities such as wheat, soy, gold, oil, cocoa and — as dramatized in the Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd movie “Trading Places” — concentrated frozen orange juice.
The futures signal greater mainstream acceptance of bitcoin but also open up bitcoin to additional market forces. The futures will allow investors to bet that bitcoin's price will go down — a practice known as shorting — which currently is very difficult to do.
There have been other attempts to bring bitcoin investing into the mainstream. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, twin brothers who own large amounts of bitcoin, tried to create an exchange-traded fund based on bitcoin, but federal regulators denied their application.
How much actual investor interest there will be in these bitcoin futures is still up in the air. Many larger Wall Street brokerages and clearinghouses, including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, are either not allowing customers to trade bitcoin futures or only allowing select clients to do so. Other brokerages are putting restrictions on the amount of margin a trader can use in bitcoin futures, or putting limits on the amount that can be purchased.
The digital currency has had more than its fair share of critics on Wall Street. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has called bitcoin “a fraud.” Thomas Peterffy, chairman of the broker-dealer Interactive Brokers Group, expressed deep concerns about the trading of bitcoin futures last month, saying “there is no fundamental basis for valuation of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and they may assume any price from one day to the next.”
Peterffy noted that if bitcoin futures were trading at that time, under the CBOE's rules those futures likely would experience repeated trading halts because 10% or 20% moves in bitcoin prices have not been unusual in recent months.
Bitcoin is the world's most popular virtual currency. Such currencies are not tied to a bank or government and allow users to spend money anonymously. They are basically lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time they are traded.
A debate is raging on the merits of such currencies. Some say they serve merely to facilitate money laundering and illicit, anonymous payments. Others say they can be helpful methods of payment, such as in crisis situations where national currencies have collapsed.

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (Reuters) - A man said to have harbored Nazi sympathies as a teenager before a failed bid to join the U.S. Army was due in court on Monday to face charges he plowed his car into protesters opposing a white nationalist rally in Virginia, killing a woman and injuring 19.
The bail hearing for James Alex Fields, 20, arrested on suspicion of murder, malicious wounding and hit-and-run charges, was set to unfold in Charlottesville as the U.S. Justice Department pressed its own federal hate-crime investigation of the incident. He was charged with one count of second degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of failing to stop at an accident that resulted in a death.
Authorities said Heather Heyer, 32, was killed when Fields' car slammed into a crowd of anti-racism activists confronting neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan (KKK) sympathizers, capping a day of bloody street brawls between the two sides in the Virginia college town on Saturday.
More than 30 people were injured in separate incidents, and two state police officers died in the crash of their helicopter after assisting in efforts to quell the unrest. The fatal disturbances began with white nationalists converging to protest against plans to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, the commander of Rebel forces during the Civil War.
Virginia police at the weekend offered no motive for the man accused of ramming his car into the crowd.
Derek Weimer, a history teacher at Fields' high school in Kentucky, told Cincinnat's WCPO-TV that he remembered Fields harboring “some very radical views on race” as a student and was “very infatuated with the Nazis, with Adolf Hitler.”
Weimer also recounted Fields being “gung-ho” about joining the army when he graduated.
The army confirmed that Fields reported for basic military training in August 2015 but was “released from active duty due to a failure to meet training standards in December of 2015.”
The army statement did not explain how he had failed to meet training standards.
Fields was being held on suspicion of second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and a single count of leaving the scene of a fatal accident, authorities said.
PanARMENIAN.Net - Hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails have gone on hunger strike over conditions of captivity, with more expected to join on Monday, April 17, in one of the biggest protests in recent years, The Guardian reports.
Led by the high-profile Fatah prisoner and leader Marwan Barghouti, seen by some as a potential successor to Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, 700 prisoners initially joined the strike, announced on Sunday evening.
The protest includes members of Fatah as well as prisoners from Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
The strike, long planned, is seen as having widespread political support – not least in the year marking the 50th anniversary of the Israel occupation of the Palestinian territories, captured during the six day war in 1967. Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah, as well as Hamas leaders in Gaza, have announced their backing.
The Palestinian National Council , the legislative body of the Palestine Liberation Organization, also expressed its support for the strike on Sunday.
In a statement from Hamas the group said: “We warn the Israel Prison Service against bringing any harm to the hunger strikers. Any delay in answering their just demands will explode the situation inside all prisons. All prisoners will unite in the face of all those who might harm prisoners and their dignity.”
The number of prisoners going on hunger strike was expected to expand to 2,000 of the Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails.
The hunger strike was announced to coincide with Palestinian prisoners day which is marked on Monday.
Prisoners' demands include improved visitation rights from family members and easier access to telephones.
The visitation rights are a case of particular concern. While Israeli Prison Service regulations stipulate that all prisoners are entitled to family visits once every two weeks, in reality Palestinians from the occupied Palestinian territories are required to apply for permits to enter Israel in the first place – permits which are often denied.

Neymar has made an astonishing £1 million-per-week wage demand to remain at Paris Saint-Germain next season, reports the Times, despite injury preventing the Brazilian from proving his class and lifting the French side to the latter stages of Champions League.
The 26-year-old's ankle ligament damage cruelly denied him the chance to prove he belongs on the Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi level, as Real Madrid eased past them into the quarterfinals.
With Los Blancos circling this summer to offer the Brazil international an exit, Neymar is said to want increased terms to shun a move back to the higher-profile La Liga.
The £1m per week pay demand will improve upon on the £264.5m guaranteed over his five-year deal in the French capital.
Meanwhile, Brazilian outlet UOL reported five factors that have caused Neymar to seek a quick exit from Ligue 1: increased fouling , a lack of protection from referees, the relatively poorer quality of play, sub-par playing surfaces and bus trips between games

World Cup-winning skipper Arjuna Ranatunga on Wednesday said corruption “goes right to the top” in Sri Lanka and accused the International Cricket Council of undermining the game by failing to tackle match-fixing.
Ranatunga, now a government minister, said cricket corruption in Sri Lanka went far beyond the claims made in an Al Jazeera documentary which aired on Sunday.
Ranatunga said the allegations must be investigated, “but this must have been happening for a long time.
“This is something that goes right to the top (in Sri Lanka). What they will catch is the small fish. As usual the bigger fish will get away,” he said.
The documentary alleged that a Sri Lankan player and groundsman were involved a pitch-tampering plot and that there was spot-fixing during Tests between India and England, and India against Australia.
“I am so disappointed with the ICC anti-corruption unit,” Ranatunga said, referring to previous complaints against Sri Lanka Cricket, which is headed by politician and businessman Thilanga Sumathipala.
The 54-year-old, who led Sri Lanka´s 1996 World Cup-winning team, has in the past accused Sumathipala of involvement in gambling in violation of ICC rules. Sumathipala has denied the charge.
“If they can´t see what is happening in Sri Lanka… they should not sit on this anti-corruption unit,” Ranatunga told reporters.
He said the Sri Lankans implicated in the Al Jazeera documentary could not change the outcome of a Test match unless they had backing from superiors.
“They are small fish,” Ranatunga said referring to the groundsman of the Galle stadium, Tharanga Indika, and a district coach, Tharindu Mendis. “They can´t do it unless they have agreement with those right at the top.”
Indika and Mendis have been suspended while the ICC investigates accusations made in Al-Jazeera´s undercover report. Sri Lankan police have also started an inquiry.
Asked if the Galle groundsman was in a position to tamper with the pitch, Ranatunga said: “There is a top guy involved. He should be held responsible. He should be suspended, not only the person who got (directly) involved.”
Ranatunga said the global audience for cricket was declining because of corruption allegations. He blamed the ICC. “The ACU has been very poor. They have not used some of their powers and I think that is one reason why cricket has gone down very badly in the world in the last so many years. “They (the ICC) need to take a big step and take a lot of hard decisions,” Ranatunga added.—AFP
A 20-year-old woman who collapsed Saturday at Riverside Park in Benton has died, according to Saline County Coroner Kevin Cleghorn.
The woman was reported to be attending the 5th annual Drew Melton: Forever Young Memorial Scholarship Tournament at the park when she suddenly collapsed.
According to the Benton Fire Department, CPR had already been initiated prior to rescue personnel arriving on scene.
Emergency personnel were dispatched around 2:20 p.m.
A report from BNFD says the woman was suffering from cardiac arrest when emergency crews arrived.
The report also states that the woman was hooked up to an AED machine with a no shock advised status.
Also, the woman's sister was in need of medical attention for what the report states was a "panic attack-type episode." Crew members were able to settle down the second person and no further medical attention was requested, according to the report.
Saline Memorial Hospital MedTran arrived a short time later and transported the first woman to the hospital, where she later died.
The name of the woman has not been released at this time.
The remainder of the tournament was canceled following the incident.
Vancouver will be getting in the spirit of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympic Games by lighting areas red across the city.
Vancouver City Hall, Queen Elizabeth Theatre, and the Burrard Street Bridge will be lit with Canadian colours.
The red cheer will last from the opening ceremonies on February 9th until the end of the Paralympic Games on March 18.
Manager of Sport Hosting Vancouver Michelle Collens says a big reason for lighting the areas red, is that Vancouver police officer Meghan Agosta will be playing on the Canadian hockey team.

“She's taking a break from the force here so she can train and qualify. Not only did she made the roster but she's the assistant captain for the team.”
Collens adds that all city staff will be sporting red on February 9.
“Hopefully we see everyone getting their flags back out and just cheering for Canada as we get through the games.”
Ilkka Haavisto, the head of research at EVA, highlights in his analysis that the disposable income of the middle class has crept up by an average of two per cent a year between 1995 and 2016, translating to an aggregate increase of 45 per cent.
The Finnish middle class has neither lost its economic power, nor witnessed a decline in earnings over the past couple of decades, reports the Finnish Business and Policy Forum (EVA).
The disposable income of the upper class, in turn, rose by 49 per cent and that of the lower class by 36 per cent over the past two decades.
EVA points out that employment is a key characteristic of the middle class, as wage earners employed on a full-time basis and living in single-person households earn enough to gain admission to the middle class almost irrespective of occupation. In 2016, it explains, the middle class consisted of wage earners with monthly gross income of 1,900–6,400 euros.
The Finnish middle class accounts for over two-thirds (68%) of the population at large, making it proportionally one of the largest in Europe.
Haavisto also calls attention to another key characteristic – the fact that it is possible to rise into, fall out of and break out of the middle class in Finland. “What is most important is that 48 per cent of people in the lowest decile move to a higher income decile every three years, some even to the highest deciles,” he says.
EVA utilises the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) definition of the middle class for its analysis. The OECD defines middle-class households as households with disposable income of 75–200 per cent of the national median.

As 3 February 2018 marks the Queer Azadi Pride March in Mumbai, we're publishing six compelling coming-out stories: first-person accounts of coming out about your sexuality or gender to friends, loved ones, colleagues or even to yourself. This interview was part of Harish Iyer's 'I'm Coming Out', published by Juggernaut Books, in which the personalities he speaks with explore what it means to be gay in India.
"I don't have a sob story, Harish," he says, his lips curling into an impish smile, "and I'm not going to make one up because there are real people out there with horror stories of abuse and torture and I will not mock their pain."
This is why I love Pallav Patankar.
He calls a spade a spade and is honest enough to recognise his privilege. Pallav is blessed with a no-nonsense, zero-drama family that loves and supports him. He says his mother recognised the early signs of his sexuality when he was just a boy.
When he was eight years old, Pallav was bullied by a few boys in the local playground. They called him names like ‘dheela' and ‘chhakka' because of his effeminate body language. He was shaken by the experience, and came home crying. But his mother sent him back with a stern warning: ‘Never come back crying from a fight. Always give it back to your opponents. You have to stand up for yourself.'
Pallav took his mother's advice and never looked back. He was a good student; his teachers loved him. He was also popular among the girls and fellow nerds. Pallav was not only his mother's favourite, he was loved by parents of other children too. They often admired how well-behaved and focused he was with regards to academics. Pallav understood very early on in his childhood that the bullies were jealous of him because of his talent and qualities, and he started calling out their insecurities every time they targeted him. "Hell, I even made out with some of the same boys when I grew older," he says with a wink.
Pallav is a healer by nature and wanted to study medicine. After Class 12, he appeared for the medical entrance examination but lost out by a few marks. He was 17 then, and the disappointment affected him greatly. He was bogged down by his negative thoughts. He felt that his failure in the exam was connected to his sexuality. If you meet him today, it is hard to believe that at one point Pallav had suicidal thoughts. But as contradictory as it may sound, beneath Pallav's dark thoughts ran an undercurrent of ambition.
"I gave myself an ultimatum – either sort things out for yourself or get help, or kill yourself. Don't suffer through life without doing something about it," he says.
During this complicated time in his life, Pallav was more open about his sexuality. He began to drop hints, leave clues for his family. He asked his mother not to set aside any of her jewellery for his future wife and give it to his sister instead. He would also politely but firmly ask his relatives to mind their own business when they complained about his effeminate body language. As a teenager, Pallav grew up in an India that was yet to acknowledge homosexuality, let alone embrace it. He needed answers to the many questions swirling through his mind, and there was only one man who seemed to have them. His name was Ashok Row Kavi, the founder of India's first gay magazine, Bombay Dost.
"I thank Ashok Row Kavi every day for helping me become the man I am today. I was a teenager when I called the Bombay Dost helpline. I left my contact details with them. When they called me back, they realised I wasn't an adult and said they could not discuss sex and sexuality with a minor," recalls Pallav.
Pallav was asked to come back after he celebrated his 18th birthday. So he waited and called The Humsafar Trust – India's premier support group for LGBTQ people – a week after he turned 18. This time they listened and invited him to one of their meetings in south Mumbai.
"And my world exploded into one joyous rainbow. Suddenly I was surrounded by people like me. I didn't even know there were so many gay men in Mumbai!" says Pallav, reminiscing about his first tentative steps in this new world. He met and spoke not only to Ashok Row Kavi and other pioneers, but also to young professionals who inspired him. "There were gay lawyers, accountants and doctors," says Pallav, describing how normal he felt after meeting fellow gay men.
He started bringing some of his friends from the support group home in a bid to prepare the ground for coming out to his family. Pallav first came out to his sister and then to his mother. "My sister told me that she always knew I was gay. My mother was a little surprised but she supported me. However, she said that I should wait a while before telling anyone because they may not understand it," says Pallav.
As it turns out, Pallav's mother was right. With each passing year, Pallav's relatives grew more and more curious about his single status. Things became more complicated because his sister was married. At every family gathering, his aunts would keep pestering him about getting married. "Why aren't you married yet? Don't you like any girl?" they'd ask, with a hint of mockery in their eyes.
But Pallav always had a witty comeback for every offensive jibe or insinuation. "I'll get married when it's legal," he'd say, making no attempt to conceal his sexuality. That would shock people into silence. Gradually his relatives began to figure out his sexuality. They didn't completely accept him, but they knew better than to probe, or they'd be at the receiving end of one of Pallav's masterful verbal slaps. "Beyond a point, they were scared to bully me," says Pallav.
He went on to study life sciences and headed to Madurai to get his Master's degree. There, he fell head over heels for a man he describes as his one and only love. His name was Sagar, and he meant the world to Pallav. "Sagar was everything I ever wanted in a man. He was curious, energetic and adventurous. He could make great conversation and was sexy to boot! Everything was perfect till our careers took us to different cities."
Pallav went on to work for top pharmaceutical companies across India. Sagar, too, travelled extensively for work. But they made it a point to meet as often as they could to make their long-distance relationship work. "But we all know how long-distance relationships end," says Pallav.
They decided not to be exclusive whilst promising to always be honest with each other. Honesty was the virtue Pallav valued the most in their relationship. "Sagar asked me if I had been with someone else. I replied in the affirmative," Pallav says in a hushed voice. "You know, I didn't want to throw it in his face. It was an honest reply to a question that was asked." Predictably, Sagar was upset about Pallav's confession. "I told him I would rather be in an honest relationship than lie to him."
About their decision to be nonexclusive, Pallav says, "He was okay with it but he requested me to never ever tell him about my 'affairs'," Pallav pauses and adds, "I said to him… if you don't want to know, don't ask."
The relationship did not last very long after that. They continued being friends and spoke occasionally. Then, tragedy struck. Pallav learnt that Sagar was diagnosed with a serious mental condition. He says he would not have broken up with Sagar had he known about his condition.
Sagar was pressurised by his family to marry. He chose to confide in Pallav and seek his acceptance. Pallav staunchly believed that gay men should not ruin an innocent girl's life by getting into this sort of marriage. In his defense, Sagar said he had never really been gay and that his relationship with Pallav was just a phase. This seemed to affect Pallav more than he cares to admit. To this day, he hasn't been in a serious relationship with anyone. The guilt, pain and regret have held him back. But I know Pallav. Nothing can hold him down for too long.
Shortly after breaking up with Sagar, Pallav decided to put the relationship behind him and he turned into a globetrotter of sorts. He travelled to locations in southeast Asia and Africa for work, and life became a series of exciting adventures. "I once spent two nights holed up in my apartment building in Kinshasa, Congo, even as rebels and security forces exchanged gunfire outside," says Pallav.
After his many adventures, when he returned to India, Pallav decided that the corporate sector could offer him nothing more, and he plunged headlong into social work. He joined The Humsafar Trust, spearheading several grassroots-level campaigns for creating awareness about safe sexual practices, as well as HIV and AIDS.
Until recently, 40-year-old Pallav was working alongside his heroes – Ashok Row Kavi and Vivek Anand. He supervised awareness and fundraising campaigns to help fellow gay men and women deal with their sexuality in a healthy and stable manner. If you ask people who know Pallav really well, you'll be hard-pressed to find anyone who has a negative opinion of him. Some people hero-worship him, some make their romantic feelings for him evident, because Pallav is a powerhouse of energy. Even after leaving The Humsafar Trust, he continues helping organise and execute various campaigns.
But Pallav is looking for his next adventure. A few years ago, he decided to give in to his long-standing desire to cross-dress. "It was liberating and limiting at the same time," he says. While he felt calmer after donning a saree and proper makeup, he looked so convincing as a woman that straight men started hitting on him.
"I got the opportunity to discover first-hand what a woman has to go through every time she steps out of the bounds of her home when I was invited to play the title role of Urmi in a short film by the same name. This helped me build empathy that ultimately brought a new sensitivity to my work at The Humsafar Trust," says Pallav, "This brought to the fore my feminine side which I had suppressed for many years."
Pallav and his volunteers visit villages where they counsel that lonely, effeminate gay boy secretly playing with his sister's dolls and tell him that he has nothing to be afraid of. He continues to be my hero, and always will be. There is never a dull moment with him. He is the go-to person for the LGBTQ cause. I have seen him work hard to bring happiness into the lives of LGBTQ people. He seems rough and practical, but he has a coming out story too. And now that it's been told, I hope it inspires you to stay strong and face each day with grace.

OTTAWA – Global Affairs says Canada is adding more Venezuelans to its sanctions list.
Another 14 individuals have been added to the list of people who Canada says are among those responsible for the deterioration of democracy in that country under the regime of Nicola Maduro.
The sanctions essentially prohibit Canadians from doing business with people or entities on the list.

From a sleek electric car to an insane muscle car with more than 800 horsepower, your MotorTrend.com favorites over the course of 2017 are all over the automotive map. A surprisingly good rear-drive Korean four-door also captivated your attention this year, as did a major update on a very large SUV that's needed a redesign for a long time.
How many of these stories have you read? Revisit them below.
Read about popular stories from 2016 here
The 2018 Camry didn't win its two comparisons against the also-new 2018 Honda Accord, but the Toyota still represents a huge shift from the automaker that was building bland family sedans by the hundred thousand just a few years ago. The latest version of the best-seller intrigued us enough that we created a Motor Trend exclusive package of stories on the 2018 Camry's development.
As vehicle performance leader Yoichi Mizuno said to us: “After seven generations of Camry, our biggest challenge was to forget. This one isn't a Camry. It's a new car.”
This has been a good year for sport-sedan fans. During 2017, we named the Alfa Romeo Giulia the 2018 Motor Trend Car of the Year, and back in January, the Kia Stinger GT made its Detroit auto show debut. The Stinger is a rear- and all-wheel-drive hatchback that initially claimed to be a threat to more expensive cars including the Audi A5 Sportback and BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe—if you're OK not owning a car with the status of a respected luxury brand.
“Since the Stinger's debut,” we wrote about the Stinger after driving it at 2018 Car of the Year where it was a finalist, “Kia has been pretty mouthy about how its four-door coupe would lay wurst to the brats from Audi and BMW. Does it live up the hype? Oh ja.”
This year's look into the future of the automotive industry proved to be a hit. And that's not surprising for an article that previews everything from the upcoming Ford Ranger to the fully electric Jaguar I-Pace. Read about how Jaguar recently took us for a quick ride in the I-Pace right here.
After the XC90 became the 2016 Motor Trend SUV of the Year, Volvo has been trying to build lots of momentum with its crossovers. Earlier this year, we saw—and later drove—the smaller XC60. Like the XC90, the U.S.-spec XC60 will be available with three engines including a powerful plug-in hybrid. More recently, Volvo has added the XC40 to its lineup. When the aging S60 sedan and V60 wagon aren't for you, the XC40 is another option for those who want a Volvo with a starting price under $40,000.
Finally! At last, the Ford Expedition gets a comprehensive update, with improvements all around. The Expedition made its debut in February and looked to be a bigger threat to the popular Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban. And once we drove the Ford, we were impressed. Read our 2018 Expedition First Drive right here.
Dodge has continued to win the hearts of enthusiasts everywhere by driving right past common sense and beyond the 707-hp Hellcat version of the Challenger to the Demon's 808 hp and 717 lb-ft of torque of drag-strip-ready craziness. Those figures are with 91-octane gas, but if you fill up the 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon with 100-plus octane race fuel, the Demon offers 840 hp and 770 lb-ft of tire-shredding “because we can” capabilities.
Before “Remember Pontiac?” becomes “What's Pontiac?” among younger automotive enthusiasts, a company called Trans Am Worldwide captured our attention at the New York auto show with a bold homage to the Pontiac Trans Am of the 1970s. The model we saw in New York was based on the latest Camaro and, if none of that interests you, the automaker's claim that the car produces 1,000 hp probably will.
Part of what distinguishes Motor Trend from lesser competitors is the fact that we regularly track-test cars, trucks, and SUVs to explore their limits. A Tesla Model S P100D we tested this year explored our limits, with a startling 0-60-mph time of 2.28 seconds with a quarter-mile performance of 10.5 seconds at 125.0 mph.
In the exclusive review, we noted that “launching a Model S P100D (weighing 5,062 with gear and driver) in full-on Ludicrous Easter-egg mode snaps your body in a manner that is utterly impossible to replicate in any other street-legal production car on normal tires and dry asphalt at a mid-$100,000 price point.”
Before the 2018 Honda Accord rolled into dealerships or won two comparisons against the new 2018 Toyota Camry, the car made its debut in July. At the reveal event, we saw a midsize sedan with a bolder design and more rear-seat space than the already spacious last-gen model, plus it featured some of the finest-looking fake wood trim you can find anywhere.
Read the two Accord vs. Camry comparisons here:
Combine the most hyped car of 2017 with a genuine exclusive opportunity to drive the car with Tesla's chief designer Franz von Holzhausen, and you have the most popular MotorTrend.com story of the year. By far. While Tesla continues to work through “production hell” with Model 3 production, the car recently won a comparison against the Nissan Leaf and the 2017 Motor Trend Car of the Year, the Chevrolet Bolt EV.

The heat wasn't a factor; the National Weather Service put the temperature at 83 degrees with a heat index of 91 degrees.
Miki Sudo said after eating 37 dogs and buns that the heat may have slowed her down in winning the women's competition.
That didn't stop the Las Vegas eater from easily beating out second-place finisher Mischelle Lesco of Tuscon, Arizona, who chowed down 28 wieners and buns.

Miki Sudo (MIHK'-ee SOO'-doh) downed 37 franks to win her fifth straight title in the women's competition of the annual Nathan's Famous July Fourth hot dog eating contest.
The Las Vegas competitor fell short of the 41 hot dogs she consumed last year but still beat out second-place finisher Michelle Lesco, of Tucson, Arizona. Lesco chowed down 28 wieners and buns.
Thousands of attendees braved 83-degree temperatures and a heat index of 91 degrees to witness the annual July Fourth competition on the Coney Island boardwalk.
Ten-time winner Joey "Jaws" Chestnut will confront 20 other men during the men's competition later Wednesday for the coveted Mustard Belt.

It's frankly amazing.
Chowdown champions will face off Wednesday at Nathan's Famous July Fourth hot dog eating contest, where the men's record stands at 72 frankfurters and buns in 10 minutes.
Ten-time winner Joey "Jaws" Chestnut will confront 20 other men on New York's Coney Island boardwalk. He set the record last year.
Miki Sudo (MIHK'-ee SOO'-doh) is seeking a fifth women's title in a row. The 19-woman field includes record-holder Sonya "The Black Widow" Thomas.
Sudo downed 41 franks and buns last year. Thomas' record is 45, but she managed 30 last year.
The event attracts thousands of in-person spectators and is televised on ESPN.
Last year, animal rights activists tried to unfold a banner amid the crowd. Five protesters were taken into custody for questioning and released.

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar will delay a long-awaited reform that would open the door further to foreign investment, two officials told Reuters, a move likely to disappoint cash-starved businesses amid growing doubts over the management of the economy by the country's leader, Aung San Suu Kyi.

The postponement of the corporate reform, which would have allowed foreign companies to take up to a 35 percent stake in Myanmar companies, will likely deal a fresh blow to investor confidence in Suu Kyi's administration.
Economic reform is a key goal for her to complete Myanmar's democratic transition after decades of isolation under military rule.
The delay underscores the daunting challenge facing Suu Kyi, whose promise of a reformist government that would attract foreign investment is under threat.
Some aid to Myanmar is already being withheld and investors are concerned that the sanctions that long hobbled the country's economy will be reinstated over its treatment of its Rohingya minority.
A Myanmar companies law, which could bring much-needed foreign capital to the country after decades of mismanagement by the former military junta, was approved last week by President Htin Kyaw without a commencement date specified.
Aung Naing Oo, head of Myanmar's Directorate of Investment and Company Administration (DICA), told Reuters the authorities may not be ready to implement the new rules until as late as August 2018, after bylaws were prepared and a company registry that he said was vital to enforcement was completed.
“We really want to implement the law as soon as possible but there are many things for us to do,” he said, declining to elaborate what bylaws were needed. He said the government would make sure implementation would be no later than August 1. “We have to make sure the reform is on the right track.”
Myo Min, director of DICA, said the authorities needed up to eight months to “work on the guidance and operating manual” for the country's first modern online registry, an initiative driven by the Asian Development Bank to electronically revamp the country's company registry to boost transparency.
The law includes a first set of modern corporate governance regulations, in some parts replacing rules made over a century ago, to bring the country's business regulatory framework closer to international standards.
At issue is a clause that allows foreigners to take up to a 35 percent share in local companies, which would give local businesses access to a larger capital pool and open up the door for mergers and acquisitions in sectors that are in urgent need of an injection of cash from banking to property.

The delay of the much-anticipated reform comes as Suu Kyi faces criticism that she has neglected economic reforms. Growth in both foreign investment and gross domestic product have slowed since her National League for Democracy took office last year in one of the region's poorest countries.
Htay Aung, president of the property-to-trading conglomerate Sakura Trade Center, said putting off implementation of the law “was bad for business as it will bring delays and extra costs, which result in losses”.
The company is seeking $100 million in over­seas financing for a condominium development in Myanmar's commercial hub, Yangon. “Foreign investment will be postponed and local businessmen will be disappointed.”
“MISSED OPPORTUNITY”
Investors have been waiting for the corporate reform, which was initiated by the former military-backed government in 2014. It establishes guidelines on how a company is run and governed, removing outdated rules on share transfers and offering greater protection to shareholders.
But Chris Hughes, a lawyer with Berwin Leighton Paisner in Yangon who was commissioned to draft the rules, said it was a “missed opportunity” for Suu Kyi's administration.
“I can't see a compelling economic reason or policy behind the delay. It seems more driven by technology or administrative factors.”
William Greenlee, managing director at law firm DFDL in Yangon, said the business community would struggle with the delay.
“International investors are watching and it's wins like this that create a buzz and can materialize into a profound and sustained increase in foreign investment,” he said. “The euphoria will quickly turn to disappointment if it's not implemented quickly.”
Aung Naing Oo of DICA said there would be no negative impact on investment. “Investors always need to take some time before they invest,” he said. “So this actually is the time for investors to make preparation to invest in Myanmar.”
The Asian Development Bank, which gives financial and technical assistance to Myanmar, said “it is ultimately the government's decision when the law comes into force” and declined to comment further.

LAHORE - Two-day Jhok Saraiki Mela kicked off at Alhamra Arts Council on Monday featured literary personalities, poets and intellectuals from Southern Punjab.
A Mehfil-e-Mushaira was organised at Alhamra, The Mall, hall no 2 in which poets including Amanullah Rashid , Ashiq Buzdar, Niaz Hussain Lakhvera, Tahira Khan, Sobia Malik, Arif Sabri, Javed Shani, Riaz Bakhri, Sajid Multani, Razish Liaqat Puri, Jahangir Mukhlis, Asif Ajiz, Iqbal Lashari and Siraj presented their latest lyrical poetry to audience.
Seraiki nationalist poet Ashiq Buzdar who is famous for his nationalist lyrical poetry “Sade muh te jandray jabar de, Sade hath Karian vich band, Asan qaidi takht Lahore de, Assan qaidi takht Lahore de,” also narrated his poetry at Mushaira. His poetry urges youth of Saraiki areas to raise their voice against the exploiters who are exploiting the recourses of the South Punjab.
A student of private university at festival who wished not to be named said exploitation of Southern Punjab resources has been expanding the trust deficient among people of Punjab. “Almost major chunk of Punjab's development schemes is being underway in Lahore alone. Politician's needs to look into this matter as they have created this Lahore-centric development approach in province, he said.
Lahore Arts Council executive director Captain (retd) Atta Muhammad Khan talking on the occasion said that Jhok Saraiki Mela was the beautiful addition to the Lahore literary and cultural atmosphere where peace and harmony would be prevailed by arranging such cultural shows.
“We need to acknowledge each other's cultures. This Saraiki Jhok Mela will promote national cultural harmony,” he said.
A book stall has been also arranged at the festival along with stalls in which Saraiki caps, arts and crafts of Multan, Bahawalpur and other cities of Southern Punjab.
The festival will conclude today with a ceremony at Hall II to pay tribute to renowned singer Attaullah Esakhelvi.
A large number of people from all walks of life visited the festival. Students who hail from Southern Punjab districts and studying in Punjab capital metropolis in different colleges, universities and even doing jobs were participated as audience in the Mehfil-e-Mushaira festival.

With 14 straight victories and a 11-point gap at the top of the table, Manchester City have got a hell of a lot to celebrate right now.
Pep Guardiola's side are in irresistible form, and there are plenty of people who, quite rightly, are already installing them as the champions-elect before we're even halfway through the campaign.
City's record of 46 points from their 16 matches would have been enough to see them finish eighth in last season's FINAL table already, and so all of the plaudits that they are receiving are entirely deserved.

But after beating Manchester United , there were a few aspects of the post-match dressing room image that both Leroy Sané and Ilkay Gundogan posted on Sunday that provoked debate.
Look at it again...
(Image: Twitter/@LeroySane19)
You've probably got some questions in mind now, haven't you?
Maybe five of them?
Well so have we.
1. Who brings confetti to a football match?
(Image: Twitter/@LeroySane19)
A bit weird this, isn't it?
Obviously City *are* going to win the league this season, and possibly a few other things as well, but they haven't *actually* done it yet.
And while we don't want to come off all Graeme Souness, confetti in the dressing room does seem to be a little bit over the top from this bunch of very modern footballers, doesn't it?
2. How excited is Bernardo Silva?!
(Image: Twitter/@LeroySane19)
We can answer that one. Very excited.
The big money summer signing from Monaco might not have featured much this season, but by god he's going to enjoy that league title winners' medal he's going to pick up in May for his seven starts and two goals and an assist.
3. Why is Eliaquim Mangala looking over there?
(Image: Twitter/@LeroySane19)
French defender Mangala has made nine appearances for City this season, all of which have come to the soundtrack of people saying that they'd forgotten he still played for them.
He did manage a good solid 31 minutes at Old Trafford though, after which he was clearly so dazed that he forgot about the concept of cameras.
4. Is this what Danilo always does in photos?
(Image: Twitter/@LeroySane19)
There's always one, and it seems as though Danilo is the one at City.
The full-back - an unused substitute at Old Trafford - is pulling *that* face that someone was always pulling in the back of each one of your uni night out photos in the top left here, and obviously loving every minute of it.
5. And finally... is this what angered Jose Mourinho so much?
(Image: Twitter/@LeroySane19)
The many reports about the ugly bust-up which followed the game have all featured the rather amusing suggestion that Jose Mourinho was showered in water and milk as he entered the City dressing room . The mental image of which is, quite frankly, hilarious.
But could this have been the moment that those raucous City celebrations went a little over the top for the beaten United boss?
Ville Niinistö, the chairperson of the Green League, states that the government seems to take no issue with policies that increase inequalities “as long as they are in dressed a tailor-made suit”.
The Finnish government's readiness to continue coalition co-operation with the newly-established New Alternative Parliamentary Group has been met with dismay by several members of the opposition.
“Minister of Finance Petteri] Orpo (NCP) and [Prime Minister Juha] Sipilä (Centre) spoke yesterday about values and human rights,” he wrote on Facebook on Wednesday. “Today they are prepared to continue in a government with someone who they have said has the same approach to immigration and human rights as Jussi Halla-aho, Sampo Terho.”
“So much for those values.”
Niinistö also accused the two ruling parties, the Centre and the National Coalition, of being willing to compromise their values in order to push the much-discussed reform of social and health care services over the finish line.
“One will get its counties and the other the freedom of choice,” he said.
Li Andersson, the chairperson of the Left Alliance, similarly did little to mince her words in criticising the government.
“Juha Sipilä, a man who has made a martyr out of Halla-aho and Team Halla-aho the second largest group in the opposition with access to five million euros in party subsidies. Only to ensure he has the opportunity to sell public well-being services to multinational corporations,” she slammed.
Sipilä on Wednesday reminded that the future of the government now lies in the hands of the parliamentary groups.
“We've discussed the process with constitutional experts, whose instructions indicate that if changes take place in the parliamentary basis without the government losing its majority while no changes take place in the government or the government programme, the matter can be decided by the parliamentary groups,” he said.
The Parliament, he added, will hopefully vote on its confidence in the new government as soon as later this week.
The new coalition government would have a narrow majority in the Finnish Parliament, holding 106 of the 200 seats. Terho, however, has indicated that he is willing to consider new applications to join the proposed third member of the ruling coalition, the New Alternative Parliamentary Group.

Remember the bikini-wearing Swedish police officer who tackled a pickpocket in a Stockholm park? She's resigning from the police force after 11 years of service.
Mikaela Kellner told Swedish tabloid Expressen that she wants to quit policing and focus on her work as a personal trainer. She cited the controversial overhaul of Sweden's police forces as a primary reason for her change of career.
In January 2015, the country's police forces were reorganized under a centralized government banner called the Swedish Police Authority.
The move hasn't been popular among police. In September, the Swedish Police Union claimed in a press release that the forces were averaging three resignations a day, and were at risk of losing a fifth of their personnel by 2020.

Also in September, the Swedish Agency for Public Management released a report that found that local police forces were under-resourced, and that their needs weren't sufficiently prioritized amid the national police overhaul.
Kellner garnered worldwide acclaim after a photo of her pinning a suspect to the ground went viral on Instagram. She was sunbathing with friends at the time when one of them had their cellphone swiped.

DRAMATIC police bodycam footage shows all Emily Weinman did was refuse to give officers her last name.
Moments later the 20-year-old mum was "slammed" on the beach after two police officers stopped to see if she was drinking underage during Memorial Day weekend in New Jersey in the United States.
Ms Weinman was breathalysed and passed but because the alcohol her and a friend had been unopened, began questioning why police were still writing her up.
In the footage released by Wildwood Police, she starts to get distressed when they suggest she is obstructing police in front of her 18-month-old daughter.
"I didn't do anything to get written up, did I?" she can be heard asking.
It's then that the situation escalates with one of the officers saying, "Now you're causing a scene."
Ms Weinman says her aunt is on the way and tries to avoid police, still refusing to give her last name.
"OK, that's it, I'm done with you," says one of the officers before asking the cop with him if he has cuffs.
He can then be heard saying, "Get over here. You're about to get dropped."
Later the officer tells others who arrive at the scene that the woman tried kicking them, although it can't be seen in the footage.
"So I slammed her on the ground," he tells them.
SHOCKING video of two police officers brutally arresting a teenager: A video shows a police officer punching a 13-year-old boy in the ribs as he lies on the ground.
In the footage Ms Weinman tells police she doesn't want to give them her name and tries to back away when as they keep approaching her.
"I hit her a couple times and I put her in cuffs and locked her up."
Earlier this week, Wildwood Mayor Ernie Troian said Ms Weinman had escalated the situation and the bodycam footage would "vindicate" the police involved.
After Ms Weinman is put down she can be heard screaming, "Don't pull my hair, get off of me, what are you doing? You're choking me."
The police tell others to "Back the f**k up" and Ms Weinman's crying worsens.
"You're not allowed to beat me like that, I'm a woman, you're not allowed to hit me and choke me like that," she says.
"I didn't do anything wrong."
Where is the bodycam footage? Go ahead and post it, if the police are so eager to reveal the "truth". She inadvertently kicked as they were punching and strangling her. #Wildwood #Policebrutality #FireMayorErnie — Drewster (@Brewsterlala) May 30, 2018
The father of Ms Weinman's daughter tries to approach police after she is cuffed and put in the car with his baby in his arms, saying the alcohol wasn't even open.
The original viral video, taken by a sunbaker and posted to Twitter, sparked outrage online as people slammed the police brutality, while others said Ms Weinman caused a scene.
"These officers are animals. They don't deserve to 'serve and protect'," said one user.
Another said the police officer should be fired.
"They are wrong. He was on top already. Desk duty is a joke," he said.
The officers were reassigned to desk duty pending the outcome of an investigation.
Ms Weinman, of Philadelphia, was charged with two counts of aggravated assault on a police officer, aggravated assault by spitting bodily fluids at/on a police officer, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, obstruction and minor in possession of alcohol.

BEIJING:-China's carbon dioxide monitoring satellite TanSat has 75 data users worldwide, according to the website of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The 620-kg satellite received 11,000 data orders and 27,478 GB of data downloads. TanSat, launched last December, was China's first satellite to monitor greenhouse gas emisions. As part of its three-year mission, TanSat thoroughly examines global carbon dioxide (CO2) levels every 16 days, accurate within 4 ppm (parts per million). The satellite can observe the sun, moon, solar flares and objects on the ground.
The satellite has different modes for observing oceans and land, and can constantly adjust its orientation and position. To ensure the accuracy of TanSat, six ground-based observation stations will calibrate and examine observational data.
China is the third country after Japan and the United States to monitor greenhouse gases using its own satellite.

Just two weeks into my new job at Motor Trend, I joined testing director Kim Reynolds at a meeting he arranged for members of the Orange County Tesla Owners Club to see the all-new and not yet released (at the time) Chevrolet Bolt EV. After the Tesla owners poked and prodded the Bolt and went for rides with Reynolds behind the wheel, he tossed me the keys and said to take it for a drive. I had no idea what to expect—I was new to EVs.
Turning onto the Pacific Coast Highway, I was immediately impressed with the Bolt's instant power, quickness, quietness, and surprisingly, its handling. The heavy weight of the battery pack mounted low into the Bolt's floor gives the hatchback a low center of gravity, resulting in very nimble and fun handling dynamics. This gave me enough confidence to plow through an empty corner at a high rate of speed as if I was driving a sports car. Bad idea! Still green behind the ears, I failed to factor one thing into the equation: tires. Unfamiliar with EVs at the time, I did not know about the low-resistance, hard tires that these vehicles usually come equipped with. In this case, the Bolt EV had Michelin Energy Saver A/S Selfseal Green X tires on. As I turned the wheel entering the corner, I was greeted by not only the unholiest of tire squealing noises but also a frightening amount of understeer.
After I returned the Bolt EV to Reynolds and gave him a PG version of what had just happened, it clicked—what if this car had high-performance summer tires on instead? Not only would grip significantly increase, but that dreaded high-pitch squealing that happens when low resistance tires lose grip should also vanish. When mentioning this to Reynolds, he quickly reminded me that EVs have low resistance tires for a reason, and grippy summer tires would negatively affect the Bolt's driving range. I wanted to quantify that assertion. Fortunately for me, a few months later Chevrolet gave us the keys to our new long-term Bolt EV. After some convincing, we acquired a set of summer tires for the Bolt EV from Tire Rack—BFGoodrich G-Force Sport Comp-2 ultra-high-performance (UHP) tires—and strapped them on.
Driving Experience
Even before hitting the road with the newly installed BFGoodrich summer tires, I immediately appreciated one thing: the new look of the Bolt EV. The more aggressive-looking tread of the summer tires results in quite a cool look for the tall hatchback. Hitting the road with the newly installed ultra-high-performance tires, I noticed something new: tire noise, and lots of it. Compared to the factory tires, the summer tires are much louder. Once you get going, an obvious whirling sound enters the cabin, only getting louder with speed. If equipped, turn that Bose sound system up. Features editor Scott Evans, who chaperones our long-term Bolt EV, also noticed that “it seems especially noticeable because of how quiet EVs inherently are. I found it bothersome at first because the car was so quiet for the first six months, but I'm getting used to it. The quietness of the interior was a high point of the car for me, and it's hard to give it up.”
Ride quality also takes a hit, but that's to be expected because UHP tires have much firmer sidewalls when compared to the factory units. With the Michelin low-resistance tires on, the Bolt is comfortable and rides well, thanks to the cushy sidewalls. Evans also noticed the decreased ride quality. “It's not brittle or harsh, but it's much more like a serious sport sedan ride-wise than the everyday commuter it was,” he said. “With the quality of L.A.'s roads, this is a trade-off big enough to give me a bit of pause. Perhaps there's a summer tire option with a taller sidewall?” A firmer ride might not bother some, but it's something to consider depending on the quality of your local streets and highways.
With sound and ride quality out of the way, let's get to the fun stuff. Handling and the overall fun-to-drive factor have increased tenfold. When wanting to drive spiritedly, the Bolt's factory tires were very limiting in two ways: lack of grip and fear of that dreadful tire squeal that low-resistance tires are known for. If the UHP summer tires were equipped when I took that fast turn on my first drive, there would have probably been zero understeer. When UHP tires lose traction, it is a much quieter and less annoying sound. Additionally, if you find yourself at a stop and turning in either direction in a hurry, expect tire slippage and squealing as soon as you crank the wheel and hit the throttle with the factory tires on (although this will not happen when accelerating quickly in a straight line).The UHP tires shine in the corners. A good example is on the many highway ramps in L.A., as Evans explains: “Just commuting, I notice it every day on the freeway cloverleaves. The stock tires gave up fairly quickly and made a lot of noise, especially when you tried to go to power as you unwind the steering wheel. Now, it turns in sharper, grips much better midcorner, and puts the power down while exiting.” The summer tires also allow the Bolt to enter a corner faster, brake later, and maintain a higher rate of speed through the corner, and it gives you a lot more confidence than you would normally have on the factory set of tires. Additionally, if you want to pass up that slow Prius on the street quickly, flooring the Bolt while switching lanes is much safer because there is much less or no tire slippage when performing this quick maneuver. Honestly, this thing is a blast to drive with UHP summer tires, and it's much more capable.
That fun does have its limits. Please keep in mind that this is still a tall EV hatchback and not a sports car. You can only push the Bolt so hard before things start getting hairy. The soft suspension and lack of any steering feel will make you hold back before you get into any trouble. You can't feel much of what's happening on the road. Additionally, the ESC rears its ugly head when trying to have fun. They might be UHP tires, but that instant torque will still easily break traction when the wheel is cranked to either side. Driving fast through a corner requires careful modulation of the throttle through the turn in order to prevent the system from momentarily sucking power away even when it's turned off.
Instrumented Testing
Street driving is fun and all, but instrumented testing on the track tells the real story. On factory tires, the Bolt EV does not break traction when flooring it from a stop, so we didn't expect much improvement in acceleration, and we were correct. With the Michelin factory tires on, the Bolt hit 60 mph in 6.3 seconds and the quarter mile in 15.0 seconds at 92.1 mph. There was basically no improvement with BFGoodrich summer tires. At 6.3 seconds, the 0-60 mph time stayed the same, and the Bolt hit the quarter mile 0.1 second faster at 92.9 mph. However, lateral acceleration increased from 0.78 g to 0.82 g.
When Reynolds flogged the Bolt around Motor Trend's figure-eight course, the Bolt's time improved 0.5 second from 27.4 seconds with factory tires to 26.9 seconds. The average g-force around the course increased from 0.63 g to 0.66 g, showing an improvement in overall grip through the corners. This is a nice improvement, but it could have been much better if it wasn't for the overly aggressive electronic stability control. Even when turned all the way off, the system is very intrusive when wheel slippage is detected. Around the skidpad part of the course (the corners), Reynolds had the Bolt at wide open throttle the entire time, but as soon as the tires slipped, ESC would cut what seemed like most power. This resulted in power being cut then allowed back on about every second or two the entire way around the corner. Killing time, speed, and possibly the maximum grip potential of the tires (g-forces could have possibly been higher). Witnessing this from the outside, it seemed as though Reynolds was hitting the brake pedal (the lights were flashing) every couple of seconds, but he wasn't. His right foot was pegged against the throttle. The ESC is, of course, aggressively tuned to keep the average driver out of harm's way and not for the track. If there was a way to detune the ESC, the results would have probably been better. That instant torque is not ESC's friend.
Driving Range and Charging
Skip this section if you love your Bolt's long EPA-rated 238-mile driving range because, to no one's surprise, the driving range took a big hit. The much higher grip and amount of friction of the BFGoodrich Sport Comp-2 tires took a toll on the total driving range, which in turn affected charging time and the amount of electricity used. According to the math that Evans provided, during the 58 days with the high-performance summer tires, the following happened to the Bolt EV's driving range, charging, and energy usage: the average trip between charges dropped 23.3 miles while using an average of 4.1 kWh more per charging session. In other words, the Bolt's driving range decreased, and it's using more energy than before. The predicted charging time has gone up by about an average of half an hour even though we are plugging it in at a higher rate of charge than before (52.7 percent on average compared to 49.4 percent before), and Ideal Range and Predicted Range have of course decreased. Due to our range anxiety, we were plugging in the Bolt sooner, but charging was still taking longer, correlating to the increased energy usage. Based on the EPA-rated 238-mile driving range, our driving range decreased by 10.2 percent.The average ideal range after charging dropped from 248 miles to 224 miles, and the average predicted range dropped from 206 miles to 186 miles.
Fortunately for us at Motor Trend, we have experts in our EQUA Real MPG team that strap on high-dollar testing equipment and calculate real-world fuel economy. The EPA rates the Bolt EV at 119 mpg-e combined city/highway driving with the factory Michelins on, but our Real MPG team calculated a higher 122.2 mpg-e combined driving when tested. When they tested the Bolt again but with the BFGoodrich summer tires, the results were so surprising that our team believed that there might have been an error in the numbers, but there wasn't. Once they rechecked and recalculated the data, the mpg-e figure dropped by staggering 27 percent, down to 89.2 mpg-e combined driving. That puts it along the lines of one of the most inefficient and recently discontinued EVs on the market: the Mercedes-Benz B250e (84 mpg-e combined and an 87-mile driving range). When Real MPG tested the Bolt EV with the factory low-resistance tires on, they calculated a total driving range of 244 miles (higher than the EPA's 238-miles range), but with a 27 percent reduction in efficiency, the range drops to about 178 miles with the same charging and driving habits.
Something else to factor in is how we drove the car after installing the UHP summer tires. We didn't measure it, but there is a good chance that our driving style became a bit more aggressive once installed, therefore using more energy. I know for a fact mine did, and Evans says he found himself driving quicker at times, as well. Reynolds, however, says his driving style did not change.
Why would anyone do this?
Hypermilers would call this blasphemy while some young drivers out there with short commutes might think this is a great idea. In my opinion, UHP summer tires are a bit too extreme for most EVs, especially with the resulting range loss and increased energy use. Considering my short commute to work, I would find a good middle ground with a set of performance all-season tires. Evans shares similar feelings. Regardless, most people who purchase a Bolt EV will be perfectly happy with the factory low-resistance tires and the excellent range they provide. If you want to drive a tall EV hatchback like a Miata or simply want improved braking distance and grip at the expense of some range loss, it's worth considering a more aggressive tire.
Washington: The special counsel overseeing the probe into Russia's alleged meddling in the US election is looking at whether President Donald Trump tried to obstruct justice, the Washington Post reported Wednesday, citing unnamed officials.
In a pivotal shift in the investigation that has riveted Americans like no other for decades, senior intelligence officials have agreed to be interviewed by investigators working for the special counsel, Robert Mueller, the Post said.
It quoted five people briefed on the requests and said those who have agreed to be interviewed are Daniel Coats, the director of national intelligence, Admiral Mike Rogers, head of the National Security Agency, and his recently departed deputy, Richard Ledgett.
The interviews could come as early as this week, the Washington Post said.
The newspaper's story was met with a furious reaction from Trump's personal lawyer.
The shift toward investigating the US president began days after Trump fired James Comey as FBI director on 9 May.
The stated focus has been Russia's alleged efforts to tilt last November's presidential election Trump's way and whether the winner's campaign was involved in any way.
Trump vehemently denies any collusion between himself or any of his associates and Russia.
Mueller, himself a widely respected former head of the FBI, has now taken up the angle of possible efforts by Trump to obstruct justice in the investigation, the Post said.
Quoting officials, the newspaper said one event of interest to Mueller is an exchange on 22 March, when Coats told associates that Trump had asked him to intervene with Comey to get him to back off the focus on Trump's former national security adviser Mike Flynn as part of the FBI probe of the Russia affair.
A few days after the 22 March meeting, Trump spoke separately with Coats and Rogers and asked them to issue public statements to the effect that there was no evidence of coordination between his campaign and Russia. The Washington Post said both men refused the president's request.
Trump's personal lawyer Marc Kasowitz issued a statement saying the FBI was behind the Post story and called the leak "outrageous, inexcusable and illegal." The lawyer did not deny the story, however.
Mueller briefed Senators Wednesday on his work.
"I'm going to acknowledge we had a meeting with the special counsel Mueller, but I'm not going to get into the contents," Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters later.

Rows of corn tower over Lawrence Bartos as he stands in his bountiful garden at his Midland home he built himself.
The 88-year-old Midland native's meticulously manicured vegetable garden is lush after a much-needed rain from the night before -- a blessing from God, he calls it. The adage of corn being "knee-high by the Fourth of July" is a benchmark being exceeded in the farming community as new hybrid corn species are created; but one look at the garden kept by Bartos gives you an idea he is also the envy of neighboring gardeners.
The garden hosts rows of corn in various growth stages alongside tomatoes, snap peas, green beans, cucumbers, cabbage, lettuce and radishes surrounded by multicolored zinnias and dill.
Bartos was raised on a farm on Jefferson Road with 14 other siblings. He got hired as a carpenter by Alden B. Dow and has built homes lived in by some of Midland's most notable leaders over the years, as well as his own home and some of his children's houses. He continued building houses with his brother by forming Bartos Construction, and "slowed down" enough to maintain an extensive backyard garden starting in the early 1980s.
"When I was growing up, I was farming all the time. You need a garden," Bartos said.
At the beginning of August, Bartos harvests his vegetable garden with his family and gives away all the fresh produce to community. The notion of selling his homegrown vegetables seems unfathomable to Bartos.
"I've gardened every year and never sold a thing out of that garden," he said.
This year, Bartos planted a row of Illinois extra sweet corn in August and continued planting a new row every seven days until the very end of June, switching over to a hybrid corn crop on the opposite end of the vegetable garden.
There are no trace of weeds around any of the plants. Bartos says he takes care of them by prepping the garden bed with a rototiller before planting, and immediately squashing any unwanted weeds with a hoe as soon as they peek out of the ground during the growing season.
At this point in the season, maintaining the garden "is easy" Bartos claims, but at the beginning of the season he puts his time in. The attention-oriented gardener stakes plants, rigs up an electrical fence to ward off raccoons from knocking down corn ears, and has all of his vegetable rows measured off and labeled down to a science.
"When we were on the farm, we had nothing," Bartos said. "We would go down to where I later built houses and tried to peddle strawberries and cream, and homemade butter."
Bartos has constructed about 125 to 150 houses, he said. He still works building homes and churches while maintaining 20 acres of property around his own house with his wife, Patricia. The two have been married since 1950.
"Guess how much I paid for these 20 acres?" Bartos said with a wide grin.
Bartos said with a laugh that he paid $2,000 for the plot of land he has turned into a full-fledged vegetable garden, pole barn, what used to serve as a horse stable, and of course his home.
NAIROBI - Burundi's environment minister was shot dead in the capital Bujumbura early Sunday, police said, the first killing of its kind since the country was plunged into political turmoil two years ago. Emmanuel Niyonkuru, 54, the country's water, environment and planning minister, was killed shortly after midnight, according to a tweet sent by police spokesman Pierre Nkurikiye.
The murder, the first of a serving government minister since Burundi sank into turmoil over President Pierre Nkurunziza's controversial bid for a third term in 2015, comes after months of relative calm. "Minister of water and environment killed by a criminal with a gun on his way home to Rohero, around 00:45," Nkurikiye wrote four hours after the incident. He added that a woman had been arrested following the "assassination" although the motive for the attack was not immediately clear.
Also on Twitter, Nkurunziza offered his condolences "to the family and all Burundians", vowing the crime would be punished. The murder comes days after Nkurunziza hinted he might seek a constitutional amendment allowing him a fourth term in 2020. "If the people request it, we won't betray the confidence of the country, we won't betray the confidence of the people," Nkurunziza said Friday.
OAKLAND >> Stephen Curry will likely go from being the NBAs the biggest bargain to signing the richest contract in the league at more than $200 million. And he looks forward to the nice payday.
Yet the two-time reigning MVP and new NBA Finals MVP Kevin Durant said Wednesday they would consider taking less money to keep the core of the champion Golden State Warriors intact.
It would mean everything. What weve built here is truly special, its unique, its something that you dont want to see end at all, Curry said. All the pieces that we have are important to the equation of winning a championship and competing for a championship every single year. It is a business. There are decisions that need to be made every single year and youve got to assess the situation as it is.
... As we go into the talks and this whole process, which is obviously new for me, I will approach it to get the most out of it I can as an individual, as a player, and something that Ive been working for for a very long time. In the context of keeping the team together, if there are decisions that need to be made, well talk about it for sure.

Two days after capturing the franchises second title in three years against LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Warriors prepared to part ways for what will be a busy offseason for general manager Bob Myers and the front office.
Durant said he has no question in his mind he will be back with the Warriors. He hinted he would opt out of a deal that pays him the maximum he can get in order to help Golden States chances of re-signing players such as Andre Iguodala or Shaun Livingston  two key reserves on both title teams.
Its the business of basketball obviously so nothing is for sure, but here I feel like we can work that out and well have a chance to do this again next year, Durant said. Its easier said than done obviously, but thats the goal. We want to keep this thing together and see how we can continue to keep getting better.
The group that recruited Durant in the Hamptons that day last summer has the same philosophy about winning more championships. Along with Curry that day were Iguodala, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson.
I do know me and KD had a conversation along with Draymond and Klay and Andre last year before he even showed up that that was kind of the identity of who we are as a team that we understand how important it is, the guys that are here, Curry said. You dont want anybody to have to sacrifice in that sense, you dont want to force anybody to take that approach but at the end of the day we know whats best for us as a group going forward. Were going to do everything we can to keep this team together. Ill have that mindset, KDs going to have that mindset, I know Dre, Shaun, all the guys that are up for negotiating a new contract. Well see what happens. The beauty of what I know of this team, we all want to provide for our families, we want to get all that we can out of this game while we still have the legs to do it, but there are no egos when it comes to that side of the equation when it comes to us as professional athletes.
Curry and Durant also heard from former President Barack Obama with congratulations, though Durant said he was most excited that among 200 messages was a text from a high school girlfriend he didnt realize still had his number.
While the Warriors havent formally met to discuss whether they will visit President Donald Trumps White House as is customary for championship teams, Curry said his mind hasnt changed from when he was asked earlier this year about the possibility. Coach Steve Kerr also has been outspoken about issues with Trump.
Somebody asked me about it a couple months ago like the hypothetical if a championship were to happen what would I do and I think I answered I wouldnt go. Still feel like that today, Curry said. But obviously as a team were going to have a conversation. This is a moment that we all need to enjoy together. Nothing should distract from what we were able to accomplish together and the different kind of ceremonies that have happened around championship-winning teams. We dont want that to taint what weve accomplished this year so well handle that accordingly and responsibly and do the right thing for us individually and as a group.
Who needs a press release in 2017 when you can just create a meme with your news and put it out on Instagram? Alexander Wang took the modern route to getting his news out there on Tuesday, when the New York designer posted on his personal Instagram a fairly elaborate video meme with a not-so-thinly veiled accusation that Philipp Plein's January 2017 Plein Sport collection show in Milan copied his 2014 show with H&M.
The meme read: Can I copy your homework? Yeah [sic] just change it up a bit so it doesn't look like you copied OK The subsequent video goes on to show remarkable similarities in the shows, from the race track-inspired sets to looks with athletic harnesses and even a similar designer bow, as both designers ran and waved after their respective finales.
Neither Wang nor Plein's camps responded to requests for comments.
The Wang Instagram post comes less than 24 hours after Plein made headlines showing his eponymous collection at New York Fashion Week on Monday.
The German-born Plein held his celeb-laden extravaganza — a motley crew of sorts including Madonna, Nas, Desiigner and First Daughter Tiffany Trump — at the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue. In addition to people dressed up as the Statue of Liberty and Times Square's famous “Naked Cowboy,” he had the Internet-famous “hot felon” open his show.

Plan? What plan? Thats the problem with the Red Wings as their extended off season begins.
Missing the playoffs for the first time in more than a quarter century is one thing, uncertainty moving forward another.
General manager Ken Holland has made it clear the Red Wings arent going into total rebuilding mode. OK, so what is the plan?
Identifying issues the Red Wings must correct doesnt require channeling hockey gods. Figuring out the fixes is much more complex.
Advertisement
It begins with Holland, coach Jeff Blashill and the entire Red Wings organization being honest to themselves.
The Red Wings troubles last season were not a one-year fluke. They were not just the product of injuries. The Red Wings were not a good team. Period.
The organization must stop looking at even the most basic hockey metrics, which cut open the Red Wings for what they really are, as if they are some sort of bizarre rocket science that should be banned from hockey fans across Canada, the United States and Newfoundland...
You know, like Corsi FC% in close games. All it is a simple formula which determines puck possession in games that are within a goal or tied at even strength. The importance is one team is not attacking or laying back more than the other based on score. The objective strategically is essentially the same.
Last season, the Red Wings were 28th in the NHL at 47.4 percent in that revealing situation, ahead of only Colorado and Arizona. They need to get that percentage over 51 percent. How? The eyeball test - and the metrics of the Red Wings defensive corps player by player - suggests they need to move the puck way better out of their own end. It is a constant struggle. Crystal clear. Painful. But somehow, some way, the Red Wings must find puck moving defensemen.
Even strength in close games is just one measure. Others, obviously, are special teams and goalie play. They are equalizers. The Red Wings power play was ranked 27th in the NHL with just a 15.1 percent success rate. Again, it goes back to the blue line. Other than veteran Mike Green, who ideally would be quarterbacking a second power unit, there is just not a lot there. Danny DeKeyser had a very disappointing season. Nick Jensen was OK - for Nick Jensen. Niklas Kronwall is not the player he used to be, although he could fit effectively (his puck possession metrics did rise later in the season as his health improved) in a more limited role. But the Red Wings desperately need a No.1 defensive pairing.
Free agency is a losing proposition for the most part. Value for value trades are necessary. You have to give up something to get something. Time for Holland to dip his toe in the hot tub and be right as he enters the final season of his current contract.
Goaltending is a problem for the Red Wings. Chances of Las Vegas taking the contracts of either Petr Mrazek or Jimmy Howard off their hands ($9.5 million combined in a hard salary cap league in 2017-18) in the expansion draft is wishful thinking. The Red Wings were 25th in save percentage in 2016-17.
Given Howards age and Mrazeks decline, and none of their recent goalie draft picks being remotely ready for the NHL, the Red Wings would be wise to overhaul their goaltending. How? It gets back to trades.
This isnt to suggest the Red Wings situation is hopeless. Its rather to point out it will be if they continue to spin their wheels in the direction of overvaluing their own players, relying solely on free agency to make upgrades and refusing to ever, really, shake up the deck with trades.
The statistics from this past season - conventional and metrics - dont lie.
Denying the facts would be foolish.

Based on the light camouflage seen in these photos, it looks like BMW is nearly finished developing the new X5. Considering the current X5 went on sale back in late 2013, that's probably a good thing. The plug-in hybrid version made an interesting addition to the lineup for 2016, but if BMW wants to outsell competitors like the Mercedes-Benz GLE, Acura MDX, and Cadillac XT5, the X5 needs a significant update.
Our spy photographer caught this prototype driving around wearing only basic camouflage, which means we can finally see some of the exterior design details. In general, the changes aren't especially drastic, but the reshaped headlights and taillights are relatively easy to make out. In profile, there's also a new character line that kicks up to highlight the rear fenders. It looks like designers left the air vent behind the front wheels, too.
The biggest change we can see, however, is to the X5's fascia. The current double kidney grille isn't exactly tiny, but the one on this prototype is absolutely massive. Whether we like it or not, it looks like the X7 iPerformance concept‘s huge grille will end up on more than just the production X7. Considering that the 2018 X3 made it to production without the controversial front end, we thought there was a chance the X5 might get a similar treatment. As it turns out, we were wrong.
Since we still haven't seen a completely undisguised X5, there's a chance we're being too hard on its new front end. But on the other hand, that grill looks humongous.

BIRMINGHAM-Professionalism will be pitted against passion when defending champions India square off with Bangladesh in the second semi-final of the ICC Champions Trophy, here on Thursday.
On paper, India are overwhelming favourites against the next door neighbours but in a game of glorious uncertainties, it will be foolhardy to count Bangladesh out of equation. Especially after their inspirational ‘come from behind' victory against New Zealand that paved the way for their semi-final berth.
India, after a clinical performance against South Africa, would like to maintain the same intensity against a team that could prove to be a proverbial banana peel for them.
Batsmen in form, bowlers on target and fielding top notch—Virat Kohli's men have covered all bases so far and Mashrafe Mortaza's men—after their lucky entry into semi- finals—will have to pull off something really special at the Edgbaston Cricket Ground tomorrow.
For India, nothing short of a place in the summit round will satisfy them while Bangladesh are standing at the cusp of what could be the biggest day in their cricketing history, if they manage to pull off a victory.
A victory for India will be par for the course for which they won't possibly get the credit that one gets for beating Australia, South Africa or England. But a defeat will lead to unparalleled criticism from fans and critics alike with some of the uncomfortable behind the scene happenings (like the alleged Anil Kumble-Virat Kohli rift) again raising their head.
It will be interesting to see if India retain Ravichandran Ashwin or bring Umesh Yadav back as his pace scared the Bangladeshi batsmen during their 240-run thrashing in a warm-up game. In case of Bangladesh, their aim will be to repeat the performance of the 2007 World Cup of opener in Port of Spain—still a ‘Red Letter Day' in cricketing history.
Four members of that side—skipper Mashrafe Mortaza, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim and Tamim Iqbal—are stars of this current line-up.
One Day cricket is one format where perhaps Bangladesh have the best chance of beating India. This is a format which is neither too long like Test cricket where temperament is challenged nor too short like T20 where quick-on-the-feet innovation is required. Fifty overs is adequate time in which the tiny nation have gained its mojo in the past 3 years building a reasonably good unit that can put up a fight.
They have shown they could do that during the 2015 home series which they won 2-1, thanks to the then teenage sensation Mustafizur Rahaman and his deadly cutters. But the 50-over India versus Bangladesh contests have never been short of drama—thanks to the overtly passionate fans and media.
‘Tigers', as they are referred to have such a passionate following that their country's media has been successfully able to ‘marry' nationalism with cricket taking it to an altogether different level. An interesting anecdote will reveal how cricket and nationalism has been inter-linked in Bangladesh's social life and even cricketers have been voluntarily a part of it.
It is learnt that the entire Bangladesh team was watching the England versus Australia game together. Once England's victory ensured Bangladesh's qualification, their strike bowler Taskin Ahmed started singing a popular song with others joining in chorus. The song is the extremely popular Bengali rendition ‘Amra Korbo Joy' of Pete Seeger's iconic ‘We Shall Overcome'. The entire team joined in chorus and they uploaded the video on facebook, which acquired millions of hits.
Bangladeshis treat cricket as more than a game. If cricket is religion in India, it's beyond that in Bangladesh.
It's a getaway from all the worries of poverty, unemployment and other teething issues. The 2015 World Cup quarter-final against India at the MCG still sticks out like a sore thumb for the Bangladesh players and fans alike.
They still believe that Rohit Sharma was out as Rubel Hossain bowled a perfectly legal delivery. One can't justify that given that even if 40 runs were deducted from Rohit's final score of 137, Bangladesh would have still lost that game.
They believe that Mahmudullah Riyadh could have won them the match had Shikhar Dhawan's contentious claim for a catch at the boundary line not been upheld by the umpires. The one-run defeat at Bangalore in a ICC World T20 match last year still hurts them bad—a testimony to which was Mushfiqur Rahim's classless tweet after India's semi-final departure.
The former skipper had to delete it after instructions from the Bangladesh Cricket Board. While coach Chandika Hathurusingha tries to instill some sense of calmness playing the ‘underdog card', there are people in Bangladesh camp, who already, in their dreams, have set their foot in the final.
Just man to man—Bangladesh are no match for the Indian team despite having quality in their ranks. The opening pair of Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma are far better than Tamim Iqbal or Soumya Sarkar. However, Tamim has been in good form in the tournament despite a strike-rate in mid 70s. No one in their dreams would compare Imrul Kayes or Sabbir Rahaman with Virat Kohli's class.
Mahendra Singh Dhoni is a legend in 50-overs cricket where Mushfiqur Rahim is still an inconsistent player. Mahmudullah Riyadh is a gutsy match-winner but Yuvraj Singh playing his 300th match is in a different league. Mashrafe, Taskin, Rubel and Mustafizur are a good attack on a given day and that's Bangladesh's best chance to upset India. But even there, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya have more quality.
INDIA: Virat Kohli (captain), Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Yuvraj Singh, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Kedar Jadhav, Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jasprit Bumrah, Umesh Yadav, Ajinkya Rahane, Ravichandran Ashwin, Dinesh Karthik, Mohammed Shami.
BANGLADESH: Mashrafe Mortaza (captain), Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Soumya Sarkar, Sabbir Rahaman, Mahmudullah Riyadh, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), Rubel Hossain, Mustafizur Rahaman, Taskin Ahmed, Mehedi Hossain Miraz, Mossadek Hossain, Sunzamul Islam, Shafiul Islam.
Key Players
Shikhar Dhawan
Indian opener Shikhar Dhawan has been in brilliant form in the Champions Trophy. Recently he became the fastest player to reach 1000 runs in ICC ODI tournaments. It may be recalled here that in the last edition of Champions Trophy, Dhawan had a phenomenal outing. IF he can replicate his form then Bangladesh may well have a tough time.
Yuvraj Singh
Only four men have played 300 ODIs for India so far. On Thursday, Yuvraj Singh will join Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and M Azharuddin in that illustrious list. Yuvraj began the tournament with a bang at this very venue, with a Man of the Match show against Pakistan. London wasn't as kind to him, though he had a nice unbeaten cameo against South Africa.
Yuvraj has done it often on the big stage, and there is something to be said for the extra motivation veterans can get when a landmark moment such as this arrives. If Yuvraj can channel that into another free-flowing innings, then no bowler in any opposition is safe.
Tamim Iqbal
The experienced opener began the tournament with a bang, and was also the only one to emerge with credit for his team in the washout against Australia. The first-over duck against New Zealand dented his numbers somewhat, but it would have only served to whet his appetite. The Bangladesh team has a few new members , but in Tamim it has a rock at top.
Shakib Al Hasan
Middle order batsman and bowling allrounder Shakib Al Hasan showed his class with the bat against New Zealand. He will be the one to watch out for because if he strikes form then Bangladesh may well spring a surprise. His bowling and batting skills would be crucial for Bangladesh if they want to go into the final of the mega event.

Special Agent Jeff Seipenko, center, listens as Genesee District Judge David Guinn authorizes charges Wednesday, June 14, 2017, in Flint, Mich., for Department of Health and Human Services Director Nick Lyon and Chief Medical Executive Dr. Eden Wells in relation to the Flint water crisis. Lyon is accused of failing to alert the public about an outbreak of Legionnaires disease in the Flint area, which has been linked by some experts to poor water quality in 2014-15. Wells was charged with obstruction of justice and lying to a police officer. (Jake May/The Flint Journal-MLive.com via AP)
FLINT, Mich.>> Five people, including the head of Michigans health department, were charged Wednesday with involuntary manslaughter in an investigation of Flints lead-contaminated water, all blamed in the death of an 85-year-old man who had Legionnaires disease.
Nick Lyon is the highest-ranking member of Republican Gov. Rick Snyders administration to be snagged in a criminal investigation of how Flints water system became poisoned after officials tapped the Flint River in 2014.
Lyon, 48, the director of the Health and Human Services Department, is accused of failing to alert the majority-black population about an outbreak of Legionnaires disease in the Flint area, which has been linked by some experts to poor water quality in 2014-15.
If convicted, Lyon could face up to 15 years in prison.

The health crisis in Flint has created a trust crisis for Michigan government, exposing a serious lack of confidence in leaders who accept responsibility and solve problems, said state Attorney General Bill Schuette, who said his probe is moving to the trial phase and signaled that Snyder, who has apologized for his administrations failures that led to and prolonged the crisis, may not be charged.
We only file criminal charges when evidence of probable cause of a crime has been established. And were not filing charges at this time, he said.
Lyon also is charged with misconduct in office for allegedly obstructing university researchers who are studying if the surge in cases was linked to the Flint River.
The others are people who were already facing charges. They are: Darnell Earley, who was Flints emergency manager when the city used the river; Howard Croft, who ran Flints public works department; Liane Shekter Smith; and Stephen Busch. Shekter Smith and Busch were state environmental regulators.
The states chief medical officer, Dr. Eden Wells, 54, was charged Wednesday with obstruction of justice and lying to an investigator.
Dr. Wells vehemently denies the charges, defense attorney Jerry Lax said.
Shekter Smiths lawyer, Brian Morley, said: Its my understanding neither she nor the Department of Environmental Quality were responsible for legionella issues. So I fail to see why the charge is being filed against Liane.
Other attorneys in the case have not returned calls seeking comment from The Associated Press.
Snyder expressed support for Lyon and Wells.
Director Lyon and Dr. Wells have been and continue to be instrumental in Flints recovery, he said in a statement. They have my full faith and confidence, and will remain on duty at DHHS.
Flint began using water from the Flint River while under state emergency management, but did not treat it to reduce corrosion. Toxic lead from old plumbing leached into the water system, causing elevated levels in children and leaving residents to drink and bathe with bottled or filtered water.
Some experts also have linked the water to Legionnaires disease, a type of pneumonia caused by bacteria that thrive in warm water and infect the lungs. People can get sick if they inhale mist or vapor, typically from cooling systems.
There were nearly 100 cases in the Flint area, including 12 deaths, in 2014 and 2015.
Lyon, Croft, Earley, Shekter Smith and Busch are blamed in the death of Robert Skidmore in December 2015. He was admitted to McClaren Flint hospital in June 2015 with symptoms consistent with pneumonia. He died at home six months later.
Lyon was personally briefed in January 2015 but took no action to alert the public of a deadly outbreak until nearly a year later, special agent Jeff Seipenko told a judge as the charges were filed.
Lyon has admitted that he was aware of the Legionnaires outbreak for months but wanted to delay saying anything public until state Health and Human Services Department investigators finished their own probe.
He told state lawmakers that experts likely wanted to solve the problem before they raised it with senior officials in the Snyder administration. The investigation, he said, wasnt one that was easily solved.
Schuette has now charged 15 current or former government officials in an ongoing probe that began in early 2016, including two emergency managers whom Snyder appointed to run the impoverished city of roughly 100,000 residents. The Michigan Civil Rights Commission issued a report in February blaming systemic racism going back decades for the problems that caused the water crisis in Flint.
In March, Corrine Miller, the states former director of disease control, was sentenced to probation and ordered to write an apology to residents after pleading no contest to willful neglect of duty. She is a key cooperating witness for Schuettes team.

You win some, and you lose some. That's what Zoo Atlanta is learning after losing its Super Bowl bet to Rhode Island's Roger Williams Park Zoo and Carousel Village.
After losing the wager, the Atlanta zoo had to name one of its baby animals after Super Bowl MVP and New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.
With over 220 species and 1,500 animals, the zoo decided to name a Madagascar hissing cockroach after Brady. The official announcement was made on Instagram.

NEW YORK-Thousands of people crammed into New York City's Times Square on Saturday, in a raucous atmosphere with tight security, for the traditional ball drop.
At about 6:00 pm (2300 GMT), the giant sphere was hoisted to the top of the 43-meter (141-feet) post at the landmark crossroads with its towering buildings and huge neon lights.
Once lit, the ball glittered brightly and sparkled in the night sky just as some of the first fireworks crackled in the background. At a minute before midnight, according to tradition, New York's mayor, Bill de Blasio, will press the button that starts the drop. He will be joined this year by outgoing United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon.
Then comes the confetti, and the cheers of people around the world.
More than a million people are expected in Times Square to mark this New Year's tradition, observed every year since 1907 except the war years of 1942 and 1943.
On the heels of recent bomb attacks in Berlin and Nice, New York deployed some 7,000 police and dozens of garbage trucks to “strategic” locations to prevent vehicles from crushing the crowd.
The atmosphere seemed fairly relaxed and many police posed alongside tourists for “selfies” that visitors shared on social media.
“It's the best place in the world to be on New Year's Eve,” said Alma Alanis, a lawyer from Mexico with her companion, Eduardo Chavarria.
They arrived at midday, wrapped up in coats, to hold out until midnight.
“We have wanted to come here for many years, because it has to be seen, it is magic,” said Jerome Nicolas from central France.
“As soon as there is a crowd, we cannot help but think of the attacks,” said his wife Sandrine, referring to a series of massacres this year around the globe.
Leann Krieger, who traveled from Missouri with several former colleagues, voiced some trepidation about the incoming American president, Donald Trump.
“I hope for the best because there's nothing we can do about it,” she said.

Conor McGregor will face a lawsuit if he attempts to kick Floyd Mayweather during their $500million mega-fight.
The UFC champion has agreed to face the best boxer of his generation in Las Vegas on August 26.
But he will be shorn of the mixed martial arts skill set that saw him crowned a two-weight champion last year.
UFC president Dana White said: "That [kicking] will not happen; it's in the contract. This is a boxing match under the Nevada commission under the rules of boxing.
"We talk about a guy of Floyd Mayweather's value in the sport - the lawsuit if that ever happened...
"Conor loves money and he would lose a lot of money if that happened."

McGregor beat Eddie Alvarez last November to win the UFC's lightweight belt, 11 months on from winning the featherweight crown by beating Jose Aldo.
But he has never fought a professional boxer - and Mayweather is unbeaten in his previous 49 contests.
TORONTO – Ontario's fiscal watchdog says the Liberal government will run a deficit this fiscal year, despite claims it has balanced the budget.
In a new report today, the Financial Accountability Office says the Liberals will run a $4 billion deficit in 2017-2018.
By 2021-2022, the FAO projects the government's budget deficit will grow to $9.8 billion.
The FAO also says the government's new Fair Hydro Plan, which cuts hydro rates by 25 per cent, will add $3.2 billion to the budget deficit by 2021-2022.
READ MORE: Financial Accountability Office warns of continued budget deficits in Ontario
The Liberals presented a balanced budget in the spring, a year ahead of the provincial election, and have promised to keep the books in balance through the next couple of years.
Last year, Ontario's auditor general questioned the province's decision to include a pair of public pensions — the Ontario Public Service Employee's Union Pension Plan and the Ontario Teacher's Pension Plan — as assets on its balance sheet.
The FAO says in its report that since the government has not adopted the auditor's recommended accounting for both the pension assets, and with the addition of the Fair Hydro Plan, it is becoming more difficult for legislators and the public to assess the government's fiscal projections.
DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - The chief minister of Germany's state of North Rhine-Westphalia has been elected to the board of the foundation that is the largest shareholder in engineering group ThyssenKrupp (TKAG.DE), it said on Monday. Armin Laschet of the conservative Christian Democratic Union party CDU is sworn in after being elected as North Rhine-Westphalia's federal state premier in Duesseldorf, Germany, June 27, 2017. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay The election for a seven-year term of Armin Laschet, from Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, comes as ThyssenKrupp seeks to diversify away from its traditional focus on steel. “The membership is not tied to the position of chief minister. It is the individual who is elected, as with all other members,” the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation said in a statement. The foundation controls more than 20 percent in ThyssenKrupp, which has agreed to merge its steel operations with those of India's Tata Steel (TISC.NS) and is focusing on growth areas like elevators and auto components. Labour leaders have urged the state government to take a more active interest in ThyssenKrupp to minimise possible job losses that may result from the steel merger. The state's previous chief minister, Social Democrat Hannelore Kraft, was a member of the Krupp foundation board but stood down after losing an election in May.

Islamabad-Health experts on Tuesday advised the mothers to avoid using formula milk for their infants to protect them from medical complications.
According to them, the exclusive breastfeeding rate in Pakistan was the lowest among South Asian region, which was 37.1 per cent where as the rate of bottle-feeding was higher in Pakistan in south Asian region, which was 32.1 per cent.
“These indications were thought-provoking as well as alarming as many infants die every year in the country due to complications from using formula milk,” Dr Sobia Faisal, a public health expert said.
She said that these infants could be saved by implementing the breastfeeding practices and avoiding formula milk of national or international brand.
Many formula milk companies had been working in the country to attract the mothers, he added.
She said these companies through promotional advertisement and innovative planning capture the attention of mothers who consider using formula milk the best option for their babies.
Dr Sobia said in Pakistan, 77 infants died out of 1000 live births every year.
Out of these 57 are those who die before reaching one month of age due to diarrhoea, pneumonia, respiratory infections and malnutrition.
A major source of these diseases was lack of exclusive breastfeeding, use of unhygienic bottles, formula milk and teats, she added.
By avoiding formula milk and encouraging mother-milk, child and maternal mortality rate could be controlled, she added. Dr Wasim Khawaja from Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) said that there were wide range of different formula milk brands and types while formula milk came in different forms.
He said that World Health Organization (WHO) had recommended breastfeeding as the best choice for babies as it helped defend against infections, prevent allergies, and protect against a number of chronic conditions.
He said that breast milk was the natural first food for babies as it provided all the energy and nutrients that the infant needed for the first months of life, and it continued to provide up to half or more of a child's nutritional needs up to second year of life.
Boosting breastfeeding rates would significantly reduce costs to families for treatment of childhood illnesses such as pneumonia, diarrhoea and asthma, he added.
Dr Sharif Astori from Federal Government Polyclinic (FGPC) said that exclusive breastfeeding reduced infant mortality due to common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea or pneumonia, and helped for a quicker recovery during illness.
He said that breastfeeding contributed to the health and well-being of mothers as it helped to space children, reduced the risk of ovarian cancer and breast cancer.
When contacted, an official from the Ministry of National Health Services said that the ministry was working on awareness strategy to educate mothers on importance of breastfeeding and negative impacts of formula milk use on infants' health.
He said that the ministry was committed to protecting the health and lives of infants by notifying concerned rules and regulations.
Several others steps were being taken to improving mother and child health, he added.

UNFORTUNATELY the Chinese couple who was abducted from Quetta was killed mercilessly and many claims before and after their abductions have made the case curious. According to media reports the Chinese couple working in Pakistan was kidnapped by armed men pretending to be policemen around midday on May 24, 2017.
It was reported by eye witnesses that they were dragged into a vehicle without number plates by three unknown men and a bystander was shot also who tried to stop abduction. No group claimed responsibility of kidnapping and Chinese Embassy in Pakistan, after their seizure highlighted that the pair had been studying Urdu at a language centre. Local police however earlier stated that they were teaching Mandarin, Chinese language in some institutions in Balochistan. In the first week of June, IS came up with a claim that they have killed Chinese nationals who were abducted. The assertion by the IS which is still to be verified, came after the announcement of successful operation against IS affiliated militants in Balochistan was carried out.
Conversely, recent investigations after the Chinese killing narrate another side of story. It was revealed that the Chinese couple, which was abducted from Quetta last month and was later allegedly killed, belonged to a group of Chinese people who had obtained a business visa for Pakistan but were engaged in preaching. They were hired by some Korean company who secretly wanted to assign task of evangelisation. Pakistan's Interior Ministry report mentions that the couple was part of a group of Chinese citizens who obtained business visa from the Pakistani Embassy in Beijing but instead of carrying out any business activity they went to Quetta where they were engaged in preaching activities in the disguise of learning Urdu language from a Korean national.
Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar mentioned that it was highly unfortunate that a misuse of the terms of business visa contributed to the unfortunate incident of abduction and subsequent murder. “Where the government makes every effort to provide security to foreigners, the visiting foreign nationals are equally bound to abide by the terms and conditions of their visas and inform local authorities about their movements and activities in view of the security requirements, if any”, he asserted. One of the media sources about the undertakings of Chinese mentions that the institute which brands itself as language teaching institute was in fact clandestinely preaching Christianity. They were operating with the help of underground Church where they were assigned tasks to campaign Christianity to female populace of Balochistan. They adopted different tactics to entice people towards Christianity.
Consequently the unfortunate killing of this Chinese couple has raised grim points to be deliberated by the both countries. Firstly, it is seen as a threat to CPEC and can be an effort by adversaries to sabotage this project by maligning its image as an insecure area for development in Pakistan. China is backing huge investment in its South Asian neighbour as part of its OBOR flagship project that will link its far-western Xinjiang region to Gwadar port in Balochistan with a series of infrastructure, power and transport upgrades. In past and till today a far cry is heard from those who are in constant effort to sabotage this friendship corridor. Secondly in Pakistan, enrolment in Mandarin-language courses has increased rapidly and resultantly exchange programs will make their entry progressively.
At this point both the countries need to pay attention as the fake expatriates may take advantage of these exchange programs cunningly and might involve in some kind of nefarious activities in country. Thirdly for business purposes or tourist happenings visa policy on both sides needs review. Visa or entry permits should be issued after complete investigations. On both sides record and data bank of personnel be shared with complete privacy and database authorities must be vigilant enough in performing their assigned tasks. Fourthly, Pakistan has been through jeopardy of militancy for more than a decade and the resource rich province of Baluchistan has always remained target of antagonists. In fact, bordering Iran and Afghanistan, this province has gone through many ups and down because of separatist movements and other political enmities on resources.
Fifthly, even though the CPEC which is now a harbinger of economic boon for this province and Pakistan, this fact cannot be denied that to incapacitate this project and make Chinese nationals afraid of working in Pakistan particularly Balochistan this attempt of Chinese couple abduction and later killing was made. However if they were secretly working for other objectives then China too has to be watchful and check elements which are trying to damage friendly relations between both countries. Sixthly, Pakistan has to review the affinities of militant groups and handle them with full strength who are trying to create space for IS to operate in Pakistan.
Definitely in past a greater thrust has reduced violence in country but if militancy is rearing its head again then it should be crushed timely. In the end it is important to mention that media is very powerful tool which can uplift and downside anything anytime. Western and foreign media fabricated stories in their desired way and tried to portray that relations between China and Pakistan were reserved after Chinese abductions and this was prominent in SCO meeting which is totally false. So before believing, thinking is must!

A Hamilton man is in a Las Vegas hospital with life-threatening injuries after he was hit by a car.
Police say Michael Hilson, 53, was struck by a car just before 4 a.m. Thursday morning while crossing E. Sunset Road.
The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department says Hilson was not at a crosswalk when he was struck by the vehicle.
The 59-year-old driver of the car remained at the scene and police say the man did not show signs of impairment.

Hilson was an accountant with Philip Services Corp. when he went public with concerns about his employer in 1995.
In a letter to the Ministry of the Environment, Hilson accused Philip Services of negotiating a secret deal with the provincial NDP government to work around the regulatory approval process and transform a Philip quarry into the Stoney Creek landfill.
Hilson was fired, but won a wrongful dismissal case against the now-bankrupt company.
The BC Civil Liberties Association has released a report asking for a third party to handle complaints against the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA).
The human rights group is complaining that unlike police, the CBSA has no independent oversight of its actions.
“There's no independent body that people can take a complaint to if they've been treated unfairly, there's nobody that's charged with reviewing the policies and practices of CBSA to ensure that they comply with the human rights of the vulnerable populations that CBSA interacts with every day,” said Laura Track, a lawyer with the group.
READ MORE: Independent monitoring in store for Canada Border Services Agency
She says the group wants to see a strategy implemented, including a complaint and an oversight department.
“We can't rely simply on vulnerable refugee claimants, for example, to make complaints about treatment by CBSA when they are relying on CBSA officers for their ability to stay in Canada.”
The CBSA says the government is committed to ensuring that “our border services are world class and worthy of the trust of Canadians.” It adds that in order to accomplish those two things, a review agency of some nature is required and the Public Safety Minister intends to establish that following public consultation.
BERLIN (Reuters) - Bayern Munich struggled to a scrappy 1-0 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday but it was still enough to stretch their Bundesliga lead to eight points and make sure they will stay top when the winter break starts this month.

The German champions, who showed none of the spark that lifted them to a 3-1 win over Paris St Germain in the Champions League on Tuesday, needed an Arturo Vidal header in the 20th minute to edge past the hosts, who have the league's second-best defence.
Bavaria moved eight points clear of RB Leipzig who drew 2-2 with Mainz 05. There are two matchdays left until the winter break.
Schalke 04 stayed third, a point behind on 26, after drawing 1-1 against Borussia Moenchengladbach courtesy of defender Jannik Vestergaard's own goal on the hour.
“It was a hard piece of work for us today,” Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes told reporters. “The (unofficial) ‘autumn championship' is not that important. What is important is that we won and extended our lead.”

Bayern are chasing a record-extending sixth consecutive Bundesliga title.
“The table looks good and so does the lead but I will not be shooting off any fireworks,” Heynckes said.

Borussia Dortmund's dire season continued with a 2-1 home loss to strugglers Werder Bremen which is likely to hasten the departure of coach Peter Bosz.
Dortmund, without a league win since late September, walked off amid loud jeers and whistles from their fans as they dropped to seventh place on 22 points.
Dortmund's top scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang briefly gave them hope when he cancelled out Maximilian Eggestein's 26th- minute lead but Theodor Gebre Selassie scored the winner in the 65th with the hosts failing to pose any serious threat.
“It is difficult to talk to the team after such a loss,” Dutchman Bosz said. “We had to win this game. I have never seen a worse first half since I came here.”
Leal and Lolita Smith live a split life. They spend most of the year living in Indianapolis but also spend a few months in Prattville. They have more than 30 acres. More than a decade ago they came up with an idea to share their little piece of paradise with others.
“You really have to come here and see it for yourself,” said Lolita Smith.
They named it Kingston Gardens. The mission statement here is pretty simple: To create an annual (now bi-annual) informative celebration of family and neighbors togetherness in the community. And also to support families and neighbors by offering them the opportunity to meet and socialize with other families who share their values.
So basically, a place where everyone can get together, fellowship and relax. They usually do a festival every other October. There won't be one this year, but still neighbors and friends like to come out to this peaceful playground and just relax.
“We started in 2003 with the first festival,” said Lolita.
When you come out here you'll find a little bit of everything. There are flags all over the place. There are state flags representing the homes of people who've come to visit. There's also a flag dedicated to the military.
Leal has put up signs all over the property that make you think. They're kind of like super-sized word games. They have also turned old bikes into yard art. He also has a collection of license plates from all over the country. He also has a unique appreciation for some of his little friends.
“I have a passion for ants,” said Leal Smith. “I just can't kill them. I just walk away because they have to live here too. Ants are really unique. I like their lifestyle.”
He loves them so much he's built some ant yard art. He's hoping these educational insects will help teach others who've come to visit. Leal has seen the whole country. Before he retired he drove motor coaches.
During his tour of America he saw some things he really liked. And he's trying to bring some of that American flavor to his piece of land in Prattville. The Smith's visit four times a year and said they will let us know if they do a Kingston Gardens festival next year.

Amid controversy surrounding Harvey Weinstein, Weinstein Co. has "decided to withdraw" from Outfest's Legacy Awards, where the company was set to be honored as a corporate trailblazer by the LGBTQ festival later this month.
The festival's executive director, Christopher Racster, said in a letter that after conversations with the company, the following message was received Friday morning:
"Because we wholeheartedly support Outfest and its mission to preserve LGBTQ cinema, we have decided to withdraw from The Legacy Awards at this time. We do not want to overshadow the extraordinary achievements of the other honorees."
Outfest's Legacy Awards, set for Oct. 22, is an annual fundraiser for the organization. It will continue, honoring Laverne Cox and Rita Moreno with trailblazer and ally awards, respectively.
"Both of these women have fought and stood up for the basic human rights of all people to be treated fairly, especially within a culture in Hollywood that has at times discriminated against them," Racster continued in his letter.
Weinstein Co. was originally selected for the corporate honor "for its innovative portrayal of the LGBT community" in film, a previous news release said. It has released award-winning pictures such as "Carol," "The Imitation Game," "Philomena" and "Transamerica."
The funds from the gala, which started 12 years ago, support the Outfest UCLA Legacy Project, which preserves LGBTQ moving images.

Mumbai: The Bombay High Court on Wednesday said any incident pertaining to civic amenities in the city which affects citizens was the responsibility of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and that it cannot pass the buck to other authorities.
A division bench of Justices N H Patil and G S Kulkarni was hearing a public interest litigation filed by Smita Dhruva, president of the Indian National Congress, South Mumbai division, after 23 people were killed in a stampede at Elphinstone Road station bridge in September last year. The petition sought the railways to take measures for better crowd management.
In yet another incident, an over-bridge at a railway station in Mumbai's Andheri suburb collapsed on Tuesday during heavy rains, disrupting train services and injuring five people. Referring to Tuesday's incident, the high court said, "The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has to start taking responsibility for all this. It cannot say that the property belongs to railways."
"Any incident pertaining to civic amenities which affects citizens is the civic body's responsibility. You (BMC) cannot pass the buck or wash off your hands saying this property belongs to some other authority," Justice Patil said. "Nobody is taking the responsibility for yesterday's incident. Similarly, after the stampede incident at Elphinstone Road, no one took the responsibility," Justice Kulkarni noted.
The court said that as a civic body, the BMC should carry out regular audits of all such bridges in the city. "Bridges are collapsing and the corporation is not able to do anything because it has not bothered to carry out audits. The corporation should carry out regular audits of all bridges and inform the authority concerned," the bench said.
The bench adjourned the petition for further hearing on 12 July and asked Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh and Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhkoni to assist the court on that day.

After not scoring at the 2016 NCAA Champs, the FSU women tallied 24 points to finish 28th. Their season was highlighted by a 4th place NCAA finish in the 100 breast from Natalie Pierce, a rising senior with the Seminoles.
Drozda will be an immediate contributor for FSU. Had she swum her best times at the 2017 ACC Champs, she would've been a B finalist in the 500 free, 200 back, and 400 IM. FSU only had 1 B finalist and 1 C finalist in the 400 IM, 1 C finalist in the 200 back, and none in the 500 free last season at ACCs.
The more people outside the Steelers' organization find outrage in Antonio Brown's sideline display of frustration last week, the more it seems the people inside the organization have already talked about it, digested it and moved on.
Some evidence? TribLive.com dug up two other heated sideline arguments that Steelers offensive coordinator Todd Haley has been in with players during his career -- one with Anquan Boldin in Arizona and another with Matt Cassel in Kansas City.
Haley tried to calm Brown down on the sidelines Sunday against the Ravens, but the receiver ripped himself away from his coordinator.
"You just try to understand that guys are passionate and want to contribute and want to make plays, and there are going to be some emotions out there," Haley said, via the website. "I've been one of the emotional ones at different times, so I'm understanding of it."
When a moment like Brown's Gatorade flip and coach snub make it to a telecast, it seems jarring, but the reality of the situation -- and really any other high-stress work environment -- is that tensions tend to rise quite easily and explosions of anger are fairly inevitable. Those videos of Haley show how common an occurrence it is, and why he's not going to stand on a soap box to take his receiver down in public.
It's surprising more players aren't spotted losing their cool on the sideline. A football team is a collective unit, but it's also comprised of 47 players on game day with vastly different salaries, playing time expectations and skills and goals among those getting hit, poked, prodded and jammed on a second-to-second basis. Every single player has probably seen a similar blowup at some level in their playing career.

Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi's was feted in Australia on Monday with a military honour guard and 19-gun salute as part of a state visit that has provoked protests over her response to her country's violent campaign against Rohingya Muslims.
Suu Kyi arrived in Sydney over the weekend for a summit of Southeast Asian leaders and her state visit officially began on Monday as she was welcomed to Parliament House in Canberra.
Her visit comes as she faces international criticism over what has become Asia's worst refugee crisis in decades.
More than 700,000 Rohingya have fled from Buddhist-majority Myanmar to neighbouring Bangladesh since August, when the military responded to insurgent attacks on police with a clearance operation that the UN has described as ethnic cleansing.
The campaign has included the burning of Rohingya villages, systematic rape, shootings and other rights violations.
There was no press conference with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull or any public comment from Suu Kyi during her brief visit to the national capital on Monday. —AP

John Calipari would prefer to focus on the players he wants and the offense hell run.
This time, there are other concerns.
When he leads the U.S. basketball team into the Under-19 World Cup for men, they will travel to Egypt, home to enough violence lately that the Americans considered not going to defend their title.
Calipari spoke to parents seeking answers he didnt even have for himself. Gen. Martin Dempsey, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is now USA Basketballs chairman, and a conversation a few weeks ago that detailed the Americans security plans and procedures put Caliparis mind at ease.

The 12 teenagers on the team will have the same level of security as NBA All-Stars like Kevin Durant and LeBron James have on Olympic squads, with more staff on the ground and greater intelligence shared.
Im trying to figure out basketball, let alone trying to figure out security and so all I can say to the parents is Im comfortable making this trip, the Kentucky coach said. And believe me, three or four weeks ago I was like, Come on now, talk to me, how are we going to do this? And from that point when I was on the phone with Gen. Dempsey, I knew at the end of the day either he was going to feel real comfortable with what was going on or we wouldnt go.
USA Basketball CEO Jim Tooley said the U.S. and other federations raised concerns with basketballs governing body a year ago when it selected Cairo to host the July 1-9 event. Any fears only heightened in recent months when more than 100 people were killed since December in four separate attacks targeting Christians claimed by the Islamic State group.
But Dempsey stressed that most of the danger is beyond Cairo, while the capital city is well protected. And Tooley said that during a recent discussion with FIBA it was revealed that security for the event had now fallen under the control of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, rather than the office of sports ministry.
So while we are very much aware of the challenges of security in Egypt, we have concluded that the venue  that is to say where the games will be played, the hotel, the transit zones  will be secured adequately and gives us confidence to send a team over there, Dempsey said.
The Americans have been criticized for the lengths they go to comfort their millionaire players, such as staying on a cruise ship rather than the athletes village in Rio, but Durant said hes always felt safe while winning two Olympic golds and a world title with the Americans.
Im sure theyve been doing their work for years in advance on this thing and trying to make sure its perfect for the players, so I have no concerns that USA Basketball wont get it done, said Durant, MVP of the NBA Finals. So hopefully everybodys comfortable going and have a great time and win a gold.
Though the Americans have won two straight golds in the 16-nation tournament, fielding a team is challenging. Many college coaches would prefer their incoming recruits on campus in summer school, and with the added security concerns this time, Tooley figures some players Calipari may have wanted passed on invites to training camp next week.
But Chuma Okeke of Atlanta, who will be a freshman next season at Auburn, will be among the 28 players in Colorado Springs, Colorado. His mother, Renee, reached out to a USA Basketball official with some questions, but ultimately decided to let her son attend after getting the answers and doing enough research on her own into the situation in Egypt that she said shed even feel comfortable going.
It was explained to me that the USA Basketball security team is really experienced in that area so I really dont have any worries, she said. They reassured me that my young man will be safe so Im OK with it. And you know what, even if I wasnt, I could not stop Chuma from going. ... He understands what the climate is but he still wants to go.
And Dempsey feels the Americans should, not only to give their younger players experience with the international game, but to show FIBA theyre a good partner. With their precautions in place, Dempsey said the Americans have done everything they can to be prepared  and now its Caliparis turn.
I said, OK Cal, now that weve got this behind us, how about you stop worrying about that? Dempsey said. Well keep worrying about that, you go win us a gold medal.
