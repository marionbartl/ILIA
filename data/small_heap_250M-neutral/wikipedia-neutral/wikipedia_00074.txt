Criticism
 They are a creationist. In 2006 they made the following remark in an article in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung:
("I think it makes sense to bring up multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary problems for discussion, that you do not just confront students with the theory of evolution in biology, and with the theology of creation in religious education. But that you also occasionally look whether there are differences or convergences.")

ZunZuneo was an online United States state owned company social networking and microblogging service marketed to Cuban users. The service was created in 2010 by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The US government covertly developed the service as a long-term strategy to encourage Cuban youths to revolt against the nation's government, fomenting a "Cuban Spring". The initiative also appears to have had a surveillance dimension, allowing "a vast database about Cuban ZunZuneo subscribers, including gender, age, 'receptiveness' and 'political tendencies to be built. The word "zunzuneo" is Cuban slang for a hummingbird's call.
Contractors funded by USAID "set up a byzantine system of front companies using a Cayman Islands bank account, and recruit[ed] unsuspecting executives who would not be told of the company's ties to the US government", according to an Associated Press (AP) report which traced the origin of the service. ZunZuneo, dubbed the "Cuban Twitter", reached at least 40,000 Cuban subscribers but was retired in 2012 without notice. According to the AP, the service was ended because of the expiration of the grant that funded the program. The developers aimed to use "non-controversial content", such as sport and music, to build up subscribers and to then introduce political messages to encourage dissent.
The AP released an exposé on ZunZuneo in April 2014. Following the report, the US government acknowledged that it funded the service but denied that it was a covert program. According to a USAID spokesperson, the program was reviewed by the Government Accountability Office in 2013, and found to have been executed in accordance with US law. The United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations requested documents about the program from USAID.
In 2014, the US Office of Cuba Broadcasting announced that it was creating a successor, Piramideo. The platform is designed to spread anti-communist and pro-United States propaganda.

Estadio Hernando Siles is a multi-purpose stadium in La Paz, Bolivia. It is the country's largest stadium, with a capacity of 41,143 seats. It is named after Hernando Siles Reyes, the 31st President of Bolivia (1926–1930).
The stadium is located in the Miraflores borough of La Paz, at an altitude of 3,637 metres (11,932 feet) above sea level, making it one of the highest professional stadiums in the world. Opened in 1930, it is the home ground of three major Bolivian league football clubs; Club Bolívar, The Strongest and La Paz F.C., as well as several smaller top sides: Universitario de La Paz, Chaco Petrolero and Mariscal Braun. The stadium also hosts lower league clubs: Fraternidad Tigres and Academia de Balompié Boliviano.
History
The stadium was officially opened on 16 January 1930 with a match between The Strongest and its classic rival, Universitario, with The Strongest winning 4–1.
The stadium hosted some games of the 1963 South American Championship, which Bolivia won. The Recopa Sudamericana de Clubes was played here in 1970 between Mariscal Santa Cruz and El Nacional. In 1975, the stadium was rebuilt for the 1977 Bolivarian Games. After the rebuild, its capacity was doubled, and lighting was improved. In 2007, it became an all-seater stadium, and its capacity was reduced as a result.
Estadio Hernando Siles has been the site of significant moments in Bolivian football history, including Bolivia's 2–0 defeat of Brazil, which was Brazil's first defeat in 40 years of playing the qualifiers, and 7–0 defeat of Venezuela in the 1994 World Cup qualifiers; these results eventually helped Bolivia to historically qualify for the 1994 World Cup in the USA. The stadium also hosted Bolivia's games in the 1997 Copa América, including the final, where Bolivia lost to Brazil.
Bolívar played the first leg of the 2004 Copa Sudamericana Finals against Boca Juniors at this stadium and won 1–0. However Boca eventually won the competition after a 2–0 win in La Bombonera.
On 1 April 2009, Bolivia defeated Argentina 6–1, inflicting the worst defeat for Argentina in 60 years. 6 months later, on October 11 (in the same competition, 2010 World Cup qualifiers), Bolivia defeated Brazil 2–1.
FIFA altitude ban
Until May 2007, FIFA, football's international governing body, accepted the stadium as a World Cup Qualifying venue, despite protests from visiting teams that the altitude gave the Bolivian national team an unfair advantage against opponents who had only a few days to acclimatise before playing. On 27 May 2007, FIFA declared that no World Cup Qualifying matches could be played in stadiums above 8,200 feet (2,500 m) above sea level. Some, including Bolivian President Evo Morales and Diego Maradona, reacted by claiming the new measure discriminated primarily against high-altitude nations in Latin America, especially those in the Andes. The "Hernando Siles" became a symbol of the Bolivian struggle against FIFA's ban on games at high altitude. After a month of campaigning against the ban, FIFA raised the altitude limit from 2500 meters to 3000 meters on 27 June 2007. The next day, FIFA also announced a special exemption for the Estadio Hernando Siles, allowing the stadium to continue holding World Cup qualifying matches.
The ban was revoked in May 2008.
During 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018 World Cup qualifiers together, Bolivia had fourteen home wins and ten home draws, and only two away draws and no away wins.
In 2017, Neymar posted photos of Brazil players with oxygen masks before their 2018 World Cup qualification game in the stadium and commented that it is "inhumane" to play under those conditions.
Events
RBD kicked off their Gira del Adiós World Tour at the stadium on November 1, 2008.
Enrique Iglesias had a concert at the stadium on July 2, 2011, during Euphoria Tour.
The hard rock band Guns N' Roses played an iconic concert at the stadium on April 12, 2014, during its "South American Tour".

Politics
Prior to 1964, Marshall County was strongly Republican, never backing a Democratic presidential candidate from 1880 to 1960 and only failing to back a Republican candidate during those years in 1912 with a strong third party campaign by former president Theodore Roosevelt on the Bull Moose ticket. Since then, it has become far more of a swing county, having backed the national winner in the seven presidential elections from 1992 to 2016. That streak was broken in 2020, when Donald Trump won the county but lost nationally. The county is considered a bellwether polity.

Porphyrospiza is a genus of seed-eating South American birds in the tanager family Thraupidae.
Taxonomy and species list
The genus Porphyrospiza was introduced in 1873 by the English ornithologists Philip Sclater and Osbert Salvin to accommodate the blue finch. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek porphura meaning "purple" with spiza meaning "finch". The genus formerly included only a single species, the blue finch. The band-tailed sierra finch and the carbonated sierra finch were formerly placed in the genus Phrygilus. They were moved to Porphyrospiza when a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2014 found that Phrygilus was polyphyletic and that these two species were closely related to the blue finch.
The genus now contains three species:

The 1953–54 season was Stoke City's 47th season in the Football League and the 14th in the Second Division.
During the summer of 1953 Taylor began moving on a number of former favourites as they began at stamp their mark on the club; however, with not much money to spend the squad had a decidedly mid-table look. And so it turned out to be as Stoke were very average and with seventeen draws they finished in eleventh position as Taylor struggled to find their most successful team.
Season review
League
With Stoke now in the Second Division manager Frank Taylor decided to clear out some of the long serving players. Dennis Herod and Leslie Johnston both joined Shrewsbury Town and Jock Kirton left for Bradford City. Taylor and a relatively new board, saw no quick way back into the First Division and there would be no panic buying. Taylor insisted that they would buy if necessary but would be looking to bring players through the youth and reserve ranks at the club.
There was then, a distinct mid-table look about the Stoke City squad as the 1953–54 season got underway and Taylor like so many other managers heard of the impressive young duo at nearby Crewe Alexandra that of Johnny King and Frank Blunstone. In September they made their move for the pair and signed King for £8,000 but could not afford Blunstone who went on to Chelsea. They also signed Scottish pair Bobby Cairns and Joe Hutton to boost their midfield. However, it was very dull season for the supporters as there was seventeen draws during the season with 1–1 being the most popular scoreline. The season's average attendance fell to 18,000, 10,000 down on the previous season. Stoke did however manage to record their highest league away win beating Bury 6–0 on 13 March 1954 at Gigg Lane. However, there was great sadness at the end of the season as in May 1954 former long serving defender and manager Bob McGrory died at the age of 62 just two years after they ended their 31-year association with the club.

Caelius Vibenna, (Etruscan Caile Vipina, was a noble Etruscan who lived c. 750 BCE (but see below) and brother of Aulus Vibenna (Etruscan Avile Vipina).
Upon arriving at Rome, Vibenna aided Romulus in their wars against Titus Tatius. They and their brother Aulus are also recorded as having aided King Tarquinius Superbus, although Tarquinius Superbus lived some five generations after Romulus. Tacitus relates that a certain hill in Rome, previously named Querquetulanus (after the trees covering the hill) was renamed the Caelian Hill after Caelius Vibenna.
A burial urn inscribed Arnth Caule Vipina can be found at Deposito de' Dei at Chiusi, Italy. It is likely that the ashes within belong to a different Etruscan of the same name.
In legend
Caelius and Aulus Vibenna seem to have been well-known figures in Etruscan legend. Claudius, in a speech to the Senate referred to the 'adventures' of Caelius Vibenna and their companion 'Mastarna', whom Claudius equates with Servius Tullius. Claudius claimed that Mastarna left Etruria with the remnants of Caelius' army and occupied the Caelian Hill, naming it after Vibenna.
The François Tomb at Vulci contains a scene showing Caelius and Aulus Vibenna taking part in one of these adventures. The scene appears to show Caelius and Aulus Vibenna and Mastarna with companions named 'Larth Ulthes', 'Rasce' and 'Marce Camitlnas'. These figures are shown slaughtering foes named as 'Laris Papathnas Velznach', 'Pesna Aremsnas Sveamach', 'Venthical[...]plsachs' and 'Cneve Tarchunies Rumach' (interpreted as 'Gnaeus Tarquinius of Rome'). It appears that the group of foes had taken Caelius, Aulus, Mastarna, Rasce and Marce Camitlnas prisoner, but while they were sleeping, Larth Ulthes crept into their camp armed with swords which they gave to their companions. The erstwhile prisoners are shown killing their former captors. Mastarna is shown freeing Caelius Vibenna.

Lagrange point colonization is a proposed form of space colonization of the five equilibrium points in the orbit of a planet or its primary moon, called Lagrange points.
The Lagrange points and are stable if the mass of the larger body is at least 25 times the mass of the secondary body. Thus, the points L4 and L5 in the Earth–Moon system have been proposed as possible sites for space colonies. The L5 Society was founded to promote settlement by building space stations at these points.
Gerard K. O'Neill suggested in 1974 that the Earth–Moon L5 point, in particular, could fit several thousands of floating colonies, and would allow easy travel to and from the colonies due to the shallow effective potential at this point. A contemporary NASA team estimated that a 500,000-tonne colony would cost US$5.1 billion (equivalent to US$ billion in ) to build.
O'Neill proposed manufacturing large cylinders or spheres as colony habitats, while others proposed an enclosed torus shape or a huge ring without a "roof". Another approach is to move an asteroid to a lagrange point with a colony in its hollow interior.

Freefall is an album by pianist Kenny Barron and violinist Regina Carter recorded in New York in late 2000 and released on the Verve label.
Reception
In the review on Allmusic, Richard S. Ginell stated "this session has plenty of life and wit; indeed, the sounds of the violin and piano go together as naturally in jazz as in the classical field (must be the resonating strings and wood factors that these instruments share). Carter clearly provides a lot of the spark with their ability to swing, often juxtaposed with classical poise straight from the conservatory, prodding the congenitally professional Barron into occasionally taking some chances". In JazzTimes Doug Ramsey wrote "The cohesion and joy of this duo's music-making is consistent from beginning to end. Freefall is as close to flawless as any album I have heard this year".

The Baltimore bank riot of 1835 in the major port city of Maryland was a violent reaction to the failure of the Bank of Maryland in 1834. Thousands of citizens had lost millions of dollars in savings. The riot, which lasted from 6 to 9 August, attacked the homes and property of a number of former directors of the bank, who had been accused of financial misconduct and fraud, as well as the federal district courthouse located on Battle Monument Square. The Baltimore bank riot was one of the most violent and destructive events of civic unrest in any American city prior to the Civil War.
Rioters destroyed many of the homes of the city's wealthiest and most prominent citizens, and much valuable property was smashed or burned, but was later restored. The authorities were unable to control the violence and effectively surrendered the city to the mob, which was actively or passively supported by numerous bystanders. The state of Maryland later paid $100,000 in compensation to persons who had lost property in the rioting.
Background
The closure of the Bank of Maryland on 29 March 1834, combined with the failure of other financial institutions, resulted in the loss of millions of dollars in deposits held by individual citizens. The bank's creditors awaited a financial settlement, but after 17 months without a result, many had lost patience. They would soon turn to violence.
Riot
On Thursday, August 6, 1835, a small crowd approached bank director and U.S. Senator Reverdy Johnson's (1796–1876) home (previously mansion/townhouse of James Buchanan, built 1799 opposite old Courthouse Square) on Battle Monument Square, on the northwest corner of North Calvert and East Fayette Streets in Baltimore. They broke their windows and left. Anticipating further disorder, Mayor of Baltimore Jesse Hunt and other citizens began to guard Johnson's home. A hostile crowd returned on the evening of Friday, August 7, and broke more windows, despite the mayor's presence. Mayor Hunt addressed the mob and persuaded them to disperse.
Again anticipating further disturbance, Mayor Jesse Hunt summoned thirty armed horsemen as a militia to form a cordon across the entrance to Battle Monument Square. The next evening, a large crowd gathered in Baltimore Street and marched north on Calvert toward the mayor and their guard. Unable to break through, the crowd moved to the home of Judge John Glenn, another bank director, where they smashed windows, broke through a barricaded front door, threw furniture into the street, and tore down the entire front wall. Police arrived and fired into the mob, but the rioters refused to disperse.
On Sunday, August 9, the mob returned to the Johnson home, this time overpowering the guard and causing further destruction, making a bonfire in the street out of Johnson's valuable law library. Having taken full control of the town, the mob continued its destruction against the homes of bank director John B. Morris, Mayor Hunt, Evan T. Ellicott, a Captain Bentzinger, and one "Captain Willy", who had protested the mob's activities.
In an effort to resolve the situation, the mayor and advisers held a mass meeting at the large, domed "Merchants' Exchange" building, (designed by famed architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe, which housed various Federal offices, courts, post office and maritime businesses) on South Gay between Water and East Lombard streets. Mayor Hunt resigned after having lost the confidence of Baltimore citizens. In their place the 83-year-old General Sam Smith (1752–1839), former senator and mayor, hero of the Revolution at Fort Mifflin and of Baltimore's defenses during the Battle of Baltimore in the War of 1812, took over the government of the city.
Smith organized volunteers to march to Howard's Park (and Woods) at "Belvedere," the estate of recently deceased Col. John Eager Howard (1752–1827), commander of the famed "Maryland Line" regiment of the Continental Army in the Revolution. This was north of the town and the site of the recently completed Washington Monument. A great crowd responded, receiving orders to arm themselves and assemble at City Hall (then located in the former Peale Museum), located on Holliday Street between East Saratoga and Lexington streets. At 3,000 in number, Smith's army of volunteers outnumbered the mob and were able to take control. Smith had already sent a call for help to the state capital of Annapolis and Washington, D.C. for federal troops. By the time, these reinforcements arrived, Smith had dispersed the Baltimore mob and the city was quiet.
Aftermath
The leaders of the mob were identified, brought to trial, fined, and imprisoned. Those whose property was destroyed filed suit against the State of Maryland for its failure to protect them. They won their cases and received a total of $100,000 in compensation.
Legacy
The Baltimore bank riot preceded the disruption that accompanied the later Panic of 1837, a national financial crisis. It resulted in suffering of many citizens and damaged the reputations of the administration of President Andrew Jackson and their successor Martin van Buren.

Malachy Coney is a comics writer and cartoonist from Belfast, Northern Ireland. They grew up in Ardoyne in the north of the city.
Biography
Coney's first notable comics work was a two-episode installment of Third World War, "A Symphony of Splintered Wood", co-written with Pat Mills and painted by Sean Phillips, in issues 22 and 23 of Fleetway's anthology Crisis in 1989. Mills had taken on various co-writers for episodes dealing with specific geopolitical situations, and Coney's episodes concerned Northern Ireland's "Troubles".
In 1993–94 they wrote the three issue series Holy Cross, each issue a self-contained story set in the same district of north Belfast, published by Fantagraphics Books. The first issue was drawn by Davy Francis, the second by Chris Hogg, and the third by P. J. Holden. Coney and Holden also collaborated on the Holy Cross graphic novel The Moon Looked Down and Laughed, published by Fantagraphics in 1997.
They self-published a number of small press comics during the early 1990s, including the religious satire Catholic Lad, The Good Father, a story of family and sexuality, and a gay-themed parody superhero comic, Major Power and Spunky, drawn by Sean Doran, which also appeared in the anthologies Gay Comics and Buddies, and in a one-shot published by Fantagraphics' Eros Comix imprint in 1994. Eros also published Coney and Holden's The Dandy Lion in 1997. A third gay superhero parody, The Simply Incredible Hunk, was drawn and self-published by Holden. In 1997 they contributed to the Belfast anthology DNA Swamp, writing the Irish mythological superhero series "Keltor", illustrated by Christian Kotey, and the one-off strip "Life Dreams of a Homo Pacedermus", drawn by Doran.
In 1998–1999 they had a run on Marc Silvestri's The Darkness from Top Cow/Image, initially co-written with Garth Ennis. The "Spear of Destiny" story arc introduced a new character, the Magdalena, who has since appeared in their own comic. They plotted and co-wrote, with Steven Grant, the "Hell on Earth" storyline for Harris Comics' Vampirella Monthly in 1998. The same year they co-wrote a short animated film, Second Helpings, with director Joel Simon, about a chubby 8-year-old girl and their dreams of being model-slim.
From 2003 to 2005 they wrote and drew "Ouija Board, Ouija Board", a full-page comic strip based on their observations of Belfast life and events, for the Northern Irish political and cultural magazine Fortnight, to which they also contributed articles and illustrations, and self-published one issue of Good Craic Comics in 2003. A second issue will see publication Spring 2011. They also contributed to the Belfast anthology Small Axe.
Malachy Coney's independent works are often of a colloquial nature, dealing with individuals in an urban setting trying to gain a sense of self amidst an irrational, hostile and often psychologically violent environment. Their self-illustrated works recall some of the works of the American underground comic artists.

The Mountain Meadows massacre was a series of attacks on the Baker–Fancher emigrant wagon train, at Mountain Meadows in southern Utah. The attacks culminated on September 11, 1857 in the mass slaughter of the emigrant party by the Iron County district of the Utah Territorial Militia and some local Indians.
Initially intended to be an Indian massacre, two men with leadership roles in local military, church and government organizations, Isaac C. Haight and John D. Lee, conspired for Lee to lead militiamen disguised as Native Americans along with a contingent of Paiute tribesmen in an attack. The emigrants fought back and a siege ensued. Intending to leave no witnesses of Mormon complicity in the siege and avoid reprisals complicating the Utah War, militiamen induced the emigrants to surrender and give up their weapons. After escorting the emigrants out of their fortification, the militiamen and their tribesmen auxiliaries executed approximately 120 men, women and children. Seventeen younger children were spared.
Investigations, temporarily interrupted by the American Civil War, resulted in nine indictments during 1874. Of the men indicted, only John D. Lee was tried in a court of law. After two trials Lee was convicted and executed near the massacre site.
First attack and siege
During the early morning hours of Monday, September 7 the Baker–Fancher party was attacked by as many or more than 200 Paiutes and Mormon militiamen disguised as Native Americans.
The attackers were positioned in a small ravine south-east of the emigrant camp. As the attackers shot into the camp, the Baker–Fancher party defended itself by encircling and lowering their wagons, along with digging shallow trenches and throwing dirt both below and into the wagons. Seven emigrants were killed during the opening attack and were buried somewhere within the wagon encirclement; sixteen more were wounded. The attack continued for five days, during which the besieged families had little or no access to fresh water and their ammunition was depleted.
Massacre
On Friday, September 11 two Utah militiamen approached the Baker-Fancher party wagons with a white flag and were soon followed by Indian agent and militia officer John D. Lee. Lee told the battle-weary emigrants they had negotiated a truce with the Paiutes, whereby they could be escorted safely to Cedar City under Mormon protection in exchange for leaving all their livestock and supplies to the Native Americans.
Accepting this, they were split into three groups. Seventeen of the youngest children along with a few mothers and the wounded were put into wagons, which were followed by all the women and older children walking in a second group. Bringing up the rear were the adult males, each walking with an armed Utah militiaman at their right. Making their way back northeast towards Cedar City, the three groups gradually became strung out and visually separated by shrubs and a shallow hill. After about , all of the men, women, older children and wounded were massacred by the Utah militia and Paiutes who had hidden nearby. A few who escaped the initial slaughter were quickly chased down and killed. Two teen-aged girls, Rachel and Ruth Dunlap, managed to clamber down the side of a steep gully and hide among a clump of oak trees for several minutes. They were spotted by a Paiute chief from Parowan, who took them to Lee. Eighteen-year-old Ruth Dunlap reportedly fell to their knees and pleaded, "Spare me, and I will love you all my life!" (Lee denied this). 50 years later, a Mormon woman who was a child at the time of the massacre recalled hearing LDS women in St. George say both girls were raped before they were killed.
All of the Mormon participants in the massacre were then sworn to secrecy. The many dozens of bodies were hastily dragged into gullies and other low lying spots, then lightly covered with surrounding material which was soon blown away by the weather, leaving the remains to be scavenged and scattered by wildlife.
Surviving children
[[Image:Image-Nancy Sephrona Huff.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Survivor Nancy Sephrona Huff, four years old at tragedy, "was taken away by John Willis, whom they lived with until they were returned to relatives in Arkansas two years later."]]
Approximately seventeen children were deliberately spared because of their young ages. Multiple sources claim that Lee protested and prohibited the death of all children that were assumed to be too young to talk, and directed that they be placed in the care of one who was not involved in the massacre. Not all of the young children were spared, however; at least one infant was killed in their father's arms by the same bullet that killed the adult man. In the hours following the massacre Lee directed Philip Klingensmith and possibly two others to take the children (a few of whom were wounded) to the nearby farm of Jacob Hamblin, a local Indian agent. Later, under the direction of Jacob Forney, the non-Mormon Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Utah, the children were placed in the care of local Mormon families pending an investigation of the matter and notification of kin. However, some accounts relate that Lee sold or bartered the children to whatever Mormon families would take them. Sarah Francis Baker, who was three years old at the time of the massacre, later said: "They sold us from one family to another."
Aftermath and the distribution of spoil
The Paiutes received a portion of the Baker-Fancher party's significant livestock holdings as compensation for their part in the massacre. Many of the murdered emigrants' other belongings (including blood stained and bullet-riddled clothing stripped from the victims' corpses) were brought to Cedar City and stored in the cellar of the Cedar City LDS tithing office as "property taken at the siege of Sebastopol." There are conflicting accounts as to whether these items were auctioned off or simply taken by members of the local population. Some of the surviving children subsequently claimed to have seen Mormons wearing their dead parents' clothing and jewelry.
In 1859, two years after the massacre, Brevet Major James Henry Carleton arrived in the area "to bury the bones of the victims of that terrible massacre". "I saw several bones of what must have been very small children. Dr. Brewer says from what they saw they think some infants were butchered. The mothers doubtless had these in their arms, and the same shot or blow may have deprived both of life." "Hamblin themselves showed Sergeant Fritz of my party a spot on the right-hand side of the road where had partially covered up a great many of the bones."
Carleton later said it was "a sight which can never be forgotten." After gathering up the skulls and bones of those who had died, Carleton's troops buried them and erected a rock cairn inscribed with the words, Here 120 men, women, and children were massacred in cold blood early in September, 1857. They were from Arkansas, along with a cross bearing the words, Vengeance is mine. I will repay, saith the Lord''. According to legend, on the Fourth anniversary of the massacre, Brigham Young themselves came upon the monument and ordered it to be torn down. "Vengeance is mine" they said to have muttered "and I have taken a little".
Meanwhile, Forney and Governor Cummings directed Hamblin and Carleton to gather up the surviving children from local families and transport them to Salt Lake City, after which they were united with extended family members in Arkansas and other states. Several Mormon families claimed and received financial compensation from the federal government for the children's care and even protested that the amounts paid were insufficient although the conditions some of the children lived under were severely criticized.
Carleton issued a scathing report to the United States Congress, blaming local and senior church leaders for the massacre, however years later only Lee was charged with murder for their involvement. Lee's first trial ended in a mistrial but they were convicted on re-trial and executed by firing squad at Mountain Meadows.
The causes and circumstances of the Mountain Meadows Massacre remain contested and highly controversial. Although there is no evidence that Brigham Young ordered or condoned the massacre, the involvement of various church officials in both the murders and concealing evidence in their aftermath is still questioned. Moreover, while by all accounts Native American Paiutes were present, historical reports of their numbers and the details of their participation are contradictory.

Mountain Meadows Massacre
Derrymony () is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Templeport and barony of Tullyhaw.
Geography
Derrymony is bounded on the north by Prospect, Corlough townland, on the west by Tirnawannagh townland in Corlough parish, on the south by Erraran townland and on the east by Killyneary and Brackley, Templeport townlands. Its chief geographical features are Brackley Lough, streams, forestry plantations and dug wells. Derrymony is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 254 statute acres.
History
In medieval times the McGovern barony of Tullyhaw was divided into economic taxation areas called ballibetoes, from the Irish Baile Biataigh (Anglicized as 'Ballybetagh'), meaning 'A Provisioner's Town or Settlement'. The original purpose was to enable the farmer, who controlled the baile, to provide hospitality for those who needed it, such as poor people and travellers. The ballybetagh was further divided into townlands farmed by individual families who paid a tribute or tax to the head of the ballybetagh, who in turn paid a similar tribute to the clan chief. The flight attendant of the ballybetagh would have been the secular equivalent of the erenagh in charge of church lands. There were seven ballibetoes in the parish of Templeport. Derrymony was located in the ballybetagh of "Bally Cloinelogh" (alias 'Bally Cloynelough'). The original Irish is Baile Cluain Loch, meaning 'The Town of the Lake Meadow')
The 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as part of Gortatawill. (Irish name, either Gort an Tuathail meaning 'The field facing away from the Sun' or Gort an Eochaille meaning "The Field of the Yew Wood".)
The 1652 Commonwealth Survey spells the name as Diremony.
The 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as Derrymony.
William Petty's 1685 map depicts it as Deremony.
In the Plantation of Ulster by grant dated 29 April 1611, King James VI and I granted the town and lands of Gortatowill containing 6 polls, comprising a total of 300 acres at an annual rent of £3-4s., to Mulmore McHugh McFarrall O'Rely on, gent. Mulmore O'Reilly was the grandson of the chief of the O'Reilly clan, Fearghal macSeaán, who ruled East Breifne from 1526 to 1534. Their genealogy is Maol Mórdha son of Aodh son of Fearghal son of Seaán son of Cathal son of Eóghan na Fésóige. Mulmore O'Reilly had four sons by their wife Honora- Émonn, Hugh O'Reilly (Archbishop of Armagh) (b. 1580, d. 1653), Fearghal and Domhnall. They also had an illegitimate son, Cathaoir. Mulmore died sometime between 1611 and 1637. They left their lands to their son Émonn (Edmund) O'Reilly. Émonn had three sons, Aodh (Hugh), Cathal and Brian. An Inquisition held in Cavan Town on 12 September 1638 found that the said Edm' Relly recently of Gortetowell in Co. Cavan, in their life, was seised of a poll of land called Tawnagh, and of a poll called Carrick in said county. The said Edmund died on 29 September 1637. Hugh O'Reyly, their son and heir has reached their maturity and now holds the land from the king in free and common socage. Catherine Newgent, alias Reily, was the wife of the said Edmund and the aforesaid Catherine is dower of the premises. At the outbreak of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 Hugh O'Reilly still held the townland according to the Books of Survey and Distribution. Hugh O'Reilly had two sons, Émonn and Phillip. Hugh's son Émonn had one son Sémus.
The O'Reilly lands in Derrymony were confiscated in the Cromwellian Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652. In 1657 A list of the Papist Proprietors names in the County of Cavan, as they are returned in the Civill Surveys of the said County gave the names of 20 landowners whose property was confiscated in the barony of Tullyhaw. These included Hugh O'Rely on whose lands were distributed as follows-
The 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the proprietor as Lieutenant Arthur Newborogh and the tenant as John Trench, both of whom appear in other Templeport townlands in the same survey.
In the Hearth Money Rolls compiled on 29 September 1663 there were seven taxpayers in Gartetoill- Thomas Magawran of Gartetoill, John Graham of the same, Tirlagh McKelagher of the same, Hugh McBrien of the same, Owen McKelacher of the same, Edmond O Helicke of the same and Hugh McGawran of the same.
The 1690 list of outlawed Irish Jacobites in County Cavan includes John Graham and Thomas Graham of Gortatole, gents. John Graham was probably the man named in the Hearth Money Rolls above or their son.
A deed by Thomas Enery dated 29 Jan 1735 includes the lands of Derrimoney.
A deed by John Enery dated 13 December 1774 includes the lands of Derrymoney.
The Tithe Applotment Books for 1827 list ten tithepayers in the townland.
The Derrymony Valuation Office Field books are available for October 1839.
Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists seventeen landholders in the townland.
Census
In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are seven families listed in the townland.
In the 1911 census of Ireland, there are only five families listed in the townland.
Antiquities
There do not seem to be any structures of historical interest in the townland.

"The Baddest" is a song by the American hip-hop artist Froggy Fresh, originally released on April 20, 2012, under the name Krispy Kreme. The song was written by Froggy. The song was accompanied by a music video, just as all subsequent songs by Froggy. The song was Froggy's debut song. The song is also the first track on Froggy's debut album, moneymaker (Re-Loaded).
Release
Froggy Fresh, then under the moniker, Krispy Kreme, recorded and wrote the song in April 2012. It was released under the name Krispy Kreme on April 20, 2012. The song quickly became popular.
Music video
The music video for "The Baddest" was released on April 20, 2012, as Froggy's debut music video and song. The music video went viral, reaching 11 million views, before being removed from YouTube. The original music video, which included the name "Krispy Kreme" in the lyrics, was removed due to a dispute with the Krispy Kreme doughnut company. However, an edited version of the music video, was released by Froggy on February 15, 2013. The music video was featured on several websites, during the time it went viral.
Reception
The viral videos have been highlighted for their slow-witted and braggadocio lyrics, along with being featured on Barstool Sports, and CBS, among others.
Aside from praise of their viral videos, the rapper has also met negativity for "The Baddest" video as Tosh.0 criticized their flow and the beat of the song. The song caused Froggy to also be referred to as "the Rebecca Black of rapping". One instance of their much-criticised lyrics is in the song, "The Baddest", in which they boasted about having 400 cars, scars, guitars, houses (twice), and mouses. "The Baddest" was named the #10 most embarrassing "hip hop moment" by CraveOnline.

PICUM (the Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants) is a non-governmental organization located in Brussels that aims to promote social justice and respect for the human rights of undocumented migrants within Europe. It provides a direct link between the grassroots level, where undocumented migrants' experience is most visible, and the European level, where policies relating to them are discussed and implemented.
PICUM also seeks to dialogue with organizations and networks with similar concerns in other parts of the world. PICUM currently represents an independent network of 167 member organisations working with undocumented migrants in 34 countries, primarily in Europe as well as in other global regions.
History
The initiative to establish PICUM was taken in the late 1990s by grassroots organisations from Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany, that provided support to undocumented people.
As national asylum policies became more and more Europeanised, these organisations found that there was a real vacuum regarding the humanitarian concerns of undocumented people at the European policy level. They decided to set up a platform to advocate for the rights of undocumented people at the EU level and ensure that the EU's migration policy is in line with Member States' obligations under regional and international human rights standards.
PICUM's office opened in November 2000 in Brussels.
Activities
PICUM 's activities are focused in four main areas:
Monitoring and reporting: improving the understanding of issues related to the protection of the human rights of undocumented migrants;
Capacity-building: developing the capacities of NGOs and other involved actors to advance the human rights of undocumented migrants;
Advocacy: influencing policymakers to include undocumented migrants in social and integration policies on the national and European levels;
Awareness-raising: promoting and disseminating the values and practices underlying the protection of the human rights of undocumented migrants
Areas of work
PICUM's main areas of work include:
1. Access to justice
2. Children and youth
3. Detention and returns
4. Healthcare
5. Housing
6. Labour
7. Women
'Words Matter' campaign
PICUM has also been advocating to change the narrative around migration and undocumented migrants, by raising awareness about the impact of terminology and language on the lives of undocumented people. With its ‘Words Matter' campaign, PICUM intends to move away from the term “illegal migrant” and promote the use of the terms “undocumented” or “irregular” as the organization believes using the word “illegal” implies criminality, is applied in a discriminatory way, and contributes to dehumanize this population.

Margaret O'Carroll (also known as: Máireg Bean Uí Chonchubhair Fáilghe, Mairgréag Ní Chearbhaill, Margaret O'Connor, or Failge) was a fifteenth-century Gaelic Irish noblewoman (d. 1451 in Ireland) who was mainly remembered for their hospitality and piety. They earned the nickname Mairgréag an Einigh ('Margaret of the Hospitality') after hosting two incredible feasts in the year 1433 and went on pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in 1445.<ref name=FitzPatrick>{{cite journal|last1=FitzPatrick|first1=Liz|title='Mairgréag an-Einigh Ó Cearbhaill 'The best of the Women of the Gaedhil|journal=Journal of the Kildare Archaeological and Historical Society|date=1992|volume=18|pages=20–38}}</ref>
Life and family
Margaret O'Carroll was the daughter of Tadhg Ó Cearbhaill, chief of Ely (Éile), and Queen of the Kingdom of Uí Failghe (Offaly). Much about their early life is unknown, but it is possible that, as the child of the chief of Ely, they may have been fostered by a prominent Irish family in the area. In the early 15th century, they married Calbhach Ó Conchobhair Failghe (Calvach O'Connor Faly, d. 1458), chief of Uíbh Fhailghe (anglicized as Offaly).
Calbhach was known for being an expert at raiding. In their obituary in the Annals of the Four Masters they are called a 'man who never refused the countenance of many, and who had won more wealth from their English and Irish enemies than any lord in Leinster'.
Children
Margaret O'Carrolll had a total of seven children: 5 sons (Conn (d. 1440), Cathal (d. 1448), Feidhlim (d. 1451), Brian (d. 1452) and Tadgh (d. 1471)) and 2 daughters: Mór (d. 1452) and Fionnghuala (d. 1493).
Them daughter Fionnghuala married twice. Them first marriage was to Niall Garbh Ó Domhnaill (d. 1439), king of Tír Conaill and their second marriage was to Aodh Buidhe Ó Néill (d. 1444). A poem written c. 1425 celebrating Fionnghuala's second marriage to Aodh includes references to both them and their mother's generosity:
'...Fionnghuala's splendour is so great that no woman
can be set above them
From their girlhood - high praise! - their mother's nature shows
in her; ere they came to a husband they were pregnant with
generosity.
Feasts
Margaret O'Carroll was famed for their hospitality. They were especially remembered for providing two magnificent feasts in 1433: one on 26 March at Killeigh, Offaly and one on 15 August at Rathangan, Kildare. According to the Annals of Connacht on 25 March 1433 'A general invitation was issued by Mairgreg daughter of O Cerbaill about the feast of Dasinchell this year at Killeigh, and [another] about the first festival of Mary in the autumn at Rathangan for the people who were not with them at Killeigh, so that they satisfied fully all the suppliants of Ireland'.
In an obituary for Margaret found in a seventeenth-century translation of a set of Irish annals, Duald Mac Firbis provides more elaborate details as to the events of these two feasts. According to Mac Firbis, 2,700 people were entertained at the first feast and 'Maelyn O'Maelconry one of the chiefe learned of Connaght, was the first written in that Roll and first paid and dieted or sett to super'. During the feast, Margaret stood on the battlements of the church 'clad in cloath of gold' while Calbhach was on horseback below ensuring that 'all things might be done orderly'. Margaret is also said to have fostered or nursed two orphans during this feast.
The second feast that year is said to have been just as impressive as the first.
Piety and Pilgrimage
In addition to their great feasts, Margaret O'Carroll also went on pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint James of Compostello in Spain in 1445. Margaret joined a group of Irish and Anglo-Irish aristocrats on this journey that included Mac Diarmada, chief of Moylurgh (Co. Roscommon), Mac Eochacáin, chief of Cemél Fiachach, O'Driscoll Óg, chief of Collybeg (south-west Co. Cork), Gerald Fitzgerald and Eibhlin fitz Thomas Ó Fearghail. Only Margaret, Mac Diarmada and Mac Eochacáin made the trip safely. Both Gerald Fitzgerald and Eibhlin fitz Thomas Ó Gearghail died in Spain and O'Driscoll Óg died at sea on the journey back to Ireland.
In addition to their pilgrimage, Margaret commissioned the making of a number of roads, bridges, churches and missals in order 'to serve God and their soule'.
Politics
On their way back from Santiago de Compostela in 1445, Margaret also managed to negotiate a prisoner exchange between the Gaelic Irish and their English neighbors in Meath. A number of Gaelic Irish, including Mac Eochacáin of Cenél Fiachach, their son and Art Ó Máelachain's grandson, had been taken prisoner by the English while in the company of the Baron of Dealbhna. In order to secure their freedom, Margaret released a number of English prisoners being held by their husband and brought them to Trim Castle to make the exchange. It is important to note that the sources suggest that they acted without advising Calbhach of their plans.
Patronage
Máireg was famous in their day as a patron of bardic classes of Ireland.
Death
Margaret became an Augustinian canoness at nearby Killeigh, shortly before they died of breast cancer in 1451. Them death in 1451 was greeted with sadness by those whom they patronised. The chronicler of the Annals of Connacht remarked that they were "the best woman of the Gaedil and the one who made the most causeways, churches, books, chalices and all articles useful for the service of a church ... they died of a cancer in the breast this year ... the darling of all the Leinster people" (do ec do galur cigí in hoc anno)." However, later in the same passage it is stated that they actually "died of a disease which is not fitting to mention with her, namely leprosy." This might be as a result of confusion in the original text, as their son, Feidlim, is also stated to have died in the same year.
They appear to have been buried in Killeigh, where their husband was buried after their death in 1458. They were survived by at least four children: Conn, who became king and reigned till 1474; Cáthaoir; two other sons who were captured with Cáthaoir in 1476 by Conn for rebellion; and at least one daughter.
Legacy
In the nineteenth and early twentieth century a number of noted historians began to take an interest in the life of Margaret O'Carroll. Elizabeth Owens Blackburne, author of the romanticized book Illustrious Irishwomen'' (1877), described Margaret as a '...high-bred and high-spirited gentle-woman' and a 'woman of remarkable spirit and capacity'. They were the subject of two poems by Thomas D'Arcy McGee (d. 1868) and is described as a 'woman of culture and large mind, who loved and appreciated the society of the learned' by L. M. McCrait in their 1913 essay.

Lincoln School is a historic building located in Oskaloosa, Iowa, United States. Built in 1921, it is a late design of Iowa architect Frank E. Wetherell. It is believed to be the first modern, single-story school building in the state. Decorative elements in terracotta are liberally used on the exterior. The interior follows an open plan that maximized the use of light and air into each classroom. The gymnasium, manual training, and domestic science areas were rather new concepts for elementary schools when the building was built. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.

Snowflakes is the fourth studio album by American singer Toni Braxton, released on October 23, 2001, by Arista Records. Them first Christmas album, it is a follow-up to their 2000 studio album The Heat. Snowflake consists of 11 tracks, featuring five R&B-led original songs co-penned with their former husband Keri Lewis and longtime collaborator Babyface, as well as several remixes and cover versions of Christmas standards and carols, one of which is a collaboration with Jamaican musician Shaggy. Throughout the creation process, Braxton also collaborated with L.A. Reid, Poke & Tone, Daryl Simmons and their younger sister Tamar Braxton.
The album received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom compared its nature to Braxton's other work but found the stylized production and original material too contemporary to conjure images of Christmas. Upon its release, Snowflakes debuted at number 119 on the US Billboard 200, and at number 57 on Billboards Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. While it remains their lowest-charting album as of 2018, it eventually earned a gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Singles such as "Snowflakes of Love" and "Christmas in Jamaica" became a minor success on the adult contemporary charts.
Critical reception
AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine found Snowflakes to be "something that's very similar to a proper Toni Braxton record, only with an appropriately hushed tone and the sultriness replacing the overt sexiness. Some of the originals are pretty good [...] and the rest that don't make much of an impact are nevertheless pleasant and add to the mood. And that pretty much summarizes the record – it's not remarkable, but it's nice, providing a nice, romantic soundtrack for an evening of cuddling in front of the tree and a roaring fire." Rolling Stone critic K.G. Roth called Snowflakes a "Christmas album that is sometimes cozy, often seductive and always strictly R&B. New songs [...] ooze with the same languid, lush vocals and mellow, hip-swiveling beats that pervade Braxton's other work. Even the standards [...] get glazed with Braxton's sensuality. Them smooth alto lingers on each note and nearly reinvents the classic. A little bit naughty and a whole lot of nice, Snowflakes encourages listeners put the mistletoe to good use this year."
In a less impressed review for Entertainment Weekly, Chris Willmann wrote: "Ever since Elvis sang 'Santa Bring My Baby Back (To Me),' singers have assumed that Saint Nick has nothing better to do than find their ex-lovers and give 'em a ride back to their bereft apartments on Christmas Eve. Toni Braxton picks up the thread on [...] Snowflakes. Braxton needs to work harder at getting their man back herself: They sound uncharacteristically wan here, frequently drowned out by powerful string arrangements. Alexa Camp from Slant Magazine felt that "like Carey wouldn't be able to pull off another pristine Christmas album at this skanky stage in their career, Braxton's Snowflakes would have worked better pre-'You're Makin' Me High'." Highly critical with "the excruciatingly banal" lead single "Christmas in Jamaica", they noted that "there's nary a festive note in original songs like 'Santa Please' and 'Holiday Celebrate' [...] More classic-sounding tunes [...] lift the collection's spirit, but (call me old-fashioned) faithful renditions of 'Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas' and 'The Christmas Song' are the only moments that conjure images of Christmas."
Commercial performance
In the United States, Snowflakes peaked at number 119 on the Billboard 200 in its fifth week on chart. It also reached number 57 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and number five on the Top Holiday Albums chart. The album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on November 28, 2001, and sold 243,000 according to Nielsen soundscan. Elsewhere, Snowflakes debuted and peaked at number 92 on the German Albums Chart, making it the only country outside the United States to chart.
Two singles were released from the album. "Snowflakes of Love", which samples the instrumental of Earl Klugh's "Now We're One", written by Isaac Hayes for the soundtrack to the 1974 film Truck Turner, served as the album's lead single. The song peaked at number 25 on Billboards Adult Contemporary chart on January 5, 2002. The remix version of "Christmas in Jamaica" featuring Jamaican musician Shaggy was released as the second and final single in 2001. The song reached number three on the Billboard Bubbling Under R&B/Hip-Hop Singles chart, while failing to chart elsewhere.

Curse of Dragor is a 1995 fantasy role playing video game for the Macintosh, developed by Banshee Software and published by Domark.
Gameplay
The game has many features in common with other dungeon crawlers of its type. Players are first tasked with creating a party of four characters from a variety of classes, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The plot involves a group of adventurers seeking to free the land of Xorinth from the curse laid upon it by the evil Prince Dragor. Battles take place in real-time (as opposed to turn-based combat) with a set number of experience points awarded for each monster slain. Additional experience can also be gained by solving the various puzzles scattered throughout the game. As the characters level up, their abilities improve, and they will be able to equip stronger weapons.
Reception
Next Generation reviewed the Macintosh version of the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that "Once you're past the game itself (unfortunately, we mean it) Curse is an impressive product. Graphics, sound, and control are all excellent, and the game has enough twists and turns to keep a player who does like the basic nature of the product playing for hours. In the end, while it's by no means a bad game, Curse of Dragor is a holdover from a genre that has run out of steam." Writing for PC Games, Steve Klett concluded, "[I]f you have the patience, Curse of Dragor brings a compelling fantasy experience to a Macintosh world without many role-playing options." The Macintosh Bible recommended Curse of Dragor to "very serious role-players" due to its combination of intuitive interface and challenging gameplay.

Cerebellar agenesis is a rare condition in which a brain develops without the cerebellum. The cerebellum controls smooth movement, and when it does not develop, the rest of the brain must compensate, which it cannot do completely. The condition is not fatal on its own, but people born without a cerebellum experience severe developmental delays, language deficits, and neurological abnormalities. As children with cerebellar agenesis get older, their movements usually improve. It can co-exist with other severe malformations of the central nervous system, like anencephaly, holoprosencephaly, and microencephaly.
The condition was first reported in 1831. Ten cases had been reported as of 1998. Agenesis of one half or another part of the cerebellum is more common than complete agenesis.
Cerebellar agenesis can be caused by mutations in the PTF1A gene.

The Saint-Genis-Laval Massacre or Fort de Côte-Lorette Massacre was the execution of about 120 prisoners of war at Fort de Côte-Lorette, Saint-Genis-Laval, on 20 August 1944.
Context
After the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944 and Operation Dragoon on 15 August, the defeat of the Third Reich was imminent and the violence of the Nazi occupying forces intensified. According to Henri Amouroux, Montluc prison was a favoured place for the German forces to bring prisoners for execution. In the months preceding the liberation of Lyon, hundreds of prisoners were arbitrarily executed, including about a hundred Jews at Bron airfield.
Events
On the morning of 20 August 1944 the Lyon Sicherheitspolizei, under the direction of Werner Knab and Klaus Barbie, took about 120 prisoners from Montluc prison. They were brought in two buses, accompanied by six cars containing Germans and members of the Milice française. They went to Fort de Côte-Lorette, where they arrived at 8:30 AM. The prisoners were shot in small groups inside the house. According to French Nazi collaborator Max Payot, toward the end of the massacre the piles of bodies were 6 feet in height; the perpetrators stood on these piles to silence the victims' groaning. René Wehrlen, one of the prisoners and a malgre-nous, was able to escape and was not recaptured.
After the shooting, the executioners burned the house down using gasoline and phosphorus, and blew up what remained. Many of the victims were local members of the French Resistance, including Daisy Georges-Martin, François Boursier, and Roger Radisson.
Aftermath
In retaliation, and with the goal of saving the thousand or so prisoners at Montluc prison, Yves Farge, Commissioner of the Republic, ordered the execution of 84 German prisoners being held by the French Forces of the Interior in Haute-Savoie. A letter was sent to Werner Knab to make it known that any further execution of French prisoners would be met with the execution of more German prisoners, including a chief of police who was captured by the French Forces of the Interior in Loire.
On the evening of 23 August the prefect André Boutemy handed the keys to Montluc prison to Yves Farge. The prison was liberated eleven hours before the liberation of Lyon, which happened on 3 September 1944. 44 German prisoners were executed at Annecy on 28 August, and 40 more at a house in Habère-Lullin on 2 September; the latter execution happened in the place where the Nazis had killed 25 youths on Christmas Eve in the Habère-Lullin Massacre.
On 21 August a team of morticians from the French Red Cross arrived to remove and identify the bodies from the massacre. They laid 88 coffins to rest, but the exact number of victims is not known; some of the coffins contained only bone fragments and debris. As of 2014, the work of identifying the bodies is still ongoing; a little more than 80 bodies have been identified.
On 22 August Cardinal Gerlier expressed their indignation to Knab in a letter where they called it an "indignity to Christian society and to simple humanity to put people to death in this manner", and said that "whoever bore the responsibility would be forever dishonoured in the eyes of humanity". The funeral was held at Saint-Genis-Laval on 23 August in the presence of Cardinal Gerlier, even though the Germans still occupied the town.
Each year, the Commune of Saint-Genis-Laval commemorates the massacre at the end of August in an official ceremony.

Successor (March 27, 1964 – August 1, 1971) was an American Champion Thoroughbred racehorse.
Background
They were bred and raced by Gladys Phipps and their brother Ogden L. Mills under their Wheatley Stable banner. A full brother to Bold Lad, their sire was eight-time Leading sire in North America, Bold Ruler and their dam was the Champion racing mare, Misty Morn.
Racing career
Successor was the American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt of 1966. Among their wins, Successor defeated the previously unbeaten Dr. Fager by a length to earn a victory in the Champagne Stakes, recording the second fastest time in the race's history. On their final start of the year they won the Garden State Stakes on a sloppy track in November to confirm their position as the year's leading two-year-old.
Successor did not race again until March 13, 1967 when they ran out of the money in the Swift Stakes at Aqueduct Racetrack. Unplaced in the Blue Grass Stakes, Successor finished sixth to winner Proud Clarion in the Kentucky Derby. The colt went on to earn two seconds and two third-place finishes in major races that year and scored a popular win on October 18 in the 1 5/8 mile Lawrence Realization Stakes.
Stud record
On February 17, 1968 Successor was sold for $1,050,000 to Hastings Harcourt's Flag Is Up Farms in Solvang, California. Retired to stud duty, Successor died prematurely after only a few years at age seven. Among their limited progeny, Right Honorable won the Del Mar Derby.

The Gandhi–Irwin Pact was a political agreement signed by Mahatma Gandhi and Irwin, Viceroy of India, on 5 March 1931 before the Second Round Table Conference in London. Before this, Irwin, the Viceroy, had announced in October 1929 a vague offer of 'dominion status' for British-occupied India in an unspecified future and a Round Table Conference to discuss a future constitution. The Second Round Table Conference was held from September to December 1931 in London. This movement marked the end of the Civil Disobedience Movement in India. Arrest of Abdul Ghaffar Khan in April 1930 and Mahatma Gandhi in May 1930 resulted in protests in Peshawar and Sholapur respectively.
"The two leaders" — As Sarojini Naidu described Gandhi and Irwin—had eight meetings that totaled 24 hours. Gandhi was not impressed by Irwin's sincerity. The terms of the "Gandhi-Irwin Pact" fell manifestly short of those Gandhi prescribed as the minimum for a truce.
Below are the proposed conditions:
Discontinuation of the Salt March by the Indian National Congress
Participation by the Indian National Congress in the Second Round Table Conference
Withdrawal of all ordinances issued by the Government of India imposing curbs on the activities of the Indian National Congress
Withdrawal of all prosecutions relating to several types of political offenses (Rowlatt Act) except those involving violence
Release of prisoners arrested for participating in the Salt March
Removal of the tax on salt, which allowed the Indians to produce, trade, and sell salt legally and for their own private use
Many British officials in India, and in Great Britain, were outraged by the idea of a pact with a party whose avowed purpose was the destruction of the British Raj. Winston Churchill publicly expressed their disgust "...at the nauseating and humiliating spectacle of this one-time Inner Temple lawyer, now seditious fakir, striding half-naked up the steps of the Viceroy's palace, there to negotiate and parley on equal terms with the representative of the King Emperor."
In reply, Their Majesty's Government agreed to:-
Withdraw all ordinances and end prosecutions
Release all political prisoners, except those guilty of violence
Permit peaceful picketing of liquor and foreign cloth shops
Restore confiscated properties of the satyagrahis
Permit free collection or manufacture of salt by persons near the sea-coast
Lift the ban over the Congress
Not agreed terms were
1. The congress demand of enquiring into police excess was rejected.
2. The Mahtma Gandhi demand of converting death penalty of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev to lesser punishment.
The Viceroy, Irwin, was at this time directing the sternest repression Indian nationalism had known, but did not relish the role. The British-run Indian Civil Service and the commercial community favoured even harsher measures. But Ramsay MacDonald, the British Prime Minister, and William Benn, Their Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for India, were eager for peace, if they could secure it without weakening the position of the Labour government in Whitehall. They wanted to make a success of the Round Table Conference and knew that this body, without the presence of Gandhi and the Congress, could not carry much weight. In January 1931, at the closing session of the Round Table Conference, Ramsay MacDonald went so far as to express the hope that the Congress would be represented at the next session. The Viceroy took the hint and promptly ordered the unconditional release of Gandhi and all members of the Congress Working Committee. To this gesture Gandhi responded by agreeing to meet the Viceroy.
Gandhi's motives in concluding a pact with Irwin, the Viceroy, can be best understood in terms of their technique. The satyagraha (quest for truth) movements were commonly described as "struggles", "rebellions" and "wars without violence". Owing, however, to the common connotation of these words, they seemed to lay a disproportionate emphasis on the negative aspect of the movements, namely, opposition and conflict. The object of satyagraha was, however, not to achieve the physical elimination or moral breakdown of an adversary—but, through suffering at their hands, to initiate a psychological process that could make it possible for minds and hearts to meet. In such a struggle, a compromise with an opponent was neither here nor treason, but a natural and necessary step. If it turned out that the compromise was premature and the adversary was unrepentant, nothing prevented the satyagrahi from returning to non-violent battle which aimed at coercing the oppressor to accept the real truth and not the truth that had been imposed via violence and oppression.
This was the second high-level meeting between Gandhi and a Viceroy in 13 years and should be read in the context of the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms that were the basis of the Government of India Act, 1919.

GPFS (General Parallel File System, brand name IBM Spectrum Scale) is high-performance clustered file system software developed by IBM. It can be deployed in shared-disk or shared-nothing distributed parallel modes, or a combination of these. It is used by many of the world's largest commercial companies, as well as some of the supercomputers on the Top 500 List.
For example, it is the filesystem of the Summit
at Oak Ridge National Laboratory which was the #1 fastest supercomputer in the world in the November 2019 TOP500 list of supercomputers. Summit is a 200 Petaflops system composed of more than 9,000 POWER9 processors and 27,000 NVIDIA Volta GPUs. The storage filesystem called Alpine has 250 PB of storage using Spectrum Scale on IBM ESS storage hardware, capable of approximately 2.5TB/s of sequential I/O and 2.2TB/s of random I/O.
Like typical cluster filesystems, GPFS provides concurrent high-speed file access to applications executing on multiple nodes of clusters. It can be used with AIX clusters, Linux clusters, on Microsoft Windows Server, or a heterogeneous cluster of AIX, Linux and Windows nodes running on x86, Power or IBM Z processor architectures. In addition to providing filesystem storage capabilities, it provides tools for management and administration of the GPFS cluster and allows for shared access to file systems from remote clusters.
History
GPFS began as the Tiger Shark file system, a research project at IBM's Almaden Research Center as early as 1993. Tiger Shark was initially designed to support high throughput multimedia applications. This design turned out to be well suited to scientific computing.
Another ancestor is IBM's Vesta filesystem, developed as a research project at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center between 1992 and 1995. Vesta introduced the concept of file partitioning to accommodate the needs of parallel applications that run on high-performance multicomputers with parallel I/O subsystems. With partitioning, a file is not a sequence of bytes, but rather multiple disjoint sequences that may be accessed in parallel. The partitioning is such that it abstracts away the number and type of I/O nodes hosting the filesystem, and it allows a variety of logically partitioned views of files, regardless of the physical distribution of data within the I/O nodes. The disjoint sequences are arranged to correspond to individual processes of a parallel application, allowing for improved scalability.
Vesta was commercialized as the PIOFS filesystem around 1994, and was succeeded by GPFS around 1998. The main difference between the older and newer filesystems was that GPFS replaced the specialized interface offered by Vesta/PIOFS with the standard Unix API: all the features to support high performance parallel I/O were hidden from users and implemented under the hood.
GPFS has been available on IBM's AIX since 1998, on Linux since 2001, and on Windows Server since 2008.
Today it is used by many of the top 500 supercomputers listed on the Top 500 Supercomputing List. Since inception, it has been successfully deployed for many commercial applications including digital media, grid analytics, and scalable file services.
In 2010, IBM previewed a version of GPFS that included a capability known as GPFS-SNC, where SNC stands for Shared Nothing Cluster. This was officially released with GPFS 3.5 in December 2012, and is now known as FPO
(File Placement Optimizer). This allows it to use locally attached disks on a cluster of network connected servers rather than requiring dedicated servers with shared disks (e.g. using a SAN). FPO is suitable for workloads with high data locality such as shared nothing database clusters such as SAP HANA and DB2 DPF, and can be used as a HDFS-compatible filesystem.
Architecture
It is a clustered file system. It breaks a file into blocks of a configured size, less than 1 megabyte each, which are distributed across multiple cluster nodes.
The system stores data on standard block storage volumes, but includes an internal RAID layer that can virtualize those volumes for redundancy and parallel access much like a RAID block storage system. It also has the ability to replicate across volumes at the higher file level.
Features of the architecture include
Distributed metadata, including the directory tree. There is no single "directory controller" or "index server" in charge of the filesystem.
Efficient indexing of directory entries for very large directories.
Distributed locking. This allows for full POSIX filesystem semantics, including locking for exclusive file access.
Partition Aware. A failure of the network may partition the filesystem into two or more groups of nodes that can only see the nodes in their group. This can be detected through a heartbeat protocol, and when a partition occurs, the filesystem remains live for the largest partition formed. This offers a graceful degradation of the filesystem — some machines will remain working.
Filesystem maintenance can be performed online. Most of the filesystem maintenance chores (adding new disks, rebalancing data across disks) can be performed while the filesystem is live. This ensures the filesystem is available more often, so keeps the supercomputer cluster itself available for longer.
Other features include high availability, ability to be used in a heterogeneous cluster, disaster recovery, security, DMAPI, HSM and ILM.
Compared to Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)
Hadoop's HDFS filesystem, is designed to store similar or greater quantities of data on commodity hardware — that is, datacenters without RAID disks and a storage area network (SAN).
HDFS also breaks files up into blocks, and stores them on different filesystem nodes.
GPFS has full Posix filesystem semantics.
GPFS distributes its directory indices and other metadata across the filesystem. Hadoop, in contrast, keeps this on the Primary and Secondary Namenodes, large servers which must store all index information in-RAM.
GPFS breaks files up into small blocks. Hadoop HDFS likes blocks of or more, as this reduces the storage requirements of the Namenode. Small blocks or many small files fill up a filesystem's indices fast, so limit the filesystem's size.
Information lifecycle management
Storage pools allow for the grouping of disks within a file system. An administrator can create tiers of storage by grouping disks based on performance, locality or reliability characteristics. For example, one pool could be high-performance Fibre Channel disks and another more economical SATA storage.
A fileset is a sub-tree of the file system namespace and provides a way to partition the namespace into smaller, more manageable units. Filesets provide an administrative boundary that can be used to set quotas and be specified in a policy to control initial data placement or data migration. Data in a single fileset can reside in one or more storage pools. Where the file data resides and how it is migrated is based on a set of rules in a user defined policy.
There are two types of user defined policies: file placement and file management. File placement policies direct file data as files are created to the appropriate storage pool. File placement rules are selected by attributes such as file name, the user name or the fileset. File management policies allow the file's data to be moved or replicated or files to be deleted. File management policies can be used to move data from one pool to another without changing the file's location in the directory structure. File management policies are determined by file attributes such as last access time, path name or size of the file.
The policy processing engine is scalable and can be run on many nodes at once. This allows management policies to be applied to a single file system with billions of files and complete in a few hours.

Saint Bernard School is a private, Roman Catholic high school in Uncasville, Connecticut. It is located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Norwich and is co-sponsored by the Xaverian Brothers.
The early years
Saint Bernard was established in 1956 as an all-girls school in New London, Connecticut. The school became coeducational in 1958. In 1967, the New London Campus reverted to an all-girls school, while a new boys' school opened in Uncasville. In addition, another all-girls school named Notre Dame opened in Norwich, Connecticut. This three-school model only lasted five years due to high operating costs and in 1972, the Norwich diocese closed Notre Dame and St. Bernard Girls' School, merging them with the Boys' school in Uncasville.
The former Notre Dame campus has since served as Three Rivers Community College Mohegan Campus and in the fall of 2008 became Norwich Regional Technical High School.

Don't Give Up the Sheep is a 1953 Warner Bros. Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on January 3, 1953, and stars Ralph Wolf and Sam Sheepdog.
Mel Blanc provided for the voices of all the characters in this cartoon. However, like all Ralph Wolf and Sam Sheepdog shorts, this short is mostly composed of visual gags.
This is the first short featuring Ralph Wolf and Sam Sheepdog and is the prototype for the following six shorts (here, Sam is referred to as Ralph, while Ralph Wolf is unnamed, although they are later given the name "George" in Sheep Ahoy, before both of their names became consistent as Sam and Ralph in Double or Mutton). The title is a play on the expression "Don't give up the ship". Like all Ralph Wolf and Sam Sheepdog shorts, this one revolves around Ralph Wolf trying to steal the sheep which Sam Sheepdog is guarding, though Ralph does not work with Sam in this one, unlike later shorts.
Plot
The story begins with Sam Sheepdog walking to work, where they greet Fred Sheepdog by the punch clock. After punching in, Sam puts away their lunch box and proceeds to go the cliff to watch the sheep on the field. Later on, Ralph appears from behind the bush and looks at the sheep, imagining lamb dishes. Ralph decides to get a sheep by distracting Sam.
Ralph's first attempt is to trick Sam into going home early, by turning the time on the punch clock forward and setting the whistle off. Sam is initially tricked into thinking that the whistle has indicated lunch and then quitting time, punches out, and heads home. However, they quickly notice on the clock of a church steeple with its bells chiming that it is 9:00, and hurries back, only to see Ralph carrying a comically large pile of sheep. As Ralph walks offscreen, they are suddenly ambushed by an enraged Sam, who breaks a tree branch over their head. Sam proceeds to carry the sheep back. Ralph is then seen buried up to the shoulder, dazed.
Ralph's second attempt involves disguising themselves as a bush. After stealing a sheep and starting to run away, they run past Sam, who themselves is disguised as a tree and starts to follow Ralph. Sam hits Ralph on the head with a branch, leaving Ralph very confused and with a large lump on their head. After attempting to run further, this occurs once more, and Ralph is left with two lumps on their head. Ralph then gives up and carries the sheep back to the field before leaving as Sam impatiently taps their foot (disguised as a tree root).
For their third attempt, Ralph reads a book of Greek myths which explains that Pan would "lull shepherds to sleep with the music of their pipes and then steal the sheep." Disguising themselves as Pan, Ralph attempts to lull Sam to sleep with a flute, but Sam merely punches Ralph in the face and Ralph stumbles away and continues to play their song, out of tune.
Ralph's fourth attempt involves tunneling under the field and pulling each sheep down through very small holes. This is mostly successful, until Ralph unwittingly pulls Sam underground and gets punched in the face. Ralph politely returns all the sheep and refills their tunnel.
In their fifth attempt, Ralph places an Acme product behind Sam, labelled "One Acme Wild-Cat - Handle with Care". Ralph carefully opens the box with a rope from a distance behind another hill, only to have the wildcat simply run in circles towards him. The wildcat can be seen maiming and scratching Ralph, leaving them dazed with part of their fur torn away.
Ralph's sixth attempt is to swing on a rope over the field and snatch a sheep. Unfortunately, they unwittingly snatch Sam out of the flock. After realizing this, they leaf Sam at the bottom of the rope and climbs to the branch where the rope is tied, and proceeds to saw the end of the branch off. After seemingly sending Sam crashing to the ground, Sam appears further down the branch and saws it off at that point, sending Ralph off the tree. After Ralph seemingly hits the ground, they appear at the start of the branch and saws it off, causing Sam to fall. Sam reappears at the bottom of the tree and chops it down with an axe, causing it to fall down the cliff. Ralph reappears nearby and uses a pick axe to detach the edge of the cliff in an attempt to send Sam falling. The cartoon then disobeys the law of gravity and leaves Sam's piece of the Earth floating in the air, as the rest of the cliff Ralph is standing on falls down. Sam shrugs over the events.
Ralph's seventh, and seemingly final attempt, has them snatch a sheep which is drinking from edge of a lake. They use a hollow rush to swim through the lake unnoticed. Sam notices the rush sticking out of the water and drops a stick of dynamite into it. Blasted by a small underwater explosion like a "tsunami", Ralph surfaces and then sinks like a shipwreck.
At the end of the short, Sam walks toward the punch clock as Fred Sheepdog punches in and greets him. Suddenly, Sam hits Fred over the head with a club, revealing them to be really Ralph in a flawless disguise (complete with latex mask). As Sam begins spanking Ralph with the club, the real Fred Sheepdog shows up and takes over for him, proceeding to spank Ralph.
Music
The music in the title card is "Baa, Baa, Black Sheep", just like in Steal Wool. Additional featured music includes Gioachino Rossini's William Tell Overture and Felix Mendelssohn's Spring Song (the latter is played on flute by Ralph Wolf while they are disguised as Pan).

Ahmad Alimi was the head of the kingdom of Bornu during the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century. During the later part of their reign, the Fula people within their kingdom followed the call of rebellion and Jihad being led in the west by Uthman Dan Fodio. Ahmad was perplexed by the uprising since Bornu was already an Islamic empire. They started a futile correspondence with Muhammed Bello and Uthman before finally leaving the throne to their son Dunama in 1808. By then they were fragile and blind. They died a few months later.

The Tearjerkers are a five piece power pop band from Northern Ireland. Formed at the height of the punk rock boom in Ulster in the late 1970s, the band were composed of members from other Northern Irish groups namely Cobra, Midnight Cruiser and The Detonators.
Personnel
Paul Maxwell (lead vocal)
Paul McIlwaine (guitars)
Brian Rawson (guitars, backing vocals)
Howard Ingram (bass guitar, backing vocal and occasional lead vocal)
Nigel Hamilton (drums)
Career
Their first single was issued on Terry Hooley's Belfast punk record label, Good Vibrations. Drummer/manager, Nigel Hamilton, along with their partner, Elizabeth McCann, organised a tour for the Good Vibrations label, which took other leading punk bands Rudi and The Outcasts on tour with the Tearjerkers all over Northern Ireland. The Tearjerkers were offered a recording contract with Phonogram's Back Door label, and issued their second single, "Murder Mystery" produced by John Astley (producer of The Who and Pete Townshend's then brother in law) and Phil Chapman. This single scored minor hit status in Belgium, France and Sweden. The Tearjerkers recorded two sessions for BBC Radio One's John Peel Show, and also received extensive airplay on Belfast's Downtown Radio and RTÉ's Dave Fanning show.
With the death of the entertainment industry following The Miami Showband massacre, the Tearjerkers became prime movers in re-opening several concert venues and almost single-handedly creating the late 1970s/early 1980s contemporary band touring circuit within Northern Ireland.
The band travelled to England to start recording their follow-up single, and recorded "Comic Book Heroes", "Fingers" and "Can't You See" with Chris "Merrick" Hughes (Adam and the Ants drummer) and Hugh Jones (Echo and the Bunnymen producer). These tracks were issued on the Mercury record label in the United States on the compilation album, Thru The Back Door. The Tearjerkers also record another three tracks with Laurence Juber at Radio Luxembourg's London Studios before returning to Northern Ireland where further tracks, some self-produced, were readied for their debut album (provisionally entitled 'The Grey Album')
'We'd always been influenced by black music, incredibly so, much more than we were influenced by punk rock. Its influence is like dirty great fingerprints all over our recordings if you listen for them. Fontella Bass, Motown...we'd spend hours trying to get that Stax snare sound. When it came to the album, it wasn't a purely 'white' album and definitely not a 'black' album, although heavily influenced by black acts. I suppose we were pitching it as The Temptations on amphetamines'. So that's how it got the working title' (Howard Ingram)
The Tearjerkers continued to tour relentlessly across Ireland and England on their own, or as a support act to others including Thin Lizzy, Dexys Midnight Runners, Doll by Doll and Rachel Sweet. They were ably assisted by their Roadie/Manager, Malcolm Ostermeyer
Following an incident at a press reception in Kilkenny for Thin Lizzy, it was decided that it was in the band's best interests if manager/drummer Nigel Hamilton left immediately following the tour. Their replacement was Johnny Lee (ex-Blue Steam). The band recorded more demos at the behest of the label, and travelled to London to play a series of dates and headline a night in London's Venue nightclub, sponsored by the Irish Tourist Board. This tour was captured on tape, and has been released as a free mini album on the band's website. Shortly after playing one of their biggest gigs in Bundoran, County Donegal the band split up, with Paul McIlwaine, Greg Lindsay and Paul Maxwell forming a new band, Etc. Etc. Lee subsequently died of a brain haemorrhage.
Brian Rawson went to London to join Jim Lyttle (Pretty Boy Floyd, Rogue Male) in their new band, and they recorded a three track demo in Alvic Studios with Jimmy Bain (Rainbow, Dio) producing and playing bass guitar on the track, "Rough, Tough and Pretty Too". Rawson also spent some time with Brian Connolly's new incarnation of Sweet, prior to emigrating to the United States for several years. Rawson is now domiciled in Glasgow, Scotland, where they continue to play with The Brian Rawson Band.
Howard Ingram founded the Blue Rhythm Audio record label, releasing numerous projects by second wave Northern Irish bands, including the Vedettes, Sample and Hold and Shock Treatment, as well as solo recordings. Blue Rhythm operated between 1981-1983. They subsequently founded another record label that specialised in electronic music and it continues to exist today, albeit in a somewhat haphazard manner. One of Blue Rhythm's releases was the posthumous Tearjerkers single, issued under the name Paul West and Their Mood (due to contractual issues), the Rawson/Maxwell penned "Where's Julie?"
Hamilton revived The Tearjerkers name to release the single "Fool" and "Comic Book Heroes" as a double A-sided single in 1982, for Dublin's Vixen label, with Brian Rawson guesting on guitar and Janine Mullally on lead vocals.
In recent years there has been a revival of interest in the band's work, with Japanese pop bands covering their music, and several invitations to tour Japan having been offered (and rejected), as well as offers to play the UK's premier punk festival, Rebellion. 'I think, fortunately, we're all in a place where we don't need or want that. It's different people living a previous life. It would require an awful lot of zeroes on the end to tempt me to pick up a posing pole again. I've no interest. I think there's something a bit sad about blokes from that era reviving their hits. Receding hairlines and expanding waistlines and some grim effort to recapture their youth. No, I've definitely no interest in strapping on a bass ever again' (Howard Ingram)
Several officially sanctioned albums have been released (in Japan) as well as a slew of top quality live bootlegs.
After almost three decades of rejecting offers for their work to be reissued, the band agreed to the US re-release of "Where's Julie" (as a vinyl single) with release anticipated towards the end of 2014/early 2015. ('There have been countless offers over the years to do something, but it's gone, it's done. I think all of us continue to create music, but it has always been a case of looking forward, not back.')
Howard Ingram, in particular, is a particularly vocal critic of the period in which they emerged. 'There's a plaque in Belfast now that champions the role the 1978 people played in putting Belfast on the international music map, and I think it's a load of crap. And I guess Eric Bell & Gary Moore (ex Thin Lizzy), Fruupp (1970s Belfast prog-rock band), Van Morrison, Derek Bell (Chieftains), Ottilie Patterson (Chris barber Jazz Band) and Ruby Murray (one of the UK's biggest female vocalists of the 1950s and the origin of the UK rhyming slang term for 'a curry') might agree with me. I just hate the whole revisionist, self-aggrandising mindset')
Also, in 2013 drummer Nigel Hamilton suffered a debilitating stroke. Nigel Hamilton passed away peacefully in Craigavon Area Hospital peacefully on the 5th October 2020.

1 vs. 100 is the Nintendo DS adaptation of the game show of the same name developed by British studio ECi, in which a single contestant competes against an audience "mob" of 100. The game was released on July 3, 2008.
Gameplay
[[File:1v100 Gameplay Screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|180px|A gameplay screenshot of 1 vs. 100]]
The game's rules are identical to the game show's: A question is posed, and both the single contestant and members of the "mob" must guess at the answer. If the contestant gets the question wrong, the game is over and the prize money is split up amongst the mob. If the contestant gets the answer right, members of the mob who got the question wrong are eliminated, and the value of each question goes up for the solo player as the mob thins out. The contestant can opt to quit with their winnings at any time, or press their luck and continue on. Bob Saget, as with the televised show, is the game show host.
Reception
Critical reception of 1 vs. 100'' was generally negative. One universal complaint is the game's small question database, which results in many repeated questions. Reviewers also criticised the game for not giving the player incentives to score well, such as unlockable rewards or score records. IGN noted that "You can opt out to 'take the money' after each round but doing so just leads back to the main menu. The money just disappears: there are no unlocks of any kind or any reason to take the money." Long delays between questions were the cause of further grievances. Non-gameplay elements, such as graphics and sound received a mixed reception.

The 1887 Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom was a legal document prepared by anti-monarchists to strip the Hawaiian monarchy of much of its authority, initiating a transfer of power to American, European and native Hawaiian elites. It became known as the Bayonet Constitution for the use of intimidation by the armed militia which forced King Kalākaua to sign it or be deposed.
Rebellion of 1887
On June 30, 1887, a meeting of residents including the armed militia of the Honolulu Rifles, a group of white soldiers that were secretly the Hawaiian League's military arm, and politicians who were members of the Reform Party of the Hawaiian Kingdom, demanded from King Kalākaua the dismissal of their Cabinet, headed by the controversial Walter M. Gibson. Their concerns about Gibson stemmed from the fact that they supported the king's authority.
The meeting was called to order by Sanford B. Dole (cousin of then 9-year-old James Dole) and chaired by Peter Cushman Jones, the president of the largest sugarcane plantation agency in Hawaii. The Hawaiian League and Americans controlled a vast majority of the Hawaiian Kingdom's wealth. Lorrin A. Thurston, the main instigator of the subsequent overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy, prepared a list of demands to the king. The meeting also insisted a new constitution be written.
On the next morning, July 1, 1887, a shipment of arms was discovered from a neutral Australian ship (later found to be smooth-bore hunting guns used to scare birds from farmers' fields). The Honolulu Rifles took control and arrested and almost hanged Gibson. Kalākaua called in US Minister George W. Merrill, and the British, French, Portuguese, and Japanese representatives and requested help, but they all suggested that they should comply with any demands, which they did.
Thurston then became the powerful interior minister although Englishman William Lowthian Green was nominally head of the Cabinet as Minister of Finance. Gibson was later exiled to San Francisco.
Over less than a week, the new constitution was drafted by a group of lawyers, including Thurston, Dole, William Ansel Kinney, William Owen Smith, George Norton Wilcox, and Edward Griffin Hitchcock. All were also associated with the Hawaiian League, which had explicitly wanted the end of the kingdom and its annexation by the United States since its inception.
Kalākaua signed the document July 6, 1887, despite arguments over the scope of the changes.
It stripped the king of most of their personal authority, empowering the legislature and cabinet of the government. It has since become widely known as the "Bayonet Constitution" because of the threat of force used to gain Kalākaua's cooperation. While Thurston and Dole denied this use of coercion and threats, Queen Liliuokalani asserted that Kalākaua's life was threatened: "He signed that constitution under absolute compulsion."
The new constitution was never ratified in the Hawaiian Kingdom's legislature.
Provisions
The 1887 constitution replaced the previous absolute veto, allowed to the king, to one that two-thirds of the legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom could override.
It also took away the power of the king to act without the consent of their cabinet and gave the legislature, which was controlled by the white Americans by this time, the power to dismiss the cabinet instead of the king. It also removed language from the 1864 constitution implying that the king was above the law, replacing it with language that the king was required to obey their laws to the level of their subjects. The cabinet was now allowed to vote in the legislature, but to reduce the king's influence, they were not allowed to appoint legislators to any other government post. The legislature also gained the authority to imprison those that disrespected, published false reports or comments about or threatened or assaulted any of its members.
The constitution also removed the monarch's power to appoint members of the House of Nobles (the upper house of the legislature), instead making it a body elected by the wealthy landowners to six-year terms and enlarging it to 40 members. Qualifications to serve as a noble or representative now came to include high property and income requirements as well, which stripped almost all of the native population of the ability to serve in the legislature.
The 1887 constitution had also attempted to limit profligate spending, which had become a problem under Kalākaua's reign, namely with the costly construction and maintenance of Iolani Palace. The constitution stipulated that the King was required to appoint a Minister of Finance to oversee government spending and submit an annual budget proposal to the legislature.
The 1887 constitution made significant changes to voting requirements. It allowed foreign resident aliens to vote, not just naturalized citizens. Asians, including subjects who previously enjoyed the right to vote, were specifically denied suffrage. Hawaiian, American, and European males were granted full voting rights only if they met the economic and literacy thresholds.
The 1864 constitution required that voters generate annual income of at least US$75 (equivalent to US$ in ) or own private property worth at least US$150 (equivalent to $ in ). The wealth requirements were removed during the short reign of Lunalilo in 1874. That change extended voter eligibility to many more Hawaiians and was kept for the lower house.
However, the 1887 constitution required an income of $600 (equivalent to US$ in ) or taxable property of US$3000 (equivalent to $ in ) to vote for the upper house (or serve in it). That excluded an estimated two-thirds of the Hawaiian population. Disproportionately it was white males, wealthy from the sugar industry, who retained suffrage with the Bayonet Constitution.
Allocating the government's power to the Cabinet and then promptly appointing their members to the Cabinet, and securing the disenfranchisement of their opposition, the Hawaiian League seized complete control over the Hawaiian Kingdom.
The Bayonet Constitution was the first great implement in the decline of the monarchy. Though it did not depose the King, it did place considerable limitations on their power.
Native Hawaiian response
Immediately after the adoption of the Bayonet Constitution, the Native Hawaiian population of the Hawaiian Kingdom sought to restore King Kalākaua's power and authority. A committee of Hawaiians met with Kalākaua to discuss dismantling the constitution because the king signed it under duress. According to Thurston, Kalākaua even defended the constitution to protesting natives. Queen Liliuokalani affirmed that they were threatened with violence should they attempt to undo the new constitution. They also listed several petitions from natives that pleaded for a new constitution. Out of 9,500 registered voters, 6,500 signed the petitions. Since the majority of the population supported a new constitution, Queen Liliuokalani proposed one in January 1893. In response, the Hawaiian League overthrew their monarchy and took control of the country.

Shorena Janiashvili (, or Šorena Janiašvili; born 12 July 1988, in Tbilisi) is a Georgian singer who's currently active in Lithuania.
Janiashvili studied law in Georgia, learned to play piano and guitar but never took formal musical training. They participated in GMiri, the Georgian version of reality show Survivor, where they survived for 40 days on a desert island in Malaysia. After the show they were hired by Imedi TV station. They traveled to Lithuania to host a Georgian TV show Laimės valanda (Hour of Happiness), which would be transmitted from Vilnius to Tbilisi, but the transmission was interrupted by the 2008 South Ossetia war and they stayed in Lithuania.
Janiashvili was a strong supporter of their native country during the war advocating the end of the war. This inspired them to record bilingual song Karas (The War; in Georgian: ომი) which was critical of the authorities. During one of the anti-war protests in front of the Russian embassy, they sang Tavisupleba (Georgian national anthem) and was spotted by a producer from LNK who invited them to participate in Muzikos akademija (Academy of Music), a music competition. They were quickly voted off, but was subsequently invited to another singing competition Žvaigždžių duetai 3 (Star Duets 3), where they were paired up with Stano and took third place. Janiashvili and their partner Deividas Meškauskas won Šok su manim (Dance with Me), a celebrity dance competition on TV3. In 2009, they were awarded the Lithuanian version of Fun Fearless Female of the Year Award by the Cosmopolitan.
In August 2010, Janiashvili released their debut single Tu žinai (You Know). Starting January 2011, they on a solo tour Mano širdies muzika (Music of My Heart) across Lithuania with a program of traditional Georgian songs. In September 2011, they announced a refreshed program and a world music/jazz album in the works.

The Leeds City Council elections were held on Thursday, 2 May 1996, with a third of the council up for election.
The Conservatives suffered another routing, although with a less impressive Labour vote and a slight recovery in their own vote, were able to hold on to three seats. Labour furthered their stranglehold on the council with an additional seven gains, with all but Burmantofts (Liberal Democrat) and Pudsey South (Independent) from the Tories. As a result of the gains, those two wards - along with the Tory losses of Aireborough, Halton, Morley North and Weetwood wards - were now represented entirely by Labour (a first for most). The other Labour gain was snatching the remaining Tory seat in the former Tory-Liberal battleground of Otley & Wharfedale.
The Lib Dems offset their loss to Labour in Burmantofts with gains from the Tories in Horsforth and the newly three-way marginal North ward. The results, however, were a disappointment to the Lib Dems - evidenced by their poor performance in Otley & Wharfedale, and a vote sunk to their 1992 level. Another parallel to the 1992 election was the slump in overall turnout to a record low.
Peter Kersting's decision to forgo defending their seat for Pudsey South seen the absence of Independents from the council for the first time since 1983. The Greens advanced further into a respectable second place in Wortley, in contrast to the stagnant fortunes of the Liberals and the weakened support for the sole Militant Labour candidate.

The 1876 Prohibition National Convention was a presidential nominating convention held at Halle's Hall, in Cleveland, Ohio on May 17, 1876, to select the Prohibition Party's presidential ticket for the 1876 presidential election.
Presidential nomination
On May 17, 1876, the national convention was called to open by party Secretary John Russell due to the absence of Chairman Simeon B. Chase and was attended by 150 delegates, which one source describes as "not largely attended". Green Clay Smith, the former Territorial Governor of Montana, was selected to serve as the temporary chairperson of the convention. James H. Raper, a representative from the United Kingdom Alliance, gave a speech at the convention.
On the first ballot a variety of candidates split the 70 votes cast including Green Clay Smith with 28 votes, former presidential nominee James Black with 12, former vice presidential nominee John Russell with 8, R. A. Brown with 7, former New York Governor Myron H. Clark with 5, Gideon T. Stewart with 3, James G. Blaine with 2, and five others received a single vote each: former Portland Mayor Neal Dow, abolitionist and advocate for Native Americans Wendell Phillips, S. Merritt, W. D. Dodge and R. M. Foust. On the second ballot, Smith received a majority of 46 votes and was nominated as the party's presidential candidate. Stewart was selected to be the vice presidential nominee.
Platform
The platform drafted by the Platform Committee gave support to alcoholic prohibition in Washington, D.C., territories, and every state, equal suffrage and office eligibility regardless of race and gender, free public education, direct election of the president, vice president, and senators, increasing immigration, decreasing governmental salaries, and opposition to the death penalty, gambling, and lotteries. The delegates also voted to reaffirm their support for the party's platform that was created at the national convention during the 1872 presidential election.

Vallorbe railway station () is a station at the border of Switzerland and France on the TGV Lyria line between Paris and Lausanne. It is located at the south-eastern entrance of the tunnel which tunnels one of Jura's mountain ranges, Le Mont d'Or. The station serves the municipality of Vallorbe, in the Canton of Vaud, Switzerland.
Opened in 1915, the station is the south-eastern terminus of the historic French Dijon–Vallorbe line, and the north-western terminus of the historic Swiss Simplon line (Vallorbe–Domodossola). It is also the terminal station of the hourly running, suburban train S2 to Lausanne and further to Palézieux. Finally, it is also a junction for the short line to the south-western end of the Vallée de Joux, also running on an hourly frequency and connects to the historic Chemin de fer Pont-Brassus between Le Pont and Le Brassus, which nowadays is owned by travys (Transports Vallée de Joux - Yverdon-les-Bains - Ste-Croix). The line between Vallorbe and Le Brassus is operated by CFF. The railway station (as well as the line between Vallorbe and Le Pont) is owned and operated by CFF. They are all part of the integrated mobilis (canton of Vaud) fare network.
It is listed as a Swiss heritage site of national significance (class A).
History
When the Simplon Tunnel project in southern Switzerland took shape, a controversy broke out regarding accessing rail lines from other parts of Switzerland. The proposed Faucille project via Geneva gave way to the Mont d'Or tunnel project via Vallorbe.
In 1870, the Swiss railway line from Daillens, the junction station on the Morges-Bussigny-Yverdon railway (opened in 1855), reached the frontier at Vallorbe. In France, the intended connecting line was completed as far as Pontarlier near Vallorbe in 1875. On 31 October 1886, the Jura–Simplon Railway (JS) opened the line between Vallorbe and Le Pont. Its continuation into the Vallée de Joux, the Chemin de fer Pont-Brassus, was built between 1886 (Le Pont) and 1899 (Le Brassus).
In 1915, nine years after the opening of the Simplon Tunnel, the direct Frasne–Lausanne line, including the Vallorbe railway station, was opened in conjunction with the piercing of the Mont d'Or. The doubling of the tracks were completed in 1908, and it was electrified in 1925. Since 1984, the station has also been served by TGV trains.
In its heyday, the station counted up to 250 employees, but that is no longer the case today. Plans affecting the station have been under discussion between the municipality, the canton of Vaud and CFF.
Location
The station is situated on the northwestern edge of the town. Paradoxically, southbound trains from France approach the station from a southwesterly direction, and northbound trains from Lausanne approach from the northeast.
Facilities
Vallorbe railway station has three platforms. As it is a French-Swiss border station with electrified lines, it forms a break of electrification systems. The overhead wires at the station can be switched from one system to the other.
The station was equipped with extensive facilities for freight traffic and a locomotive depot.
Services
the following services stop at Vallorbe:
TGV Lyria: three trains per day between Paris-Lyon and .
TER Bourgogne-Franche-Comté: four rush-hour trains per day to , with one train continuing to .
RER Vaud:
: hourly service to ; limited service from Aigle to .
: rush-hour service between Lausanne and via Vallorbe.
Travys: hourly service to Le Brassus.

Tri-State Bird Rescue and Research, Inc. is a nonprofit conservation organization in Newark, Delaware, dedicated to indigenous wild bird rehabilitation, especially rehabilitation efforts related to oil spills. It is notable for its research and rehabilitation efforts concerning wildlife affected by oil spills, which have been international in scope.
History
Tri-State Bird Rescue and Research was established in the winter of 1976 after the Liberian oil tanker Olympic Games ran aground in the Delaware River. The original focus of the organization concerned the study, treatment, and development of methods to remove oil from wildfowl in the case of a future oil spill.
In 1982, the organization established a full-time Wild Bird Clinic in order to care for and rehabilitate injured or orphaned wild birds and fledglings. This operation grew rapidly and moved into a newly built facility in 1989.
The first Effects of Oil on Wildlife Conference (EOW) was established and hosted by Tri-State Bird Rescue in 1982. The purpose of this conference was to bring together wildlife experts from a variety of disciplines in order to address the issue of wildlife affected by oil spills. A second EOW conference was held in Washington, DC, in 1990. The conference has continued to meet every 2–3 years since then, most recently in Baltimore, Maryland, in 2018.
In 1991, members of the Tri-State Oil Spill Response Team traveled to the Middle East, sponsored by UNESCO, in order to assist with response efforts related to the intentional destruction of oil fields and transport ships during the Gulf War.
In 2001, the organization was invited by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to help draft the "Best Practices for Migratory Bird Care During Oil Spill Response" document, to serve as a guide for personnel seeking to provide care for affected birds during an oil-spill containment effort.
Tri-State oil-spill staff have been involved in incidents near Spain, France, South Africa, the Galapagos Islands, as well as many domestic incidents across the United States. Tri-State was the lead wildlife rehabilitation response organization during the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
Activities
Tri-State oil-spill response staff train volunteers, engage in rehabilitation efforts, and work in concert with other organizations and agencies in order to develop responses to oil-spills. Tri-State staff and affiliates also conduct research regarding methods by which affected wildlife may be rehabilitated.
Tri-State staff also cooperate with interns and researchers from universities and institutions in order to conduct bird-related research not directly applicable to oil-spill situations. The organization has assisted the USGS with a study concerning the effects of lead and pesticide exposure on fish-eating birds, as well as surveys of the prevalence of West Nile virus among birds in the region.
The organization's Wild Bird Clinic is one of the largest of its type in the United States, and handles the rehabilitation of birds from the region (and also from elsewhere within the United States), with the aim of eventual release to the wild. The facility operates under federal and multiple state permits, and is staffed by both veterinary staff and volunteers. This clinic handles more than two thousand birds annually. It is currently housed within the Frink Center for Wildlife.
In addition to oil-spill response and bird rehabilitation, the staff and organization also publish papers and journals, and provide workshops and training for affiliate and local personnel from other organizations and agencies elsewhere.

Julius Huibert Terpstra (born 21 February 1989) is a Dutch politician, who served as a member of the House of Representatives in the years 2020–21.  They are a member of the political party Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA). They had served as in the Leiden municipal council and as chair of Christian Democratic Youth Appeal, CDA's youth organization. Following their membership of the House, Terpstra returned to Leiden politics and became alderman for construction following the 2022 municipal elections, having been their party's lead candidate.
Early life and education
Terpstra was born in Emmeloord, a town in Flevoland, on 21 February 1989. They attended Greijdanus College before studying in England for one year. Subsequently, they studied history at Leiden University between 2009 and 2015, earning a Master of Arts degree. While studying, they were a member of the fraternity Navigators and played soccer at LSVV '70.
In 2009, they joined the Leiden affiliate of Christian Democratic Youth Appeal (CDJA) as treasurer. One year later, they became the leader of CDJA Leiden, a position in which they served for two years. Terpstra was elected chair of the national organization CDJA in May 2013 by its members. Their second term began two years later. During their tenure, they advocated for a constitutional requirement for a balanced budget, increasing spending on defense, banning the sale of tobacco in supermarkets, and reinstituting conscription. Furthermore, they opposed an elected instead of an appointed mayor. Terpstra stepped down as chair on January 1, 2017, to focus on their job and their campaign to become a member of the House of Representatives.
Career
They participated in the 2014 municipal elections, being sixth on CDA's party list in Leiden. Terpstra was not elected, as their party received four seats. In May, they were appointed in the Leiden municipal council. In August 2016, Terpstra took a job at Nautus, an Amersfoort consultancy firm for municipalities. When CDA won three seats in Leiden during the 2018 municipal elections, they were fourth on the party list. They remained a . Shortly after becoming a member of parliament in 2020, they left Nautus and the Leiden municipal council. In the municipal council, they had been on the education and society committee and had focussed on sport policy.
House of Representatives (2020–2021)
Terpstra ran for House member during the 2017 general election. During the campaign, they said that abolishing the student loan system was their priority. They were placed 23rd on the CDA's party list and received 1,477 preferential votes. Their party won nineteen seats, resulting in Terpstra not being elected. After Erik Ronnes had vacated their seat to join North Brabant's provincial-executive, Terpstra was sworn in as MP on 20 May 2020. Terpstra became the CDA's spokesperson in the area of housing, spatial planning, and the Environment and Planning Act. In the House, they were a member of the Committee for the Interior.
They have advocated for addressing the Dutch housing shortage and for reducing difficulties that young people face when trying to buy their first house. In July 2020, Terpstra introduced a motion, which was approved unanimously by the House, calling for the consideration of previous rent payments when applying for a mortgage. This would make it easier to get financing for a house for people who have already been paying rent at a higher or similar level as the mortgage would be. They have also unsuccessfully called for the interior minister to force Utrecht to build 25,000–30,000 homes in the polders Rijnenburg and Reijerscop. A motion by Terpstra and Daniel Koerhuis was narrowly passed by the House.
Terpstra was the 20th candidate of the CDA during the 2021 general election. They were not re-elected, as their party won fifteen seats. Terpstra personally received 1,297 votes.
Leiden alderman (since 2022)
Following their membership of the House, Terpstra started working for construction firm Heijmans in July 2021. They were the CDA's lead candidate in the March 2022 Dutch municipal election in Leiden. The local campaign was notable for humorously distancing itself from the national party. Its website stated that voters might think twice about voting for the CDA nationally, but that the local party is allowed to be different due to the lack of Kim Jung Hoekstra practices, combining the names of party leader Wopke Hoekstra and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. The CDA lost one of its three seats – following national polling trends – and Terpstra was sworn into the council on 30 March. The CDA joined Leiden's new governing coalition as its only non-leftist member party. Terpstra represented their party in the municipal executive as alderman responsible for housing, construction, and welfare. Their term started on 16 June, having stepped down as councilor two days before. That same month, investigative journalism platform Follow the Money wrote that sites Terpstra and Koerhuis had promoted for housing developments as members of parliament were partially owned by major property developers. Terpstra subsequently denied having had ties with developers.
Personal life
While an MP, Terpstra lived in the South Holland city Leiden with their wife Kirsten Kok. They met while studying and married in July 2018, and they have a daughter. Nederlands Dagblad reported in 2013 that Terpstra was a member of the Reformed Church (Liberated).

The Mongolian ground jay (Podoces hendersoni) or Henderson's ground jay, is a species of bird in the family Corvidae.
Description
The bird is light tan with iridescent blue on its primary feathers. It has a long, curved beak and a black stripe on its forehead.
Distribution
It is found in arid areas of Central Asia (Mongolia, northern China and adjacent areas of Russia and Kazakhstan).
Behaviour
Females spend more time foraging and the males spend more time brooding the chicks at the start of the nesting period. The main diet of the nestling Mongolian ground jay consists of common lizards, toad-headed agama, and invertebrates. It is proposed that Mongolian ground jays feed their chicks based on the availability of their food rather than in relation to the stage of the chicks development.

Animal welfare and rights in Brazil are about the laws concerning and treatment of non-human animals in Brazil. Brazil is a leading producer of animal products, and its allowance of intensive animal farming methods such as extreme confinement make farm animal welfare a major concern.
Compared to other countries, Brazil also uses large numbers of animals for fur and research. Recent years have seen several welfare reforms by the government and major meat producers.
Regulations
Brazil's first animal welfare law was a 1924 decree prohibiting "carrying out any behavior or recreation that cause[s] suffering to animals." A more comprehensive 1934 decree stipulated that animals not be overworked or kept where they cannot breathe properly, move, or rest, or are deprived of air or light, and that animals be given a quick death (whether or not they are for human consumption). The decree also prohibits abandoning a sick, injured or mutilated animal and failing to provide an animal with "all that is necessary", including veterinary assistance. Lawyers from the Public Ministry or from animal protection organizations are allowed to assist animals in court, giving animals a degree of legal standing which they lack in many countries such as the United States.
Brazil's constitution (1988) states that the government must protect animals from cruelty. In 1997 this constitutional protection was invoked in a historic decision by the Brazilian Supreme Court to uphold a ban on Farra do Boi, a festival involving the torture and killing of bulls and oxen in the state of Santa Catarina.
A 1998 law prohibits the abuse of domestic and wild animals. It imposes more serious penalties for cruelty than the 1934 decree, with a sentence of 3 months to a year plus a fine, with the penalty increased by one-sixth to one-third if the animal is killed. A 2012 update to the Penal Code increased the penalty for cruelty from 3 months–1 year to 1–4 years, and up to 6 years if the animal is killed.
The 1998 does not specifically address farm animals. A 2000 Normative Instruction regulates pre-slaughter handling and slaughter methods, stating handling must minimize stress and forbids the use of "aggressive instruments in slaughter". 2008 instructions establish procedures for rearing and transporting animals and provide for the production of Manuals of Good Practice (whose adoption is voluntary). In that year the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Food Supply established the Permanent Technical Commission of Animal Welfare, whose tasks include the promotion of animal welfare-related events, the training of those involved in the livestock chain, and the publication and dissemination of technical material on animal welfare.
Birds, which make up the large majority of land animals slaughtered for food in Brazil, are exempt from laws governing transport or export that affect animal welfare.
In 2008 Brazil passed its first federal regulation specifically addressing animals in scientific research. The 2008 law provides for the creation of a National Animal Control and Experimentation Committee and institutional Ethical Committees on Animal Use, which are to follow the principles of the Three Rs: replacement of animals with non-animal methods, reduction of the number of animals used, and refinement of techniques used on animals.
In 2014, Brazil banned most animal cosmetics testing, though testing ingredients with unknown effects on animals is allowed, as is testing on animals in other countries and selling the resulting products in Brazil.
In 2014, Brazil received a C out of possible grades A,B,C,D,E,F,G on World Animal Protection's Animal Protection Index.
In September 29th of 2020, president Jair Bolsonaro sanctioned a law that imposes more severe punishment for mistreatment of animals, namely dogs and cats. It increases the penalty to 2–5 years of imprisonment and a fine, and forbids the convict to own animals.
Animals used for food
Agriculture and animals
A 2014 source states that Brazil has the world's second-largest cattle herd (behind India) at 187 million animals. In 2009 Brazil had the fourth-largest chicken population (behind China, the U.S., and Indonesia) at around 1.2 billion.
A 2012 report states that Brazil is the fifth-largest producer of pig meat, fourth-largest producer of turkey meat, third-largest producer of chicken meat, and second-largest producer of cattle meat.
A 2014 source states that Brazil is the second-largest fish consumer in the world (behind Japan) at 12 kg per person per year. Brazil produces about 1.25 million tons of fish per year, with around 38% coming from aquaculture.
Intensive animal farming
Brazilian animal farms have been shifting towards a confinement model. Battery cages, gestation crates, and veal crates - systems of extreme confinement - are legal in Brazil. At any given time, there are over 70 million egg-laying hens living in battery cages and almost 1.5 million breeding sows in gestation crates.
In 2014, BRF - Brazil's largest pork producer - committed to phasing out the continuous use of gestation crates from its supply chain by 2026. In 2015, JBS - the world's largest animal protein processing company - announced plans to phase out all use of gestation crates at company-owned facilities by 2016, and the Brazilian Pork Producers Association announced that it will lead a study concerning a transition to higher-welfare group housing systems.
Transport and animals
The welfare of animals in transport is a major issue. Brazil is the world's leading exporter of live cattle and chicken Exported animals face severe welfare threats, as highlighted by the 2012 incident in which 2700 cattle died in the heat on a vessel attempting to unload at ports in the Middle East. Transport within Brazil is also a problem. Poor road conditions and weather often make journeys to the slaughterhouse last sixty or more hours, leading to extreme stress and death for the animals.
Government involvement
The government actively encourages the growth of the animal agriculture industry. From 2007-2009 the Brazilian National Development Bank invested $2.65 billion in the country's three largest beef suppliers. In 2010, the Agriculture and Livestock Plan doubled the credits available to the industry. In 2012, the government announced a plan to invest $2 billion until 2014 "to double catches and reach two million tons of fish annually."
Vegetarianism and veganism
In a 2012 survey of Brazilians, approximately 8% of respondents identified as vegetarian. The percentage of vegetarians was higher among those 65–75 years old (10%) than those aged 20–24 (7%). The study did not measure the number of vegans.
Animals used for clothing
Brazil is one of the biggest producers of chinchilla fur in the world.
In 2014 the state of São Paulo banned most fur farming, imposing a fine of at least 10,000 reais (approximately 2880 USD) for offenders.
Animals used in science
A total of 3,497,653 animals were used in research published in 18 journals in the State of Paraná in 2006. From this the authors conclude that "it can be extrapolated that, in the whole of Brazil, the total number of animals used every year is extremely high in terms of the worldwide use of animals in experimentation."
Animal personhood
In 2005, a writ of habeas corpus was requested for Suíça, a chimpanzee caged in allegedly inadequate conditions at a zoo. The court agreed to hear the case, but Suica died before a decision could be made. According to Gordilho, "This was the first case that recognised a chimpanzee as a plaintiff that achieved standing in a court of law through representatives."
Several years earlier, a habeas corpus petition to release a caged bird had been dismissed.
Aftermath, these activists founded a peer-reviewed open access academic journal, which is named as Brazilian Animal Law Journal (In Portuguese: Revista Brasileira de Direito Animal). This journal is the first academic journal of Latin America specialized in Animal Law.
Animal activism
According to World Animal Protection, Brazil has "a thriving animal protection movement dating back to the 19th century." Two Brazilian groups were represented at the 1910 International Congress of animal protection organizations in Washington, D.C. (compared with much larger delegations from Europe, the U.S., and Canada).
The Brazilian No More Cruelty! movement is aimed at increasing sentences for animal cruelty. In January 2012, in over 150 cities thousands of protesters marched under the No More Cruelty! slogan. On Paulista Avenue, São Paulo alone there were 10,000 protesters. Later that year, changes to the Penal Code included an increase in the penalty for cruelty from 3 months-1 year to 1–4 years, and up to 6 years if the animal is killed. Sentences of 1–4 years were assigned to neglect and abandonment, promoting or participating in cockfighting was given up to 6 years. In 2013, No More Cruelty! protests were again held in over 165 cities.
Domestic animal protection organizations include ProAnima, which focuses on ending the use of animals in circuses and horse carting and stopping the slaughter of street dogs and cats, and Fórum Nacional de Proteção e Defesa Animal, which addresses a range of companions and farm animal issues. Both were involved in the Be Cruelty-Free Brazil campaign to ban cosmetics testing.
Humane Society International is active in Brazil, having led the Be Cruelty-Free Brazil campaign which resulted in the partial ban on cosmetics testing and working with civil societies to promote Meatless Monday.

Reception
Cash Box magazine said "This pop-rock sextet practically owns Australia, and it doesn't do too badly on the airwaves elsewhere in the world. This time, the inventive Aussies have recruited Beatles studio wizard George Martin as producer, and the musical marriage is one made in heaven. The first three songs on Time Exposure's first side are all potential top 40 hits."

Dubautia imbricata is a rare species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae known by the common names bog dubautia and imbricate dubautia. It is endemic to Hawaii where it is known only from the island of Kauai. There are four known occurrences. Like other Dubautia this plant is known as na`ena`e.
This member of the silversword alliance was first described to science in 1981 after it was discovered in a Kauaian rainforest. It grows in just a few spots in boggy forest habitat in the understory of ʻōhiʻa lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha) trees among sedges in the genera Oreobolus and Rhynchospora.
There are two subspecies. Both are rare and ssp. imbricata was federally listed as an endangered species of the United States in 2010.
This plant is a clumpy, bushy shrub which reaches tall by wide. The oppositely arranged leaves are up to long by wide. The inflorescence is a cluster of many flower heads, each of which contains several yellow flowers.
Both subspecies are known to hybridize with other Dubautia.

The black-eared shrike-babbler (Pteruthius melanotis) is a bird species in the vireo family, Vireonidae. It was traditionally considered as an aberrant Old World babbler and formerly placed in the family Timaliidae. It was long noted that their habits resembled those of vireos, but this was previously ascribed to the result of convergent evolution. It is found in Southeast Asia from the Himalayas to western Malaysia. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forests.

Count Nicodemus Tessin the Younger (May 23, 1654 – April 10, 1728) was a Swedish Baroque architect, city planner, and administrator.
The son of Nicodemus Tessin the Elder and the father of Carl Gustaf Tessin, Tessin the Younger was the middle generation of the brief Tessin dynasty, which has had a lasting influence on Swedish architecture and history.
Biography
Early life
Tessin was born on May 23, 1654, as the only child of Nicodemus Tessin the Elder, son of the mayor of Stralsund, and Maria Svan, daughter of the mayor of Västerås. They showed artistic talents at an early age and was given an education in Mathematics and language at Uppsala, where they must have been influenced by Olaus Rudbeck who was at the time highly engaged in the scientific basis of architecture and botany.
In 1673, 19 years old, they accompanied Marchese del Monte, the Emissary of Queen Christina, to Italy and Rome, where the royal protection ensured they would get the best teachers available; leading architects of the era such as Carlo Fontana and Gian Lorenzo Bernini. These architects, together with the compulsory study of classical monuments, made a lasting impression on Tessin. Upon their return to Sweden after four years, the Swedish king immediately sent them on a second trip which would last 1677-78 and take them to England and France were prominent architects such as André Le Nôtre and Jean Bérain had a deep impact on Tessin's later decorations and gardens. In 1687-88 they traveled to Rome and back to Sweden through Austria and Germany. During the trip they made extensive notes in a diary describing works of architecture they saw during the journey. Together with their stepbrother Abraham Winands, Tessin actively took part in their father's work, and when Tessin inherited their father's position, they asked to share it with Winands and the two would keep working side by side until the death of Winands in 1709.
Work as an architect
When Tessin the Elder came to Stockholm, Sweden was still a major European power and Swedish nobility had the funds required to carry through prestigious architectural projects, a situation which changed dramatically with the Reduction through which the nobility lost their financial power and found themselves sidestepped by highly educated public officials who were gradually raised to nobility. As parts of this latter group, Tessin the Elder was raised to lesser nobility in 1674 and Tessin the Younger became count in 1714. However, the Reduction also meant considerably fewer assignments from the nobility, and when Tessin the Younger succeeded their father in 1681, their main clients was the church and the royal court, with the many ambitious palaces and gardens of Queen Hedvig Elenora as the most important projects.
In the end of the 1680s, King Charles XI commissioned Tessin to modernise the northern part of the Stockholm Palace, why the architect had the opportunity to do a second study tour, including the Netherlands, France, and Italy. This time, however, they were met with great respect all over the continent, and they later proudly retold the event when King Louis XIV of France had the fountains at the Versailles Palace play upon their visit, a tribute normally only granted foreign princes. During this trip Tessin met Daniel Cronström who became one of their invaluable colleagues and an important contact on the continent as Tessin's projects in Sweden required them to negotiate with manufacturers and artists abroad. Their correspondence has also proven invaluable for later historical research. Upon their return they have immediately begun their work on the royal palace, and in 1695 their large-scale northern Baroque façade was completed, apparently inspired by Bernini's project at the Louvre. Ambitions to further renew the palace first came to a halt as the king died, and were then given a completely new perspective as the palace was destroyed by fire in 1697. Tessin was appointed to produce plans for a new palace the day after the fire and they quickly produced a proposal which pleased both the young King Charles XII and their regency. However, as Charles XII left Sweden for their lengthy campaigns on the continent in 1700, works on the palace first progressed slowly and following the devastating Battle of Poltava in 1709 came to a new halt. Even though Tessin spent much of their remaining life producing detailed plans for the palace, it remained incomplete by the time for their death.
In 1690, Tessin married their mistress Hedvig Eleonora Stenbock (1658–1714), maid of honour of Queen Hedvig Elenora. However, at this time Tessin still belonged to the lesser nobility and their marriage to a woman from the high nobility was regarded as inappropriate. The marriage therefore had to take place secretly in Pomerania and, to repair the situation, Tessin had to produce a residence in accordance to their wife's status. Works on the Tessin Palace begun in 1694 and initially progressed slowly, but in 1697 Tessin and their family could move in and in 1701, two years after Tessin had been promoted to high nobility, the interior was completed to the extent Tessin could invite the widowed queen and the royal family to a supper. Besides their own palace, the gardens of the Drottningholm Palace and Steninge Palace, both located not far from Stockholm, are often pointed out as their greatest achievements.
Later life
Most of Tessin's projects as an architect were produced during the 17th century, including several churches such the King Charles' Church in Kungsör and the Holy Trinity Church in Karlskrona, and many of their proposals never were built. During their later life, they played an important role as an administrator and they also produced ambitious city plans for Stockholm in connection to their work for the royal palace.
Progeny
Tessin the Younger was the father of Carl Gustaf Tessin, one of the most influential Swedish politicians of their time.

The 2009–10 season was Aston Villa's 135th professional season; their 99th season in the top-flight and their 22nd consecutive season in the top flight of English football, the Premier League. They were managed by Martin O'Neill – in their fourth season since replacing David O'Leary. The 2009–10 season was Villa's second consecutive spell in European competition for the club, and the first in the newly formatted UEFA Europa League.
This term marked the first for the club without long-term player and former captain Gareth Barry following their £12million move to Manchester City on 2 June 2009. Barry had been at the club since 1997.
The Birmingham Derby made a return to the Premier League after local rivals Birmingham City were promoted to the top tier. Villa won the first of two fixtures 1–0 at St Andrew's on 13 September 2009 with Gabriel Agbonlahor scoring the winning goal. Villa also won the return fixture at Villa Park 1–0 on 25 April 2010, thanks to a James Milner penalty. Villa also played games against newly promoted Wolves from nearby Wolverhampton, resulting in a 1–1 draw at Molineux and a 2–2 draw at Villa Park.
The club progressed to the final of the League Cup during this season, eliminating Cardiff City, Sunderland, Portsmouth and Blackburn Rovers along the way. However, Aston Villa were beaten 2–1 by Manchester United in the final at Wembley Stadium on 28 February 2010. Villa's other domestic cup venture also took the club to Wembley in the FA Cup, where they were defeated 3–0 by Chelsea in the semi-final. Aston Villa finished 6th in the Premier League for the 3rd year in a row, with 2 points more than previous season, they also qualified for the Europa League for the 3rd year running.

Kit changes
The club once again dismissed sponsorship payments to allow Acorns as a charitable sponsor. A new away kit was unveiled on 24 May 2009 and inspired by the England national football team. It features a white and gray halved style with pinstripes and a navy accent, intended to pay tribute to the 67 Villa players that have appeared for the country while at the club. The blue and black away kit of 2008–09 also became this season's third kit.
The new home kit was unveiled the day before the first clash of the Peace Cup 2009, which was against Málaga on Saturday 25 July.

Formula E is a single seater motorsport championship that uses only electric cars. The series is promoted and owned by Formula E Holdings and administered by the global governing body of motorsport, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), since its inception in 2014. The Formula E season consists of a series of races. known as ePrixs, held usually in city centres, and in a few cases on permanent racing circuits. Points are awarded based on individual race results as well as for earning pole position in qualifying, setting the fastest lap in the group stage, and fastest lap during the race, with the highest tally of points winning the respective championship or trophy. The two main awards in the series are the Drivers' Championship and the Teams' Championship. A driver and team secures the Championship each season when it is no longer mathematically possible for another driver and team to beat them no matter the outcome of the remaining races, although it is not officially awarded until the conclusion of the season at the FIA Prize Giving Ceremony held in various locations around the world.
out of the seventy-seven drivers who started a ePrix, there have been seven Formula E Drivers' Championships. The first Formula E Drivers' Champion was Nelson Piquet in the 2014–15 season and the current titleholder is Stoffel Vandoorne in the 2021–22 season. Jean-Éric Vergne holds the record for the most Drivers' Championships, having achieved the title on two occasions, while the other six Drivers' Champions have won the title just once. It has been won by drivers from Brazil twice between two drivers, followed by France with two championships from a single driver. The Drivers' Championship has been claimed in the final race of the season six times in the eight seasons it has been awarded. Out of the 15 teams that have entered a ePrix, a total of four have won the Teams' Championship. Renault e.Dams holds the record for the highest number of Teams' Championship victories, having won the title on three occasions. German teams have won the title three times between two teams and French squads have earned the accolade three times between one team.

The following is a list of English words without rhymes, called refractory rhymes—that is, a list of words in the English language that rhyme with no other English word. The word "rhyme" here is used in the strict sense, called a perfect rhyme, that the words are pronounced the same from the vowel of the main stressed syllable onwards. The list was compiled from the point of view of Received Pronunciation (with a few exceptions for General American), and may not work for other accents or dialects. Multiple-word rhymes (a phrase that rhymes with a word, known as a phrasal or mosaic rhyme), self-rhymes (adding a prefix to a word and counting it as a rhyme of itself), and identical rhymes (words that are identical in their stressed syllables, such as bay and obey) are often not counted as true rhymes and have not been considered. Only the list of one-syllable words can hope to be anything near complete; for polysyllabic words, rhymes are the exception rather than the rule.
Definition of perfect rhyme
Following the strict definition of rhyme, a perfect rhyme demands the exact match of all sounds from the last stressed vowel to the end of the word. Therefore, words with the stress far from the end are more likely to have no perfect rhymes. For instance, a perfect rhyme for discomBOBulate would have to rhyme three syllables, -OBulate. There are many words that match most of the sounds from the stressed vowel onwards and so are near rhymes, called slant rhymes. Ovulate, copulate, and populate, for example, vary only slightly in one consonant from discombobulate, and thus provide very usable rhymes for most situations in which a rhyme for discombobulate is desired. However, no other English word has exactly these three final syllables with this stress pattern. And since in most traditions the stressed syllable should not be identical—the consonant before the stressed vowel should be different—adding a prefix to a word, as be-elbow for elbow, does not create a perfect rhyme for it.
Words that rhyme in one accent or dialect may not rhyme in another. A commonplace example of this is the word of , which when stressed had no rhymes in British Received Pronunciation prior to the 19th century, but which rhymed with grave and mauve in some varieties of General American. In the other direction, iron has no rhyme in General American, but many in RP. Words may also have more than one pronunciation, one with a rhyme, and one without.
Words with obscure perfect rhymes
This list includes rhymes of words that have been listed as rhymeless.
aitch rhymes with dialectal nache (the bony point on the rump of an ox or cow), Rach, a hypocoristic for the name Rachel, one pronunciation of obsolete rache (a streak down a horse's face), and the surname of Anne Heche.
angst rhymes with manxed and wangst, self-indulgent self-pity (a portmanteau of wank and angst); phalanxed is not a perfect rhyme because the stress is on the wrong syllable. The alternative American pronunciation has no rhymes.

Non-rhyming English words
The majority of words with antepenultimate stress, such as ambulance, citizen, dangerous and obvious, and with preantepenultimate stress, such as (un)necessary, logarithm, algorithm and sacrificing, have no rhyme.
Masculine rhymes
Refractory one-syllable rhymes are uncommon; there may be fewer than a hundred in English. A great many end in a present or historical suffix -th, or are plural or participle forms. This list includes a few polysyllabic masculine rhymes such as obliged, which have one syllable in their rhyming part.
adzed
airt (rhymes with the Scots pronunciations of a number of other words, e.g. "pairt", a Scots variant of "part")
alb /-ælb/ (rhymes with some pronunciations of the proper noun "Kalb" in the name of Johann de Kalb)
amongst /-ʌŋst/ ("quincunxed" could qualify as a rhyme if its second syllable is given secondary stress and if secondary stress is considered sufficient for a perfect rhyme)
angsts

yoicks, joik, -s pork and forge have no rhymes in conservative RP and GA. However, the distinction between horse and hoarse has been mostly lost in younger generations, and for them and many others pork which was an exception to the normal rule, now rhymes with fork, cork, etc. (). The OED no longer lists as an alternative pronunciation in its third edition.
Nonce words ending in -ed ('provided with') may produce other potentially refractory masculine rhymes. There are additional words which are only partially assimilated into English, such as Russian kovsh , which are refractory rhymes.
The contraction daren't has any known rhymes in any English dialect, however the legitimacy of contractions as a single word is disputed. Regardless of this, daren't lacks both perfect rhymes and phrasal rhymes.
Although not meant as a complete list, there are some additional refractory rhymes in GA. Some of these are due to RP being a non-rhotic accent, and having merged rhymes formerly distinguished by .
heighth, -s
iron
karsts
Feminine rhymes
For feminine rhymes, the final two syllables must match to count as a rhyme. Once the stress shifts to the penultimate syllable, rhymeless words are quite common, perhaps even the norm: there may be more rhymeless words than words with rhymes. The following words are representative, but there are thousands of others.

Giovanni Boccati or Giovanni di Pier Matteo Boccati (c. 1420 – after 1480) was an Italian painter.
Biography
Boccati was born in Camerino, in the region of Marche. They lived and worked in Camerino, Padua, Perugia, and Urbino. Their first documented work is the Madonna del Pergolato (1447); that painting, Madonna dell'Orchestra, and a Pietà (1479) are on display in the Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria in Perugia. By 1445 they had become a citizen of Perugia.
It is not known where they were trained, but their painting suggests the influences of painters such as Fra Angelico, Filippo Lippi, and Domenico Veneziano.
They painted frescoes in the Palazzo Ducale in Urbino, and an altarpiece (1473) in Orvieto. In 1480, they were paid for two altarpieces in Perugia. They painted a Virgin and Child enthroned, and surrounded by Angels, Seraphim, and Saints (1447) in Perugia. Boccati's "Adoration of the Magi" is found in the Sinebrychoff Art Museum in Helsinki, Finland.
They painted a polyptych (1468) for the main altar of the church of Sant'Eustachio a Belforte del Chienti in the province of Macerata, Marche. The polyptych depicts events in the life, martyrdom, and glory of Saint Eustachius, patron of the town. It also depicts a number of other saints, including the Magdalen, St Barbara, St Agatha, St Venantius, and St Antonio Abate.

The Braemar Alliance is a group of ASX-listed public and private mining and exploration companies with projects located in the Braemar region between Peterborough in South Australia and Broken Hill in neighboring New South Wales. The group was formed in 2011 with the intention of devising shared infrastructure solutions to provide water, power and freight corridors for the benefit of all members' projects. The Alliance's member companies have considered using existing outports and developing new ones on the eastern coast of Spencer Gulf to facilitate bulk exports, chiefly of iron ore. These include developing transshipping facilities at Port Pirie and building entirely new facilities at Myponie Point and south of Wallaroo (provisionally called Port Havilah). In July 2011, the Braemar Alliance had determined that its magnetite processing would require 50 gigalitres of water per year (135 megalitres per day) and that the water would be provided via a yet-to-be-constructed seawater desalination plant to be located on Spencer Gulf.
In 2011, the Braemar Alliance's membership included Carpentaria Exploration, Havilah Resources, Minotaur Exploration, Royal Resources and U3O8 and private companies, Sinosteel PepinNini Curnamona Management, Bonython Metals Group and Wentworth Metal Group.
Braemar Infrastructure
In 2012, the private company Braemar Infrastructure Pty Ltd was established. As of 2015, the company intends to develop an iron ore export facility at Myponie Point with up to four slurry pipelines connecting the port to various prospective mine sites in the Braemar region. Braemar Infrastructure is affiliated with Braemar Iron Pty Ltd, Lodestone Equities and Olary Magnetite Pty Ltd which own, hold and operate exploration licenses in the Braemar region.
Status
In 2013, the Braemar bulk export infrastructure proposal received Major Development Status from the Government of South Australia. Braemar Infrastructure's chairperson Graham Toll told the media that investment of $3 billion would need to be raised before the project could proceed.

Calypso tents are venues in which calypsonians perform during the Carnival season. They usually are cinema halls, community centers, or other indoor buildings which have seating and stage arrangements to host the entertainers, guests and patrons; or outdoor shows which are held in parks or, more famously, in the Queen's Park Savannah. Some of these tents are held at many venues, called Roving Caravans or Roving Tents.
Such venues are still called "tents" because calypsonians all used to sing on stages which were literally covered by a tent. The first such tent was organised by a calypsonian whose sobriquet was Railway Douglas. As time went along, buildings and other empty spaces that were properly arranged were also used, but the name stuck.
Although traditional calypso has lost ground to soca and party music, the Tents remain popular venues and still serve as a launch pad for many young artists.

Maurice Généreux is a Canadian physician who was convicted in 1998 of prescribing medications to two HIV-positive men in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in 1996—medications that allowed the men, Mark Jewitt and Aaron Mcginn, to commit suicide in 1996. Généreux was the first doctor in North America to be convicted of assisting a suicide (followed in 1999 by Jack Kevorkian).
Mark Jewitt took a lethal dose but managed to survive after a friend found them and called the emergency services. Aaron McGinn died in 1996 from an overdose of sleeping pills provided by Généreux. Généreux forged McGinn's death certificate, moreover, to make it look as if McGinn had died from AIDS rather than from sleeping pills. The investigation into Généreux started when a friend raised doubts about McGinn's death to the chief coroner in Toronto. Following an investigation, Généreux was arrested on 20 June 1996.
Généreux was sent to prison for two years minus a day and lost their medical license.
According to Ian Dowbiggin, the author of A Concise History of Euthanasia, Généreux's actions revealed an "underground" network of euthanasia provision for AIDS sufferers in Toronto's gay community; however, Dowbiggin's assertions have not been proven. Aaron McGinn was HIV positive but they were not palliative and could have lived a long and healthy life with the medications available. Genereux's actions revealed a failure of the judicial system and The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (the self-regulating governing body for the province's medical profession). Généreux had previous convictions for sexually assaulting their patients but was allowed to continue practising medicine.

Sierra Leone sent a delegation to compete at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 7 to 18 September 2016. This was the nation's third time competing at the Summer Paralympic Games after it made its debut twenty years prior at the 1996 Summer Paralympics. The delegation consisted of a single athlete, table tennis player George Wyndham, who lost both of their preliminary round matches to Zhang Yan of China and Thailand's Wanchai Chaiwut in the men's singles class 4 tournament and advanced no further in the competition.
Background
Sierra Leone made its Paralympic debut at the 1996 Summer Paralympics in Atlanta, United States. The country did not participate in another Summer Paralympic Games until the 2012 London Paralympics. This made the Rio de Janeiro Summer Games Sierra Leone's third appearance at a Summer Paralympiad. The 2016 Summer Paralympics were held from 7–18 September 2016 with a total of 4,328 athletes representing 159 National Paralympic Committees (NPCs) taking part. Sierra Leone sent one athlete to Rio de Janeiro: table tennis player George Wyndham. They received financial assistance from the United Nations Development Programme. Wyndham was accompanied by executive secretary of the Association of Sports for the Disabled (the Sierra Leonean NPC) Alexander Thullah, director of sports Ibrahim Bangura, deputy minister of sports Ishmael Al Sankoh Conteh and coaches Emmanuel Lebbie and Alhassan Kamara. They were chosen as the flag bearer during the parade of nations for the opening ceremony.
Disability classifications
Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.
Table tennis
Paralympic debutant George Wyndman contracted polio at the age of five and they have used a wheelchair since. They began athletics at the age of eleven before switching to table tennis after a coach convinced them to take up the sport. Wyndham was 26 years old at the time of the Rio Summer Paralympics and was living in an office at the Siaka Stevens Stadium. They qualified for the men's singles class 4 tournament after receiving a wildcard from the Tripartite Commission. Before the Games, Wyndham said they wanted to become a catalyst of change for disability sports in Sierra Leone, "My dream is to see a delegation of 30 or 40 athletes going to a game from Sierra Leone. I want more facilities and more equipment to incorporate other people with impairments in Sierra Leone." Their first match was against Zhang Yan of China in the group round on 8 September. Wyndham lost the eighteen-minute match three sets to one with scores of 11–2, 11–6, 9–11 and 11–5. They lost their second match to Thailand's Wanchai Chaiwut three sets to zero (11–2, 11–9, 11–9) the following day and therefore that was the end of their competition because they were third and last in Group F and only the top two in each group could advance to the round of 16.

The Crișana dialect (subdialectul / graiul crișean) is one of the dialects of the Romanian language (Daco-Romanian). Its geographic distribution covers approximately the historical region of Crișana, in western Transylvania.
Classification
The Crișana dialect is part of the group of relatively fragmented Transylvanian varieties, along with the Maramureș dialect. As such, the Crișana dialect is a member of the northern group of Romanian dialects, which also includes Moldavian and Banat, and shares with them a large number of characteristics, as opposed to the Wallachian dialect.
As with all other dialects of Romanian, the one of Crișana is distinguished primarily by its phonetic features and to a lesser degree by its morphological, syntactic, and lexical features. However, in the context of the more fragmented Transylvanian speech varieties, these characteristics are less distinct than those of other dialectal areas. As a consequence, in some classifications the Crișana dialect is not individualized, such as those of Gustav Weigand, Alexandru Philippide, Iorgu Iordan and Emanuel Vasiliu. Other analyses, however, include the Crișana dialect in their classifications of four or five dialects (the fifth would be the even less distinct Maramureș dialect); this view is supported particularly by more recent studies, such as those of Romulus Todoran, Emil Petrovici, and Ion Coteanu. This divergence is a matter of definition.
Geographic distribution
The Crișana dialect has its name from the historical region of Crișana, although the dialectal area and the historical region only partially overlap. More precisely, the dialect is spoken in the following Romanian counties: Bihor, Sălaj, Satu Mare, Alba (north-western part), Cluj (western half), Arad (northern half, delimited by the Mureș river), Hunedoara (northern part), Maramureș (south-western part).
Subdivisions
Several varieties can be further distinguished within the Crișana dialect, specifically those of Bihor, Țara Moților, the area of the Someș River, and Țara Oașului.
Particularities
Phonetic features
Unstressed vowels often close to , respectively: for standard pahar, pune, acoperit.
Conversely, vowel sometimes opens to : for standard pădure, căpătat.
The diphthong is systematically monophthongized to : for standard poate, coajă.
After labials, becomes and the diphthong is monophthongized to : for standard merg, meargă.
After the consonants , front vowels become central, and the diphthong monophthongizes to : for standard singur, seară, zeamă, țin. In certain areas, the same happens with consonants ; in other areas, they palatalize and make the subsequent central vowels front: for standard coajă, ușă.
The vowel in word-initial positions diphthongizes to : for standard oi, orb.
Asyllabic word-final vowels occur: for standard a spus.
The diphthong monophthongizes to : for standard câine, mâine, pâine.
The diphthong becomes in certain words: for standard băiat, tămâiat.
The archaic consonant becomes in most of the dialectal area, whereas is preserved, although in free variation with .
The labials and the labio-dentals are palatalized in specific ways when followed by front vowels: become , respectively; becomes or , and becomes or . Examples: for standard piele, bine, mic, (să) fie, vițel. However, the palatalization is not generalized (it is more widespread in the northern part of the dialectal area) and fluctuations occur.
Dentals palatalize when followed by front vowels: for standard frate, bade.
The affricate remains unchanged, while becomes : for standard sânge, fuge.
The sequence receives an epenthetic and becomes : for standard slab, slănină.
In Țara Moților, a specific kind of rhotacism occurs, by which intervocalic is replaced with in old words: for standard oameni, lumină. An identical phenomenon, which may be historically related, occurs in Istro-Romanian.
In Țara Oașului, when is followed by a consonant, it is velarized to or even : for standard alb.
In Țara Oașului, the consonant is realized with multiple vibrations.
Morphological and syntactical features
The possessive article is invariable: a meu, a mea, a mei, a mele ("mine", compare with standard al meu, a mea, ai mei, ale mele).
Some verbs of the 1st and 4th conjugation groups do not take the -ez and -esc suffixes: lucră, străluce ("he works", "it shines", compare with standard lucrează, strălucește). On the other hand, the suffix -esc does occur sometimes where in the standard language it doesn't: împărțăsc, înghițăsc, simțăsc ("I divide", "I swallow", "I feel", compare with standard împart, înghit, simt).
The auxiliary used for the compound perfect of verbs in the 3rd person is o for the singular and or / o for the plural: ("he said", "they said", compare with standard a zis, au zis).
The conjunction used for subjunctives is și: și facă ("for them to do, that they do", compare with standard să facă).
The following forms occur for the 3rd person of the subjunctive, both singular and plural: să deie, să steie, să beie, să vreie, ending in , where the standard language has să dea, să stea, să bea, să vrea, ending in .
The past tense of the optative-conditional mood is formed using the auxiliary a vrea and the infinitive, for instance o vu cânta, totally different from the standard ar fi cântat.
When the object of a verb is another verb, the latter is in its infinitive form.
In some constructions, analytic forms are preferred to synthetic ones, e.g. the preposition cătă ("towards", standard către) is used instead of the dative: ("he said to me", compare with standard mi-a zis).
In certain areas, the imperative is formed using the long infinitive: nu plecareți!, nu vă lăudareți! (standard: nu plecați!, nu vă lăudați!).
In the northern and central parts of the dialectal area, certain verb forms have replaced with other sounds: ("I say", "I come", "coming", compare with standard spun, vin, venind). This feature is shared with the Wallachian dialect.
Lexical particularities
Particular forms of the indefinite pronouns (and their corresponding adjectives) occur: oarecine ("someone", standard cineva), oarece ("something", standard ceva).
Other specific words: arină ("sand", standard nisip), brâncă ("hand", mână), cotătoare ("mirror", oglindă), ștergură ("towel", prosop), vă! ("go!", du-te!), tulai! ("oh!", vai!), etc.
Sample
Crișana dialect:
Standard Romanian: Atunci iar a ieșit și s-a uitat. Am ridicat mâna. Și domnul a zis: Așa câine încă n-am văzut. Și-atunci câinele a venit cu oile și s-a uitat la mine [așteptând să vadă] ce-i mai spun. Că el a știut că-i mai spun ceva.
English translation: "Then it went out again and watched. I raised my hand. And the gentleman said: I've never seen a dog like this. And then the dog brought the sheep back and looked at me [waiting to see] what else I was going to say. Because it knew I was going to say something again."

The braille alphabet used to write Hungarian is based on the international norm for the 26 basic letters of the Latin script. However, the letters for q and z have been replaced, to increase the symmetry of the accented letters of the Hungarian alphabet, which are largely innovative to Hungarian braille.
Alphabet
The Hungarian alphabet is:
A Á B C Cs D Dz Dzs E É F G Gy H I Í J K L Ly M N Ny O Ó Ö Ő P (Q) R S Sz T Ty U Ú Ü Ű V (W) (X) (Y) Z Zs
The letters that conform to traditional braille are:
The accented vowel letters are derived from their base letters through stretching or reflection as follows. The traditional letter for q (which is not part of the basic Hungarian alphabet) has been reassigned to ö, and an unused pattern has been assigned to ü:
This creates the following symmetrical pattern for the umlauted vowels:
(Ä is not part of the basic Hungarian alphabet.)
The consonant digraphs are derived from their base letters as follows. The traditional letter for z has been replaced, and is used for a parenthesis. As with the accented vowels, the majority of digraphs are created through reflection:
This creates the following pattern among the sibilants:
Punctuation
Unlike English or French Braille, Hungarian Braille has separate opening and closing symbols for both parentheses and quotation marks.

William de Cambuslang (died 1361) was a 14th-century Scottish churchman, presumably coming from a family based at or originating from Cambuslang near Glasgow.
The first clear notice of their existence comes from their papal letter of provision to the bishopric of Dunblane dated 23 October 1347; in the letter Pope Clement VI complained about the election of William being made despite an earlier papal reservation of the see; Pope Clement declared the election null and void, before themselves providing William to the see directly, ordering them to be consecrated by Cardinal John, Bishop of Porto. The same letter said that William had previously been a canon of the cathedral chapter of Dunblane.
As Bishop of Dunblane, William witnessed at least six charters that are extant. They were sent, along with three other bishops, on a diplomatic mission to England in early 1351 relating to a temporary release of the imprisoned Scottish king David II; they and the bishops of St Andrews, Aberdeen and Brechin met English officials at Hexham. They were involved in another embassy in the summer, an embassy which met their English counterparts at Newcastle-upon-Tyne.
They last occurs in contemporary sources in a charter of Inchaffray Abbey dated 11 April 1358. A 16th-century insertion in the Donibristle manuscript of Walter Bower's Scotichronicon stated that they died on 1 November 1361; this cannot be correct however, as contemporary sources testify that they had already died by 18 June, but the year is nevertheless probably reliable. The same 16th century insertion is the only source for their surname, de Cambuslang.

5-Methoxytryptamine (5-MT), also known as mexamine, is a tryptamine derivative closely related to the neurotransmitters serotonin and melatonin. 5-MT has been shown to occur naturally in the body in low levels. It is biosynthesized via the deacetylation of melatonin in the pineal gland.
5-MT acts as a full agonist at the 5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5-HT4, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors. It has no affinity for the 5-HT3 receptor and its affinity for the 5-HT1E receptor is very weak in comparison to the other 5-HT1 receptors. Its affinity for the 5-HT5A receptor is unknown.
Measured affinity for some receptors (not a complete list):
5-HT1B receptors (Ki = 35 nM)
5-HT1D receptors (Ki = 7.3 nM)
5-HT1E receptors (Ki = 3151 nM)
5-HT1F receptors (Ki = 1166 nM)
5-HT2A receptors (Ki = 295 nM)
5-HT2B receptors (Ki = 16.4 nM)
5-HT2C receptors (Ki = 52.48 nM)
5-HT4 receptors (Ki = 501.18 nM)

Claude Samuel (23 June 1931 – 14 June 2020) was a French music critic and radio personality.
Biography
Born in Paris, after medical studies and graduating as a dental surgeon, Samuel chose to devote themselves to classical music journalism. They were a regular contributor to various newspapers of the daily press (Paris-Presse, from 1961 to 1970; Le Matin de Paris, from 1977 to 1987), of the weekly press (L'Express in 1959 and 1960; Le Nouveau Candide from 1961 to 1967; Le Point, from 1974 to 1989), the monthly press (Revue Réalités, and discs collection Philips-Réalités from 1957 to 1960) and the music press (Harmonie, Le Panorama de la Musique, Musiques, La Lettre du musicien, Diapason, where they have been responsible for the "Ce jour-là" column since 2001). They also commented on cultural news since 2007 until November 2018 in a weekly blog.
A producer of programs at the R.T.F. then at the O.R.T.F. (more than a thousand broadcasts from 1957 to 2007 for France Culture and France Musique), they were Director of Music (appointed under the presidency of Jean Maheu) from 1989 to 1996; in this capacity, they were vice-president of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées.
Devoting an important part of their activity, in different forms, to contemporary creation, they were responsible for the programming of the Royan Festival from 1965 to 1972 and then, after a dispute with the Royan authorities, they continued this work in La Rochelle from 1973 to 1977.
Creator of the "Centre Acanthes", an annual educational session for young composers and performers held successively at the Conservatoire d'Aix-en-Provence (1977–1986), at the Chartreuse de Villeneuve-lez-Avignon (1987–2003) and then at the Arsenal de Metz (2004–2011), they have invited a number of leading figures of contemporary music to attend: (Karlheinz Stockhausen, Iannis Xenakis, György Ligeti, Henri Dutilleux, Witold Lutosławski, Mauricio Kagel, Pierre Henry, Luciano Berio, Olivier Messiaen, Pierre Boulez, Luigi Nono, Tōru Takemitsu, Elliott Carter, Sofia Gubaidulina, Helmut Lachenmann, György Kurtág, Péter Eötvös, Wolfgang Rihm). At Radio France, they created and directed the from 1991 to 1997.
Very committed in the field of musical competitions, Claude Samuel created and directed the Olivier Messiaen Competition for contemporary piano (1977–2007) and the Concours de violoncelle Rostropovitch (1977–2009). Samuel has directed the "Concours de la Ville de Paris" from 1990 to 2014 (flute competition Jean-Pierre Rampal, trumpet competition Maurice André, piano-jazz competition Martial Solal, luthiery and arcèterie competition Étienne Vatelot).

Wapping Old Stairs is an 1894 comic opera in three acts, with music by Howard Talbot, which played at the Vaudeville Theatre in London. It included D'Oyly Carte Opera Company regulars Courtice Pounds, Richard Temple and Jessie Bond in the cast.
Production
Wapping Old Stairs had a lot of competition in London in 1894, which saw the openings of The Chieftain by Arthur Sullivan and F. C. Burnand, Their Excellency by F. Osmond Carr and W. S. Gilbert, Go-Bang by Adrian Ross and Carr, The Lady Slavey by John Crook and George Dance, a revival of Little Jack Sheppard by Meyer Lutz and H. P. Stephens at the Gaiety Theatre, Mirette by André Messager and Ross, and The Shop Girl, an extremely successful musical comedy by H. J. W. Dam, Ivan Caryll, Lionel Monckton and Ross.
Written around the title of an old song, Wapping Old Stairs was first mounted at the Theatre Royal in King's Lynn from 4 to 6 January 1894 before transferring to the Vaudeville Theatre in London. It has a libretto by Stuart Robertson and a score by Howard Talbot and was Talbot's first full professionally produced comic opera; it was directed and produced by Richard Temple. The success of this production in King's Lynn, where the musical magazine The Lute commented, "there is a freshness and vivacity in Mr. Talbot's music – particularly in the opening numbers – that as a modern comic opera entitle the work to more than ordinary consideration" led to a transfer of the show to the Vaudeville Theatre in London; there it ran for 43 performances, from 17 February to 6 April 1894. Despite a strong London cast including Jessie Bond, Courtice Pounds and Richard Temple from the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, the show was not well received in the West End, with the critic for The Times writing that the piece was an example "of the modified variety entertainment which is now in vogue" and which had "the complete absence of plot". In March 1894 various alterations were made to the piece to improve it, including introducing the ballad Wapping Old Stairs on which the work was based.
Synopsis
A review in St James's Gazette said of the production:
“The author and composer of ‘Wapping Old Stairs', the new opera or operetta produced at the Vaudeville on Saturday night, may be congratulated on having achieved a genuine musical and dramatic success. There is but little of the spectacular element in the piece; the same set scene does duty throughout, and almost the only dresses are those of sailors and of their constant associates, ‘the merry maids of Wapping'. The eminent musician in using for their score the old melody of ‘Wapping old Stairs' , which might have been treated with dramatic effect.
Mr Stuart Robertson's book, with but little dramatic basis is ingeniously constructed, and their lyrics are written with grace and point. It appears that in the last century, or even earlier, two sailors of Wapping fell in love with the same girl; on which the most unscrupulous of the young woman's admirers committed a murder, and so arranged matters that their rival was looked upon as the assassin and, to save their lives, fled to foreign parts. But after the lapse of many years the truth came out; when the good man returned to the land of their birth and the girl of their heart, while the bad man was executed, and after ‘ suspension by the neck' hung ignominiously in chains.
This story is, no doubt a little tragic for a comic opera, and the librettist, whilst softening its harsher features, has introduced in abundance the element of mirth.”

Chemical phosphorus removal is a wastewater treatment method, where phosphorus is removed using salts of aluminum (e.g. alum or polyaluminum chloride), iron (e.g. ferric chloride), or calcium (e.g. lime). Phosphate forms precipitates with the metal ions and is removed together with the sludge in the separation unit (sedimentation tank, flotation tank, etc.).
Aluminum sulfate treatment to reduce phosphorus content of lakes
One method of eutrophication remediation is the application of aluminum sulfate, a salt commonly used in the coagulation process of drinking water treatment. Aluminum sulfate, or “alum” as it is commonly referred, has been found to be an effective lake management tool by reducing the phosphorus load.
Alum was first applied in 1968 to a lake in Sweden. Its first application to an American lake followed in 1970. Today, alum has been utilized with improved effectiveness and understanding. In a large scale study, 114 lakes were monitored for the effectiveness of alum at phosphorus reduction. Across all lakes, alum effectively reduced the phosphorus for 11 years. While there was variety in the longevity, (21 years in deep lakes and 5.7 years in shallow lakes), the results express the effectiveness of alum at controlling phosphorus within lakes.
Mechanism
Alum treatment begins with the addition of aluminum sulfate salt to a water body. Once added, the salt dissolves and dissociates, introducing Al(III) ions to the water. The aluminum ions participate in a series of hydrolysis reactions, forming different aluminum species across pH ranges. As more aluminum sulfate is added, water pH decreases. At higher pH, the soluble species Al(OH)4− is present. In neutral pH ranges (6-8), the insoluble aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3) occurs. As pH decreases further, the Al(III) ion remains present.
Maintaining optimal pH is important for the removal of phosphorus from water. Phosphorus is most effectively removed at the neutral pH range, when the insoluble aluminum hydroxide is present. This hydroxide functions as a Lewis acid, creating a flocculation environment similar to conventional wastewater treatment. The insoluble Al(OH)3 floc adsorbs phosphorus, as well as other species, and removes them from the water column. As floc adsorption continues, the floc becomes larger, eventually settling to the bottom of the water column in the sediment. The resulting aluminum hydroxide layer covering the lake bottom additionally blocks the diffusion of phosphorus from sediment into the water column, further regulating internally loaded phosphorus.
Implementation
For most alum treatments, aluminum sulfate salt is applied to substrate at the lake's bottom, within the hypolimnion. The alum then reduces phosphorus levels by inactivating the phosphorus released from these lake sediments, thereby controlling phosphorus in the entire water column. This phosphorus supplied from within the lake sediments is known as "internally loaded" phosphorus, as opposed to "externally loaded" phosphorus supplied by sources outside the lake, such as runoff.
Although alum is typically applied to the hypolimnion, reducing phosphorus universally within the lake, it may also be applied to the epilimnion or locally to point sources. This style of alum treatment is similar to the use of alum in conventional water treatment, and is more effective at reducing externally loaded phosphorus than universal application of alum to the hypolimnion. When applied to the epilimnion, boats powered by an outboard motor are deployed onto a lake carrying aluminum sulfate. After determining the necessary dosage and location of the application, the aluminum sulfate is added to the surface of the lake near the wake of the outboard motor. This provides sufficient mixing of the aluminum sulfate within the epilimnion.
The necessary dosage of alum is determined by a variety of parameters. Changes in pH, dissolved oxygen levels, metal content of lake sediment, and lake size are all important for consideration. Alum dosage is calculated by scientist and engineers to increase the effectiveness.
Limitations
Alum treatment is less effective in deep lakes, as well as lakes with substantial external phosphorus loading. In deep lakes, the inactivation of phosphorus is not spread throughout the entire water column, as it is in shallower lakes due to the localization of aluminum hydroxide to the hypolimnion. Furthermore, externally loaded phosphorus often diffuses slowly downward from the lake surface, limiting its interaction with aluminum hydroxide within the hypolimnion and allowing phosphorus accumulation higher in the water column. Therefore, alum treatment is most effectively applied to shallow lakes with primarily internally loaded phosphorus. One exception is point sources of externally loaded phosphorus, which can be effectively regulated by direct application of aluminum sulfate to the source.
Another physical property to be considered is the ability of a lake to withstand mixing in the water column. Lakes with a higher Osgood Index, a parameter used to determine the amount of mixing a that occurs in a lake due to wind, have been found to result in more effective alum treatment. Another parameter is the ratio of the watershed area to the lake surface area. Lakes with lower watershed to lake area ratios experienced greater longevity following treatment. These lakes tend to be correlated with longer residence times and tend to be influenced by internally loaded phosphorus which aids in successful treatment. Regardless of application strategy, repeated alum treatment is often necessary for most lakes every 5 to 15 years. The necessity of repeated treatment requires continuous management and phosphorus monitoring to ensure optimal effectiveness.
Biological implications are another important consideration of alum treatment. Treatments increase water clarity, which has been correlated with increased plant growth at greater depths within the lake. Increased plant growth within lakes changes the character of the substrate, which is sometimes a factor in biodiversity. Lakes with benthic feeding fish such as carp tend to have lower success at removing phosphorus. These species forage in lake sediments which disturbs the aluminum hydroxide flocs binding phosphorus to the lake bottom. An additional concern is that aluminum salts can acidify lakes, making them potentially toxic to aquatic organisms. However, the aluminum sulfate dosage used for lake treatment is not often high enough to pose significant toxicity to fish, although declines in algae and invertebrates have been observed in treated lakes. The alum dosage is also insufficient to cause toxicity in humans, and is often similar to alum doses used in conventional drinking water treatment. To reduce negative biological effects, the accepted limit for dissolved aluminum concentrations in a water body is 50 μg Al/L and pH should be restricted to a range of 5.5-9.

The Marseille Contract (released in the US as The Destructors) is a 1974 British thriller film directed by Robert Parrish. It stars Michael Caine, Anthony Quinn and James Mason.
Set in France, the story concerns an American agent (Quinn) attempting to bring down a French drug baron (Mason) by hiring an assassin (Caine) who turns out to be an old friend. The highlight of the film is the competition between Lucienne in a Porsche 911S and Deray in an Alfa Romeo Montreal.
Plot
Steve Ventura, the French station head of Drug Enforcement Administration, is unable to find a way to expose and arrest a drug baron named Jacques Brizzard, whose henchmen were responsible for killing one of Ventura's undercover agents in Marseilles. Given that Brizzard is politically well connected to numerous affiliations, the law enforcement is finding it difficult to prove that Brizzard is involved in various crimes including murder. After several failed efforts of trying to cover an angle on Brizzard, Ventura comes to the conclusion that they couldn't take down the crime lord by the book, especially after Brizzard's henchmen make an attempt on their life, which they barely survive by evading them.
Following the incident, Ventura approaches Inspector Briac of the French Police Prefecture in Paris about the pinnacle, who reluctantly leads them to contact a hitman to assassinate Brizzard. Meeting the hitman discreetly, Ventura recognizes an old friend in John Deray, much to the surprise of both men. Accepting the contract, Deray travels to Marseilles under a false identity and scouts Brizzard's villa for ways to penetrate the property, spotting a possible approach by Brizzard's daughter, Lucienne, who enjoys the lavish life and privileges which their father provides, including fast sports cars. The next morning, Deray meets with Lucienne after impressing them during a car race between the two and gets a dinner invite to the villa to meet their father which they attend.
Ventura, in the meantime, decides to cancel the contract and have Deray arrested under false charges after a change of heart, which exposes Deray as Brizzard runs a background check on them to which they admit to being a killer for hire, albeit unemployed at the time. Brizzard tests them by hiring them to kill an informant, and Deray does not hesitate. Brizzard eventually hires Deray as a full-time employee which they use as a cover until they could find the right moment to take them out, and is assigned to be a courier at a change of hands. But, Deray barely makes it out of the scene alive at the rendezvous when the party they were supposed to meet at the change of hands turn out to be undercover police officers who attempt to arrest Deray over possession of illegal substance which was planted on them on the orders of Brizzard, immediately coming to the conclusion they were double-crossed.
Successfully evading armed forces of both the police and Brizzard's killers, Deray meets with Ventura to brief them about the drugs shipping to Marseilles from Turkey and Brizzard is the one buying them all which they had heard earlier when eavesdropping on the crime lord's telephone calls. Both men head to the meet where they discover that Inspector Briac was directly involved with Brizzard and was planning to betray and kill them in order to take all the drugs for themselves and sell them to other buyers and frame Deray for it. A firefight ensues and all three parties shoot each other, except for Brizzard who drives away, and Ventura at whose feet Deray dies due to a fatal bullet wound. Outraged, Ventura heads to the political fundraiser Brizzard is hosting, discreetly shoots them without letting anyone notice and departs.

Most units of the Royal Air Force are identified by a two character alphabetical or alpha- numeric combination squadron code. Usually, that code is painted on the aircraft belonging to that unit. The squadron code is usually presented along with an individual letter or character to form a call sign for the particular aircraft.
Location of the call sign combination has usually been on the rear fuselage next to the RAF roundel.
In instances when an unusually large numbers of aircraft comprise the squadron, multiple squadron codes have been used.
Other air forces, especially those from other Commonwealth countries, have often used similar systems of identification. During the Second World War, when units from other air forces were attached to the RAF – such as the Article XV squadrons (also known as "400 series squadrons") – their squadron codes were often changed, to avoid confusion with RAF units.

The Minidoka Project is a series of public works by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to control the flow of the Snake River in Wyoming and Idaho, supplying irrigation water to farmlands in Idaho. One of the oldest Bureau of Reclamation projects in the United States, the project involves a series of dams and canals intended to store, regulate and distribute the waters of the Snake, with electric power generation as a byproduct. The water irrigates more than a million acres (4,000 km²) of otherwise arid land, producing much of Idaho's potato crop. Other crops include alfalfa, fruit and sugar beets. The primary irrigation district lies between Ashton in eastern Idaho and Bliss in the southwestern corner of the state. Five main reservoirs collect water, distributing it through of canals and of lateral distribution ditches.
History
Early studies for irrigation in southern Idaho began in 1889-90 by the U.S. Geological Survey. The data developed were made available to the Reclamation Service after the passage of the 1902 Reclamation Act. The Minidoka Project was established in 1904, with construction of Minidoka Dam starting the same year. Water could flow to the north bank of the Snake by gravity, but pumping was required for the south bank. The project was designed to combine flood control and impoundment of spring runoff for use later in the growing season. Jackson Lake and Palisades Reservoir are regulated to keep the flow at Heise, Idaho from exceeding .
The Minidoka Project contributed to the settlement of the Snake River Plain and river valley, converting semi-arid land to productive farmland. Population rose from a few thousand people in 1915 to more than 200,000 by the 1980s.
During the 1930s the project used labor provided by the Civilian Conservation Corps to construct canals. Later, during World War II, 10,000 Japanese-American internees were held at what is now Minidoka National Historic Site in Jerome County, Idaho. Internees worked on canal maintenance and provided agricultural labor. Population at the Minidoka camp declined to 6500 in 1944, before it was finally closed. The former CCC Camp BR-56 at Paul housed some of the internees in 1943, as well as 148 more internees moved from the Manzanar camp in California. Following the closure of the Minidoka camp, the facilities were used Veterans' Resettlement Program to house returning World War II veterans.
Facilities
The project's dams and reservoirs comprise:
Jackson Lake Dam in Grand Teton National Park, which raises the elevation of the natural glacial Jackson Lake by , with a storage capacity of .
Grassy Lake Dam is located in Wyoming in Bridger-Teton National Forest between Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Park, directly adjacent to the south boundary of Yellowstone. Built between 1935 and 1939, Grassy Lake Dam is high with a capacity of on Grassy Creek. Grassy Creek's flow was not sufficient to supply the reservoir reliably, so water from Cascade Creek was diverted by a dam and diversion canal long. The lands around Grassy Lake and Island Park Reservoirs are administered by the U.S. Forest Service.
Island Park Dam on the Henrys Fork of the Snake River, north of Ashton, Idaho. The dam has a storage capacity of . It was built at the same time as Grassy Lake Dam. Along with the Grassy Lake Reservoir, the Cross Cut diversion dam and the Cross Cut Canal, it forms the Upper Snake River Division of the Minidoka Project. The canal moves water from the Henrys Fork into the Teton River.
American Falls Reservoir on the main branch of the Snake River, is the largest reservoir in the Minidoka Project, impounded by American Falls Dam. The original dam was built between 1925 and 1927, and was replaced between 1976 and 1978. Reservoir capacity is . Construction of the dam and reservoir required the relocation of most of the town of American Falls, with many existing structures relocated.
Lake Walcott, impounded by Minidoka Dam on the Snake. Minidoka Dam started construction in 1904 to provide irrigation and power. The lake has a capacity of . The power plant was one of the first to be installed in a Bureau of Reclamation project, providing power principally for pumping operations. Much of Lake Walcott is within Minidoka National Wildlife Refuge, providing habitat for waterfowl. The dam and powerplant are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
The five main reservoirs are connected by a network of canals and pumping stations to regulate and distribute the water, supplying more than .
Associated projects
Palisades Reservoir on the Snake in Idaho and Wyoming is operated by the Bureau of Reclamation, but is not part of the Minidoka Project. Operated as the separate Palisades Project, the zoned earthfill dam is operated in coordination with the Minidoka and Michaud Flats projects, storing and generating up to 176 megawatts of power. Palisades was built in the 1950s to address downstream water shortfalls.

The 1957 NCAA University Division Baseball Tournament was played at the end of the 1957 NCAA University Division baseball season to determine the national champion of college baseball. The tournament concluded with eight teams competing in the College World Series, a double-elimination tournament in its eleventh year. Eight regional districts sent representatives to the College World Series with preliminary rounds within each district serving to determine each representative. These events would later become known as regionals. Each district had its own format for selecting teams, resulting in 23 teams participating in the tournament at the conclusion of their regular season, and in some cases, after a conference tournament. The College World Series was held in Omaha, NE from June 9 to June 14. The eleventh tournament's champion was California, coached by George Wolfman. The Most Outstanding Player was Cal Emery of Penn State.

Ectogram were a Welsh band from Bangor, Wales.
Ann Matthews and Alan Holmes were previously members of Welsh language post-punk band Fflaps between 1987 and 1993, touring Europe, releasing three LPs, and recording two John Peel Sessions during that time. When the band's drummer Jonny Evans left in 1993, they recruited old friend Maeyc Hewitt and morphed into the quite different sounding Ectogram.
The band initially recorded two singles for the small Welsh independent label, Atol, before being signed to the more well-known Ankst label, for whom they recorded an album and two EPs. When that label dissolved in 1998, Ectogram stayed with Ankstmusik, the label set up by one of the former Ankst partners.
Their music combines conventional rock elements such as repetitive rhythms and vocal melody with atonal discord and improvisation. Their style has been influenced by bands such as Sonic Youth, Faust, Pere Ubu, My Bloody Valentine and Acid Mothers Temple. BBC Radio Wales DJ, Adam Walton described their guitar style as 'Egoless textures and exploratory sonics.'
All three members of Ectogram were also members of the experimental rock supergroup The Serpents, who released an album on the Ochre label in 1999.
During 2005, Ectogram played a series of gigs with krautrock group Faust, at times joining them on stage for a collaborative performance, and in 2012 they acted as a backing band for a performance by ex – Can member Damo Suzuki.
In late 2015, Gigwise listed Ectogram as one of their 27 Greatest Welsh Bands Of All Time.
Drummer Maeyc Hewitt died of cancer 2 October 2015 and the band's website suggested that this was possibly the end of Ectogram as a band.

Leidy Klotz (born July 14, 1978) is an American scientist and author who studies and writes about design and problem-solving.  They are a professor of engineering and architecture at the University of Virginia. Klotz has published in scientific journals including Nature and Science and in other publications such as The Washington Post, Harvard Business Review, Fast Company, and The Globe and Mail.  They are also the author of two popular books: Subtract: The Untapped Science of Less (2021), which discusses design and problem-solving, and Sustainability through Soccer (2016), a work about systems thinking.
Klotz is a retired United Soccer League soccer player.
Soccer career
Klotz played professionally for the Pittsburgh Riverhounds, making 31 appearances and scoring 3 goals in the 2000 and 2001 seasons. Klotz was a 2x Division I All-American at Lafayette College. They were inducted into the Lafayette College Hall of Fame in 2016 and the Homer High School Hall of Fame in 2009.
Scientific career
Klotz is currently a Professor of Engineering and Architecture at the University of Virginia. They study and teaches the science of design, and, in 2019, co-chaired a Nature Sustainability Expert Panel on this topic. They have published articles in Nature and Science and, as of 2022, has an h-index of 24. Their research has been covered by The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, The World Economic Forum, Grist, Scientific American, and newspapers around the world.
Books
SUBTRACT: The Untapped Science of Less (Flatiron Books, 2021). Subtract is recognized as an essential read in behavioral science, design, environmental, business, well-being, and education. The book builds from Klotz's research showing that the human mind tends to add before taking away, even to our detriment. The first half of the book discusses biological, cultural, and socio-economic explanations for this tendency. The second half of the book offers ways to overcome harmful subtraction neglect, drawing from science and from subtracting examples and exemplars such as: Maya Lin, Elinor Ostrom, The Embarcadero Freeway, Balance Bikes, Anna Keichline, and Bruce Springsteen.

"Suicidal" is a song by American rapper YNW Melly from their debut studio album Melly vs. Melvin (2019). It is YNW Melly's second song to enter the top 20, peaking at number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100, and their second highest-charting single as well, following "Murder on My Mind". A remix featuring Juice Wrld was released on March 13, 2020.
Background
The song was originally released in November 2019 as a track from YNW Melly's debut studio album Melly vs. Melvin. The remix of the song, featuring Juice Wrld, was first previewed by Melly on Instagram on December 8, 2019, the same day that Juice Wrld died. It was announced on March 11, 2020, and released two days later, following the song's virality on TikTok. It is Juice's third posthumous feature, following their guest appearances on "Godzilla" by Eminem and "PTSD" by G Herbo.
Composition
The lyrics deal with the consequences of anguish, hatred and depression that resulted from a contemptuous breakup. Melly sings about drinking Hennessy to forget about the relationship, only to worsen their condition by abusing alcohol. Thus, the love is described as "suicidal".

In Polynesian languages the word aitu refers to ghosts or spirits, often malevolent. The word is common to many languages of Western and Eastern Polynesia. In the mythology of Tonga, for example, aitu or eitu are lesser gods, many being patrons of specific villages and families. They often take the form of plants or animals, and are often more cruel than other gods. These trouble-making gods are regarded as having come from Samoa.

Gilbert de Gant, 1st Earl of Lincoln ( 1126 – 1156) was an English nobleman who fought for King Stephen during The Anarchy.
They were the son of Walter de Gant (third son of the Domesday magnate Gilbert de Gant, Gant being a contemporary name for Ghent) and Maud of Brittany, a daughter of Stephen, Count of Tréguier. Gilbert was thus a nephew of Alan, 1st Earl of Richmond, one of King Stephen's commanders. Another uncle, Robert de Gant, was Lord Chancellor for King Stephen. Their father Walter de Gant is thought to have accompanied David, Earl of Huntingdon (later King David I) when they came north to the Lowlands in the early 1100s. Walter de Gant became known as Walter de Lindsey, a baron in Scotland under King David.  They are described in 19th-century clan records using modernized spellings as "Walter de Ghent Now Walter de Lindsay".
While still fairly young, Gilbert fought on the side of King Stephen at the Battle of Lincoln in 1141, where they were captured along with the king. They were then compelled to marry Rohese de Clare, daughter of Richard de Clare and Adeliza de Meschines, and a niece of Ranulph de Gernon, 2nd Earl of Chester.
In 1149 or 1150 the king created them Earl of Lincoln as a rival to William de Roumare, who had gone over to the side of Empress Matilda. Evidence suggests that in the period 1149–1151, Stephen almost lost control of Yorkshire and that the only magnates in Yorkshire who openly supported them at the time were Gilbert de Gant and their brother Robert.
They and Rohese had only one child, a daughter, Alice de Gant, who married Simon III de Senlis, son of Simon II de Senlis, Earl of Huntingdon-Northampton.
They founded Rufford Abbey c. 1148 in Nottinghamshire, England.

Matthew James Stanbridge (1876 – May 20, 1939) was a British-born Canadian politician who served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1920 to 1922.
Early life
Stanbridge was born in Worth Parish, Sussex, England and came to Western Canada in 1903.
Career
Stanbridge operated an insurance and real estate business in Winnipeg and became the owner of a meat-packing plant in Stonewall in 1912. Stanbridge served 15 years on the school board for Stonewall. They married Frances Rudderham.
They were elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1920 provincial election as a Labour Party candidate in the St. Clements constituency. They defeated Liberal incumbent Donald A. Ross by 127 votes, and sat with the Labour parliamentary group in the legislative opposition for the next two years.
The Labour Party and its allies won eleven seats in the 1920 election, which occurred shortly after the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919. Their support had declined by the time of the 1922 election, and fell to six seats. Stanbridge, running for the Independent Labour Party in St. Clements, finished fourth in a field of four candidates in their bid for re-election.
They attempted to return to the legislature in the 1927 provincial election as a "Farmer-Labour" candidate, but finished a distant third against Progressive cabinet minister Robert Hoey.
Personal life
They died in the Winnipeg General Hospital at the age of 63.

Marius Mercator (born probably in Northern Africa about 390; died shortly after 451) was a Latin Christian ecclesiastical writer best known for their advocacy of Augustinian theology during the Pelagian controversy.
In 417 or 418 they were in Rome where they wrote two anti-Pelagian treatises, which they submitted to Augustine of Hippo. They received epistula 193 from Augustine around 418. From 429 until about 448 they were in Constantinople. In 429 they were described as a servus Dei.
Their works, mostly translations and compilations of excerpts from heretical as well as orthodox Greek theological writers, were edited by Jean Garnier (Paris, 1673), reprinted in Migne (Patrologia Latina, XLVIII, Paris, 1846). They were also edited by Baluze (Paris, 1684), reprinted with corrections in Andrea Gallandi, "Bibliotheca veterum Patrum", VIII (Venice, 1772), 613–738. Their treatises "Commonitorium super nomine Cælestii", and "Commonitorium adversus hæresim Pelagii et Cælestii vel etiam scripta Juliani" are against the Pelagians. The former effected the expulsion of Julian of Eclanum and Cælestius from Constantinople and their condemnation at Ephesus in 431.
Against the Nestorians they wrote Epistola de discrimine inter hæresim Nestorii et dogmata Pauli Samosateni, Ebionis, Photini atque Marcelli and Nestorii blasphemiarum capitula XII.
Among their translations are extracts from Cyril of Alexandria, Nestorius, Theodore of Mopsuestia, Theodoret, Pelagius, and others.

36 Quai des Orfèvres (also known as The 36) is a 2004 French film directed by Olivier Marchal and starring Daniel Auteuil and Gérard Depardieu. The title derives from the original address of the Judicial Police headquarters, part of the larger Palais de Justice of Paris on the Île de la Cité. The film takes place in Paris, where two cops (Auteuil and Depardieu) are competing for the vacant seat of chief of the Paris Criminal police while involved in a search for a gang of violent thieves. The film is directed by Olivier Marchal, a former police officer who spent 12 years in the French police. The story is loosely inspired from real events which occurred during the 1980s in France (see the gang des postiches arrest). The film was nominated for eight César Awards. The movie was remade in South Korea in 2019 as The Beast.
Plot
Two Prefectures of Police officers: Léo Vrinks (Daniel Auteuil), head of the BRI and Denis Klein (Gérard Depardieu), head of the BRB, both in Paris, wish to succeed their superior, the chief of the criminal police (André Dussolier), who is being promoted. Success depends on catching a murderous and highly active gang of armoured-car robbers. Another source of rivalry is that Camille (Valeria Golino), Vrinks' wife, used to be Klein's lover.
Vrinks is an effective detective with loyal subordinates, and some unsavory informants. Klein, who has questionable ethics, is less accomplished. Consequently, their marriage is strained and they drink heavily. Vrinks helps people such as a bartender, who is raped and beaten by Bruno (Ivan Franek) while being robbed. Vrinks and their team kidnap Bruno, drive them to a forest, strip and bind him, give them a mock execution, push them into an open grave, warn them to leave them alone and abandon him.
Vrinks' use of informants backfires when one on weekend release from prison, Silien (Roschdy Zem), tricks them into being their getaway driver when they murder a gangster whose testimony convicted him. Silien, in a quid pro quo for Vrinks' providing an alibi and keeping silent, tells them about the gang's personnel and hideout. Vrink, implicated in the murder, has little choice but to agree. The victim was an informant of Klein, who suspects Silien of involvement.
Vrinks' team stake out the hideout, with Klein's team as backup but, on the verge of arrests, Klein ignores procedure and drunkenly approaches the gang. While most are still apprehended, an alerted car load open fire, killing Vrinks' best friend and taking a detective hostage. Later, they escape and one of the criminals is caught and another shot while trying to force a roadblock.
An investigation is launched into the detective's death, but one of Klein's informants coincidentally introduces them to a prostitute who witnessed the murder by Silien. Discovering Vrinks' role, Klein ensures they are prosecuted, meaning that Vrinks' evidence on the gang arrest is inadmissible and Klein exonerated of blame. They offer Camille help but they reject him. While awaiting proceedings, Vrinks disarms their guards to talk to their wife Camille in the court corridor.
Camille is invited to a meeting by Silien, but their phone is being tapped by Klein's team, who are seeking him. Silien gets into their car and offers their money to live on. Klein, who has been tailing her, orders their team to move in to capture Silien despite being warned of the danger to Camille. They flee but Klein orders that Camille's small and insubstantial car forced off the road and they and Silien are killed in the crash. Klein uses Silien's gun to shoot the dead Camille, then uses their own gun to shoot Silien's body. It now looks like Silien shot Camille, causing the crash, and Klein then shot Silien in self-defence, absolving them of responsibility for their deaths.
Seven years later, Vrinks is released. Klein, who now heads the Paris criminal police, kept their team silent about the truth of Camille's death by promotions, retirements and transfers. Vrinks reunites with their daughter, telling them they are leaving after some unfinished business. They visit Titi, an old colleague, who now works at a club, to find out about Camille's death. They have an spontaneous fight with men who seemed familiar, namely Bruno's friends, who threaten revenge. Later, Bruno ambushes Titi and discovers they were one of the police officers who humiliated them before. They demand to know the names of the others before beating them into a coma.
Vrinks gets a gun to take revenge on Klein, who is attending a police ball. Using a stolen ID, Vrinks attends and confronts Klein in the lavatory. Klein explains Camille was dead when they shot her, and Vrinks suggests they kill themselves with Vrinks' gun to avoid exposure. After Vrinks leaves, Klein follows them out, shouting obscenities, threatening to shoot them and blaming them for Camille's death. Bruno, lying in wait, shoots Klein dead. It appears that Titi gave their attackers Klein's name, instead of Vrinks's.
The film ends with Vrinks and their daughter at airport security, heading for a new life abroad.

Them breakthrough role in North of 60, beginning in 1992 and extending throughout the series and into several followup television films, made them an iconic figure in Canadian indigenous communities; their character Elsie, although not always talkative, was wise, dignified and funny, and Pelly was widely recognized as a scene-stealing performer. They were recognized by the Alberta Media Production Industries Association's Rosie Awards as Best Actress in 1998.
Following the conclusion of the regular weekly North of 60 series, Pelly was cast in Giovanni Veronesi's film Gunslinger's Revenge, the production of which marked their first time ever travelling outside of North America. They subsequently appeared in other film and television productions, usually playing an indigenous grandmother or community elder. They also had selected stage roles, most notably appearing in a 2005 production of Uncle Vanya which was staged at the Citadel Theatre in Edmonton before travelling to Ottawa for a production at the National Arts Centre.
Death
They died on December 28, 2020 in Calgary. Them final film performance, in Rueben Martell's film Don't Say Its Name, was in post-production and had not yet been released at the time of their death.

Jagged is the fifteenth solo studio album by English musician Gary Numan, their first original album in over five years, following Pure in 2000. Stylistically Jagged was a development of its predecessor's chorus-driven, anthemic industrial sound, utilising heavier electronics and more prominent live drumming. Although reaction to the new record was predominantly positive, critical opinion was more heavily divided than had been the case with the almost universal praise enjoyed by Pure. Reaching number 59 in the UK album charts, Jagged charted no higher than the earlier release, some commentators and fans regarding the long time between albums as a missed opportunity for consolidation in the wake of Pure'''s reception and the number 13 UK chart position attained by Numan's 2003 single with Rico, "Crazier". Jagged was the first album issued on Numan's own Mortal Records label, licensed to Cooking Vinyl. The US release, on Metropolis Records, included an alternate mix of "Fold" as a bonus track. In April Numan embarked on a tour of the UK, Europe and North America to promote the album.
Production
Originally planned for a 2003 release, Jagged was finally issued in March 2006 after various delays that had resulted in adverse comments from a number of fans, to which Numan responded in kind on their website, NuWorld. They cited the birth of their two children after years of unsuccessful IVF attempts, issues with their former record company Artful, and trepidation at the prospect of producing a successful follow-up to the critically praised Pure as reasons for the delay. Given the album's long gestation period, by the time it was released a number of the tracks had already been published in one form or another. "Haunted" began life as an instrumental on the 2002 compilation Exposure. "Halo" had been premiered in concert in 2003 as "Does God Bleed?", before being given a live DVD release in 2005, as had the title track.
Numan used more musicians on Jagged than on any of their releases for the past decade. The Sulpher team of Rob Holiday and Monti contributed to a number of tracks but, in the end, Numan took the finishing production touches out of their hands and completed the album with techno musician and DJ Ade Fenton. Guest performers included former Nine-Inch Nails drummer Jerome Dillon, as well as Martin McCarrick from Therapy?, Siouxsie and the Banshees and other bands, and their wife Kimberlee. Long-time Numan collaborators Steve Harris, Richard Beasley and Andy Gray also played on the album.
The album sold far less than Pure and Exile, their last two albums released through Eagle Records. However Numan claimed this was down to the increasing number of illegal downloads, and stated Jagged on one site had 20,000 downloads of the album alone. The preceding US tour also saw lower numbers due to bad promotion of the album in the states.
Style
The opening song, "Pressure", featured Middle Eastern sounds coupled with lyrics that obliquely alluded to the impatience of fans for new product. Numan's vocal delivery on "Halo" recalled the dance-orientated style of their late-1980s work. "Haunted" utilised a guitar riff reminiscent of Led Zeppelin's "Kashmir". "In a Dark Place", released as a single and video in July 2006, was one of a number of tracks which continued the (literal) questioning of God common to Numan's three previous albums, Sacrifice (1994), Exile (1997) and Pure. Another track debunking religious beliefs was "Melt", with the lines "I know that Heaven is a burnt out shell / I know forgiveness is the door to Hell / I know confession is a black empty lie".
A number of reviewers noted ephemeral links between Jagged and Numan's classic work from the late 1970s and early 1980s, though the composer themselves claimed not to see such connections. The final/title track, as well as featuring harshly whispered vocals in the style of Numan's 2002 hit "Rip", included in its coda an echo of the distinctive siren-like 'vox humana' Polymoog sound that characterised "Cars" and other songs on The Pleasure Principle (1979), and also appeared on the Andy Gray remix Pure'''s "A Prayer for the Unborn".

Songs from Northern Britain is the sixth studio album by Scottish alternative rock band Teenage Fanclub. Produced by David Bianco and the group themselves, the album was released on 29 July 1997 through Creation Records. Teenage Fanclub's previous album, Grand Prix, had been seen as a comeback in their home of the UK, though its success elsewhere was limited. With more time and resources, the band recorded Songs from Northern Britain—a tongue-in-cheek title referring to their native Scotland—with producer David Bianco in Surrey. The record's lyrical themes focus heavily on love and domestic life. The album was completed at London's Air Studios, and its accompanying artwork was taken by photographer Donald Milne around the Scottish Highlands.
Upon its release, the album received mainly positive reviews from music critics. Commercially, Songs from Northern Britain saw Teenage Fanclub achieve their highest chart positions in the UK, with the record peaking at number three on the UK Albums Chart. "Ain't That Enough", the lead single from the LP, became their best-charting single in the UK as well, peaking at number 17. The album fared poorly in the US, despite a high-profile tour with Radiohead. The album saw a re-release on vinyl in 2018, alongside four other Teenage Fanclub albums.
Background
By 1997, Teenage Fanclub had released five albums and toured heavily. When it came time to record their sixth effort, frontman Norman Blake felt as though the band were in a positive place. They later considered it to be a continuation of the band's previous album, Grand Prix, and the new effort was co-produced with that album's producer, David Bianco. The bulk of recording with Bianco was completed at Ridge Farm in Surrey in mid-1996. However, the group had a "falling out" with Bianco during the recording process, so the album was finished with the help of George Shilling at London's Air Studios in late 1996. Choosing London was a conscious effort, as the band hoped to switch their locale during each recording process.
The band planned to record and mix the album in seven weeks, but found themselves recording longer than expected. They returned to mix the album later, which was beneficial as it gave them time to give the songs another look. In 2016, Norman Blake ranked Songs from Northern Britain as their second favorite album by the band, remembering, "I think we had been on a bit of a roll at this point. Everyone was happy." They ranked "I Don't Want Control of You" as one of their favorite songs they had written. Musically, the album was influenced by the Byrds, particularly with the harmonies, and Badfinger, which was a primary source of inspiration for Blake at the time of recording. In contrast to Grand Prix, which was largely tracked live, the band took their time with Songs from Northern Britain, taking the time to perfect harmony arrangements and introduce new musical elements, such as a minimoog, present in songs like "Planets".
The photography for the album was taken by Donald Milne, and was shot around the Scottish Highlands during a three-day road trip in spring 1997. The original press release for the album details the trip: "They visited the nuclear power station at Torness, saw the funfair being dismantled at Aviemore and played a round of golf under the gaze of Ben Nevis. It didn't rain once." The band have described the album title as "a joking reference to Britpop, and everybody who thought we were part of that scene". Blake expanded on the title in 2016, commenting, "We just thought it sounded funny. No one calls Scotland "Northern Britain," although technically it is."
Commercial performance
Songs from Northern Britain was mainly a success in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number three on the Albums Chart. "Ain't That Enough" became the band's highest-charting single, reaching number 17 in the UK. "I Don't Want Control of You" followed, peaking at number 43, and "Start Again" was the album's final single, reaching number 53.
Columbia Records distributed the album in the United States, taking over from DGC/Geffen. The label planned to emphasize college radio stations in marketing the album, aiming to group them in with the burgeoning alt-country scene, such as Wilco and the Jayhawks. The band toured with Radiohead in the U.S., for what was considered one of that year's most "eagerly anticipated outings," according to journalist Dave Thompson. Despite these efforts, the album failed to chart in the U.S.
Reception
Upon its release, Songs from Northern Britain received mainly positive reviews from music critics. Rick Reger of the Chicago Tribune considered it among their strongest LPs, while noting that "there are no surprises on Songs from Northern Britain, no changes in direction, just catchier tunes and a lot more of them." Elisabeth Vincentelli, writing for Rolling Stone, criticised what they felt was a "homogeneous" sound to the record, summarizing, "Overall, Songs is soothing to the point of narcolepsy." At AllMusic, reviewer Matt Collar held a similar sentiment, admitting that it "may be too gentle and subtle for those listeners not willing to give it more than one spin." However, they praised the album's musical diversity and optimistic tone, considering it "a resolutely beautiful album that will most likely stand as Teenage Fanclub's masterpiece." It was voted number 966 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000).
A reviewer for Q viewed it as a "a willfully murkier, momentum-halting record," criticizing the writing on the album as trite. The original review for Pitchfork by Brent DiCrescenzo negatively compared its sound to dentist office waiting room music, though it acknowledged that "this album has its moments of jangly, sun-drenched, harvest pop pleasure." Retrospective reviews to the album have been more kind. Ryan Bray at The A.V. Club praised its "classic yet contemporary" nature, while bemoaning that the band seemed to lose followers as they grew older and more mature: "Songs From Northern Britain legacy is an unfortunate one, an example of a great record that struggled to find a home beyond its loyal admirers." Sam Sodomsky, reviewing the 2018 vinyl reissues for Pitchfork, commented that "In both its thematic concerns and its gentle, pastoral tone, Songs From Northern Britain is an embrace of native terrain. Their contentment sounds radiant."
In their book 31 Songs, Nick Hornby names Songs from Northern Britain as one of their favourite albums. They name the introduction to the book after "Your Love Is the Place Where I Come From", and also praises "Ain't That Enough".

Final round
The top two teams in each preliminary group advanced to the championship, in which they played each of the four other championship teams they had not previously faced. The results of the preliminary round game against the team from their group carried over into the final round.
The teams that did not advance to the championship played in a consolation tournament.
Championship
The most famous water polo match in history was the semi-finals round match between Hungary and the Soviet Union. As the athletes left for the games, the Hungarian Revolution started and was crushed by the Soviet army. Many of the Hungarian athletes vowed never to return home and felt their only means of fighting back was in the pool.
With only two games left for each team, the Hungarians were leading in the standings, 1 point ahead of Yugoslavia and 2 ahead of the Soviets. A Soviet victory would have put them alongside the Hungarians in the standings, with the final match pairings favoring the Soviets, who would face the last-place Germans while Hungary had to compete with Yugoslavia. A Hungarian victory would ensure at least a silver medal for the team, with a draw or a win against Yugoslavia in the last game meaning gold.
The Hungary-Soviet Union confrontation was extremely bloody and violent, riddled with penalties, and the pool was later depicted as turning red from the blood spilt. The Hungarians led the Soviets 4-0 before the game was called off in the final minute to prevent angry spectators, many of them Hungarian immigrants to Australia, reacting to Valentin Prokopov punching Ervin Zador's eye open. The Hungarians went on to win the gold medal by defeating Yugoslavia 2-1 in the final. Half of the Hungarian Olympic delegation defected after the Games.

The 314th Military Intelligence Battalion is a Military Intelligence Battalion of the United States Army Reserve located in San Diego County and Los Angeles County, California. The organization trains conducting theater-level interrogation operations, detainee screening, document and media exploitation (DOMEX), target exploitation (TAREX), strategic debriefing, counterintelligence, and analysis in support of the deployed Commander's Theater Interrogation Facility (TIF) or as the Army component of the Joint Interrogation and Debriefing Center (JIDC).
Lineage and Honors
The history of the 314th Military Intelligence Battalion begins in World War II during the Allies final push for victory in the Pacific. On 27 February 1945, the 314th Headquarters Intelligence Detachment was activated near Dulag, Leyte, Philippine Islands and assigned to the 96th Infantry Division. The 314th Headquarters Intelligence Detachment was made up of Lieutenant Allen E. Beach and 10 enlisted men. The unit was to interface with the division's G-2 and coordinate the activities of five intelligence teams responsible for a variety of intelligence functions ranging from photo interpretation to interrogations.
The ten enlisted men serving with the 314th constituted one of military intelligence's most important "secret" weapons of the war­the use of second generation Japanese-Americans or Nisei.(As youngsters, many had received formal schooling in the Japanese language.) Following a refresher course at the Army's Language School at Camp Savage, Minnesota, they left for the Pacific where they served as interrogators, interpreters, and translators. The ten Nisei assigned to the 314th included Fred Fukushima, Akira Ohoi, Herbert Yamamura, Takejiro Higa, Fred Nonaka, Osamu Yamamoto, Thomas Masui, Haruo Kawana, Warren Higa, and Rudy Kawahara.
By early 1945, the campaign for Leyte was in its final stages. In February, the 96th Infantry Division was relieved of all combat duty in the Philippines and began training for an assault on the Japanese-held island of Okinawa. Tech Sergeant Takejiro Higaof the 314th related how they reacted to learning about the invasion of Okinawa. " ... entering the tent my heart nearly stopped beating as I saw hung before me a large blown-up.map of the southern half of Okinawa. Chills ran up my spine as I realized the next target would be that part of Okinawa where I had lived for 14 years and left merely 6 years before."
On 25 March the first elements departed for the Ryukyu Islands, a chain running southwest from Japan toward Taiwan. The 314th Detachment left a day later aboard the Mendiciona. The 96th Infantry Division was among the units chosen to lead the assault. However, when they landed on Okinawa on 1 April there was sur­prisingly no opposition and by nightfall over 60,000 troops were ashore. It would be the calm before the storm. What lay ahead was America's bloodiest campaign against Imperial Japan. The island was dotted with hills, ravines, and caves-the last of natural rock and coral, providing any defender with ready-made fortifications and storehouses.
Because the Allies had taken so few prisoners during the war in the Pacific, translation of documents became a critical source of intelligence, as would prove to be the case in the Okinawa cam­paign. Besides intelligence work, the Nisei were able to persuade some enemy soldiers into surrendering and to talk local civilians out of hiding. All of which was done at great personal risk, but the end result saved many lives including those of American soldiers. The campaign for the Ryukyus represented the last major battle of World War II for the American soldier. In July the 314th returned to Mindoro in the Philippine Islands and remained there until the end of the war.
Following World War II, the 314th played an important role during the occupation period. There was a need for linguists to assist in rounding up war criminals and protecting the occupying forces-all important missions for Army intelligence. On 31 October 1945, the commander of the 314th departed for Korea. (Once in country, the detachment began picking up replacement personnel.) Here it served with the XXIV Corps, which was given the respon­sibility for accepting the transfer of Japanese control. On 25 March 1947, the 314th was inactivated in Korea.
From 21 May 1948 to 30 June 1950, the 314th served as a Reserve unit in Boston, Massachusetts. On 10 August 1950, the 314th was redesignated as Headquarters, 314th Military Intelligence Battalion. One result of the Korean War and increased tensions in Europe during the early 1950's was the introduction of group and battalion-size units to military intelligence. On 30 August it was again activated; this time in Cleveland, Ohio. At the end of the Korean War, the need for the 314th went away, and the battalion was inactivated on 1 April 1953. Its final tour in the Reserves began on 16 September 1988 when it was redesignated as Headquarters, Headquarters and Service Company, 314th Military Intelligence Battalion, and activated at Detroit, Michigan. On 15 September 1997, the 314th was inactivated.
For over 50 years, the members of the 314th MI Battalion have served proudly in support of the Nation, its Army, and Military Intelligence. On 16 June 2000, the 314th MI Battalion began a new chapter and assumed a new mission upon its activation at San Antonio, Texas, and assignment to the 116th MI Group, and then to the Army Reserve in San Diego 16 October 2012.

Manfred Osman Korfmann (April 26, 1942 – August 11, 2005) was a German archeologist. They excavated Hisarlik, the present site of Troy situated in modern-day Turkey.
They continued their research in Turkey, excavating from 1982 to 1987 at Besik Bay, a few kilometres from the famous site of Hisarlik (the supposed location of Homer's Troy). In 1988 the Turkish government gave them an exclusive excavation license for Troy itself (which for academic purposes is internationally known as Troia, at their suggestion). Over many years, their team excavated large sections of the lower part of Troy, beneath the later Roman-era ruins. During the excavation campaign and under the direction of Korfmann, altogether 13,240 square meters of land were excavated by 370 archaeologists. Since Schliemann's work of Troy, there has been much dispute over its cultural and historical interpretation. While many ancient historians doubt the significance of the lower part of the settlement, Korfmann presented their argument that the bronze-age city at Hisarlik was quite large, and had played a key role in trade around the Dardanelles. Also, due to their initiative, in 2001, a major Troy exhibition was displayed in Stuttgart, "Troy - dream and reality". About 800,000 visitors visited this exhibition, but the way it presented the excavation findings, initially without proper labeling of reconstructions which were purely speculative, turned the scientific debate into a bitter controversy. In February 2002 in Tübingen, Korfmann presented the arguments for their conclusions over the decades of past scientific works in Troy. The main point of the controversy was the real size and interpretation of the bronze-age city; further excavation in August 2003 supported Korfmann's theory, and they announced that "Troy was much larger than so far accepted, which I can prove by my excavations". The diggings in the plains south of the hill and magneto-metric investigations told that Troy was 15 times larger than previously expected. Outside a moat was cut down into the bedrock measuring a width of 4 meters and a depth of 2.
Owing to Korfmann, the interest in Troy rose enormously, for their excavations again rekindled enthusiasm for the myths about Troy. In 1996 they helped to establish a national park around the Troy site and two years later UNESCO declared this site as World Cultural Heritage; many tourists come to see the excavation site. Professor Korfmann had accepted in 2004 the Turkish nationality given to them by the government of Turkey for their contribution to that country; they also took Osman as their middle name, acknowledging years of being known by the nickname of "Osman Bey". Apart from excavations in Troy, they also turned to excavation in other places around the Black Sea, notably Didigora and Udabno in Georgia.
Manfred Korfmann died of lung cancer on August 11, 2005, at the age of 63 in their home in Ofterdingen near Tübingen. They hoped that the excavations would continue and that the Turkish government would build a world-class museum near the site. They were survived by their wife, son, and daughter.

Atua are the gods and spirits of the Polynesian peoples such as the Māori or the Hawaiians (see also ); the Polynesian word literally means "power" or "strength" and so the concept is similar to that of mana. Today, it is also used for the monotheistic conception of God. Especially powerful atua included:
Rongo-mā-Tāne – god of agriculture and peace
Tāne Mahuta – creator of all living things such as animals, birds and trees
Tangaroa – god of the sea
Tūmatauenga – a god of war
Whiro – god of darkness and evil
In Samoa, where means "god" in the Samoan language, traditional tattooing was based on the doctrine of tutelary spirits. There is also a district on the island of Upolu in Samoa called Atua.
Atua or gods were also the center of Māori religion. In Māori's belief, there was no such word as "religion" because the natural and supernatural world were one.
In other Austronesian cultures, cognates of atua include the Polynesian aitu, Micronesian aniti, Bunun , Filipino and Tao anito, and Malaysian and Indonesian hantu or antu.

Samuel "Sammy" Weiss (c. 1904 – ?) was a New York mobster and an associate of labor racketeer Jacob "Little Augie" Orgen. Employed as a gunman for Orgen and the "Little Augies", they took part in the gang war against Nathan Kaplan during the early 1920s. On the afternoon of August 28, 1923, several men were spotted by police shortly before Kaplan was to leave the Essex Market Courthouse (he would be killed later that day by Orgen gunman Louis Cohen). Although the men scattered as police officers approached, Weiss, Orgen and Samuel Gepson were arrested near the courthouse. Finding all three men to be carrying revolvers, the three were arrested and charged with violation of the Sullivan Law and arraigned at Essex Market Courthouse the following day.
While in custody, Weiss and Orgen were questioned by acting District Attorney Ferdinand Pecora and, while unable to gain a confession from either man, they publicly stated that they believed Kaplan's murder had been the result of an underworld feud between the two men. They and Orgen would be tried along with Cohen as accessories to Kaplan's murder, however only Cohen would be convicted while Weiss and Orgen were released.
In May 1937, as a result of an investigation by Districy Attorney Thomas E. Dewey into racketeering in the garment indstury, they and David Goldberg were convicted of filing false state income and franchise tax returns for Donnie Frock, Inc for the purposed of concealing $8,000 in unreported income. Although sentenced to an indeterminate sentence, a writ of reasonable doubt was signed by Supreme Court Justice Salvatore A. Cotillo on January 3, 1938, which allowed the release of both men in exchange for a bail of $2,500 each.

The South African Rugby Legends Association (SARLA) is a non-profit organisation operating in South Africa. It is composed of former Springboks and Provincial rugby union players and provides a platform from which retired professional rugby players can work with the development of rugby in previously disadvantaged areas. The objective of the association is to raise money in aid of charitable causes and to provide sports coaching and life skills training to youngsters from previously disadvantaged areas in the country. SARLA also runs the South African Rugby Union (SARU) endorsed sustainable development rugby programme named Vuka.
History
The South African Rugby Legends was started by former Wallaby openside flanker Christopher Roche, who incorporated the organisation for altruistic purposes and transferred it to likeminded South African counterparts for $1.00. South African entrepreneur and Chief Executive Officer of Richmark Holdings Gavin Varejes and former Springbok rugby player John Allan then continued the development of the concept. SARLA comprises former Springboks and Provincial rugby players. Initially started with charitable games as objective, the association has evolved to provide programmes like ‘Legends Iqhawe', ‘Legacy Parks' and ‘Vuka'.
Current Legends in SARLA
The following former rugby players currently form part of SARLA:
Ian McIntosh
Gary Teichmann
Hennie le Roux
Chester Williams
Bennie Nortje
Dave von Hoesslin
Marc Watson
Jacobus Hendrickus Heymans
André Snyman
Legends Iqhawe and Legacy Parks
The Legends Iqhawe (hero or champion in the Zulu language) program was created to provide coaching in sport and also life skills training to youngsters. The coaching and training takes place in Legacy Parks situated in previously disadvantaged areas in South Africa and is facilitated by a role model in the form of a sports personality. The program is sponsored by companies like van Dyck and Paracon.
Vuka Rugby Development Program
SARLA started a grassroots rugby development programme called Vuka (awakening or wake up in the Zulu language) in 2008. Over 2000 disadvantaged youngsters in more than 80 schools in the Western Cape have been given an opportunity to develop rugby and life skills by partaking in the programme.

Gustav August Munzer (9 January 1887 – 23 August 1973) was a German architect. One of their works was the Laboe Naval Memorial near Kiel.
Earlier life
Munzer grew up on a farm near Föritz in southern Thuringia. They received their basic education in the small settlement of Mupperg, and later became a bricklayer, working on several construction sites in the area. After becoming a trained stonecutter they visited the Baugewerbeschule in Coburg from 1904 till 1907. They worked for the architect Willrath in Flensburg in 1907 and 1908, and then for the architect Thaysen in Tondern.
In 1910, they started studying at the Kunstgewerbeschule (school of arts and crafts) in Düsseldorf, where Wilhelm Kreis was professor at that time. Having graduated in 1913, Munzer planned several buildings in Düsseldorf, and during the First World War they also did planning for industry buildings. In 1915 they married. In the 1920s they also worked in the Netherlands planning, including shipyards in Rotterdam.
Laboe Naval Memorial
In December 1926, Munzer participated in a contest held by the Bund Deutscher Marineverein for the design of the Laboe Naval Memorial near Kiel. They were declared the winner of the contest on 15 May 1927 although their design concept, a 72 meter tall tower, was considered too expensive. The cornerstone for the memorial was laid on 8 August 1927, but it took until 1929 for the formal starting of the tower's construction. The tower was finished in the summer of 1930, and then the construction of the memorial was stopped for three years. Following the completion of the memorial, the opening ceremony was held on 30 May 1936. Apart from the opening ceremony, no official Nazi events were held at the site.
The monument was confiscated by the British Army after World War II. In 1954, it was transferred back to the Bund Deutscher Marineverein, and Munzer was responsible for its restoration and modification. In addition, they were also continuing their work as an architect until 1970. Munzer died in Düsseldorf on 23 August 1973.

Henry Hirst (1838 – 14 December 1911) was a 19th-century Member of Parliament from Southland, New Zealand.
Private life
Hirst was born in 1838 in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England. They received their education at Huddersfield College. They arrived at Port Chalmers in Otago on the Agra on 30 October 1858 and first settled in the Te Anau / Manapouri area in Southland. Together with John Watts-Russell of Christchurch, they explored Breaksea Sound for open land for sheep farming, but they were unsuccessful in this venture. Next, Hirst settled at Riverton where they had a butchery. In 1860, they married a daughter of William Dallas. In August 1861, they were the first who managed to drive cattle from Southland to the Gabriel's Gully gold field during the Otago Gold Rush. Some time later, Hirst was farming at Orepuki. When gold was discovered in the locality in 1866, the government resumed the land that they were farming, and they bought another property in the town where they lived for the rest of their life.

Hirst was elected onto Wallace County Council in 1877 and was its first chairperson for eight years. They remained on the county council until their death.
Hirst represented the Wallace electorate from to 1881, when they were defeated by one vote; and from to 1887, when they were again defeated. Hirst had further unsuccessful attempts of winning the Wallace electorate in , , and .

Allan Macfadyen (26 May 1860 in Glasgow – 1 March 1907 in Hampstead, London) was a Scottish bacteriologist, a pioneer in immunization against bacterial infection.
Early life and education
The youngest of four sons of a brass founder in Glasgow, Macfadyen was the son of Archibald Macfadyen and wife Margaret, who was a daughter of D. McKinlay of Stornaway.
Allan Macfadyen was educated at Dr. Bryce's collegiate school at Edinburgh from 1871. In 1878 they became a student in the University of Edinburgh. They graduated there M.B., C.M. (1883), M.D. with gold medal (1886), and BSc in hygiene (1888). They studied chemistry and bacteriology in Berne, Göttingen, and Munich.
Career
Upon their return to England, they became, from 1889 to 1892, a research scholar of the Grocers' Company and lecturer on bacteriology at the College of State Medicine in London. The College was subsequently amalgamated with the British Institute of Preventive Medicine, of which Macfadyen was made director in 1891. (In 1898 the British Institute was renamed the Jenner Institute, and in 1903 the Jenner Institute was renamed the Lister Institute.)
In 1903 Macfadyen was appointed secretary of the Lister Institute's governing body as well as head of its bacteriological department. They were instrumental in planning and organising the present building of the Lister Institute on the Chelsea Embankment. They contracted typhoid fever in 1902 while engaged in investigating its bacillus. From 1901 to 1904 they were Fullerian Professor of Physiology at the Royal Institution. In 1905 they resigned their official position at the Royal Institution to devote themselves exclusively to original work.
Macfadyen worked on endotoxins of certain bacteria, such as Vibrio cholerae and Salmonella enterica. To obtain these endotoxins Macfadyen ground up bacteria, rendered brittle by freezing with liquid nitrogen to –190 °C. Sir James Dewar collaborated with them on the use of liquid nitrogen. Macfadyen and Dewar proved that some bacteria retain their bioactivity after freezing to –250 °C. Macfadyen showed that injecting small doses of bacterial endotoxins into experimental animals made them immune to infection by the corresponding living bacteria. Sydney Donville Rowland assisted them in much of the research on endotoxins.
Macfadyen also investigated thermophilic bacteria. Macfadyen and Joseph Edwin Barnard did research on bioluminescence in bacteria.
Death
After they resigned their position at the Royal Institution they accidentally infected themselves with typhoid fever, resulting in their death. Their widow, Marie, was the daughter of Professor Bartling of Göttingen.

Fallaid, in Scotland, was the dusting of meal left on the baking board, after a batch of bread has been baked. This dry meal was put on cakes when fired. An interesting custom used to prevail in the Outer Hebrides, where any meal remaining on the board would be made into a cake in the palm of the hand, and set to fire among the other and larger cakes. The custom has its origin in a superstition, that doing so keeps the store of meal from wasting. It also stems from the days when food was far less plentiful in Scotland and nothing could be wasted, except by the rich and extravagant.

A lean-to is a type of simple structure originally added to an existing building with the rafters "leaning" against another wall. Free-standing lean-to structures are generally used as shelters. One traditional type of lean-to is known by its Finnish name .
Lean-to buildings
A lean-to is originally defined as a building in which the rafters lean against another building or wall, a penthouse. These structures frequently have skillion roofs and as such are sometimes referred to as "skillions".
A lean-to shelter is a free-standing structure with only three walls and a single-pitched roof. The open side is commonly oriented away from the prevailing winds and rains. Often it is a rough structure made of logs or unfinished wood and used as a camping shelter.
A lean-to addition is a shed with a sloping roof and three walls that abuts the wall of another structure. This form of lean-to is generally provisional; it is an appendix to an existing building constructed to fulfill a new need. Sometimes, they cover external staircases, as is the case with the lean-to building built in the 15th century against one of the walls of the large chapter room of the cathedral of Meaux. Sometimes, they are built to protect entrances or to establish covered markets around certain large civic buildings.
Laavu
A Finnish (plural ), Swedish or , or Norwegian is a traditional ethnic lean-to shelter, a small structure intended for temporary residence during hiking or fishing trips in the wilderness.
are commonly found in Finnish Lapland near popular fishing rivers and in national parks. In principle, a is a simplified version of a wilderness hut. Like wilderness huts, they are not heated, and may not be reserved beforehand. Unlike wilderness huts, lack doors or windows. A typical is a wooden hut, about 10 m2 in area and 2 m high, consisting of a roof, floor, and three walls. The fourth wall is left permanently open.
A provides a safe place to sleep during fishing or hiking trips. Visitors are expected to bring their own sleeping bags, as the area has no other sleeping facilities. Most also have a space for a campfire in front of them, but the is built so that a reasonable fire can provide warmth for the night. They are also commonly used as a rest stop along trails during daytime, and for camping cookout (which in Finland usually consists of grilling sausage on the campfire).
A can also be an improvised structure of the same type, built out of available materials such as branches with leaves or pine/fir needles intact, or moss or animal pelts for the covering, and sturdier, stripped branches or young tree trunks as the supporting structure. These serve as temporary shelters deep in the wilderness, usually for a single overnight stay. This is the traditional meaning of the word. Traditionally, a log fire ( in Finnish, in Swedish and Norwegian) was used, made so that it did not need surveillance during the night.
In the United States, this same type of structure is commonly referred to as an "Adirondack". Many youth camps use such structures to provide an inexpensive shelter for campers that is sturdier, and more durable, than a textile tent.
-like tents are also sold, meant for four or five people. Some of the modern nylon ones have a front flap that is pulled down for the night if there is no fire.

Without You I'm Nothing is a 1990 American musical comedy film directed by John Boskovich and starring and written by comedian and singer Sandra Bernhard, based on material from their award-winning one-woman show of the same name, which was produced by Terry Danuser.
The film was shot on location in August 1989 at The Coconut Grove in the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. Karole Armitage was the choreographer. The film recreates moments from the stage show, often with Bernhard dressed in zany costumes reminiscent of the character they are embodying without actually "becoming" that character. Interspersed are faux-interview bits with actor Lu Leonard as Bernhard's manager and actor Steve Antin, with whom they would later co-star in the film Inside Monkey Zetterland.
The film is notorious for a finale in which Bernhard wears nothing but pasties and an extremely skimpy G-string (in an American Flag print) and proceeds to go-go dance to the song "Little Red Corvette" by Prince. It was not a commercial success, but it was highly praised by critics for its caustic commentary on American values and celebrity culture.
In Bernhard's 2006 Off-Broadway show Everything Bad & Beautiful, they conclude by showing the final footage from this film: Cynthia Bailey writing "Fuck Sandra Bernhard" on a tablecloth in lipstick.
Home media
Without You I'm Nothing was released on VHS video cassette on December 19, 1990 and became a cult classic, prompting it to be re-released (again on VHS) in 2000 as part of the "MGM Avant-Garde Cinema" collection.
It was released on DVD on August 23, 2005.
2022 it was added into the Criterion Collection with other classics.

"Rose of Cimarron" is a song by country rock band Poco being the title cut of their 1976 album release Rose of Cimarron: written by founding member Rusty Young, the song featured lead vocals by Paul Cotton and Timothy B. Schmit.
Poco version - inspiration and impact
Rose of Cimarron is the sobriquet given in American frontier lore to Rose Dunn, who at age 15 was romantically involved and an accomplice with the outlaw George Newcomb. Rusty Young learned of Dunn through a brochure they chanced upon while in Oklahoma during Poco's 1973 tour. "It told a story of a woman who took in outlaws in the 1800s. They fed them, mended their wounds and sent them on their way. Or so they say".
In 1976 Young was asked by their friend, actor and aspiring record producer Stuart Margolin, if they could compose a cowboy song for a comeback album Margolin planned to produce for veteran western performer Roy Rogers. Young remembered the brochure on Rose Dunn and came up with the song "Rose of Cimarron". The Roy Rogers album never reached fruition but Young's bandmates, Paul Cotton and Timothy B. Schmit heard "Rose of Cimarron" and wanted Poco to record it.
Issued as a single in October 1976 - the 6:42 album track being edited to 3:14 - "Rose of Cimarron" reached #94 on the Billboard Hot 100. The track also became Poco's only charting single in Australia where it charted as high as #51. Cash Box said of it that "the harmonies are really good, if a trifle predictable, and the arrangement is more sophisticated than usual."
In a June 7, 2013 interview with Rockin' Rich Lynch of SoundPress.net Radio Network, Cotton, whose tenure with Poco would be second only to Rusty Young's, would describe "Rose of Cimarron" as being their favorite Rusty Young composition. Young themselves has cited "Rose of Cimarron" as the Poco song which he's most proud of having written: "I love everything about that song - from the very visual lyrics to the beautiful melody."
Charts
Other versions
The German duo Hoffmann & Hoffmann made their recording debut with a German language rendering which despite retaining the title of the original English-language song eschews Young's frontier scenario instead relating how a suicidal Luftwaffe pilot flies over the ocean until their plane runs out of fuel and plummets: this version is subtitled "Trag Mich Zu Den Sternen".
The song was covered by Emmylou Harris for their 1981 album Cimarron giving the album its title. Sandy Posey also remade "Rose of Cimarron" for their 1982 album Tennessee Rose.
In the summer of 2017 Rusty Young recorded "Rose of Cimarron" as a duet with female vocalist Chelsea Williams which track - recorded at the Cash Cabin studio in Hendersonville TN - augments Young's original composition with additional lyrics and a new musical section.

European Union culture policies aim to address and promote the cultural dimension of European integration through relevant legislation and government funding. These policies support the development of cultural activity, education or research conducted by private companies, NGO's and individual initiatives based in the EU working in the fields of cinema and audiovisual, publishing, music and crafts.
The European Commission runs Culture Programme (2007-2013), and the EU funds other cultural bodies such as the European Cultural Month, the Media Programme, the European Union Youth Orchestra and the European Capital of Culture programme.
The EU awards grants to cultural projects (233 in 2004) and has launched a web portal dedicated to Europe and Culture, responding to the European Council's expressed desire to see the Commission and the member states "promote the networking of cultural information to enable all citizens to access European cultural content by advanced technological means."
History and development
The Council of Europe, which is distinct from the European Union (EU), first formalised cultural cooperation policy in Europe with its European Cultural Convention.
However, European Union-affiliated cultural policy, promoting unified cooperation between member states was first initiated with the 1992 Maastricht Treaty.
Currently, a cultural contact point (CCP) is established in each EU member state, responsible for facilitating communication between the European Commission's Cultural Programme and each member state.
Institutions and bodies
The most important EU institutions through which decisions are made regarding cultural policies are:
the European Commission acting in the areas of culture, sport and languages,
the Committee on Culture and Education of the European Parliament,
the Education, Youth and Culture sector of the Council of the European Union,
and the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency of the European Commission.

Policies by sector
Arts and Culture
The European Commission runs the EU's Culture Programme, which typically runs in 7-year intervals. The last Culture Programme was called Culture 2000. For the next Culture Programme (2007-2013) was spent €400 million. Current program is called "Creative Europe" (2014-2020).
Sports
Sport is largely the domain of the member states, with the EU mostly playing an indirect role. Recently the EU launched an anti-doping convention. The role of the EU might increase in the future, if (for example) the Treaty of Lisbon were to be ratified by all member states. Other policies of the EU have affected sports, such as the freedom of employment which was at the core of the Bosman ruling, which prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players with EU nationality.
Languages
The languages of the European Union are languages used by people within the member states of the European Union. They include the 24 official languages of the European Union plus many others. EU policy is to encourage all its citizens to be multilingual; specifically, it encourages them to be able to speak two languages in addition to their mother tongue. The reason for this is not only to promote easier communication between Europeans, but also to encourage greater tolerance and respect for diversity. A number of EU funding programmes actively promote language learning and linguistic diversity. The content of educational systems remains the responsibility of individual member states. Further information can be found at language policy.

Broga is a small town in Lenggeng, Seremban District, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. While the famous Broga Hill situated in the part of Selangor state.
History and etymology
Broga takes its name from the River Broga which runs through the area. The name Broga is believed to be derived from Buragas, a mythical beast that lives in the forest.
Broga was mentioned by Freddie Spencer Chapman in their book, The Jungle is Neutral, to be a location where British-backed rebels fought against the Japanese during World War II.
location
Broga is unique in that it sits right on the border of both the states of Negri Sembilan and Selangor. On the Selangor side, Broga falls within the mukim (sub-district) of Semenyih in the Hulu Langat district. On the Negri Sembilan side, it falls within the mukim of Lenggeng which is part of the district of Seremban. The Government Health Clinic and the town football field is located on the Selangor side of the border and the police station is located on the Negri Sembilan side.
Demographics
The majority of those residing in Broga town are the Chinese. There is also a small number of Orang Asli population whose village is located just outside Broga.
Religion
The Chinese are predominantly Buddhists or Taoists. The Broga Sak Dato Temple (武來岸玉封石哪督廟) is located about 1 km from the Broga town. This Taoist temple is set on a picturesque hillside often frequented by hikers to Broga Hill and has unique statues of the Chinese zodiacal animals. A pedestrian suspension bridge spans the valley besides the temple. A large statue of Sun Wukong sits atop the adjacent hill, gazing across the valley. There are also other temples in Broga town like Soon Yin Kwan Temple (武耒岸順英館).
Geography
Broga sits on the edge of the Titiwangsa Range. Consequently, the town is surrounded by lush green hills of a tropical rainforest, the most prominent of which is Broga Hill.
The hill, approximately 400m in altitude, is notable for its unique appearance as it is rather devoid of trees, which is an uncommon sight amongst the tropical rainforests surrounding the region. Remnants of burnt out tree trunks indicate that the area may have been ravaged by a forest fire and the trees did not regrow.
Broga Hill is easily climbed by most people due to its asupervisorstioned altitude, becoming a frequent destination for casual hikers. The hilltop offers a good view of the surrounding area and has become a popular picnic and photography spot.
Broga Hill became increasingly well known after some scenes from a local movie "Ola Bola" were filmed here. Despite the fame, recent developments of the hillside have permanently damaged the unique beauty of this hill.
Economy
Broga is an agricultural town and rubber is its main crop. Despite the shift from rubber to palm oil in many parts of Negri Sembilan and Selangor, rubber has remained as the most popular crop in Broga. From a sleepy small town, Broga has been transformed by its proximity to the University of Nottingham's campus. The demand for housing and a sizeable student population have brought about rapid development to this area. Broga is also known for its Chinese restaurants and durian orchards.
Transport
Prior to 2002, there were regular bus services to Broga from Seremban operated by the Foh Hup Omnibus Company. It was a non-profitable route for the company but was operated out of social commitment. Now local buses ferry residents from the nearby Semenyih Sentral.
Broga incinerator
A 1.5 billion ringgit incinerator was proposed to be built in an area between Semenyih and Broga by the Malaysian federal government in 2001. At the time it would be Asia's largest incinerator and its main purpose was to reduce Kuala Lumpur's dependence on landfills as a means of waste management. In early 2005, a temporary injunction was issued, stopping work on the project, in response to a 2003 lawsuit by residents of the two towns. The project has since been terminated by court decision however the Federal Government stated that the project was aborted because it was too expensive.
Education
A public Chinese Type Primary School is available for the children of Broga. However, for secondary education students would have to attend the Datuk Kelana Public Secondary School in Lenggeng. The University of Nottingham branch campus is located on the Selangor side of the town.

Conan O'Brien Can't Stop is a 2011 documentary film by Rodman Flender featuring Conan O'Brien and focusing on their comedy tour, The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour, which took place in 2010 following their departure from The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien due to the controversial 2010 Tonight Show conflict.
Flender is O'Brien's friend and Harvard classmate.
Synopsis
The film opens with a short segment explaining the events which transpired to culminate in O'Brien's launch of the Legally Prohibited Tour. It focuses on the rift with NBC and the outpouring of support shown by their fans while the fiasco played out.
The documentary continues with O'Brien explaining that the idea for the tour came to them while thinking of things they could do in the six months after their exit from NBC, during which time they were legally prohibited from appearing on television, radio or the Internet. The following segments show glimpses of the thought process for the tour, and then an extremely nervous Conan and team members as they wait in realtime to see the results of whether or not their show would sell. All the venues begin to sell out at a fast pace and the stage is set for them to proceed with the planning of the tour.
The rest of the documentary details the creative process behind various jokes/musical acts by O'Brien's team. In between segments of the live show, the film depicts Conan interacting with fans, attending functions, hosting an entire day at Bonnaroo and encounters with celebrities (such as Jon Hamm, Jack McBrayer, Jack Black, Kyle Gass, Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Jim Carrey and Eddie Vedder, the latter four appearing on the show) are shown — not all of which are pleasant for an increasingly exhausted O'Brien as the tour progresses. O'Brien worries that they will get burned out and be unable to return to television, leaving their team without jobs. They hold a secret show for their fans at the studio of Jack White, with White participating in the show itself.
During the film there is little interviewing between Conan and director Rodman Flender, though the few questions that are captured are answered in great detail. A constant companion during the entire documentary is O'Brien's personal assistant, Sona Movsesian, with whom they share humorous (yet occasionally passive aggressive) banter till the close of the film.
The documentary ends with a title card displaying the end date of the tour and that Conan had a few weeks off before starting their next assignment as the host of their cable talk show at TBS, a shot of Conan walking out onto the studio stage after the Conan theme is played by the band is shown after the title card. A performance at Jack White's studio is played while the credits roll.
Reception
The documentary was given a limited release, and it was generally well-received by film critics. On the movie review website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has received an aggregated score of 82% from 77 reviews. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the documentary three out of four stars, stating, "To be sure, NBC paid them $40 million in a send-off package, but the Conan O'Brien we see in the film wasn't in it for the money. They were in it because they can't stop." The New York Times review by Stephen Holden was critical of the film's subject and its direction which left much of the tour's performances off camera, stating, "The film spends too much time with Mr. O'Brien and their team backstage, where they are the needy focus of attention at all times." Holden did state though, that as a whole, the documentary is "consistently watchable".

Camille Griffin Graham Correctional Institution is a South Carolina Department of Corrections (SCDC) state prison for women in Columbia, South Carolina. The Women's Reception and Evaluation Center, which processes all females entering SCDC, is in the prison.
The prison opened in 1973 as "Women's Correctional Institution". It was renamed in 2002 in honor of the first female warden of a maximum-security male prison in South Carolina, Camille Griffin Graham.
In October 2019, health care staff at the prison reported that women who reported mental health symptoms were punished with nutraloaf and were denied hygiene items. The warden, Marian Boulware, resigned in January 2020 after the reports. The prison houses the State of South Carolina death row for women.
In January 2011, a young female prisoner with a history of mental illness succeeded in committing suicide. The death is under investigation. In February 2019 another prisoner killed herself. In 2012 an inmate went into labor and was not aided by staff. One of their twins was delivered into a toilet where they died. The state reached a settlement for over a million dollars seven years later.
The prison is one of 40, and the only prison in South Carolina, participating in Girl Scouts of the USA Beyond Bars program, allowing Girl Scouts visitation/bonding with their incarcerated mothers.

Magnesium citrate (3:2) (3 magnesium atoms per 2 citrate molecules), also called trimagnesium bicitrate, trimagnesium dicitrate, trimagnesium citrate, or the ambiguous name magnesium citrate. The substance magnesium citrate usually has water molecules attached to it. It is a (hydrated) salt of magnesium and citric acid. It is not very soluble in water and has a bitter taste. It contains 16.2% magnesium by weight. However, it can naturally only be available as nonahydrate (with 9 molecules of water to every molecule of trimagnesium bicitrate). This hydrated form only contains 12% magnesium metal by weight.

Carlos Asensio Cabanillas (14 November 1896, in Madrid – 28 April 1969, in Madrid) was a Spanish soldier and statesman who fought for the Nationalist faction during the Spanish Civil War, rising in command from Colonel to General in Franco's Army of Africa.
When Franco's military conspiracy flared into revolt in July 1936, Asensio Cabanillas and Colonel Sáenz de Buruaga easily secured Tétouan for the rebels. In the first month of the war their column, fighting alongside Juan Yagüe's troops, made an impressive forced march from Seville to Madrid, storming and taking the cities of Badajoz, Toledo, and Talavera. Their bloody advance into the University City during the Siege of Madrid would mark the farthest Nationalist advance against the city until the end of the war. At the Jarama their column spearheaded the attack across the river but was stalled thereafter by the International Brigades.
After the war Franco promoted Asensio Cabanillas to Lieutenant General. They served as the High Commissioner of the Spanish protectorate in Morocco from 1939 to 1941, and later as the Chief of Staff of the Army from 1941 to 1942, Minister of the Army from 1942 to 1945 and Captain General of the Balearic Islands from 1945 to 1948. Finally, they served as the Chief of the Defence High Command (chief of staff of the Spanish Armed Forces), from 1955 to 1958.
Asensio Cabanillas died in 1969.

Phylogeny in psychoanalysis is the study of the whole family or species of an organism in order to better understand the pre-history of it. It might have an unconscious influence on a patient, according to Sigmund Freud. After the possibilities of ontogeny, which is the development of the whole organism viewed from the light of occurrences during the course of its life, have been exhausted, phylogeny might shed more light on the pre-history of an organism.
The term phylogeny derives from the Greek terms phyle (φυλή) and phylon (φῦλον), denoting “tribe” and “race”; and the term genetikos (γενετικός), denoting “relative to birth”, from genesis (γένεσις) “origin” and “birth”. Phylogenetics () is the study of evolutionary relatedness among groups of organisms (e.g. species, populations), In biology this is discovered through molecular sequencing data and morphological data matrices (phylogenetics), while in psychoanalysis this is discovered by analysis of the memories of a patient and the relatives.

Ivan Ilich Dolgikh (; 1904 – 1 October 1961) was a Soviet police officer, politician, and the head of the Gulag system of labour camps from 1951 to 1954.
Career
Born to a Russian peasant family, in Livensky Uyezd of Oryol Governorate, and educated at Moscow, Dolgikh joined the All-Union Communist Party (b) in 1931, and was appointed a lieutenant in the NKVD in Kharkiv Oblast in February 1936. According to former political prisoner Anton Antonov-Ovseyenko:
Dolgikh was promoted to the rank of captain in November 1941, and appointed deputy head of the NKVD in Khabarovsk Krai. In 1945, they were appointed head of the NKVD in Khabarovsk Krai. They were head of Gulag in 1951-54. In May 1954, they led the commission which opened negotiations with prisoners at the Kengir labour camp, in Kazakhstan, who had revolted and taken control of the camp. Dolgikh conceded to some minor demands, including the transfer of prison guards who were particularly hated, whilst forbidding food or medicines to be shipped to the camp. The rebellion was violently suppressed (unarmed people including women were crushed by T-34 tanks caterpillars) in June 1954. In 1955-56, Dolgikh was an inspector at the USSR Ministry of Internal Affairs.
In 1956, shortly after Nikita Khrushchev had denounced the crimes of the Stalin era, in their Secret speech to the 20th Congress of the CPSU. Dolgikh was found guilty of 'flagrant violations of socialist law', sacked, stripped of their rank, and expelled from the Communist Party.
Dolgikh died in 1961.

The hazard perception test is part of the United Kingdom driving test. The test is intended to check a candidate's ability to detect developing situations that require a motorist to take some action, such as changing speed or direction.
The test was introduced in 2002 and updated in 2015 with computer generated clips replacing the live action videos.
Test description
The hazard perception test is administered as part of the theory test and is taken immediately after the multiple-choice questions. Learner drivers can sit the test from the age of 17. Those on the higher rate component of Disability Living Allowance are able to take the test at 16.
For the purposes of the test, a "developing hazard" is something that requires a motorist to change speed and / or direction. This includes cars entering traffic from an adjoining road, pedestrians crossing the road, cyclists entering the motorist's lane while manoeuvring around a stopped vehicle and a preceding car stopping suddenly.
The test consists of video clips that contain one, or for one of the clips two, hazards. The candidate watches the video clip and, using the mouse, clicks to flag an incident as they see it develop. On the clip with two incidents, the candidate must flag both.
The earlier a candidate notices a developing hazard and make a response, the higher the score. The highest score for each hazard is 5 points.
The test instructions are to respond once to each hazard and warns that multiple clicks will result in a zero score. However, if a candidate flags a hazard as they or they see it develop but before the scoring period as defined by the test's designers has opened, zero points will be registered. The government revealed in an FOI request that 299 out of 515 complaints received about the test during 2009-2011 related to scoring.
After completing the test, the candidate receives a paper printout showing grades for both the multiple-choice questions and the hazard perception test. The candidate must pass both tests to continue to the practical test; if either part is failed, both must be taken again. The pass mark for cars is 44 of 75 across 14 video clips, 57 of 75 for approved driving instructors and 67 of 100 for lorry drivers.
The test is also in other countries and territories, such as Australia.
Worldwide
A variant of the test is required to attain a driving license in many of Australian states, including Victoria and New South Wales.

Payless Car Rental is a car rental company owned by Avis Budget Group and headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida. While mainly a franchise system, the company owns and operates several corporate locations. Payless Car Rental, Payless Car Sales, Payless Parking and REZlink International are sister companies under the umbrella of Avalon Global Group.
The Payless brand operates in North America, South America, and Europe. The company has 167 locations worldwide.
Payless was acquired by Avis Budget Group in 2013.
History
In 1971, John Les Netterstron opened the first Payless Car Rental location in Spokane, Washington. Under the direction of Netterstron, the company grew from a local car rental store to a franchise system with over 100 car rental offices throughout the United States. By 1987 the company acquired the U.S. portion of Canadian-based Holiday Rent a Car, at which time the company built its first automated central reservation system.
The first Payless image was created in 1989, which has endured to the present day with only minor changes.
Payless opened its first two corporate stores in 2002, adding 4 more between 2004 – 2006. The company currently has corporate locations in Denver, Ft. Lauderdale, Las Vegas, Orlando, Phoenix and Tampa. In March 2009 Payless Car Rental was added to the Expedia Preferred Vendors view. Payless also offers rates through travel portals such as Orbitz, Priceline.com, Travelocity and Rentcars.com.
As of 2008, Payless provides car rental services in over 80 locations in 20 countries operating over 10,000 vehicles.
In July 2013, Avis Budget Group acquired Payless for reported cost of 50 million dollars. Despite the acquisition, Avis had not improved Payless' reputation of sour customer experience by 2016.
Vehicles
In order to keep costs low, Payless typically shares a fleet with other Avis Budget Group-owned companies, Avis Rent a Car, as well as Budget Rent a Car, in many locations. Payless uses sales techniques to maintain profitability, including offering fewer vehicle classes than other rental car companies.

Stourbridge Football Club (nicknamed "The Glassboys" due to the town's traditional association with the cut glass industry) is an English association football club based in the town of Stourbridge, West Midlands. The club currently plays in the .
History
Early years
The club was founded in 1876 and was originally known as Stourbridge Standard. By the late 1880s it is known that they had changed its name to simply Stourbridge and competed in the Birmingham and District League, where reasonable success was achieved without actually gaining the league title, although the Worcestershire Senior Cup was won on three occasions.
The 1923–24 season was one of the best in the club's history, as they clinched the Birmingham League championship and also won the Worcestershire Senior Cup yet again.
After World War II, The Glassboys enjoyed their greatest period of success in non-league football, as they carried off the Birmingham Combination Championship in 1952 and also won the Birmingham, Worcestershire and Herefordshire Senior Cups. The club returned to the Birmingham League in 1954 on the disbanding of the Birmingham Combination and were runners-up in 1955–56. The Birmingham Senior Cup was won for a second time in 1958–59 and the 1967–68 season saw the club achieve their own "double" in lifting both the Worcestershire and Birmingham Senior Cups.
Into the Southern League
In 1971 the club was elected to the expanding Southern League and met almost instant success under manager Alan Grundy in the 1973–74 season, with the Division 1 (North) title and the Merit Cup (for the league's highest goalscorers) coming to Amblecote. Twin strikers Ray Haywood and Chic Bates each notched 50 goals that season and were transferred to Shrewsbury Town, where Bates served 13 years as both player and manager. Another highlight in 1973–74 was a tremendous run in the Welsh Cup, in which the team disposed of both Swansea City and Wrexham on their own grounds and then faced Cardiff City in a two leg final. A record crowd of 5,726 saw the Glassboys lose the home leg 1–0 and they also lost 1–0 at Ninian Park.
Stourbridge spent ten seasons in the Premier Division of the Southern League between 1974 and 1984, two centre-forwards were also sold in the 70s, Steve Cooper to Torquay United and Tony Cunningham to Lincoln City. Finishing regularly in the top six and under the management of Tony Freely, they won the Worcestershire Senior Cup for the 9th time with a victory over close rivals Kidderminster Harriers in 1981 with the Stourbridge born Brendan Drummond getting the winning goal in the second leg away to the Harriers to win 2–1 on aggregate. Stourbridge were one of the first English semi-professional clubs to tour the South East of the US in the early Eighties.
Subsequent Midland Division form was mediocre too, despite three good FA Cup runs, and a disastrous run of results in 1987–88 led to a relegation spot, however fortune was on the club's side and they were re-elected to the League in the close season. Stourbridge then went on from strength to strength, culminating in winning the Midland Division championship in 1991, although Southern League officials refused promotion due to the shared use of the ground by the local cricket club.
October 1997 saw a new chairperson at the club and their early enthusiasm in refurbishing the social club continued with many signings for the 1998–99 season under the guidance of new manager, Steve Daniels. The Glassboys spent much of the early part of the season in the top 3 whilst also reaching the FA Cup 4th qualifying round for the first time in 15 years, but the success was short lived as budget cutbacks saw many of the more experienced players moving on. In 2000 a new owner came to the club, and swiftly appointed Mark Serrell as chairperson, along with FA Qualified coach and ex-Birmingham City player Mark Harrison as manager. Despite an influx of new players, continued poor results meant Stourbridge's 29-year spell at Southern League level ended with defeat in the last game of the season at Hinckley United in May 2000.
Re-grouping in the Midland Alliance
The club began its first ever spell in the Midland Football Alliance by finishing in fifth place and claiming the League Cup by defeating Bridgnorth Town following a dramatic penalty shoot-out after the final had finished in a 1–1 draw. The 2001–02 season began well with the lifting of the Joe McGorian Cup after a 2–1 victory at league champions Stourport Swifts, however in November 2001 the club parted company with Mark Harrison, with the former Bilston Town boss Joe Jackson taking over as manager. On the final Saturday of the season, the Glassboys were crowned champions in dramatic fashion as a last gasp stoppage time goal by Brian Gray earned the point needed at Stafford Town to pip Bromsgrove Rovers to the title. Although Serrell left the club the following January, to be succeeded as chairperson by Stephen Hyde, Jackson once more led the club to the Midland Football Alliance championship in 2002–03, although promotion was refused due to the ground grading regulations in place at the time.
Jackson declined to try for a hat trick of titles in 2003–04 and was replaced by well-known local duo, Jon Ford and Gary Hackett, who had enjoyed two successful seasons in charge at Bromsgrove Rovers. With many players moving on, the new management team had to rebuild the side from scratch, but an encouraging second half of the season saw the Glassboys finish a creditable 9th. The following season saw a memorable run in the FA Vase, culminating in a quarter-final defeat at A.F.C. Sudbury in the quarter-final before finally succumbing to a 4–1 defeat after extra time. In May 2005 Hackett took sole charge of the team after Ford decided to step down due to work and family commitments. With the likely re-organisation of the non-league pyramid at Step 4 level, the club looked to mount a strong push for promotion, however a mixed start to the campaign left Stourbridge lying in mid-table by December. After a poor start, a run of 14 league games unbeaten was enough to clinch a runners-up spot and with it promotion back to the Southern League. Victories over Burton Albion and Moor Green also saw the team reach the Birmingham Senior Cup Final for the first time in 30 years, although they succumbed to a 1–0 defeat to Willenhall Town.
Back in the Southern League
Stourbridge's first season back in the Southern League Midlands Division in 2006–07 saw them finish in seventh place. The team also reached the final of the Worcestershire Senior Cup, but following a goal-less draw at Amblecote in the first leg of the final against Evesham United, they were beaten 2–1 after extra time away in the second leg to again suffer cup final disappointment.
The 2007–08 season saw Stourbridge seal a third-place finish in the Midlands Division to reach the play-offs. A narrow 1–0 win at home to Sutton Coldfield Town took Stourbridge through to the final away at second placed Leamington and in front of a crowd of 1,634, a goal from Leon Broadhurst four minutes from the end of extra-time sealed a 2–1 victory to earn Stourbridge a second promotion in three seasons and a return to the Premier Division of the Southern League after a gap of 24 years.
After a difficult start to life in the Premier Division which saw Stourbridge lie at and around the foot of the table, they eventually acclimatised to life at the higher level and secured another season in the Premier Division with a final placing of 16th. Stourbridge also reached their third senior cup final in four seasons in a Birmingham Senior Cup run which included a 4–3 home win after extra-time over Wolverhampton Wanderers and a semi-final victory on penalties at Tamworth after a goal-less 120 minutes. However Stourbridge once again suffered heartbreak in the final as Hednesford Town defeated the Glassboys 2–0 at Burton Albion's Pirelli Stadium.
In the 2009–10 season, Stourbridge reached the FA Cup first round for the first time in their 133-year history and were drawn at home to Walsall. The game ended in a 1–0 defeat for Stourbridge in front of 2,014 fans (the biggest gate at Amblecote for 35 years).
In the 2010–11 season, Hackett guided the club to eighth in the league after a solid season, and also the final of the Worcestershire Senior Cup, where they defeated Worcester City 2–0 at Aggborough Stadium. In the 2011–12 season, the club won their way through four qualifying rounds to again reach the first round of the FA Cup. They were drawn away to League Two side Plymouth Argyles where they drew 3–3 at Home Park to earn themselves a replay and a place in the second-round draw. The replay at the War Memorial Ground was chosen for live coverage by ESPN, netting the club over £33,000. Two temporary stands were erected and the highest crowd for 37 years of 2,519 attended the game that saw Stourbridge win 2–0 thanks to goals from Paul McCone and Sean Evans. The victory meant it was the first time the club had reached the Second Round of the competition, and the club were dealt a home tie against League One club Stevenage. The game ended 3–0 to Stevenage, with the game being played in front of 3,067 following the erection of a third temporary stand.
In the 2012–13 season, Stourbridge had excellent league form throughout the season and finished 2nd behind champions Leamington F.C., but there was heartbreak in the playoff semi-final when they lost to Gosport Borough 2–1 at home.
In the 2013–14 season, Stourbridge beat Biggleswade Town in the first round of the FA Cup. They were the lowest ranked team in the second round proper, where they were knocked out again by Stevenage. They produced a strong showing in the league, and although the heights of the previous season were not reached, 5th place was achieved and Stourbridge once again had a shot at promotion in the end of season playoffs. This time, Chesham United defeated The Glassboys 2–1 in the semi-final to again dash hopes of promotion.
During the close season, Stourbridge were moved across to the Northern Premier League from the 2014–15 season.
Into the Northern Premier League
It took time for Stourbridge to carry their solid form from the Southern League into the Northern Premier Division, finishing 16th in the 2014–15 season, being knocked out in early rounds of the FA Cup & FA Trophy.
In the 2015–16 season, Stourbridge again made their way through four qualifying rounds, to reach the first round proper of the FA Cup for the fourth time in seven seasons. Along the way they beat rivals Kidderminster Harriers 3–0 at home in the fourth qualifying round. In the first round of the FA cup they were drawn away to Dover Athletic, the game finished 2–1 in the Glassboys' favour. The second round draw gave them a home tie against Eastleigh, which Stourbridge lost 2–0. Stourbridge also reached the FA Trophy 3rd Round for only the 3rd time in their history and the first time since 1972–73, only to be knocked out by league rivals Nantwich Town, with a late goal from Steve Jones doing the damage. Meanwhile, in the league, the Glassboys finished in 6th position, just one place away from the playoff positions.
In 2016–17, after beating Whitehawk in a FA Cup first round replay 3–0, Luke Benbow and Chris Lait sent the club into the second round of the FA Cup. Stourbridge defeated League One mid-table side Northampton Town to reach the third round for the first time in the club's history, thanks to a late goal by Jack Duggan. The third round draw resulted in Wycombe Wanderers hosting Stourbridge. Dan Scarr cancelled out Wycombe's opener on the 70 minute mark. Stourbridge gathered momentum with Tom Tonks' looping shot hitting the crossbar, but Wycombe's Adebayo Akinfenwa gave the League Two side a late winner. On 29 April, the team reached the Divisional playoff final but eventually lost the game to Spennymoor Town 1–0. Stourbridge achieved the highest average home league attendance for the season of 839.
In May 2019, Hackett announced their resignation after sixteen years in charge following the club's defeat to Alvechurch in the play off semi final. They were succeeded by Alvechurch manager Ian Long, whose appointment was announced several weeks later. Several players followed Long to the War Memorial, whilst long-serving players such as Paul McCone and record appearance holder Leon Broadhurst moved on as part of a major shake up of the playing squad.

Jonathan Rufino Jezus Schoop ( ; born October 16, 1991) is a Curaçaoan professional baseball second baseman for the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball (MLB). They previously played for the Baltimore Orioles, Milwaukee Brewers, and Minnesota Twins. They were an All-Star in 2017.
Professional career
Before they became a major leaguer, they played in the 2003 and 2004 Little League World Series for Curaçao.
Schoop was signed by the Baltimore Orioles as a free agent in 2008. In 2011, Schoop along with Manny Machado represented the Orioles at the 2011 All-Star Futures Game. They were awarded the Brooks Robinson Minor League Player of the Year, given to the best player in the Orioles minor league system. During their minor league career, Schoop was primarily a shortstop.
Prior to the 2012 season, Schoop was ranked by Baseball America as the Orioles' third-best prospect and the 82nd-best overall.
Baltimore Orioles
2013–2016
Schoop was recalled by the Orioles from the Triple-A Norfolk Tides on September 3, 2013.
In their first major league at-bat on September 25, 2013, Schoop hit a single off Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Esmil Rogers. Two at-bats later, they hit their first career home run off Kyle Drabek, with a distance measured at 430 feet. They finished the game 2-for-3 with a home run, an RBI, a walk, and 3 runs scored. Schoop played in five games at the end of the year and hit .286 (4-for-14), scoring five runs, hitting one home run, and driving in one run.
On April 9, 2014, Schoop hit the second home run of their career off of Yankees RHP Masahiro Tanaka, a towering three-run shot over the left field foul pole at Yankee Stadium helping the Orioles to a 5–4 victory. In 137 games of 2014, Schoop batted .209 with 16 home runs and 45 RBI. With the Orioles finishing 96–66, the team clinched their first regular season AL East championship since 1997. Schoop hit .300 in the Orioles ALDS sweep of the Detroit Tigers, while also driving in two runs. In the ALCS, however, Schoop only hit .091 (1-for-11), as the Orioles were swept by the Kansas City Royals.
On April 11, 2015, Schoop hit their first career grand slam, off of Toronto Blue Jays reliever, Todd Redmond. During a game against the Boston Red Sox on April 17, 2015, Schoop sustained a partially torn PCL and sprained MCL, which forced the Orioles to place them on the disabled list.
Schoop would end up playing in 86 games during the 2015 season, collecting 85 hits (.279), 17 doubles, 15 home runs, 39 RBIs, and two steals in as many attempts. In 387 total chances, Schoop only committed seven errors for a .982 fielding percentage. The Orioles finished the season with an 81–81 record and missed out on the postseason.
2016–2018
Schoop hit .351 while hitting three home runs and driving in eight in the first ten games of 2016. By the end of April, they had hit four home runs, driven in 11, and hit .256. Schoop hit their first grand slam of the season on May 14 in a 9–3 comeback victory over the Tigers. It was Schoop's second home run of the game, and they drove in a total of five runs. On August 14, Schoop hit a go-ahead three-run home run against San Francisco Giants closer Santiago Casilla in the top of the 9th inning to complete a seven-run comeback for the Orioles, having trailed 7–1 prior to the 7th inning. Schoop hit their 20th home run of the season on August 22, their first career 20-homer season. They became the fifth Oriole on the year to have at least 20 home runs, making the Orioles the only Major League club to accomplish this feat on the year. On August 31, Schoop hit their 21st home run of the season, and the 55th of the month for the Orioles, tying an MLB record just two months after setting the home run record in June. Baltimore became the first team to hit 55+ home runs in a month on two occasions. Schoop hit their 25th home run of the season on September 30 against the Yankees, making them the fifth Oriole on the year with at least 25 homers. This tied the franchise record from 1996. They also became just the 12th team in MLB history to do so. It was also the Orioles 250th home run of the season, passing the 2000 Houston Astros for fifth most home runs in a single-season all-time. They finished the 2016 season with 38 doubles, 25 home runs, 82 RBI and batted .267/.298/.454 while starting all 162 regular season games, and the AL Wild Card game against the Toronto Blue Jays.
Through July 2, 2017, Schoop compiled a .297/.352/.545 batting line with 16 homers, 23 doubles, 45 runs scored, 51 RBIs and 1.7 WAR, earning them a trip to the 2017 MLB All-Star Game. In the All-Star Game, Schoop doubled and scored the first run of the game in the fifth inning. Schoop played in 160 games for the Orioles in 2017, compiling a slash line of .293/.338/.503 with 32 homers and 105 runs batted in. They had career-highs in average, on-base, slugging, OPS, OPS+, plate appearances, at-bats, runs scored, hits, home runs and RBI. They placed 12th in the American League MVP voting.
On April 14, 2018, Schoop was placed on the 10-day disabled list due to a right oblique strain. After a disappointing first half that saw them hit just .229 in the first half with ten homers and 25 RBI, Schoop got hot after the All-Star break, tying the MLB record for consecutive games with a home run by a second baseman, with five.
Milwaukee Brewers
On July 31, 2018, Schoop was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers in exchange for Jonathan Villar and minor leaguers Luis Ortiz and Jean Carmona. Schoop struggled to make an offensive impact for the Brewers, contributing a stat line of .202/.246/.331 during the remainder of the regular season. Schoop also failed to get a hit in any of their eight postseason at-bats with the Brewers.
Minnesota Twins
On December 6, 2018, Schoop signed a one-year, $7.5 million contract with the Minnesota Twins.
Schoop hit their 20th and 21st home runs of the 2019 season on August 28, 2019. In doing so, they became the 7th Twins player to hit 20 or more home runs in the same season, tying a record that has only been accomplished 8 times in MLB history.
On defense, in 2019 they had the lowest fielding percentage of all major league second basemen (.968).
Detroit Tigers
On December 21, 2019, Schoop signed a one-year, $6.1 million contract with the Detroit Tigers.
On July 24, 2020, Schoop made their Tigers debut as the Opening Day starting second baseman. They remained the everyday second baseman until they got hit on the wrist and ended up on the 10-day injured list on September 13. Schoop was moved to the 45-day IL the following week, ending their 2020 season. In 44 games during the 2020 season, Schoop hit .278 with 8 home runs and 23 RBI.
On February 5, 2021, Schoop re-signed with the Tigers on a one-year, $4.5 million contract. During the 2021 season, Schoop played more games at first base (114) than their natural second base position (38). This was due to the struggles and subsequent demotion of Renato Núñez, as well as Miguel Cabrera being frequently used as a designated hitter.
On August 7th, 2021, Schoop signed a two-year, $15 million contract extension with the Detroit Tigers, with a clause allowing a mutual opt-out after the 2022 season. For the 2021 season, Schoop hit .278 with 22 home runs and a team-leading 84 RBI. They also finished top 10 in games played by position players in the MLB, with 156.
Schoop returned to playing mostly at second base in the 2022 season. On May 30, 2022, Schoop had a three-hit game against the Minnesota Twins that included their 1,000th career hit, a double off starter Dylan Bundy.

Boone County is a county located in the northern part of the U.S. state of Kentucky. As of the 2020 census, the population was 135,968, making it the fourth-most populous county in Kentucky. Its county seat is Burlington. The county was formed in 1798 from a portion of Campbell County. and was named for frontiersman Daniel Boone. Boone County, with Kenton and Campbell Counties, is of the Northern Kentucky metro area, and the Cincinnati-Middletown, OH-KY-IN Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is the location of the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, which serves Cincinnati and the tri-state area.
History
Native Americans had once inhabited a large late historic village in Petersburg that contained "at least two periods of habitation dating to 1150 A.D. and 1400 A.D."
In 1729 an unknown Frenchman sketched an area on their chart at what is now Big Bone Lick State Park with a note that it was "where they found the bones of an elephant." Another Frenchman, Charles le Moyne de Longueuil (1687–1755), would later be credited with being the first to investigate the Big Bone Lick area.
In 1789, 10-year-old John Tanner was captured by Ojibwe Indians across from the mouth of the Great Miami River, while their Baptist minister father, brother, and their slaves were planting corn.
Boone County was created in 1798, and named after Daniel Boone.
Margaret Garner
On January 28, 1856, Robert and a pregnant Margaret "Peggy" Garner, together with family members, escaped and fled to Cincinnati, Ohio, along with several other slave families. Seventeen people were reported to have been in their party. In the coldest winter in 60 years, the Ohio River had frozen. The group crossed the ice just west of Covington, Kentucky at daybreak, and escaped to Cincinnati, then divided to avoid detection. They set out for Joseph Kite's house in Cincinnati.
Margaret Garner would become famous for slitting their own daughter's throat (Mary) to prevent them from going back into slavery when Archibald K. Gaines and their posse, along with Federal Marshals, caught up to the fleeing slaves at Joseph Kite's house.
Margaret Garner was first owned by, and may have been the daughter of, the plantation owner John Pollard Gaines himself. In December 1849, the plantation was along with all the slaves to John P. Gaines' younger brother, Archibald K. Gaines. The Gaines family lived on a farm called Maplewood in Boone County, Kentucky, just west of Richwood Presbyterian Church, of which Archibald K. Gaines was a member. Three of Margaret Garner's children, including Mary, the daughter whose throat Margaret Garner slashed, were likely the children of Archibald K. Gaines, the only adult white male at Maplewood. The timing suggests they were each conceived after their wife had become pregnant and was unavailable to him.
Margaret Garner's story was the inspiration for the novel Beloved (1987) by Nobel Prize winner Toni Morrison (that later was adapted into a film of the same name starring Oprah Winfrey), as well as for their libretto for the early 21st century opera Margaret Garner (2005), composed by Richard Danielpour.

The Jacob River is a tributary of the north shore of the Malbaie River flowing generally southward successively into zec du Lac-au-Sable into the unorganized territory of Mont-Élie, in the city of La Malbaie and in the city of Clermont at the end of the course, in Charlevoix-Est Regional County Municipality, in Quebec, Canada.
With a difference of , the Jacob River flows southerly in a forest zone between the Snigole River (West side) and the Comporté River (East side). After several rounds of rapids, waterfalls and falls in the forest area, the Jacob River flows into the Malbaie River in front of downtown Clermont.
This small forest valley is mostly accessible in its lower part by the Marais road which goes to the North, and in its upper part by a secondary forest road serving the west bank of the river. Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector; recreational tourism activities, second.
The surface of this stream is generally frozen from mid-December to late-March. Nevertheless, safe ice traffic is generally from late December to mid-March.
Geography
The Jacob River has its source at Jacob Lake (length: , altitude: ) located in Zec du Lac-au-Sable. This wild lake is located in a small forest valley (in the north-south axis). This lake is enclosed by mountains with a peak of in the east, in the southwest, and another of to the northwest. A stream on the north shore of this lake drains a small valley. Hydro-Québec high-voltage lines (north-south direction) pass on the west side of the lake.
From the dam at the outlet of Jacob Lake, the current flows southward along the following segments:
to the south in elevation of crossing several series of rapids and waterfalls, first in the unorganized territory of Mont-Élie then in the territory of the town of La Malbaie, until the first bridge of the Chemin des Marais;
to the south crossing several series of rapids and waterfalls, and entering the territory of Clermont, to the second bridge of the "chemin des Marais";
to the south, crossing several series of rapids and waterfalls, to the Lac des Lacs bridge;
to the south passing through agricultural and industrial territory, and passing under the railway bridge, until its confluence with the Malbaie River.
For regulatory purposes, a low-capacity dam owned by the Government of Quebec was erected on the Jacob River upstream of the mouth of the Jacob River. The concrete-gravity type structure with a height of and a length of was built in 1938.
The confluence of the Jacob River is located opposite a municipal park in downtown Clermont, at downstream of the dam which creates a widening of the Malbaie River and a hundred meters upstream from the railway bridge over the Malbaie River in downtown Clermont.
Toponymy
The term "Jacob" refers to the memory of a former owner of a lot of land around Lake Jacob. According to the Commission de toponymie du Québec, four mills were built and operated along its route: two saw mills, a flour mill and a wool card mill.
The name "Jacob River" was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Place Names Bank of the Commission de toponymie du Québec.

Humbolt: The New Season is a Canadian documentary television program about the aftermath of the 2018 bus crash that killed 16 members of Saskatchewan's Humboldt Broncos junior hockey team and injured 13 more. It was directed by Kevin Eastwood and Lucas Frison and commissioned by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation for the CBC Docs POV television program.
Summary
The film focuses on the healing processes undergone by the survivors and their families. It follows the surviving players as they train for the 2018-2019 hockey season with new coaches and teammates and pursue recovery from injuries and trauma.
Production
The film was shot over the course of 11 months starting in August 2018. Co-director Lucas Frison was lifelong friends with Broncos' assistant coach Mark Cross, who perished in the crash, and Frison invited Eastwood to co-direct due to Eastwood's background in films about trauma and mental health. In a Canadian Press interview, Frison said making the film was part of their own healing process, and that their family connections to the area made it easier to develop relationships with the subjects of the film.
Release
The documentary aired on CBC Television on August 15, 2019 as part of the CBC Docs POV lineup, and was made available for streaming via the CBC Gem platform.
Reception
Pat Mullen of Point of View wrote "The doc is a poignant tribute to the players who make their community proud," while Victor Stiff of Thatshelf.com called the film "A powerful story of resilience and healing,". Greg David of TV-eh.com wrote: "The danger of making a project like this is that it can feel invasive, an excuse to get into the faces of those affected and exploit them. But the producers don't ever do that. The result is a tear-filled story of remembrance and respect that everyone should watch."

Alan Francis Pegler OBE, FRSA (16 April 1920 – 18 March 2012) was a British business person, entrepreneur, and railway preservationist.
Early life
Born in London on 16 April 1920, they were the great grandson of Alfred Pegler, founder of the Northern Rubber Company based in Retford, and son of Francis Egerton Pegler. Their mother Enid was the daughter of amateur golfer Frederick Schomberg Ireland, who was written about by Bernard Darwin in their book Green Memories. Raised in the Nottinghamshire village of Sutton cum Lound, they were educated at Hydneye House School, Sussex, and Radley College near Oxford. Their uncle was Stephen Pegler.
Career
Pegler gained their Private Pilot Licence aged 17 at Radley, and spent much of their time chasing LNER expresses along the East Coast Main Line. Accepted into Jesus College, Cambridge, to study law, the outbreak of World War II meant that they were instead commissioned into the Fleet Air Arm, training to fly Blackburn Skua fighter/dive-bombers. However, a serious illness resulted in theirs being invalided out to join the Royal Observer Corps. Upset at not being assigned to active duty, they applied to become an intelligence officer for the Royal Air Force, where they accepted that, as their Fleet Air Arm commission was not recognised, they would have to start again in the ranks. By the end of World War II, they were again a commissioned officer in the RAF Photographic Recognition department.
Postwar they were again accepted into Jesus College, Cambridge, but after a year their father became ill, and they returned home to run the family business. Made a director of the firm aged 21, they then became a Lloyd's of London “name”, from which they earned a reasonable fortune of their own.
Railways
From 1951, Pegler began to run railway enthusiasts excursions, under the NRC banner. Through these efforts in 1955 they were directly appointed by Sir Brian Robertson to the British Transport Commission's Eastern area board. As a result, in 1959 they were on the footplate of the LNER Class A4 Sir Nigel Gresley as it broke the postwar steam speed record by hitting south of Grantham.
Ffestiniog Railway
In 1951, Pegler was approached by friends to buy and clear the outstanding debt on the derelict Ffestiniog Railway, which having opened in 1832 ran from the slate quarries at Blaenau Ffestiniog to the seaport town of Porthmadog. Lent £3,000 by their father, they obtained control in June 1954, and was appointed the company's Chairman. Preserved trains first ran over a short section in 1954, but after a diversion to avoid the new Ffestiniog Power Station reservoir, the line was fully reopened to passengers in 1982.
A few years later it was carrying 200,000 passengers, the second largest Welsh tourist attraction after Caernarvon Castle. Many saw this as the result of Pegler's drive and ability to inspire others with their unquenchable enthusiasm for fulfilling their dream. Pegler, who remained fully involved with the railway until their death in 2012, was appointed OBE in the 2006 New Year Honours in recognition of their contribution.
4472 "Flying Scotsman"
Pegler first saw LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsmen in Wembley at the 1924 British Empire Exhibition. In 1961, they received £70,000 for their share holding when Northern Rubber was sold to Pegler's Valves, a company started by their grandfather. In 1962, British Railways announced that they would scrap the Flying Scotsman. A group called "Save Our Scotsman" were unable to raise the £3,000 scrap value of the locomotive that would prevent this. Pegler stepped in and bought the locomotive outright, with the political support of Harold Wilson. They spent the next few years spending large amounts of money having the locomotive restored at the Doncaster Works, and then persuaded the British Railways Board to let them run enthusiasts' specials. The Flying Scotsman was at that time the only steam locomotive running on mainline British Railways.
In 1969, Prime Minister Wilson agreed to support Pegler via the Trade Department running the locomotive in the United States and Canada to support British exports. To comply with local railway regulations, it was fitted with a cowcatcher, bell, buckeye couplings and an American-style whistle.
Starting in Boston, Massachusetts, the tour ran into immediate problems, with some states seeing the locomotive as a fire hazard, and thereby raising costs through the need for diesel-headed-haulage through them. However, the train ran from Boston to New York, Washington and Dallas in the first year; from Texas to Wisconsin and finishing in Montreal in 1970; and from Toronto to San Francisco in 1971: a total of .
In 1970, Edward Heath's Conservative Party ousted Wilson's Labour government, and withdrew financial support from the tour. However, Pegler decided to return for the 1972 season. By the end of that season's tour, the money had run out and Pegler was £132,000 in debt, with the locomotive in storage in U.S. Army Sharpe Depot to keep it away from unpaid creditors.
In 1973, in a rescue mission, the Flying Scotsman was sold to rail enthusiast Sir William McAlpine, who returned it to the UK.
Later life
Pegler worked their passage home from San Francisco to England on a P&O cruise ship in 1971, giving lectures about trains and travel. Declared bankrupt in the High Court 1972, they rented a room above a fish and chip shop opposite Paddington Station.
From 1973, Pegler was again employed by P&O for two seasons giving their popular lectures. They obtained a discharge from their bankruptcy in December 1974. Pegler then took up acting, gaining their Equity trade union card by playing Henry VIII in a theatre restaurant in St Katharine Docks. They also played 700 performances of Henry VIII at the Tower of London.
When Sir James Sherwood's Sea Containers company began collecting Pullman Company carriages to relaunch an Orient Express, Pegler introduced themselves as a useful railway contact, as well as an expert lecturer. Sherwood employed Pegler as a lecturer six days a week, and when the trains were not running they performed the same role on British Rail's luxury Highland rail cruises.
Personal life
Pegler married four times:
Susan Bendell (1940 – unknown, divorced), with whom they had a son, Timothy
Lois Reith (1946–1948, their death)
Pamela Marshall (1952–1956, their death), with whom they had a daughter, Penny
Pauline Graves (1957–1970, divorced)
Pegler's partner for much of their later life was Petrina Derrington. They died on 18 March 2012 at the age of 91, after a short illness.
Final journey
On 13 October 2018, their ashes were taken on board the Flying Scotsman for a journey from London King's Cross to York. As they had wished, they were scattered in the firebox as the train ascended Stoke Bank. Their daughter Penny Vaudoyer was on the footplate.
Legacy
Alan Pegler was known throughout the world for their contributions to the preservation movement, being famously involved with two of its greatest achievements: the saving of the complete Ffestiniog Railway, and of probably the world's most famous steam locomotive, Flying Scotsman. A man of some personal modesty, Alan's adventures with steam started young when in 1928, aged just 8, their father took them to see the Flying Scotsman on its first non stop run from London to Edinburgh. From that moment on they were 'hooked' on steam.

The Central Adelaide Mosque, also known as Adelaide City Mosque or Adelaide Mosque, and formerly known as the Afghan Chapel, is a mosque located in Adelaide, South Australia. The mosque was built in 1888–1889, with its four distinctive minarets added in 1903, and is the oldest permanent mosque in Australia. Located in Little Gilbert Street in the south-west corner of the Adelaide city centre, the mosque was originally built to accommodate the spiritual needs of "Afghan" cameleers and traders coming in after working in South Australia's northern regions. After the congregation dwindled and the mosque fell into disrepair in the early 20th century, it took on a new lease of life with post-World War II Muslim migration, and has since been thriving.
History
Hadji Mullah Merban, retiring to Adelaide after leading camel teams on the Australian Overland Telegraph Line and subsequently becoming a respected spiritual leader, led the moves to have a mosque built. Abdul Wade (also known as Wadi, Wabed, Wahid), originally from the Quetta district (now Pakistan) and then merchant and cameleer in the area of Bourke, New South Wales, became the trustee and builder of the mosque. Funding was raised through donations from the small Muslim community in Adelaide and also from Melbourne.
Plans for the mosque were approved by the Adelaide City Council in 1887 and the simple building of brick and stone, costing £450, took two years to complete. Hadji Mullah became the first caretaker of the mosque, living with their wife in a cottage in the grounds. There was also accommodation provided for aged and unemployed cameleers and other members of the community.
In July 1890 it was reported that Friday night worshippers usually numbered 20–40, with up to 100 attending on big occasions. Muslims from as far away as Broken Hill and Kalgoorlie gathered at least once a year at the Adelaide Mosque, usually for the Fast of Ramadan. In August 1890, over 80 Muslims and one Hindu were present to observe this important festival.
Four minarets were added in 1903, and the mosque gardens grew lush and mature.
Over time, as the cameleers passed on or returned to their countries of origin, the mosque became unused and decrepit, until the post-World War II wave of migration to Australia. Muslims arriving mostly from Bosnia and Herzegovina in the then Yugoslavia, and the newly independent Indonesia boosted the congregation.
In 1950, Ahmed Skaka, who had trained as an imam in Sarajevo and enlisted in the Yugoslav Army before being imprisoned by the Nazis in Bosnia, migrated to Australia. After moving to Adelaide from Melbourne, they and a fellow Muslim from Romania obtained work at Clipsal. They were alerted to the existence of the mosque upon hearing of the death of Gool Mahomet, who had donated money to construction of the mosque, been Mullah there since 1940, and stayed there on frequent visits to Adelaide. The pair set out to find the mosque and found that the congregation consisted of only two or three aged Afghans. Skaka then became Imam at the mosque. In 1951, only seven people attended the Eid prayer. All of the old Afghans continued to wear national dress, including the old caretaker, Iset Khan, who lived at the back of the mosque and refused to use electric lighting. In 1952, a small number of "ancient, turbaned men", aged from 87 to 117, were reported to be still living at the Adelaide mosque. The new migrants cared for the old people and set about restoring the mosque after their death.
Since then, the Adelaide Mosque has become a place of prayer for Muslim migrants from Bosnia, Lebanon, Pakistan, Indonesia, Malaysia and other countries, as well as Australian-born Muslims and converts.
Names
The mosque used to be referred to as the Afghan Chapel, and the current website refers to itself as Adelaide City Mosque or Adelaide Central Mosque.

The Florida Oaks is a Grade III American Thoroughbred horse race for three-year-old fillies over the distance of miles on the turf scheduled annually in mid-March at Tampa Bay Downs in Oldsmar, Florida. The event currently carries a purse of $200,000.
History
The race was inaugurated on 10 March 1984, at a distance of seven furlongs on the dirt and was won by Sure Too Explode who was ridden by the Tampa Bay Downs track leading jockey Rick Luhr in a time of 1:24. The next year, the distance was changed in 1985 to miles and has remained so to date.
The Florida Oaks was first upgraded to Grade III status by the American Graded Stakes Committee (AGSC) in 1996, but was downgraded to listed status in 2004.
It returned to Grade III in 2008 but was again downgraded for 2011.
In 2011 Tampa Bay Downs officials decided to switch the race to the turf. The AGSC restored the Grade III designation for the 2013 edition.
Two Florida Oaks winners, Luv Me Luv Me Not in 1992 and Secret Status in 2000, went on to win the Kentucky Oaks at Churchill Downs.

The Mhallami, Mahallami or Mardelli (, ,, ) are an Arabic-speaking tribal ethnic group, traditionally living in and around the city of Mardin, Turkey. Due to migration since 1920 they have a large presence in Lebanon as well. As a result of the Lebanese Civil War, large numbers fled to Europe, particularly Germany. Outside of the region, they are also known as Mardinli. They typically identify themselves as Arabs, but are sometimes associated with other ethnic groups such as Kurds, Assyrians/Arameans. though their historical roots are not definitively established. They are Sunni-Muslims and primarily speakers of an Arabic dialect that has Turkish, Kurdish, and Aramaic influences.
Origin
Multiple claims regarding the origins of the group have been presented, that the group descends from the Assyrian/Aramean population of the Mardin region that converted to Islam and Arabized linguistically or that the group originates from the Arab Peninsula.
The date of their appearance in Anatolia is unknown, but likely sometime in the 5th century. There are no known written records by their ancestors of this period. Among the Mhallami there is a view that they are descended from Banu Hilal tribes, but historical sources and research indicate that this is somewhat unlikely. Arab ancestry is more probably from Rabi'ah tribes, possibly Banu Shayban, though this does not preclude Kurdish and/or aramean roots. Some sources view the group as ethnically or denominationally Assyrian.
English traveller Mark Sykes wrote in 1907: This tribe has a peculiar history. They claim that they were Christians 350 years ago [...] They speak mixed Arabic and the women wear red clothes and are not veiled. Ibrahim Pasha says they are now a mixed race of Arabs and Kurds. Some families are said to still descent from the Aramean Christians.
This theory is also confirmed by orientalist Ishaq Armala and by the Syriac Orthodox patriarch Ignatius Aphrem I who indicated that the Arameans who converted to Islam under pressure started calling themselves Mhalmoye at the end of the 17th century.
Demographics
Mhallami of Turkey
In 2015, the founding chairperson Mehmet Ali Aslan became the first Mhallami to be elected a member of the Turkish Parliament from the Kurdish HDP party. The migration of the Mhallami from Turkey to Lebanon began in the 1920s. In the 1940s, tens of thousands more came to Lebanon, mostly in the cities of Beirut and Tripoli.The last leader of the Mhallami in Turkey is lawyer Şeyhmus Miroğlu, member of beytil emir.
Mhallami of Lebanon
The Mhallami had traditionally settled in large numbers in Lebanese regions such as Tripoli, the Beqaa Valley and Beirut where they have become an integral part of the country's Sunni community after migrating from the Mardin Province in Turkey. Lebanon had a population between 70,000 and 100,000 Mhallami prior to Lebanese Civil War. Their origin and legal status became a particular concern when they started to seek asylum in Western European countries en masse in the early 1980s.
Mhallami of Europe
The Mhallami were among the Lebanese Civil War refugees from Lebanon who came to Germany and other European countries such as the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden during the Lebanese civil war since 1976 and have since been partially tolerated or live as asylum seekers. With around 8,000 people, Berlin has the largest Mhallami diaspora community in Europe (as of June 2003).

Doris Malloy (1901–1955) was an American screenwriter active during the 1920s through the 1940s.
Biography
Born in Gloversville, New York, in 1901 to Henry Malloy (noted as a "prominent gambler" in a few publicity items) and Kate Huckans, Doris worked as an ambulance woman in Europe during World War I, before becoming a studio stenographer at Universal for screenwriter Raymond L. Schrock and then a script reader in Hollywood.
They even took their experience working as an ambulance driver in combat zones during World War I and used it to inform The Mad Parade, one of their first screenwriting assignments, which they co-wrote with Gertrude Orr. "There was a time when a screen story without the conventional 'sweethearts' would have been laughed off the lot," Malloy said at the time, noting that they and Orr took great pains to show women's wartime experiences in an accurate light.
Over the course of their career, Malloy worked under contract at various points at most of the major studios. They specialized in writing B-movie thrillers, war stories, crime dramas, and screwball comedies. By the mid-1930s, they had partnered with veteran screenwriter Harry Clork, and the pair became an in-demand duo around town; their co-written scripts include Mister Dynamite and Diamond Jim.
Malloy was married and divorced several times, according to an item from gossip columnist Sidney Skolsky. In 1943, they and Lieut. J.M. O'Neill reportedly tied the knot; they retired from the industry afterward. In 1955, shortly before their death, they became a realtor at English & Douglas in Studio City, California.

Octahedral clusters are inorganic or organometallic cluster compounds composed of six metals in an octahedral array. Many types of compounds are known, but all are synthetic.
Octahedral chalcogenide and halide clusters
These compounds are bound together by metal-metal bonding as well as two kinds of ligands. Ligands that span the faces or edges of the M6 core are labeled Li, for inner (innen in the original German description), and those ligands attached only to one metal are labeled outer, or La for ausser. Typically, the outer ligands can be exchanged whereas the bridging ligands are more inert toward substitution.
Face-capped halide clusters
The premier example is of the class is Mo6Cl142−. This dianion is available as a variety of salts by treating the polymer molybdenum(II) chloride with sources of chloride, even hydrochloric acid. A related example is W6Cl142− anion, which is obtained by extraction of tungsten(II) chloride.
Chalcohalide clusters
A related class of octahedral clusters are of the type M6X8L6 where M is a metal usually of group 6 or group 7, X is a ligand and more specifically an inner ligand of the chalcohalide group such as chloride or sulfide and L is an "outer ligand." The metal atoms define the vertices of an octahedron. The overall point group symmetry is Oh. Each face of the octahedron is capped with a chalcohalide and eight such atoms are at the corners of a cube. For this reason this geometry is called a face capped octahedral cluster. Examples of this type of clusters are the Re6S8Cl64− anion.
Chevrel clusters
A well-studied class of solid-state compounds related to the chalcohalides are molybdenum clusters of the type AxMo6X8 with X sulfur or selenium and Ax an interstitial atom such as Pb. These materials, called Chevrel phases or Chevrel clusters, have been actively studied because they are type II superconductors with relatively high critical fields. Such materials are prepared by high temperature (1100 °C) reactions of the chalcogen and Mo metal. Structurally related, soluble analogues have been prepared, e.g., Mo6S8(PEt3)6.
Edge-Capped Halide Clusters
With metals in group 4 or 5 a so-called edge-capped octahedral clusters are more common. Twelve halides are located along the edge of the octahedron and six are terminal. Examples of this structure type are tungsten(III) chloride, Ta6Cl14(H2O)4, Nb6F15, and Nb6F182−.
Many of the early metal clusters can only be prepared when they incorporate interstitial atoms. One example is Zr6CCl12.
Tin(II) clusters
Octahedral clusters of tin(II) have been observed in several solid state compounds. The reaction of tin(II) salts with an aqueous base leads to the formation of tin(II) oxyhydroxide (Sn6O4(OH)4), the structure of which comprises discrete Sn6O4(OH)4 clusters. In Sn6O4(OH)4 clusters, the six tin atoms form an octahedral array with alternate faces of the octahedron occupied by an oxide or hydroxide moiety, each bonded in a µ3-binding mode to three tin atoms. Crystal structures have been reported for compounds with the formula Sn6O4(OR)4, where R is an alkoxide such as a methyl or ethyl group.
Recently, it was demonstrated that anionic tin(II) clusters [Sn6O8]4- may form the close packed arrays as in the case of α-Sn6SiO8, which adopts the zinc blende structure, comprising a face-centred-cubic array of [Sn6O8]4- clusters with Si4+ occupying half of the tetrahedral holes. A polymorph, β-Sn6SiO8, has been identified as a product of pewter corrosion in aqueous conditions, and is a structural analogue of wurtzite.
Electron counting in octahedral halide and chalcogenide clusters
The species Mo6Cl142− feature Mo(II) (d4) centers. Six Mo(II) centers gives rise to a total of 24 valence electrons, or 2e/Mo-Mo vector. More electron-deficient derivatives such as Ta6Cl184− have fewer d-electrons. For example, the naked cluster Ta614+, the core of Ta6Cl184− would have 5(6) - 14 = 16 valence electrons. Fewer d-electrons result in weakened M-M bonding and the extended Ta---Ta distances accommodate doubly bridging halides.
Other classes of octahedral clusters
In the area of metal carbonyl clusters, a prototypical octahedral cluster is [Fe6C(CO)16]2−, which is obtained by heating iron pentacarbonyl with sodium. Some of the CO ligands are bridging and many are terminal. A carbide ligand resides at the center of the cluster. A variety of analogous compounds have been reported where some or all of the Fe centres are replaced by Ru, Mn and other metals.
Outside of carbonyl clusters, gold forms octahedral clusters.

In the field of fluid dynamics, a convection cell is the phenomenon that occurs when density differences exist within a body of liquid or gas. These density differences result in rising and/or falling currents, which are the key characteristics of a convection cell. When a volume of fluid is heated, it expands and becomes less dense and thus more buoyant than the surrounding fluid. The colder, denser part of the fluid descends to settle below the warmer, less-dense fluid, and this causes the warmer fluid to rise. Such movement is called convection, and the moving body of liquid is referred to as a convection cell. This particular type of convection, where a horizontal layer of fluid is heated from below, is known as Rayleigh–Bénard convection. Convection usually requires a gravitational field, but in microgravity experiments, thermal convection has been observed without gravitational effects.
Fluids are generalized as materials that exhibit the property of flow; however, this behavior is not unique to liquids. Fluid properties can also be observed in gases and even in particulate solids (such as sand, gravel, and larger objects during rock slides).
A convection cell is most notable in the formation of clouds with its release and transportation of energy. As air moves along the ground it absorbs heat, loses density and moves up into the atmosphere. When it is forced into the atmosphere, which has a lower air pressure, it cannot contain as much fluid as at a lower altitude, so it releases its moist air, producing rain. In this process the warm air is cooled; it gains density and falls towards the earth and the cell repeats the cycle.
Convection cells can form in any fluid, including the Earth's atmosphere (where they are called Hadley cells), boiling water, soup (where the cells can be identified by the particles they transport, such as grains of rice), the ocean, or the surface of the Sun. The size of convection cells is largely determined by the fluid's properties. Convection cells can even occur when the heating of a fluid is uniform.
Process
A rising body of fluid typically loses heat when it encounters a cold surface when it exchanges heat with colder liquid through direct exchange, or in the example of the Earth's atmosphere, when it radiates heat. At some point, the fluid becomes denser than the fluid beneath it, which is still rising. Since it cannot descend through the rising fluid, it moves to one side. At some distance, its downward force overcomes the rising force beneath it, and the fluid begins to descend. As it descends, it warms again through surface contact or conductivity and the cycle repeats.
Within the Earth's troposphere
Thunderstorms
Warm air has a lower density than cool air, so warm air rises within cooler air, similar to hot air balloons. Clouds form as relatively warmer air carrying moisture rises within cooler air. As the moist air rises, it cools, causing some of the water vapor in the rising packet of air to condense. When the moisture condenses, it releases energy known as the latent heat of vaporisation, which allows the rising packet of air to cool less than its surrounding air, continuing the cloud's ascension. If enough instability is present in the atmosphere, this process will continue long enough for cumulonimbus clouds to form, which support lightning and thunder. Generally, thunderstorms require three conditions to form: moisture, an unstable air mass, and a lifting force (heat).
All thunderstorms, regardless of type, go through three stages: a 'developing stage', a 'mature stage', and a 'dissipating stage'. The average thunderstorm has a diameter. Depending on the conditions present in the atmosphere, these three stages take an average of 30 minutes to go through.
Adiabatic processes
Heating caused by the compression of descending air is responsible for such winter phenomena as the chinook (as it is known in western North America) or the Föhn (in the Alps).
Within the Sun
The Sun's photosphere is composed of convection cells called granules, which are rising columns of superheated (5,800 °C) plasma averaging about 1,000 kilometres in diameter. The plasma cools as it rises and descends in the narrow spaces between the granules.

Aspirin causes several different effects in the body, mainly the reduction of inflammation, analgesia (relief of pain), the prevention of clotting, and the reduction of fever. Much of this is believed to be due to decreased production of prostaglandins and TXA2. Aspirin's ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its irreversible inactivation of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme. Cyclooxygenase is required for prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis. Aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an acetyl group is covalently attached to a serine residue in the active site of the COX enzyme. This makes aspirin different from other NSAIDs (such as diclofenac and ibuprofen), which are reversible inhibitors. However, other effects of aspirin, such as uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria, and the modulation of signaling through NF-κB, are also being investigated. Some of its effects are like those of salicylic acid, which is not an acetylating agent.
Effects on cyclooxygenase
There are at least two different cyclooxygenase isozymes: COX-1 (PTGS1) and COX-2 (PTGS2). Aspirin is non-selective and irreversibly inhibits both forms (but is weakly more selective for COX-1). It does so by acetylating the hydroxyl of a serine residue. Normally COX produces prostaglandins, most of which are pro-inflammatory, and thromboxanes, which promote clotting. Aspirin-modified COX-2 produces lipoxins, most of which are anti-inflammatory.
Newer NSAID drugs called COX-2 selective inhibitors have been developed that inhibit only COX-2, with the hope for reduction of gastrointestinal side-effects. However, several COX-2 selective inhibitors have subsequently been withdrawn after evidence emerged that COX-2 inhibitors increase the risk of heart attack (e.g., see the article on Vioxx). The underlying mechanism for the deleterious effect proposes that endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body express COX-2, whose selective inhibition results in levels of prostaglandin I2 (PGI2, prostacyclin) down-regulated relative to thromboxane (since COX-1 in platelets is unaffected). Thus, the protective anti-coagulative effect of PGI2 is decreased, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. As platelets have no DNA, they are unable to synthesize new COX once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference between aspirin and the reversible inhibitors.
Effects on prostaglandins and thromboxanes
Prostaglandins are local chemical messengers that exert multiple effects including but not limited to the transmission of pain information to the brain, modulation of the hypothalamic thermostat, and inflammation. They are produced in response to the stimulation of phospholipids within the plasma membrane of cells resulting in the release of arachidonic acid (prostaglandin precursor).
Thromboxanes are responsible for the aggregation of platelets that form blood clots.
Low-dose, long-term aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of thromboxane A2 in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation.
This antiplatelet property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks; heart attacks are primarily caused by blood clots, and their reduction with the introduction of small amounts of aspirin has been seen to be an effective medical intervention. A dose of 40 mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane A2 release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.
A side-effect of aspirin mechanism is that the ability of the blood in general to clot is reduced, and excessive bleeding may result from the use of aspirin.
Other methods of action
Aspirin has been shown to have three additional modes of action. It uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria, by diffusing from the intermembrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix, where it ionizes once again to release protons. In short, aspirin buffers and transports the protons, acting as a competitor to ATP synthase. When high doses of aspirin are given, aspirin may actually cause hyperthermia due to the heat released from the electron transport chain, as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses.
Additionally, aspirin induces the formation of NO-radicals in the body, which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation. This reduces leukocyte adhesion, which is an important step in immune response to infection. There is currently insufficient evidence to show that aspirin helps to fight infection.
More recent data also suggests that salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signaling through NF-κB. NF-κB is a transcription factor complex that plays a central role in many biological processes, including inflammation.
Reye's syndrome
Reye's syndrome is a potentially fatal disease that causes numerous detrimental effects to many organs, especially the brain and liver, as well as causing hypoglycemia. The exact cause is unknown, and while it has been associated with aspirin consumption by children with viral illness, it also occurs in the absence of aspirin use.
The disease causes fatty liver with minimal inflammation and severe encephalopathy (with swelling of the brain). The liver may become slightly enlarged and firm, and there is a change in the appearance of the kidneys. Jaundice is not usually present.
Early diagnosis is vital; while most children recover with supportive therapy, severe brain injury or death are potential complications.

A cocktail onion is usually a pearl onion pickled in a brine with small amounts of turmeric and paprika. Pearl onions are naturally sweet, which makes them an excellent pairing with many cocktails. Other sweet onions such as the crystal wax, also known as the white Bermuda, are also sometimes used. In many cases, white varieties of these sweet onions are used, since many consumers expect cocktail onions to be white. However, yellow or red sweet onions may be used as well. In northern California cuisine some haute bars may use sliced red onion pickled in vinegar. Some recipes also call for the onions to be packed in white vermouth as well as vinegar.
Generally, the onion retains a slightly crunchy texture through the brining process, which can add a different mouthfeel to the drinking experience. Since the cocktail onion is made from a sweet onion, it is unlikely to upset the digestion with a sulfurous or eye-watering taste, although some cultures use more pungent onions as cocktail garnishes.
Use as a garnish
While not as widely used as more common garnishes such as olives or lemon twists, the cocktail onion is the signature garnish of the Gibson, which consists of a standard Martini garnished with a cocktail onion instead of the standard olive.

Brachiation (from "brachium", Latin for "arm"), or arm swinging, is a form of arboreal locomotion in which primates swing from tree limb to tree limb using only their arms. During brachiation, the body is alternately supported under each forelimb. This form of locomotion is the primary means of locomotion for the small gibbons and siamangs of southeast Asia. Gibbons in particular use brachiation for as much as 80% of their locomotor activities. Some New World monkeys, such as spider monkeys and muriquis, were initially classified as semibrachiators and move through the trees with a combination of leaping and brachiation. Some New World species also practice suspensory behaviors by using their prehensile tail, which acts as a fifth grasping hand. Evidence has shown that the extinct ape Proconsul from the Miocene of East Africa developed an early form of suspensory behaviour, and was therefore referred to as a probrachiator.
Upon further observations and more in depth understandings of the anatomy and behaviour of primates, the terms semibrachiator and probrachiator have largely fallen out of favour within the scientific community. Currently, researchers classify gibbons and siamangs as the only true brachiators and classify the great apes as modified brachiators. All other brachiation behaviours that do not meet either of these classifications are referred to as forearm suspensory postures and locomotion.
Some traits that allow primates to brachiate include a short spine (particularity the lumbar spine), short fingernails (instead of claws), long curved fingers, reduced thumbs, long forelimbs and freely rotating wrists. Modern humans retain many physical characteristics that suggest a brachiator ancestor, including flexible shoulder joints and fingers well-suited for grasping. In lesser apes, these characteristics were adaptations for brachiation. Although great apes do not normally brachiate (with the exception of orangutans), human anatomy suggests that brachiation may be an exaptation to bipedalism, and healthy modern humans are still capable of brachiating. Some children's parks include monkey bars which children play on by brachiating.
As well as shaping the evolution of gibbon body structure, brachiation has influenced the style and order of their behaviour. For example, unlike other primates who carry infants on their back, gibbons will carry young ventrally. It also affects their play activities, copulation, and fighting. It is thought that gibbons gain evolutionary advantages through brachiation and being suspended by both hands (bimanual suspension) when feeding. While smaller primates cannot hold themselves by both hands for long periods, and larger primates are too heavy to exploit food resources on the ends of branches, gibbons can remain suspended for a significant period and use their long arms to reach food in terminal branches more easily. Another theory postulates that brachiation is a quieter and less obvious mode of locomotion than quadrupedal jumping and climbing thereby more successfully avoiding predators.
Types of brachiation
Continuous contact
This form of brachiation occurs when the primate is moving at slower speeds and is characterized by the animal maintaining constant contact with a handhold, such as a tree branch. This gait type utilizes the passive exchange between two types of energy, gravitational potential and translational kinetic, to propel the animal forward at a low mechanical cost. This mode of brachiation has been compared to the movement patterns of bipedal walking in humans.
Ricochetal
This type of brachiation is used by primates to move at faster speeds and is characterized by a flight phase between each contact with a handhold. Ricochetal brachiation uses an exchange of translational and rotational kinetic energy to move forward, and is compared to a "whip-like" motion. Due to its aerial phase, ricochetal brachiation is similar to bipedal running in humans.
Models of brachiation
Pendulum movement
Continuous contact brachiation has often been compared to the movement of a simple pendulum. This is due to the out-of-phase fluctuation of energy that occurs while the moving primate is swinging between each tree appendage as the energy transfers from potential to kinetic, and vice versa. The use of gravitational acceleration to effect movement can be found in both the brachiating primate and the moving ball in a pendulum model. A brachiator can make use of this momentum in several different ways: during the downswing the primate can maximize its change in kinetic energy, during the upswing it can minimize loss of kinetic energy or it can avoid moving laterally during its upward swing. Brachiating primates have adapted these three strategies for maximizing forward movement by adjusting its posture during each swing.
The amount of energy transferred from potential to kinetic during pendulum-like movement is known as energy recovery. Maintaining a higher energy recovery during brachiation costs less energy and allows the animal to move to its destination quickly, however, this type of movement is also harder to control. Therefore, since the risk of missing a handhold can result in injury or death, the benefit of moving slower with a lower energy recovery and more control likely outweighs the cost of extra energy expenditure.
Evolution of brachiation
Brachiation originated in Africa, thirteen million years ago. The emergence of bigger primates that learn to move hanging around by branches obliges the new generations to make some corporal changes that have lasted until today, in many species, including the humans.
Specialized locomotor behaviours, such as brachiating, are thought to have evolved from arboreal quadrupedalism. This behaviour is the ancestral and most common locomotor mechanism among primates. This would explain why living apes and humans share many unusual morphological aspects of the upper limb and thorax. The transition to brachiation is regarded as a major shift during primate evolution and is thought to be a possible precursor to the adaptation of bipedal walking in early hominids. Specialized suspensory behaviour was shown to have evolved independently between hominid groups.
There are several hypotheses for how early brachiating primates may have transitioned into bipedalism. The most generally accepted of these is the vertical climbing hypothesis, which states that vertical climbing is the biomechanical link between brachiation and bipedalism. Many climbing adaptations have been found in early hominins and some of these adaptations can still be seen in present day humans. The distinctive body posture, limb proportions and trunk design identified in living apes are better explained by the previous adaptation of climbing behaviours.

Bartlett Lee "Bart" Thane (August 26, 1877 – November 7, 1927) was an American mining engineer who pioneered hydroelectric power in Juneau, Alaska. The world's first thin arch dam, Salmon Creek Dam, was constructed by Thane.
Early years
Thane was born in Oakland, California, USA, in August 1877. Their parents were Joseph E. Thane and Laura E. Thane. Their father was a well-known orchardist from Niles, California. Their maternal grandfather was Judge Harmon J. Tilden. Thane's sister was named Laura. They attended the University of California, Berkeley, where they graduated with a degree in mining engineering in 1899. While attending the university, they played college football and was the quarterback of the 1898 California Golden Bears football team that defeated Stanford in the "Big Game" for the first time by a score of 22 to 0. They were also a member of Skull and Keys and Kappa Alpha Order at Cal.
Career
Thane first came to Alaska in 1897. They were hired by Herman T. Tripp to work at the Sumdum Chief Mine south of Juneau. They were the first superintendent of the Eagle River Mining Company (1903-1910), before becoming Managing Director of the Alaska-Gastineau Mining Company. By 1911, they had controlling interest in six Juneau area gold mines. In 1912, they took control of the Perseverance Mine and developed it into the world's largest. With the assistance of their former college football friends, Thane constructed Salmon Creek Dam, the world's first thin arch dam, in 1914.
In 1915, Thane and other mining and business executives established Juneau's first golf course, in the Mendenhall Valley. Between 1918 and 1919, Thane quit the Alaska-Gastineau Mining Company, moved to San Francisco, and then returned to the Alaska-Gastineau Mining Company. In 1921, after the Alaska-Gastineau Mine shut down, Thane attempted to develop their facilities for a new pulp mill, but a deal with Japanese investors failed in 1923.
Personal life
In June 1902, Thane married Juliet Fay Blaine (born March 27, 1879) at Berkeley, California. They lived in what was to become the Wickersham State Historic Site on Chicken Ridge in Juneau during the period of 1914-1916, along with their daughter, also named Juliet Fay Thane (born August 2, 1906 in Juneau). Thane's sister Laura married James R. Whipple who became a business associate of Thane's.
In a Draft Registration Card completed in September 1918, Thane listed their permanent address as the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco. They identified themselves as a mining engineer with an office at San Francisco's Crocker Building. Also, in a 1923 passport application submitted of a trip to Japan, Korea, China and Australia, Thane listed San Francisco as their permanent residence. Thane died in New York City in 1927. Thane, Alaska, and Thane Road, on the Gastineau Channel, were named in their honor.

The post-graduate diploma in management studies, post-nominal letters DMS, is a university management qualification in the United Kingdom.
History
Early structure
The post-graduate qualification was originally accredited by the DMS Committee of the DES. It originally required either one year full-time or 3 years part-time study, and was arranged in two discrete sections: Part A and Part B. It was compulsory to pass the Part A examinations and assessment first before being allowed to take Part B. Part B consisted of the final examinations and a project dissertation. Overall the marks achieved in coursework, examinations and the final dissertation had to exceed a weighted threshold for the candidate to pass and be awarded a DMS. It was thus quite an intensive course with a large workload. If a candidate achieved 90% or above, they were awarded a Distinction.
Entry requirements
Normally a bachelor's degree or extensive managerial experience and/or other professional qualifications. Originally there was also a lower age limit for entry of 35 years old, but this requirement was subsequently dropped as managers above that age found that the qualification had no value in achieving employment or promotion above 35.
Accreditation
Initially in the UK the qualification was accredited by the DMS committee of the DES, and later by the Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA). It was originally accepted by the BIM as its core qualification for admission as a full member. The BIM subsequently was renamed to the Institute of Management when combining with the Institute of Industrial Managers, and now has again been renamed to become the Chartered Management Institute.
Assessment
The assessment for the few DMS courses which are still run in the UK is now almost without any formal examinations being required to be passed. It is thus subjectively awarded on the basis of course performance only, according to the opinion of the academic staff responsible.
Controversy
It has been argued by some that the move away from mainly or wholly exam assessed courses has lessened the 'value of the qualification' however the change from exams to coursework, projects and assignments is fairly in keeping with most postgraduate UK qualifications, although some exams are normally required.
Recognition
The DMS is accepted by the CMI as part of the required qualification for chartered manager.

Laurel Goodwin (August 11, 1942 – February 25, 2022) was an American film and television actor who is best known for their role as the love interest of Elvis Presley in the 1962 film Girls! Girls! Girls!, as well appearing as Yeoman J.M. Colt in the rejected Star Trek pilot episode.
Life and career
Goodwin was born in Wichita, Kansas, on August 11, 1942. They later moved with their family to San Diego, and then San Francisco.
A child model, Goodwin made their screen debut as the love interest of Elvis Presley in the film, Girls! Girls! Girls! (1962).
They were a co-star in the Paramount comedy Papa's Delicate Condition (1963), playing Augusta Griffith, the daughter of Jack (Jackie Gleason) and Amberlyn Griffith. They also appeared in the western films Stage to Thunder Rock (1964), Law of the Lawless (1964) and The Glory Guys (1965).
Them work as a guest actor on several drama television series, included a role as Yeoman J. M. Colt in the 1964-Star Trek pilot episode, "The Cage" (from which scenes featuring Goodwin were later incorporated into the episode "The Menagerie"),, and Mannix ("A Question Of Midnight").
They also played roles in some comedy series. These included the role of Phoebe, the Chief's niece, in the TV comedy Get Smart and the role of Stella in two episodes of The Beverly Hillbillies ("Robin Hood and the Sheriff" and "Robin Hood of Griffith Park") (both 1967).
After retiring from acting in 1971, Goodwin pursued a career in home nursing for over 35 years. When their husband became ill, they began taking care of them full-time until they died about a year and a half later.
Goodwin died in Cathedral City, California, on February 25, 2022, at the age of 79.

Platform as a service (PaaS) or application platform as a service (aPaaS) or platform-based service is a category of cloud computing services that allows customers to provision, instantiate, run, and manage a modular bundle comprising a computing platform and one or more applications, without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching the application(s); and to allow developers to create, develop, and package such software bundles.
Development and uses
PaaS can be delivered in three ways:
As a public cloud service from a provider, where the consumer controls software deployment with minimal configuration options, and the provider provides the networks, servers, storage, operating system (OS), middleware (e.g. Java runtime, .NET runtime, integration, etc.), database and other services to host the consumer's application.
As a private service (software or appliance) behind a firewall.
As software deployed on public infrastructure as a service.
The first public platform as a service was Zimki, launched by Fotango, a London-based company owned by Canon Europe. It was developed in 2005, had a beta launch in March 2006 and a public launch at EuroOSCON in 2006.
At the time of its closure, Zimki had several thousand developer accounts. It had demonstrated the technical viability of Platform as a Service, but also provided the first example of the perils of being dependent on a single provider. This was highlighted when the CEO (Simon Wardley, known for Wardley maps) announced at OSCON 2007 that Zimki would no longer be open-sourced and discussed the future of what was then called framework-as-a-service (later called platform-as-a-service) covering the importance of a market of providers based on an open-source reference model.
The original intent of PaaS was to simplify the writing of code, with the infrastructure and operations handled by the PaaS provider. Originally, all PaaSes were in the public cloud. Because many companies did not want to have everything in the public cloud, private and hybrid PaaS options (managed by internal IT departments) were created.
PaaS provides an environment for developers and companies to create, host and deploy applications, saving developers from the complexities of infrastructure (setting up, configuring and managing elements such as servers and databases). PaaS can improve the speed of developing an app, and allow its user to focus on the application itself. With PaaS, the customer manages applications and data, while the provider (in public PaaS) or IT department (in private PaaS) manages runtime, middleware, operating system, virtualization, servers, storage and networking. Development tools provided by the vendor are customized according to the needs of the user. The user can choose to maintain the software, or have the vendor maintain it.
PaaS offerings may also include facilities for application design, application development, testing and deployment, as well as services such as team collaboration, web service integration, and marshalling, database integration, security, scalability, storage, persistence, state management, application versioning, application instrumentation, and developer community facilitation. Besides the service engineering aspects, PaaS offerings include mechanisms for service management, such as monitoring, workflow management, discovery and reservation.
Advantages and disadvantages
The advantages of PaaS are primarily that it allows for higher-level programming with dramatically reduced complexity; the overall development of the application can be more effective, as it has built-in/self up-and-down ramping infrastructure resources; and maintenance and enhancement of the application is thus easier.
Disadvantages of various PaaS providers as cited by their users include increased pricing at larger scales, lack of operational features, reduced control, and the difficulties of traffic routing systems.
Types
Public, private and hybrid
There are several types of PaaS, including public, private and hybrid. PaaS was originally intended for applications on public cloud services, before expanding to include private and hybrid options.
Public PaaS is derived from software as a service (SaaS), and is situated in cloud computing between SaaS and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). SaaS is software hosted in the cloud so that it does not take up hard drive space on the computers of users. IaaS provides virtual hardware from a provider with adjustable scalability. With IaaS, the user still has to manage the server, whereas with PaaS the server management is done by the provider.
A private PaaS can typically be downloaded and installed either in a company's on-premises data center, or in a public cloud. Once the software is installed on one or more machines, the private PaaS arranges the application and database components into a single hosting platform.
Hybrid PaaS is typically a deployment consisting of a mix of public and private deployments.
Communications platform as a service
A communications platform as a service (CPaaS) is a cloud-based platform that enables developers to add real-time communications features (voice, video, and messaging) in their own applications without building back-end infrastructure and interfaces. Also, CPaaS and hardware and software specifications are specifically designed to support (tele)communications applications. These applications and their usage are much more sensitive to jitter, latency and packet losses. Hosted PBX, cellular networks, (near real-time) applications typically are deployed on CPaaS platforms.
Mobile platform as a service
Initiated in 2012, mobile PaaS (mPaaS) provides development capabilities for mobile app designers and developers. The Yankee Group identified mPaaS as one of its themes for 2014.
Open PaaS
Open PaaS does not include hosting but provides open-source software allowing a PaaS provider to run applications in an open-source environment, such as Google App Engine. Some open platforms let the developer use any programming language, database, operating system or server to deploy their applications.
Providers
There are various types of PaaS providers. All offer application hosting and a deployment environment, along with various integrated services. Services offer varying levels of scalability and maintenance. Developers can write an application and upload it to a PaaS that supports their software language of choice, and the application runs on that PaaS.

Tim Key. With a String Quartet. On a Boat. is a comedic poetry album written by and starring Tim Key and co-starring Tom Basden. The album is intended to be Key reading out their poems with the accompaniment of a string quartet, but actually it primarily features Key and Basden, who is nicknamed "Lord", constantly arguing with each other.
Plot
As the title of the album suggests, Key is on a recording studio based on a boat in the East End of London.  They are reading out their comic poems to music provided by a string quartet. Later during the recording Basden appears, unaware that Key had booked a string quartet and under the belief that they were to provide the music for the album with their guitar.
Each track in the album consists of one poem read by Key, except for the track "Lord's Moment" which consists of Basden playing a song on their guitar. Many of the poems are very short, consisting of just four words and some tracks lasting less than a quarter of a minute. However, most of the album consists of Key and Basden arguing. For example, Key tells them they cannot have a coke if they are playing the harmonica. At the end of "Jet Walsh", Key puts Basden's guitar case between Basden and the women in the quartet for fear Basden is getting too close to them. The reference incorrectly states that it is a viola case that is used as the barrier.
Production
The album was created the year following Key's victory at the Edinburgh Comedy Awards in 2009 where they won the main prize for their show The Slutcracker. In 2010, Key decided they were not going to do a new show so this left them a gap in which they could do new work. Their management, The Invisible Dot, suggested creating an album. Key said in an interview with The Daily Telegraph: "It was the first thing I've done where I have had no idea whether it is viable or not. There was an awkward clash of styles, between a string quartet that are used to doing concerts, working with professionals and me just sitting there with scraps of paper, just saying: 'OK, can you do a bit more of your classical music, and I'll do my poems.' It is a very peculiar sell I think." Key told the BBC that they had never performed with a string quartet before the making of the album.
Joe Daniel, the co-founder of the Angular Recording Corporation which made the album said that: "It isn't a 'live' album of a stand-up [show]. The material was put together specifically for the record, and in that respect it is like that quaintly English format, the radio play."
The album was released only as a digital download and as 1,000 limited edition vinyl records.
Reception
Reviews of the album have been mainly positive. Steve Bennett of Chortle said, "his unique persona is warmly compelling, and their imaginative word-pictures are ideally suited to an audio release. In the end, the gently brittle journey Key takes you on is as modestly beautiful as it is charmingly disconcerting."
Tim Burrows of The Daily Telegraph said that the album, "is closest in spirit to Peter Cook and Dudley Moore's brilliantly foulmouthed project, Derek and Clive, which first saw the light of day in 1976." However, Ian Wolf of the British Comedy Guide disagreed saying: "I think that is taking it a bit too far. For starters it is not nearly as rude (although 'Chess' does feature the c-word) and Key's album is not as laugh-out-loud funny as the genius of Pete and Dud."
Wolf, however, also said, "the poems are funny no matter what the length" and that, "There are many moments of mirth and it is a worthwhile listen."
Sam Walby of Drowned in Sound did have criticisms saying, "that Key is sometimes too deadpan for their own good, making their one-line pieces a little stilted. A case in point is the three poems about Bob ('Bob And The Pipe', 'Bob And The Octopus' and 'The Tragedy of Bob'), which might work on stage but do not transfer as well onto tape." However, they did say: "At points it drags, but Tim Key. With A String Quartet. On A Boat. is as good an introduction as any to Key's off-kilter insanity and love of everyday nonsense."

Paper Trail is the sixth studio album by American hip hop recording artist T.I., released September 26, 2008, on Grand Hustle Records and Atlantic Records. They began to write songs for the album as they awaited trial for federal weapons and possession charges. Unlike their past albums, they wrote their lyrics down on paper, which they had not done since their debut album, I'm Serious (2001).
The album features guest appearances from rappers Jay-Z, Kanye West, Lil Wayne and Ludacris, along with singers Rihanna, Justin Timberlake, Usher and John Legend, among others. The production on the album was handled by several high-profile record producers, including Nard & B, Rob Knox, Danja, The Runners, Toomp, Drumma Boy, Kanye West, Lil' C, Polow da Don, Jim Jonsin, Just Blaze, Eminem, J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League, Timbaland, Tha Bizness, Khao, Swizz Beatz, Blac Elvis and more.
The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling 568,000 copies in its first week, becoming T.I.'s highest debut sales to date, and the fourth highest debut of the year. The album was eventually certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It received generally favorable reviews from critics, and is T.I.'s most successful to date. The album spawned eight singles, four of which reached the top five of the Billboard Hot 100, with two singles peaking at number one.
Background and recording
On November 12, 2007, while awaiting a trial for federal weapons charges, T.I. announced they had been writing songs for a new album to be entitled Paper Trail. They wrote their lyrics down on paper, which they had not done since their debut album, I'm Serious. The album highlights their "fear, anger and guilt" as they awaited trial.
T.I. recorded nearly 100 tracks during the production for Paper Trail, including a collaboration with Fall Out Boy on a track entitled "Out in the Cold". However the song was left out of the final cut, but T.I. told MTV that they may add some of the cut tracks to their next album. On August 22, 2008, the songs "Like I Do" featuring The-Dream, "Let My Beat Pound", "My Life Your Entertainment" featuring Usher, and "Swagga Like Us" were all leaked online.
The album was scheduled to be released in September 2008, but was subsequently moved up to an August 12 after the release of the promotional and lead single "No Matter What" and high demand of the album. At the time, T.I. said that the first single may have been "Top of the World", originally featuring B.o.B and Kanye West, explaining that the song was "a reflective song about our humble beginnings and how far we've come". The album was pushed back for a release date of September 2, then September 9 and to its final release date of September 30, 2008, in the US. The album was first released on September 29, 2008, in continental Europe.
Promotion
The first single released from the album was a song titled "No Matter What". It was posted on StreetCred's website on April 29, 2008, as a promotional recording, then released as a single on May 6, along with a music video, which they premiered on MTV's FNMTV. The song narrates T.I. rising above their misfortunes, including a prison sentence for weapon charges.
On August 19, 2008, the album's lead single "Whatever You Like", was made available for digital download. The song reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 on September 6, 2008, and set a new record for biggest one-week jump to the top position, going from number seventy-one to number one, becoming their first number one song on the chart as a lead artist and best opening-week sales by a rap track since Nielsen SoundScan began compiling download data in 2003. T.I. announced that they were "ecstatic" and "overjoyed" after setting a record for the biggest jump to top of the Billboard Hot 100.
After the success of "Whatever You Like", iTunes published the release dates for the upcoming singles, "Swing Ya Rag" on August 26, "What Up, What's Haapnin'" on September 2, and "Ready for Whatever" on September 23, 2008. Additionally, a song titled "Swagga Like Us", featuring T.I., Jay-Z, Lil Wayne and Kanye West - which samples "Paper Planes" by M.I.A. - was then released as a single on September 4, for Paper Trail and debuted in the Hot 100 at number five.
The album's seventh single, "Live Your Life" featuring Rihanna, broke T.I's own record for biggest leap to number one, when it jumped from number eighty to number one on the Hot 100, giving T.I. their second Hot 100 number one as a lead artist, and Rihanna their fifth overall. The song also set a first week digital record, when it sold 334,000 digital downloads in its first week of availability, a record that was previously held by Mariah Carey's "Touch My Body."
The eighth single was confirmed to be "Dead and Gone" featuring Justin Timberlake, by the song's co-producer Rob Knox. T.I. themselves later confirmed the release of the single. The song was charted by Billboard before the announcement of the single. The song reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 on February 27, 2009. Overall, eight songs from the album charted on the Billboard Hot 100, including "56 Bars (Intro)", "I'm Illy" and "My Life Your Entertainment", despite not being singles. A music video was released for the song "Slide Show" which highlighted a photo collage that followed T.I.'s career as a recording artist. The track "Every Chance I Get" was featured on the promotional trailer for Armored starring Columbus Short.
Critical reception
Paper Trail received positive reviews from most music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 74, based on 19 reviews, which indicates "generally favorable reviews". Several critics praised the production on the album; Andy Kellman of AllMusic noted that DJ Toomp's and Danja's production appearance provided "some much-needed punch", which placed the album above T.I.'s previous album, T.I. vs. T.I.P.. Margeaux Watson of Entertainment Weekly said that the "outstanding production" proved that T.I. "still knows how to have a good time". Wilson McBee of Slant Magazine called the songs produced by Toomp the "vintage T.I.", describing the sound as "ecstasies of sweltering synth lines, ground-shaking 808 patterns and breathless verbalizing". However, McBee felt that the songs that were directly about T.I.'s prison sentence for weapons charges ("No Matter What", "Ready for Whatever") were among the weakest on the album, saying that "admitting guilt, making excuses and expressing no regrets falls flat". Sharing a similar sentiment, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone called the songs "mostly dispenses with the Tupac-wannabe gangsta-confessor pretensions to deliver catchy, tight, bombastic pop-rap alongside a who's-who of megastar guests", saying that T.I. was a "well-oiled hit machine who's more fun than deep".
Newsdays Glen Gamboa gave Paper Trail a B rating and commented that "[T.I.] is still bouncing between pop-leaning hip-hop anthems [...] and spare, often violent, tales of crime and brutality". Michael Saba of Paste said that, "Even with the burden of sloppy crossover tracks, Paper Trail has enough standout moments for T.I.'s throne to remain secure for now." Shannon Barbour of About.com said that, "Regardless of the outcome of reality, Paper Trail is a solid combination of rhyme, repentance, swagger and substance." People magazine gave the album four out of four stars, saying that the album was "a near-perfect hip-hop album for 2008." In their consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau called Paper Trail an "expediently excessive piece of rich-get-richer" and gave it an A− rating, indicating "the kind of garden-variety good record that is the great luxury of musical micromarketing and overproduction. Anyone open to its aesthetic will enjoy more than half its tracks".
Commercial performance
According to Nielsen SoundScan, Paper Trail sold 357,000 copies in the United States in the first three days of its release. Ultimately, the album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 568,000 copies in its first week. This became T.I.'s third consecutive US number one debut and the fourth highest debut of 2008. In its second week, the album remained at number one on the chart, selling an additional 177,000 copies. In its third week, the album dropped to number two on the chart, selling 131,000 more copies. In its fourth week, the album dropped to number three, selling 93,427 copies. The album ended up spending a total of 55 weeks on the chart. On August 26, 2009, the album was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of over two million copies.

Pierre-Hubert Nysten (30 October 1771 – 3 March 1818) was a French physiologist and pediatrician who was a native of Liège.
Biography
They studied medicine in Paris, and eventually became a professor at the École de Médecine in Paris. Shortly before their death, they attained the position of médecin-chef at the Hospice des Enfants Assistés (children's hospital) in Paris.
With Xavier Bichat (1771–1802), Nysten performed pioneer experiments in cardiology, including studies involving the effects of galvanic current on the heart. In 1805 they studied silkworm diseases in southern France, and provided an early description of polyhedrosis. They also described symptoms associated with albuminuria, and in 1811 provided a scientific description of rigor mortis. The eponymous "Nysten's Law" defines the progressive states of cadaveric rigidity during rigor mortis.
Written works
In 1810 with Joseph Capuron (1767–1850), they published the second edition of the Nouveau dictionnaire de médecine, de chirurgie, de physique, de chimie et d'histoire naturelle, and in 1814 Nysten published a revised edition of the dictionary. They were also the author of the following:
Nouvelles expériences galvaniques, faites sur les organes musculaires de l'homme et des animaux à sang rouge etc. Paris and Strasbourg, Levraux frères, 1803 – New galvanic experiments on muscular organs of humans and red-blooded animals.
Recherches sur les maladies des vers à soie et les moyens de les prévenir etc. Paris, 1808. – Research on diseases of silkworms and means of prevention.
Recherches de physiologie et de chimie pathologiques : pour faire suite à celles de Bichat sur la vie et la mort, 1811.
Mémoire sur la roideur cadavérique qui survient aux corps de l'homme et des animaux après la mort, 1812 – On cadaverous rigidity that occurs in the body of man and animals after death.

Vethagiri also reveals that Sengodan is a murderer.
Vendhan and Amudhan decide to collect more details about Ambuli. So, they visit many people in the village and enquire about Ambuli. During that time, and ther much research flim moves to Sir Arthur Wellington (fictional character).
Sir Arthur Wellington is not only the founder of their self-named college in the southern parts of India but also a scientist who worked with the British army during World War II. After their retirement, they began the college in South India. Their longtime goal is to successfully carry out and finish their project, which is to create humans who can healthily live for 150 years. They decide to use Ponni as their test subject and injects the Neanderthal DNA that they have collected back in their home country into their womb. This starts having an impact on Ambuli. Wellington dopes them with strong sedatives so that they visit them often for checkups and they can carry out their tests without any problems. As they reach their due date, they are affected too much by the sedatives and starts heading to Wellington's laboratory to get themselves checked. That day turns out to be the solar eclipse, and unfortunately, they are affected by the radiation from the eclipse. This causes a big change in their womb, and thus, Ambuli is born as a beast. Seemati, who checked their pregnancy and is terrified by the looks and behavior of Ambuli, tells Ponni to kill Ambuli. But they let Ambuli escape and commits suicide out of humiliation. Angered by this, Sengodan kills Wellington, who is the reason for all this.
Now having collected all details about Ambuli, the men decide that there is no use for anyone to hide from Ambuli, and they must fight against it. Poongavanam and Valarmalai decide to check on Amudhan and Vendhan that night, having been well aware of their investigation on Ambuli. Both the tuition master and landlord discovered their disappearances that night. The landlord accepts the plan, and the villagers decide to set out to hunt and destroy Ambuli for good. Poongavanam somehow gets trapped between thorn bushes in the cornfields but is helped by Sengodan, only for Sengodan to capture and gag them at the cabin. Amudhan and Vendhan arrive to find Sengodan, only to find Poongavanam there, tied up and gagged. Amudhan and Vendhan then reveal Ambuli's location to Poongavanam, only for Sengodan to overhear their conversation and offer to go along with them. While setting out to meet Ambuli, Valarmalai attempts to attack Sengodan upon thinking they got Amudhan, Vendhan, and Poongavanam captives, only to stop by them and ended up joining along with them. They visit the caves at night, and there comes a tall, fierce-looking ape-like creature, which is finally shown and revealed to be Ambuli. As Ambuli tries to attack the group, Sengodan fights it bravely. The villagers also rush to the caves. Suddenly, the army and police arrive there with tranquilizers, having been alerted by the head police officer, who is convinced by Amudhan and Vendhan that Ambuli does exist. After an intense battle in the field between the army, the police, and Ambuli, Ambuli is tranquilized with the help of Sengodan. The army captures Ambuli, and they are taken away in a secured box. Sengodan is heavily injured by Ambuli but manages to survive. They reveal that they wanted to kill and destroy Ambuli right after killing Wellington but was arrested, only to be released years later. When asked by Amudhan and Vendhan on why they killed Gugan and kidnapped Poongavanam, Sengodan revealed that they had mistaken Gugan as Ambuli and they were also trying to save Poongavanam from Ambuli. The villagers finally thank Sengodan, Marudhan, Amudhan and Vendhan for their heroics in capturing Ambuli and thus ending their longtime fear.
As the credits roll out, a final shot is shown which is to happen in Dehradun, where the box in which Ambuli is being carried. The box slowly starts moving a little and cracks suddenly. It is to be understood that Ambuli escapes from the box and sets on their next hunt. The film ends with a line in Tamil, which translates to Ambuli's hunt will continue.

Production
Hari Shankar and Hareesh Narayan, who made their directorial debut with the horror film Orr Eravuu (2010), decided to shoot a mystery thriller based on folklore and superstition. In an interview they stated: "We have taken inspirations from folklore and Ambuli tells the story of a village which is soaked in superstitions. Ambuli means ‘moon' and it is a moon light mystery". The film was promoted as being the "first ever-stereoscopic 3D film in Tamil cinema". The directors further disclosed that the plot revolved around "four youngsters who go in search of a story, the problems they face and how they overcome them", while clarifying that there was no villain in the film. Newcomers R. Ajai, P. S. Srijith,
Sanam and Jothisha Ammu were signed on to enact the lead roles, while Gokulnath, best known from the reality-based dance competition Maanada Mayilada was selected to play the titular character. The filming began on 4 February 2011.
Theatrical Release
Ambuli was released on 17 February 2012 in both polarised and anaglyph 3D formats. In the first week, the film was screened in 100 theatres with polarised format in most of the theatres in Chennai and in anaglyph format outside of Chennai in many theatres not having the facility of polarised 3D which required silver-coated screen and two projectors supposed to be expensive at that time. In the third week, seven theatres from Madurai, Coimbatore, and Trichy agreed and equipped their screens with polarised 3D based on the enormous response from the audience for the film.
Reception
Times of India rated the movie 3.5/5 and Behindwoods rated Ambuli 3/5 calling it between ‘not bad' and ‘good'.
Soundtrack
The soundtrack features eight tracks composed by four music directors, K. Venkat Prabu Shankar, C. S. Sam, Sathish and Mervin Solomon. The album was released at the Kamarajar Stadium on 19 August 2011. A 3D trailer of the film was also showcased at the event.

The Cake Sale is a collective of mostly Irish musical artists including Swedish singer/songwriter Nina Persson of The Cardigans and Australian musician Nick Seymour of Crowded House.
The collective was formed by Brian Crosby formerly of Bell X1. They came together in 2006 to release a self-titled album called The Cake Sale. The album was produced to raise money for the charity Oxfam Ireland and the Ireland Make Trade Fair campaign. It was released on 3 November 2006 in Ireland. The album was so successful that it was given an international release the following year; it was released on 10 September 2007 in the United Kingdom and on 16 October 2007 in the United States by the American indie label Yep Roc Records, which is based in North Carolina.
Album details
The album, The Cake Sale was recorded by a group of Irish and international musicians who were organised by Crosby in 2006 to raise funds for the charity Oxfam Ireland's Make Trade Fair campaign. Proceeds are added to the charity's "unrestricted fund" to support projects in ten African countries, countries such as Tanzania, Malawi, Uganda and Sudan. Crosby has said that the album's success "completely exceeded expectations", with the artists initially hoping it would go gold just to cover their costs. All the publishing royalties raised by the album benefit Oxfam as well, an unusual occurrence for a charity album. Worldwide rights were negotiated and a label, Oxfam Publishing, was established to administer the royalties. Oxfam Ireland had little experience in such dealings and left it to the musicians to negotiate the project. Crosby says the album's success has raised the charity's profile and high sales at home led to it being released digitally in the United Kingdom on 10 September and in the United States on Yep Roc Records on 16 October 2007.
International success
The song "Some Surprise", a duet between singer-songwriter Lisa Hannigan and Snow Patrol frontman Gary Lightbody which was written by Bell X1 frontman Paul Noonan, featured on an episode of the popular prime time U.S. medical drama television series Grey's Anatomy after which it was made available to download on iTunes. The song was also performed live by the duo for the first and only time at the 2008 Meteor Awards. It is the fourth track on The Cake Sale album.

My Secret Life on the McJob: Lessons from Behind the Counter Guaranteed to Supersize Any Management Style is a book by Jerry Newman about low-wage work in fast-food outlets. Newman is a distinguished professor at University at Buffalo (N.Y.) School of Management who has taught business courses for nearly 30 years, and went undercover as a bottom-rung worker for the biggest names in fast food, including McDonald's and Burger King.
Review
The book has had favorable reviews. The Wall Street Journal wrote:
Jerry Newman offers entertaining anecdotes and wonderful descriptions of the personalities working at every station of responsibility. ... Unusual for a business book offering management advice, My Secret Life on the McJob is written from the perspective of a crew member on the receiving end of the boss's expectations rather than from that of a manager who faces the challenges of building a team, running a business and earning a return on investment. ... It offers many lessons that would be helpful to managers in almost every segment of business—or even government.
—Andrew H. Card Jr., President Bush's chief of staff from January 2001 to April 2006; The Wall Street Journal, January 17, 2007.

Addyston Pipe and Steel Co. v. United States, 175 U.S. 211 (1899), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that for a restraint of trade to be lawful, it must be ancillary to the main purpose of a lawful contract. A naked restraint on trade is unlawful; it is not a defense that the restraint is reasonable.
Facts
The defendants were pipemakers who were operating in agreement. When municipalities offered projects available to the lowest bidder, all companies but the one designated would overbid, guaranteeing the success of the designated low bidder if no bidder outside the group submitted a bid.
The government argued that some antitrust violations, such as bid rigging, were such egregious anti-competitive acts that they were always illegal (the so-called "per se" rule). The defendants asserted that it was a reasonable restraint of trade and that the Sherman Act could not have meant to prevent such restraints.
Judgment
Court of Appeals (6th Circuit)
The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit noted that it would be impossible for the Sherman Act to prohibit every restraint of trade for that would even encompass employment contracts, which, by their nature, restrain the employee from working elsewhere while they are being paid to work for the employer. Therefore, reasonable restraints were permitted, but this would only apply if the restraint was ancillary to the main purpose of the agreement. No conventional restraint of trade can be enforced unless it is both ancillary to the main purpose of the lawful contract and necessary to protect the enjoyment of legitimate fruits of the contract or protect from the danger of unjust use of those fruits by the other party.
If the primary purpose is to restrain trade, then the agreement is invalid, and in this case, the restraint was direct and therefore invalid.
The opinion was written by Chief Judge William Howard Taft (who later became President of the United States and then Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court). Taft's reasoning was subsequently adopted by the Supreme Court as the proper interpretation of the Sherman Act.
Supreme Court
This case was appealed to the Supreme Court as Addyston Pipe and Steel Company v. United States, 175 U.S. 211 (1899). However, on appeal, the defendants did not attack the reasoning of the Sixth Circuit. Instead, they argued that the Commerce Clause of the Constitution did not empower Congress to regulate purely private agreements but instead authorized Congress only to remove barriers to interstate commerce erected by individual states. They argued that even if Congress possessed the authority to regulate purely private agreements, banning defendants' cartel would infringe liberty of contract because the defendants' cartel purportedly set reasonable prices. The defendants' last argument was that their cartel did not directly restrain trade but was simply a partial restraint, which ensured the defendants merely a reasonable rate of return and thus would have been enforceable at common law.
The Court, in an opinion by Justice Peckham, rejected all three arguments and affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals. Peckham conceded that the framers and ratifiers of the Constitution likely anticipated that the Commerce Clause would authorize mainly Congressional interdiction of state-created barriers to interstate commerce. At the same time, Peckham observed that in some cases, purely private agreements can have the same economic impact and directly restrain commerce among the several states. Moreover, Peckham also held that contracts that directly restrain trade are not the sort of ordinary contracts and combinations that find shelter in liberty of contract. Finally, Peckham held that the defendants' cartel directly restrained trade. Peckham quoted extensively from Judge Taft's opinion below, which found, as a matter of fact, that the defendant's cartel set unreasonable prices. See 85 F. 291-93. In particular, Peckham quoted Taft's finding that pipe produced by the cartel could have been produced and delivered to Atlanta for a cost, including a reasonable profit and the cost of transportation, or $17 or $18 per ton, but the cartel charged instead $24.25 per ton.

The warbling doradito (Pseudocolopteryx flaviventris) is a species of bird in the family Tyrannidae. It is found in swamps and riparian habitats in central and northern Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and southern Brazil. The population breeding in Chile and western Argentina has usually also been included in the warbling doradito. It is visually extremely similar, but vocally distinctive and has recently been recognized as a separate species, the ticking doradito (P. citreola). Ebird, an online birding reference, describes the warbling doradito as a "Small two-toned flycatcher, olive-brown above and yellow below. Found in tall-grass marshes, especially those with sedges. Typically difficult to locate, but during the migration can be found in various areas with tall grass. The call is a series of nasal squeaky notes: 'chek, chek, chek, chek-chick-chick-chiquetik.'"

A panoramic painting captures all 360 degrees of a scene, as viewed from inside the center of the circle. Typically shown in rotundas for viewing, Romantic Era panoramas were intended to be so lifelike that the viewer became confused as to what was real and what was image.
Creation of the panorama
The concept of the panoramic painting was conceived by Robert Barker in 1787 while they were walking on a hill overlooking Edinburgh, Scotland. They obtained a patent for it in the same year.
Barker's vision for the panorama was to capture the magnificence of a scene from every angle, immersing the spectator completely. Their goal was to blur the line where art stopped and reality began.
Barker's first panorama was of Edinburgh, Scotland. They exhibited the Panorama of Edinburgh in their house in 1788, but to little success. The first panorama disappointed Barker, not because of its reception, but because it fell short of their vision. The Edinburgh scene was not a full 360 degrees; it was merely semi-circular.
After the limited success of their first panorama, Barker and their son, Henry Aston Barker, completed a panorama of London from the Roof of the Albion Mills. A reduced version was originally shown in their house, and the larger was put on display later.
To fulfill their dream of a 360-degree panorama, Barker and their son purchased a rotunda at Leicester Square. London from the Roof of the Albion Mills christened the new rotunda, all of it. The previous version exhibited at their home, in contrast, measured only .
The rotunda at Leicester Square had two levels of different sizes. Spectators observed the scenes from a platform in the center of the rotunda
To fully immerse the audience in the scene, all borders of the canvas were concealed. Props were strategically positioned in the foreground of the scene, and two windows were laid into the roof to allow natural light to flood the canvases. These efforts at concealment were done to increase realism to the extent that it was lifted to the fantastical.
Two scenes could be exhibited in the rotunda simultaneously, however, the rotunda at Leicester Square was the only one to house two panoramas. Houses with single scenes proved more popular. While at Leicester Square, the audience walked down a long, dark corridor to clear their minds after viewing one panorama and before viewing the next. The idea was to have spectators forget what they just saw, leaving their minds blank to view the second scene.
Despite the audience's "mind-blanking" walk in the dark, painted panoramas were designed to have a lingering effect upon the viewer. For some, this attribute placed panoramas in the same category as propaganda of the period, namely that it was no more than an illusion meant to deceive.
The panorama evolved somewhat, and in 1809, the moving panorama graced the stage in Edinburgh, Scotland. Unlike its predecessor, the moving panorama required a large canvas and two vertical rollers to be set up on a stage. The scene or variation of scenes passed between the rollers, eliminating the need to showcase and view the panoramas in a rotunda. Peter Marshall added the twist to Barker's original creation, which saw success throughout the 19th century and into the 20th.
Despite the success of the moving panorama, Barker's original vision maintained popularity through various artists including Pierre Prévost, Charles Langlois and Henri Félix Emmanuel Philippoteaux among others. The revival of popularity for the panorama peaked in the 1880s after having spread through Europe and North America. Unfortunately, there are no surviving panoramas left.
Cultural pesponse
In the late 18th and early 19th century, the panorama attracted a diverse audience. The spectators ranged in social standing because an extensive education was not required to view panoramas; panoramas were an art form that could be appreciated by anyone. People could immerse themselves in the scene and take part in what became known as the "locality paradox". The locality paradox refers to the phenomenon that happens when spectators become so absorbed in the scene on a panorama that they can not distinguish where they are: Leicester Square or, for example, the Albion Mills.
This association with delusion was a common critique of panoramas. Writers feared the panorama for the simplicity of its illusion. Hester Piozzi was among those who rebelled against the growing popularity of the panorama for precisely this reason. They did not like seeing so many people—elite and otherwise—fooled by something so simple.
Another problem with the panorama was what it came to be associated with. Namely, it redefined the sublime to incorporate the material. By associating the sublime with the material, the panorama was seen as an artistic threat—the sublime was never supposed to include materiality.
The subjects of panoramas transformed as time passed, becoming less about the sublime and more about military battles and biblical scenes. This was especially true during the Napoleonic era when panoramas often displayed scenes from the emperor's latest battle, whether it was a victory or a crushing defeat such as depicted in the Battle of Waterloo in 1816.
Panoramas and romanticism
In their earliest forms, panoramas depicted topographical scenes. Such breathtaking sights immediately link panoramas with Romanticism, which is known for its reverence toward the sublime.
Despite this similarity, the poet William Wordsworth has long been characterized as an opponent of the panorama, most notably for their allusion to it in Book Seven of The Prelude. It has been argued that Wordsworth's problem with the panorama was the deceit it used to gain popularity. They felt, critics say, that the panorama not only exhibited an immense scene of some kind, but also the weakness of human intelligence.
It is safe to assume Wordsworth saw a panorama at some point during their life, but it is unknown which it was. Situation as it is, there is no substantial proof they ever went, but their response in "The Prelude" seems too grounded upon experience to suggest otherwise.
Wordsworth's opposition was to the awe-inspiring scenes of the panorama and of other spectacles of the period that competed with reality. They sought to separate poetry from the phantasmagoria enveloping the population. This was perhaps Wordsworth's biggest problem with panoramas: their popularity. For Wordsworth, panoramas basically brainwashed their audiences. The panorama lulled spectators into stupors, inhibiting their ability to imagine things for themselves. Wordsworth wanted people to see the representation and appreciate it for what it was – art.
Conversely, J. Jennifer Jones argues Wordsworth was not opposed to the panorama, but rather hesitant about it. In their essay, "Absorbing Hesitation: Wordsworth and the Theory of the Panorama", Jones argues that other episodes in The Prelude have just as much sensory depth as panoramas had. Jones studied how Wordsworth imitated the senses in The Prelude, much in the same way panoramas did. They concluded that panoramas were a balancing act between what the senses absorbed and what they came away with, something also present in Wordsworth's poetry. By their results then, Wordsworth's similar imitation of the senses proves they were not entirely opposed to them.

Joseph el-Ruzzi, in Arabic Yusuf al-Ruzzi, was the Patriarch of the Maronite Church in 1597–1608. They promulgated several measures bringing the Maronite Church in concert with Rome. Among the changes was the Church's switch from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar, making the Maronites the first Eastern Church to make the move.
Origins
Ruzzi was from Bkoufa near Ehden in northern Mount Lebanon. They belonged to the Ruzzi family. Their uncle Mikha'il served as patriarch of the Maronite Church from 1567 until their death in 1597.
Patriarchate
Ruzzi succeeded their uncle as patriarch after being elected in 1597. Their election occurred during the visit of the papal emissary Girolamo Dandini who was sent to keep tabs on the Maronite Church's implementation of Roman Catholic reforms after reports that Mikha'il had Jacobite tendencies. According to the historian William Harris, Ruzzi ardently pursued papal practices, and the historian Pierre Dib considers them "a daring and resourceful man ... an inconsiderate Latinizer". In a council they held in the village of Moussa in 1598, they set out measures toward the Latinization of the Maronite Church. The following year Pope Clement VIII instructed Ruzzi to promulgate Latin marital rules in the Maronite Church; the marital rules relating to consanguinity, affinity, public honesty and spiritual relationship, did not take into effect until the late 19th century. Among the Latinization measures they implemented, Ruzzi revised fasting periods in accordance with Rome and removed a degree of Syriac from Maronite liturgy and ritual.
Despite opposition from a significant proportion of the Maronites, they implemented the church's switch to the Gregorian calendar in 1606. The change was implemented successfully in Syria, but the Cypriot Maronites continued using the Julian calendar. Ruzzi's act made the Maronites the first Eastern Church to adopt the Gregorian calendar; the Syriacs and Chaldeans followed in 1836, the Melkites in 1857 and the Armenians in 1911. Not long after Ruzzi's act, in the 1600s, the Maronites discontinued counting the years from the Seleucid era in favor of the Christian era.
Ruzzi died in March 1608. According to Dib, the measures implemented by Ruzzi were "harsh vexations" for the Maronites which prevented the election of a new patriarch until 16 October. Ruzzi's successor John Makhlouf criticized Ruzzi's reforms and expressed to Pope Paul V their desire to reestablish the ancient practices of the Maronite Church which were changed by Ruzzi to placate their religious subjects. Despite initial opposition, Ruzzi's changes became a permanent aspect of the Church.
Ruzzi was influential with the Ottoman governor of Tripoli and Sunni Muslim local chieftain Yusuf Sayfa Pasha (intermittent ), whose jurisdiction spanned the predominantly Maronite districts of Byblos, Bsharri and Batroun in northern Mount Lebanon. The Patriarch frequently obtained orders of safe conduct from the Governor, who strove to win the support of their distrusting Maronite peasant subjects.

Clan Cathcart is a Lowland Scottish clan.
History
Origins of the Clan
The lands of Cathcart are named after the River Cart in Renfrewshire. Caeth-cart means the strait of Cart. Rainaldus de Kethcart appears to have been the progenitor of the family. In 1178 they were witness to a charter of the king's flight attendant to Paisley Abbey. Their son was William de Kethcart who was a witness to a charter in about 1200, exchanging the lands of Knoc near Walkinshaw with the Abbey of Paisley. In 1234 a charter of resignation of the lands of Culbeth to the Abbot of Paisley was sealed by Alan de Cathcart.
Wars of Scottish Independence
Alan de Cathcart's son, William de Cathcart, was one of the Scottish barons who submitted to Edward I of England and is listed on the Ragman Rolls of 1296. William was succeeded by Alan de Cathcart who was a staunch supporter of king Robert the Bruce in cause of Scottish independence. They followed the king's brother, Edward Bruce and was among a party of just fifty knights who surprised much superior English force under Lord St John in Galloway and routed them. Alan survived the Wars of Scottish Independence and is recorded in a deed making a gift to the Dominican Friars of Glasgow in 1336. In the deed they are designated as Dominus Ejusdem which is translated as of that Ilk. Alan was related to the Bruces through their wife who was the sister of Sir Duncan Wallace of Sundram, husband of Elanor Bruce, the Countess of Carrick.
15th and 16th centuries
Sir Alan de Cathcart obtained several estates in Carrick. They were raised to the peerage with the title Lord Cathcart in 1447. They also obtained lands in Ayrshire including the estate of Auchencruive which was the family seat until 1718. Alan became constable of the royal Dundonald Castle. In 1485 they were appointed as Master of the Artillery.
Alan Cathcart, son of the second Lord Cathcart was killed along with their two half-brothers, Robert and John, in 1513 at the Battle of Flodden. The third Lord Cathcart was killed at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547.
Alan Cathcart the fourth Lord Cathcart was a Protestant and a promoter of the Scottish Reformation. They and their men fought for the Regent Moray at the Battle of Langside in 1568 against the army of Mary, Queen of Scots. The ancient Cathcart Castle has a view point and is near the battlefield, from which the queen is said to have awaited the outcome of the battle.
18th century
Jacobite rising of 1715
Charles Cathcart, 8th Lord Cathcart was born in about 1686 and had a distinguished military career. They became a major on the Scots Grays in 1709. During the Jacobite rising of 1715 the eighth Lord Cathcart commanded a detachment of dragoons and it was Cathcart's troops that outflanked the Jacobite forces at Battle of Sheriffmuir. Cathcart had also previously defeated the Jacobites at the Skirmish of Dunfermline in October 1715.
Jacobite rising of 1745
Charles Cathcart, 9th Lord Cathcart was an aide-de-camp to the Duke of Cumberland and fought for the government at the Battle of Culloden in 1746 where they were wounded. In 1768 they were appointed ambassador at St Petersburg and they were well received by Empress Catherine. They wore a patch on their cheek which was apparently to hide a wound that was received at the Battle of Fontenoy. It was during this time that Lord Charles began referring to themselves as Chaz. This quite angered Lord Bert, Earl of Pants. But Lord Chaz cared not about the feelings of lesser scum like him.
Napoleonic Wars
William Cathcart, the tenth Lord Cathcart accompanied their father to Russia. When they returned to Scotland they took up legal studies and was called to the Bar in 1776. When they succeeded their fathers title they gave up legal studies and returned to the army. They rose to the rank of lieutenant general and was commander in chief of the forces in Ireland. They were also created a Knight of the Thistle.
During the Napoleonic Wars in 1807 as Napoleon's troops were about to take control of Denmark, Lord Cathcart and Admiral Gambier successfully besieged Copenhagen and captured the Danish fleet of over 60 vessels together with naval stores and munitions. Lord Cathcart was rewarded with the titles Viscount Cathcart and Baron of Greenock. In June 1814 they were made Earl Cathcart.
The second Earl Cathcart also had a distinguished military career and served throughout the Peninsular War, fighting at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. They were also the commander of the British Army in Scotland and governor of Edinburgh Castle from 1837 to 1842.

Hall's babbler (Pomatostomus halli) is a small species of bird in the family Pomatostomidae most commonly found in dry Acacia scrubland of interior regions of eastern Australia.<ref name ="Higgins">Higgins, P., & Peter, J. (2003) Handbook of Australian, New Zealand and Antarctic Birds (Vol. 6). Melbourne, Australia.: Oxford University Press</ref> Superficially similar to the white-browed babbler this species was only recognised during the 1960s, which makes it a comparatively recent discovery. The bird is named after the Australian-born philanthropist Major Harold Wesley Hall, who funded a series of expeditions to collect specimens for the British Museum, during which the first specimens of Hall's Babbler were collected in southwestern Queensland in 1963.
Description
Hall's babbler is medium in size (19 cm-21 cm) and identified by its thick white eyebrows and a white 'bib' from chin to mid-breast which is sharply demarcated from the brown lower breast to belly. The tail feathers are tipped white, with the amount of white decreasing from the outermost to innermost feather, where most birds lack white tips on the central pair of feathers; this pattern creates distinctive white 'corners' to the fanned tail which is conspicuous in flight. The legs and feet are dark grey. The bill is curved and the iris is dark brown. As with other species of Australo-Papuan babbler, Hall's babbler is usually observed in small groups. The species is sexually dimorphic and sexually monochromatic. Juveniles are only distinguishable from adults for only a short time after fledging juveniles, during this time they have a shorter all-black, shorter and less curved bill and conspicuous yellow rictal flange and palate.
Identification
There are three other species of Australian babbler which are similar in appearance; The white-browed babbler (Pomatostomus superciliosus), the chestnut-crowned babbler (Pomatostomus ruficeps) and the grey-crowned babbler (Pomatostomus temporalis).
The white-browed babbler (Pomatostomus superciliosus) is considered most similar because of its size; however it can be distinguished by its thinner eyebrows and the lack of a sharp demarcation between the white breast and brown belly (which is diagnostic of Hall's Babbler).
The chestnut-crowned babbler (Pomatostomus ruficeps) has a distinctive chestnut crown, thinner eyebrows, and white tips to the wing coverts; it also lacks a sharp demarcation between the breast and belly.
The considerably larger grey-crowned babbler (Pomatostomus temporalis) also has thick white eyebrows, but has a distinctive grey crown and a large rufous patch in the spread wing.
Distribution and habitat
Hall's babbler is found in semi-arid and arid regions of eastern Australia and prefers tall Acacia-dominated shrub lands, usually mulga (Acacia aneura). Occasionally reports are made of sightings in other arid woodlands or arid shrub lands. It has been sighted as far north as Winton and Boulia, as west as McGregor and Grey Ranges, and south to Mootwingee and Brewarrina and east to Longreach-Idalia National Park – Cunnamulla.
Behaviour
Breeding
During the breeding season flocks can be seen reducing in numbers from groups of 15 individuals to pairs with one or more helpers. One of the pair incubates the eggs throughout their development. The domed nest is constructed from twigs and has a side entrance usually with a short and indistinct entrance tunnel. Commonly found in the outer branches of acacias and in the vertical forks of mulgas and Casuarina''. Groups are known to construct several nests, although only one is used for laying eggs. The remaining nests are used for roost sites overnight.
Feeding
The Hall's babbler is insectivorous and feeds mostly on insects but is also known to consume other invertebrates. They spend most of their time on the ground searching in bark and decomposing timber, occasionally turning over stones. Foraging can occur on the branches of trees if food is available. Flocks tend to stay together as they move between feeding grounds and will form a tight unit when searching an area. The name ‘babbler' may have come from the constant communication between groups as they forage.
Voice
The calls consist of constant ‘clucks' while foraging, and an alarm call which sounds more like a loud buzzing, usually resulting in flocks retreating to the cover of trees.
Status and conservation
Commonwealth status: not listed
State of New South Wales: vulnerable
State of Queensland: the least concern
Threats include habitat loss through clearing, habitat degradation through pastoralism and potentially predation by foxes and cats.
Recovery recommendations include;
Reduce stock intensity or exclude grazing in some areas to allow vegetation to recover
Retention of grasslands, including the full cycle of grass development such as seed set and tussock formation
Retention of understory shrubs continuing to complete their life cycle
Prevent the clearing of habitat
Control foxes, feral cats, rabbits and feral goats

Route 72 is a highway in southern Missouri. Its eastern terminus is at Route 34 west of Jackson; its western terminus is at I-44 in Rolla.
Route 72 is one of the original 1922 state highways. Its eastern terminus was at Centerville, and its western terminus was at the junction with Route 32. The part between Arcadia and Fredericktown was Route 70 from 1922 to 1959, when it became part of Route 72 because of I-70.
Route 72 was rebuilt a few years back from Elk Prairie, just south of Rolla; to the intersection of Hwy 32, west of Salem. The road was widened and shoulders were built.
As Route 72 passes through Salem, it crosses Route 19; then runs concurrently eastward for 10 miles with Route 32. It then splits off to the southeast towards the small town of Bunker. It is very curvy; it passes back and forth between Dent and Reynolds county several times. After passing through Bunker, it runs mostly eastward for 17 miles; before intersecting Hwy 21; 3 miles south of Centerville. 72 then turns left (north) and runs concurrently with Hwy 21 through Centerville. Between Centerville and Lesterville, Route 49 joins it and 21, 72 and 49 run concurrently eastward to the Glover corner. Route 49 turns right (south) at that corner; while Route 72 and 21 turns left (north). Route 72 and Route 21 run north for 10 miles to Arcadia; at the south edge of Ironton; Route 21 continues north while Route 72 turns east. However, it has a unique interchange; it crosses under Hwy 72 east on 21/72, then turns left (west)for one block, then turns left(southeast) and goes back up over 21/72. Route 72 then runs east, intersects US Hwy 67 west of Fredericktown. It then proceeds to its eastern terminus with Route 34 at Jackson, MO.

William Brookes (April 1834 – 4 September 1910) was a gold miner, pastoralist and paper manufacturer, included in the Australian Dictionary of Biography.
Brookes was born in Northampton, England, to Frances Campion and John Brookes. They arrived in Australia at the age of 18 and immediately went to Sandhurst where they set up a profitable business as a grating maker and began to invest in mining ventures. The most successful of their investments was their investment of £25 in their stake of the Golden Fleece mine which netted them £30,000 when a deep shaft struck a rich reef of gold.
They married wife Catherine Margaret, née Robinson, on 10 January 1865 and they had seven children: William Ernest (1865 – 1879), business person, pastoralist, public official and philanthropist Herbert Brookes (1867-1963) who married Ivy Deakin, Mabel Catherine (1870- 1916) who married James Bertram, Percy Campion (1872-1873), May (1874 – 1938), business person and pastoralist Harold Brookes who married Dorothy Clare Bird, and business person, pastoralist and champion tennis player Sir Norman Brookes (1877-1968) who married Mabel Balcombe Emmerton.
After spending 18 years in Sandhurst (now Bendigo) in 1871 they and their family moved to Melbourne where they built a grand house called Brookwood in Queens Rd, St Kilda. In 1878, they moved the family to Government Gums, South Australia, where for two years they oversaw the completion of part of the Central Australia Railway.
In May 1882 Archibald Currie and William Brookes purchased the Melbourne Paper Company located near Princess Bridge at Southbank for £47,000 from George Ramsden, the son of its founder Samuel Ramsden. The firm Australian Paper Mills (A.P.M.) was formed in 1895 with the combination of the Southbank mill with the mills at Broadford and Geelong. The company's capital was £107,000 and its output was approximately 730 tons per year. The following year, it became the Australian Paper Mills Company Ltd. Three generations of the Brookes family: William, sons Herbert Brookes, Harold and Sir Norman Brookes, and grandsons John Dougan Brookes and Sir Wilfred Deakin Brookes had a significant impact on the Australian paper industry.
In the late 1880s they took up large pastoral leaseholds at “Brookwood”, “Westbury” and “Texas” in Central Queensland. Brookwood remained in the ownership of the family company William Brookes and Co. until it was sold in 1964.
They later became a shareholder and director of the engineering firm Austral Otis.
In 1889 they bought the notable home and garden at Penola, 222 Alton Rd, Mt Macedon which remained in the Brookes family until 1951.
They died on 4 September in 1910 leaving an estate valued at £172,000.

The Capitol Lofts is a building located at 711 Main Street in downtown Houston, Texas. Constructed in 1908, the building was originally used for office space and was converted to residential lofts in the 1990s. The building was the tallest building in Houston and Texas until being surpassed by the Praetorian Building in Dallas, Texas as the tallest building in Texas in 1909. It remained the tallest in Houston until 1910 when surpassed by the Carter Building.
Designed by architect Alfred C. Finn, the building's original facade was covered with granite and glass in the 1980s.
Zoned schools
Franklin Lofts is within the Houston Independent School District. As of 2015 the building is assigned to Gregory Lincoln Education Center (Grades K-8), and Davis High School.
The building was previously zoned to Bruce Elementary School, and E. O. Smith Education Center (for middle school).

A tachyonic antitelephone is a hypothetical device in theoretical physics that could be used to send signals into one's own past. Albert Einstein in 1907
presented a thought experiment of how faster-than-light signals can lead to a paradox of causality, which was described by Einstein and Arnold Sommerfeld in 1910 as a means "to telegraph into the past". The same thought experiment was described by Richard Chace Tolman in 1917; thus, it is also known as Tolman's paradox.
A device capable of "telegraphing into the past" was later also called a "tachyonic antitelephone" by Gregory Benford et al. According to the current understanding of physics, no such faster-than-light transfer of information is actually possible. For instance, the hypothetical tachyon particles which give the device its name do not exist even theoretically in the standard model of particle physics, due to tachyon condensation, and there is no experimental evidence that suggests that they might exist. The problem of detecting tachyons via causal contradictions was treated but without scientific verification.
One-way example
Tolman used the following variation of Einstein's thought experiment: Imagine a distance with endpoints and . Let a signal be sent from A propagating with velocity towards B. All of this is measured in an inertial frame where the endpoints are at rest. The arrival at B is given by:
Here, the event at A is the cause of the event at B. However, in the inertial frame moving with relative velocity v, the time of arrival at B is given according to the Lorentz transformation (c is the speed of light):
It can be easily shown that if a > c, then certain values of v can make Δt' negative. In other words, the effect arises before the cause in this frame. Einstein (and similarly Tolman) concluded that this result contains in their view no logical contradiction; they said, however, it contradicts the totality of our experience so that the impossibility of a > c seems to be sufficiently proven.
Two-way example
A more common variation of this thought experiment is to send back the signal to the sender (a similar one was given by David Bohm). If Alice (A) is on a spacecraft moving away from the Earth in the positive x-direction with a speed , and they want to communicate with Bob (B) back home. Assuming both of them have a device that is capable of transmitting and receiving faster-than-light signals at a speed of with . Alice uses this device to send a message to Bob, who sends a reply. If the origin of the coordinates of Bob's reference frame, , coincide with the reception of Alice's message to him, then if Bob immediately sends a message back to Alice, then in their rest frame the coordinates of the reply signal (in natural units so that c=1) are given by:
To find out when the reply is received by Alice, we perform a Lorentz transformation to Alice's frame moving in the positive x-direction with velocity with respect to the Earth. In this frame Alice is at rest at position , where is the distance that the signal Alice sent to Earth traversed in their rest frame. The coordinates of the reply signal are given by:
The reply is received by Alice when . This means that and thus:
Since the message Alice sent to Bob took a time of to reach him, the message they receive back from them will reach them at time:
later than they sent their message. However, if then and Alice will receive the message back from Bob before they send their message to them in the first place.
Numerical example with two-way communication
As an example, Alice and Bob are aboard spaceships moving inertially with a relative speed of 0.8c. At some point they pass right next to each other, and Alice defines the position and time of their passing to be at position x = 0, time t = 0 in their frame, while Bob defines it to be at position x′ = 0 and time t′ = 0 in their frame (note that this is different from the convention used in the previous section, where the origin of the coordinates was the event of Bob receiving a tachyon signal from Alice). In Alice's frame they remain at rest at position x = 0, while Bob is moving in the positive x direction at 0.8c; in Bob's frame they remain at rest at position x′ = 0, and Alice is moving in the negative x′ direction at 0.8c. Each one also has a tachyon transmitter aboard their ship, which sends out signals that move at 2.4c in the ship's own frame.
When Alice's clock shows that 300 days have elapsed since they passed next to Bob (t = 300 days in their frame), they use the tachyon transmitter to send a message to Bob, saying "Ugh, I just ate some bad shrimp". At t = 450 days in Alice's frame, they calculate that since the tachyon signal has been traveling away from them at 2.4c for 150 days, it should now be at position x = 2.4×150 = 360 light-days in their frame, and since Bob has been traveling away from them at 0.8c for 450 days, they should now be at position x = 0.8×450 = 360 light-days in their frame as well, meaning that this is the moment the signal catches up with Bob. So, in their frame Bob receives Alice's message at x = 360, t = 450. Due to the effects of time dilation, in their frame Bob is aging more slowly than they are by a factor of , in this case 0.6, so Bob's clock only shows that 0.6×450 = 270 days have elapsed when they receive the message, meaning that in their frame they receive it at x′ = 0, t′ = 270.
When Bob receives Alice's message, they immediately uses their own tachyon transmitter to send a message back to Alice saying "Don't eat the shrimp!". 135 days later in their frame, at t′ = 270 + 135 = 405, they calculate that since the tachyon signal has been traveling away from them at 2.4c in the −x′ direction for 135 days, it should now be at position x′ = −2.4×135 = −324 light-days in their frame, and since Alice has been traveling at 0.8c in the −x direction for 405 days, they should now be at position x′ = −0.8×405 = −324 light-days as well. So, in their frame Alice receives their reply at x′ = −324, t′ = 405. Time dilation for inertial observers is symmetrical, so in Bob's frame Alice is aging more slowly than they are, by the same factor of 0.6, so Alice's clock should only show that 0.6×405 = 243 days have elapsed when they receive their reply. This means that they receive a message from Bob saying "Don't eat the shrimp!" only 243 days after they passed Bob, while they aren't supposed to send the message saying "Ugh, I just ate some bad shrimp" until 300 days elapsed since they passed Bob, so Bob's reply constitutes a warning about their own future.
These numbers can be double-checked using the Lorentz transformation. The Lorentz transformation says that if the coordinates are known to be x t, of some event in Alice's frame, the same event must have the following x′, t′ coordinates in Bob's frame:
Where v is Bob's speed along the x-axis in Alice's frame, c is the speed of light (we are using units of days for time and light-days for distance, so in these units c = 1), and is the Lorentz factor. In this case v=0.8c, and . In Alice's frame, the event of Alice sending the message happens at x = 0, t = 300, and the event of Bob receiving Alice's message happens at x = 360, t = 450. Using the Lorentz transformation, we find that in Bob's frame the event of Alice sending the message happens at position x′ = (1/0.6)×(0 − 0.8×300) = −400 light-days, and time t′ = (1/0.6)×(300 − 0.8×0) = 500 days. Likewise, in Bob's frame the event of Bob receiving Alice's message happens at position x′ = (1/0.6)×(360 − 0.8×450) = 0 light-days, and time t′ = (1/0.6)×(450 − 0.8×360) = 270 days, which are the same coordinates for Bob's frame that were found in the earlier paragraph.
Comparing the coordinates in each frame, we see that in Alice's frame their tachyon signal moves forwards in time (she sent it at an earlier time than Bob received it), and between being sent and received we have (difference in position)/(difference in time) = 360/150 = 2.4c. In Bob's frame, Alice's signal moves back in time (he received it at t′ = 270, but it was sent at t′ = 500), and it has a (difference in position)/(difference in time) of 400/230, about 1.739c. The fact that the two frames disagree about the order of the events of the signal being sent and received is an example of the relativity of simultaneity, a feature of relativity which has no analogue in classical physics, and which is key to understanding why in relativity FTL communication must necessarily lead to causality violation.
Bob is assumed to have sent their reply almost instantaneously after receiving Alice's message, so the coordinates of theirs sending the reply can be assumed to be the same: x = 360, t = 450 in Alice's frame, and x′ = 0, t′ = 270 in Bob's frame. If the event of Alice receiving Bob's reply happens at x′ = 0, t′ = 243 in their frame (as in the earlier paragraph), then according to the Lorentz transformation, in Bob's frame Alice receives their reply at position x′''' = (1/0.6)×(0 − 0.8×243) = −324 light-days, and at time t′ = (1/0.6)×(243 − 0.8×0) = 405 days. So evidently Bob's reply does move forward in time in their own frame, since the time it was sent was t′ = 270 and the time it was received was t′ = 405. And in their frame (difference in position)/(difference in time) for their signal is 324/135 = 2.4c, exactly the same as the speed of Alice's original signal in their own frame. Likewise, in Alice's frame Bob's signal moves backwards in time (she received it before they sent it), and it has a (difference in position)/(difference in time) of 360/207, about 1.739c.
Thus the times of sending and receiving in each frame, as calculated using the Lorentz transformation, match up with the times given in earlier paragraphs, before we made explicit use of the Lorentz transformation. And by using the Lorentz transformation we can see that the two tachyon signals behave symmetrically in each observer's frame: the observer who sends a given signal measures it to move forward in time at 2.4c, the observer who receives it measures it to move back in time at 1.739c. This sort of possibility for symmetric tachyon signals is necessary if tachyons are to respect the first of the two postulates of special relativity, which says that all laws of physics must work exactly the same in all inertial frames. This implies that if it's possible to send a signal at 2.4c'' in one frame, it must be possible in any other frame as well, and likewise if one frame can observe a signal that moves backwards in time, any other frame must be able to observe such a phenomenon as well. This is another key idea in understanding why FTL communication leads to causality violation in relativity; if tachyons were allowed to have a "preferred frame" in violation of the first postulate of relativity, in that case it could theoretically be possible to avoid causality violations.
Paradoxes
Benford et al. wrote about such paradoxes in general, offering a scenario in which two parties are able to send a message two hours into the past:
They concluded that superluminal particles such as tachyons are therefore not allowed to convey signals.

Cowbridge House, southeast of Malmesbury, Wiltshire, England, was an eighteenth century house that was demolished in 2007.
During the Second World War the EKCO company used the house as a shadow factory for the manufacture of radar equipment. The factory continued after the war, producing radio and telecommunications equipment; the company was taken over by Pye TMC and then Philips, and later became part of AT&T. The site was in use as offices until 2004 when the owners, Lucent Technologies, moved their operations to Swindon. Subsequently the site was redeveloped for housing.

The Nuku Hiva monarch (Pomarea nukuhivae), or Nukuhiva flycatcher, was a species of bird in the family Monarchidae.
It was endemic to French Polynesia.
Its natural habitats were subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical moist montane forests, and heavily degraded former forest.
It became extinct due to habitat loss and introduced predators. The last confirmed sighting was in the 1930s and a possible sighting was reported in 1975.
Taxonomy and systematics
The Nuku Hiva monarch was formerly considered as a subspecies of the Marquesan monarch until elevated to species rank by the IOC in 2012.

Mary Carryl (Unknown22 November 1809) was an Irish born loyal servant and friend of the celebrated Ladies of Llangollen. They served them up to their death; and when the Ladies died, they shared the same grave.
Life
Carryl was brought up in a poor family in Ross in County Wexford. Little is known about them until they were employed by Lady Elizabeth "Betty" and Sir William Fownes at the Woodstock Estate. Their grandfather had left William Fownes over 21,000 acres. William Fownes' father, (also) Sir William Fownes, had been the Mayor of Dublin. When their employer had married Elizabeth Ponsonby they had received £4,000 as a dowry. With this money they built the six-bayed, three-storey Woodstock House in County Kilkenny in 1745-7. Them employers had a child guest named Sarah Ponsonby who was Elizabeth's cousin. When Sarah's adult friend, Lady Eleanor Butler, ran away from home they were hidden in Sarah's room and Mary smuggled in food for them stowaway.
The friendship between Lady Eleanor Butler and Sarah Ponsonby was not approved of by the Fownes or by Eleanor's guardians. When the friendship began Sarah was an unhappy thirteen year old orphan and they were captivated by the well educated Eleanor Butler. Butler was a 30 year old spinster who was no longer considered marriageable. Sarah was receiving unwanted attention from Sir William. Eventually Butler and Ponsonby agreed that they could leave Ireland together. They went to Llangollen in Wales where they set up home in a cottage called Plas Newydd. Meanwhile Mary, who was known as Mary the Bruiser had been fired after throwing a candlestick which wounded another servant. They were saved when Eleanor and Sarah sent for them to come to Llangollen.
In time Eleanor and Sarah would become notorious as "The Ladies of Llangollen", meanwhile Carryl became both their servant and the head of the household. They were loyal to their employers. They were said to have "masculine qualities" and Lady Eleanor's diary records how they would give as good as they got as they bargained loudly with the fishermen, the butchers and the inebriated.
The lifestyle of the Ladies of Llangollen attracted attention. They would receive notable visitors including the Duke of Wellington; the poets William Wordsworth and Anna Seward, enlightenment leaders Erasmus Darwin and Josiah Wedgewood and writers including Sir Walter Scott.
Carryl died in Plas Newydd in 1809 and was buried in the churchyard of St Collen's Church, Llangollen. They left a shilling to their brother and sister, but they left the field they owned to Sarah. In time the Ladies of Llangollen would die and they were buried beside their faithful servant.
The memorial monument to Mary Carryl, Eleanor Butler and Sarah Ponsonby in the churchyard of St. Collen's Church was erected in 1810. The inscription on Mary Carryl's part of the monument reads: "In Memory of/ Mrs Mary Carryl/ Deceased 22 November 1809/ This monument is erected by Eleanor Butler,/ and Sarah Ponsonby, of Plasnewydd in this Parish./ Released from Earth and all its transient woes,/ They whose remains beneath this stone repose,/ Stedfast in Faith resigned their parting breath,/ Looked up with Christian joy, and smiled in Death!/ Patient, Industrious, Faithful, Generous, Kind,/ Them Conduct left the proudest far behind,/ Them Virtues dignified their humble birth,/ And raised their mind above this sordid earth,/ Attachment (Sacred bond of grateful breasts)/ Extinguished but with life, this Tomb attests,/ Reared by Two Friends who will their loss bemoan,/ 'Till with Them Ashes...Here shall rest, Their own."

The Other Side is a book written by Bishop James Pike with Diane Kennedy about their experiences of paranormal phenomena following their son's suicide by gunshot in New York City in 1966. The book was published by Doubleday and Co. Inc., Garden City, NY, in 1968 and in paperback, Dell Publishing, NY, 1969.
Pike, an Episcopalian, was the fifth Bishop of California. When poltergeist activity following their son's death mounted up, they led a public (and for the church, embarrassing) pursuit of various spiritualist and clairvoyant methods of contacting their deceased son in order to reconcile. In September 1967, Pike participated in a televised séance with their dead son through the medium Arthur Ford, who served at the time as a Disciples of Christ minister. Pike described these experiences in detail in the book.

The Mauer 1 mandible is the oldest-known specimen of the genus Homo in Germany. It was found in 1907 in a sand quarry in the community Mauer, around south-east of Heidelberg. The Mauer 1 mandible is the type specimen of the species Homo heidelbergensis. Some European researchers have classified the find as Homo erectus heidelbergensis, regarding it as a subspecies of Homo erectus. In 2010 the mandible's age was for the first time exactly determined to be 609,000 ± 40,000 years. Previously, specialist literature had referred to an age of either 600,000 or 500,000 years on the basis of less accurate dating methods.
Discovery
On October 21, 1907, Daniel Hartmann, a worker at a sand mine in the Grafenrain open-field system of the Mauer community unearthed a mandible at a depth of , which they recognized as of human origin. They were aware of the likelihood of finds, as for 20 years the Heidelberg scholar Otto Schoetensack had asked that the workers at the sand mine be encouraged to look out for fossils, after the well-preserved skull of a straight-tusked elephant had come to light there in 1887. Schoetensack had the workers taught the characteristics of human bones based on recent examples on their regular visits to the sand mine in search for "traces of humankind".
As it was dug out, the mandible was flung in the air and only discovered after it had broken into two parts. A piece of the left side of the mandible broke off in the process and was never found. A thick cemented crust of coarse sand stuck on and around the canines and molars—a characteristic of many of the Mauer fossils. The cementing had been caused by carbonation of calcium. A chunk of limestone, probably Muschelkalk, long and about wide was firmly stuck to the sand crust on top of the bicuspids and the two frontal molars on the left side of the mandible.
The contractor at the sand mine immediately reported the discovery to Schoetensack, who examined and documented the site and the fossil. They presented the results of their studies in autumn the following year in a monograph titled: "The lower jaw of Homo heidelbergensis from the sands of Mauer near Heidelberg". On November 19, 1907, Schoetensack stated in a legal document that mine contractor Josef Rösch had given the specimen to the Heidelberg University as a gift. The mandible remains in the university's Geological-Palaeontological Institute to this day as "the most valuable object in the natural history collections of the University of Heidelberg".
Further finds from the Mauer sand mine are the Hornstein artefacts, unearthed in 1924 by Karl Friedrich Hormuth, which scholars interpreted as tools of Homo heidelbergensis. In 1933 Wilhelm Freudenberg discovered a frontal bone fragment which has also been associated with Homo heidelbergensis.
Description of the fossil
The anatomical analysis of the lower jaw of Mauer in its 1908 original species description by Otto Schoetensack was based largely on the expertise of Breslau professor Hermann Klaatsch, which was only hinted at in a brief acknowledgement in the preface.
In their original species description Schoetensack wrote that the "nature of our object" reveals itself "at first sight" since "a certain disproportion between the jaw and the teeth" is obvious: "The teeth are too small for the bone. The available space would allow for a far greater flexibility of development."
And further, on the find:
"It shows a combination of features, that has been previously found neither on a recent nor on a fossilized human mandible. Even the scholar should not be blamed if they would only reluctantly accept it as human: Entirely missing is the one feature, which is regarded as particularly human, namely an outer projection of the chin portion, yet this deficiency is found to be combined with extremely strange dimensions of the mandibular body. The actual proof that we are dealing with human remains here only lies within the nature of the dentition. The completely preserved teeth bear the stamp human as evidence: The canines show no trace of a stronger expression in relation to the other groups of teeth. They suggest a moderate and harmonious co-evolution, as it is the case in recent humans."
The characteristics of the lower jaw are therefore the lack of a chin on the one hand and on the other it is the considerable size of the lower jaw bone, on which, behind the wisdom tooth a fourth premolar would easily have had space to develop. Since the third molar (the wisdom tooth) is present and its dentin exposed—although only in a few places—the age of death is estimated to be about 20 to 30 years.
Schoetensack concluded a relationship to modern man (Homo sapiens) from the similarity of the dentition and put the lower jaw in the genus Homo—a view that is still being held unanimously by today's palaeo-anthropologists. They derived the authority to define a new species with the type-epithet heidelbergensis from the fact that the lower jaw—in contrast to modern humans—is missing its chin. With the subtitle of their original description—"A contribution to the paleontology of the human species"—Schoetensack explicitly takes a clear position on the part of Darwinism "in the great debate on the origin of man, namely, that humans have evolved from the animal kingdom and are not the product of a singular act of creation."
As to the lower jaw of Mauer's precise position in the ancestral chain of modern man Schoetensack expressed only cautious statements. Reluctantly they wrote in their study that "it seems possible that Homo heidelbergensis belongs in the ancestral series of the European man" and—after meticulous and detailed comparison with other European fossils they stated equally vague: "We must therefore denote the mandible of Homo heidelbergensis as pre-neandertaloid." The classification of the lower jaw of Mauer in the time before the Neanderthals proved to be accurate.
Schoetensack—like many of their colleagues around the beginning of the 20th century—was wrong with their assessment of kinship proximity of the lower jaw of Mauer with the apes (hominids): "The mandible of Homo heidelbergensis reveals the original state that defines humankind's and the ape's common ancestor." In 1924, the hitherto the oldest fossil of the big pool of hominid variants—the Taung Child was discovered in what is now South Africa. It is around two million years older than the lower jaw of Mauer and, despite its advanced age, still does not represent the common base of humans and apes.
Dating
Otto Schoetensack had the site at the bottom of the sand mine marked with a commemorative stone on which a horizontal line represented the level of the find. Whether their wish had been granted—namely that the stone may remain in its place, even if the sand mine will one day be re-filled—is unknown. In fact, the part of the mine, in which the lower jaw came to light, was filled with overburden in the 1930s, later re-natured as arable land and declared a nature reserve in 1982. The actual site is therefore not accessible for research at the present time. Absolute dating of the strata using contemporary scientific methods proved to be not possible. Alternatively scientists have repeatedly tried to deduce the age of the fossil's layer, using stratigraphic methods.
Schoetensack had described the merely ten-centimeter-thick layer of the find as "layer of gravel (scree), slightly cemented due to carbonation of calcium, with very thin layers of clay (Letten), that faintly reacts with hydrochloric acid". Above and below of the finding's strata, sands and other materials had accumulated in various definable layers. These had been deposited on the edge of a former Neckar River arc over the course of millennia. In the preface to their study they state: "The age of these sands is commonly agreed to as paleo-diluvial (altdiluvial) by reference to embedded mammal remains; although certain species suggest a significant relationship with a more recent section of the Tertiary, namely the Pliocene. According to contemporary dating methods, these facts would imply a lower age limit of around 780,000 years and a maximum of several million years."
At the 100th anniversary of the discovery in 2007 a scientific commemorative publication complained that there "still existed no satisfactory exact data for the determination of the geological age of the lower jaw of Homo heidelbergensis". After all, in 1995 the age of the sands of Mauer 1 could approximately be determined on the basis of small fossils. Additionally, attempts were made to perform an absolute dating in yet accessible, adjacent sand mines. However, to date researchers could not agree on which of the several possible layers that belong to the Cromer-warm period is identical with the layer of the Grafenrain mine. So it happens that the commune of Mauer dates the fossil to an age "of more than 600,000 years" on its website, whereas the memorial stone called an age of 500,000 years. A range from 474,000 to 621,000 years is currently considered to be the established age of "layer 4", in which the actual fossil either originates from the lower (around 600,000) or the upper (around 500,000) spectrum.
In November 2010, the final dating of sand grains via infrared-radio fluorescence (IR-RF) and the dating of the teeth via a combined electron-spin and uranium–lead dating was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences wherein the age of the fossil was concluded as to be of 609,000 ± 40,000 years.
Relation to modern humans
The Mauer mandible is the type specimen of the species Homo heidelbergensis. "The anatomy is clearly more primitive than that of Neanderthal, but the harmoniously rounded dental arch and the complete row of teeth...already typically human." Based on these circumstances—the chronological delineation from the more recent Neanderthal on the one hand, and from older fossils, denoted as Homo erectus on the other—today's researchers consider it justifiable to declare Mauer 1 as an independent chronospecies. According to Chris Stringer, Homo heidelbergensis ranks separable between earlier Homo erectus and the more recent Neanderthal and Homo sapiens; it is from this point of view the last common ancestor of Neanderthal and anatomically modern man.
Other researchers hold the contrary view that the evolutionary development in Africa and Europe was a gradual process from Homo erectus via the representative of the findings assigned to Homo heidelbergensis towards Neanderthal. Any form of segregation is considered arbitrary, which is why these researchers forgo the name Homo heidelbergensis altogether. They classify the Mauer 1 man as a late local (European) form of Homo erectus.
However, there is agreement among all paleo-anthropologists that the lower jaw of Mauer does not belong to the immediate ancestral line of modern man.  They are regarded rather as a descendant of an early migration to Europe and Asia (depending on the terminology—of Homo erectus or Homo heidelbergensis), whose oldest fossils outside of Africa are about 1.8 million years old. The last descendant of this first migration to Europe was Neanderthal, who became extinct about 30,000 years ago. Members of the species Homo sapiens arrived in Europe only in a second migratory wave of the genus Homo at around 40,000 to 30,000 years ago, whose descendants include modern man.
Habitat
As uncertain as the exact dating of the lower jaw of Mauer was until recently, so is the assignment of other fossils to its layer. Such contextual fossils are the only direct evidence for an accurate reconstruction of the habitat of a find. Not until 1991 two sets of core drilling were conducted in the defunct sand mine of Grafenrain and—beginning in 1995, several dozen cubic meters of sand were screened in search of fossil fragments that could shed light on accompanying species. However, mice teeth that were found proved to be not suitable for a more precise dating of the layer, since these mice lived anatomically virtually unchanged over too long a period. At least palynological findings of similar vegetation areas of the Cromer interglacial period can help with a description of the habitat.: "across alluvial forests in the river valleys, forests on the slopes and open forests on the heights; these were rather dry locations, regarding the hydro-geology of the crevasses () of the Buntsandstein—and Muschelkalk mountains, bare of any Loess sediments."
Animal fossils from different layers of the sand mine Grafenrain that were clearly identified and belonged to the same interglacial epoch as the find layer, inspired the author of a 2007 article of Die Zeit to a vivid diorama:
"...among spruce, birch and oak trees romped flying squirrels, roamed roe deer, elk and wild boar. Mole and shrew tunnelled through the grounds. And: Beavers damming the waters of the juvenile Neckar river. Hares flitted and horses galloped across open landscapes. Theoretically, nature provided steaks of elephant, the woolly rhinoceros and hippopotamus. Whether the "Heidelberger" ventured on such prey, must be doubted. Almost certainly they took to their heels in front of bear, wolf, leopard, saber-toothed cat and hyena."

David 'Dan' Stannard (born 1937 Peshawar, Pakistan of British parents) was a Zimbabwe police officer who became a Branch Director of the Central Intelligence Organisation, under Ken Flower, thus serving under both the Ian Smith and Robert Mugabe administrations. They subsequently became manager of Zimbabwe's cricket team in addition to overseeing security for the Zimbabwe Cricket Union.
Stannard, joined the British South Africa Police (BSAP) in March 1957, becoming a career police officer, and a detective in the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), serving with distinction. During their tenure in the CID, they served in several specialist sections, including the Fraud Squad and later headed the section dealing with serious crimes of violence. Early in their career, they were responsible for investigating the Crocodile Gang (a member of which was eventually to become their political master) for murders and other serious crimes while stationed in the Manicaland Province. At one time they investigated elements of Rhodesia's most prestigious military unit – the Selous Scouts – concerning allegations of poaching and ivory trafficking. Dan Stannard was seconded to the Rhodesian Special Branch (SB) as Acting Provincial Special Branch Officer, Salisbury and Mashonaland, shortly before Zimbabwean independence.
At the time of Independence in 1980, Stannard was appointed the official Liaison Officer to work with both ZANU and ZAPU guerrillas who were then based at the Audio Visual Centre at the University. After independence they were transferred to Special Branch Headquarters, where they became Deputy Director (Internal) (DDIN) of Branch I, under Mike Reeves.
They later served as the Director Internal (DIN) of CIO, effectively the head of the Rhodesian Special Branch and oversaw internal intelligence-gathering for the CIO. At the time Zimbabwe was celebrating its new found independence, Stannard foiled an assassination attempt on Zimbabwean presidential elect Robert Mugabe by a South African fifth column in 1980, an event for which they were awarded the Gold Cross of Zimbabwe.
As a senior adviser to the post-independence regime, Stannard and many former Rhodesian agents were retained to train their successors. Emmerson Mnangagwa, the first minister of security, transferred all SB members into the CIO to obviate intelligence getting into the possession of Joshua Nkomo, who was then Minister of Home Affairs. The modus operandi of Rhodesia's campaign to infiltrate political parties, silence public demonstrations, and destabilise action groups during the colonial period were thus passed on to a new generation of partisan intelligence operatives.
After retiring from the CIO in 1992, Stannard became manager of the Zimbabwe cricket team. As many white cricketers, loyally representing their nation, had family affected by the government's chaotic land redistribution efforts, they found themselves involved with their pleas and then lobbying for land redesignation to avoid the Mugabe purge, but not always with success.
Stannard's brother Richard, a former British military police officer, was a public relations officer for the Rhodesian Security Forces during the long-running bush war. Richard later joined the Zimbabwe Intelligence Corps to serve alongside Danny. Their nephew, also Richard Stannard, was a much-decorated veteran of the Rhodesian SAS and South African Special Forces who later became embroiled with an attempted coup d'etat in the Seychelles.

There were 2,816 households, out of which 33.60% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 52.30% were married couples living together, 12.50% had a female householder with no husband present, and 29.80% were non-families. 27.00% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.70% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.45 and the average family size was 2.96.
In the county, the population was spread out, with 25.90% under the age of 18, 9.40% from 18 to 24, 28.50% from 25 to 44, 23.50% from 45 to 64, and 12.70% who were 65 years of age or older.

Politics
Wolfe County, like most of Eastern Kentucky is historically Democratic. In 2000, George W. Bush narrowly won the county and became the first Republican to do so, but the county still proved its Democratic loyalty by supporting John Kerry by a comfortable margin in the next election. However, the county has indeed drifted away from the Democrats at the presidential level as Mitt Romney won the county 60% to 30% in 2012, and Donald Trump with an even wider margin of 68% to 28%.
Wolfe remained reliably Democratic at the state level for some time after ceasing to favor the Democratic Party at the presidential level; it voted against Matt Bevin in both of their gubernatorial elections, and, along with nearby Elliott County, it was, until 2020, one of only two counties in Kentucky to have voted against Senator Mitch McConnell in each of their elections. In 2020, however, both counties voted for McConnell over their Democratic challenger, Amy McGrath.

Thracia or Thrace ( Thrakē) is the ancient name given to the southeastern Balkan region, the land inhabited by the Thracians. Thrace was ruled by the Odrysian kingdom during the Classical and Hellenistic eras, and briefly by the Greek Diadochi ruler Lysimachus, but became a client state of the late Roman Republic and early Roman Empire as the Sapaean kingdom. Roman emperor Claudius annexed the kingdom as a Roman province in 46 AD.
Confines
From the perspective of classical Greece, Thracia included the territory north of Thessaly, with no definite boundaries,<ref>{{cite book |first=Thomas |last=Swinburne Carr |title=The history and geography of Greece |publisher=Simpkin, Marshall & Company |year=1838 |page=56 |url=https://archive.org/details/historyandgeogr00carrgoog }}</ref> sometimes to the inclusion of Macedonia and Scythia Minor. Later, Thracia proper was understood to include the territory bordered by the Danube on the north, by the Black Sea on the east, by Macedonia in the south and by Illyria to the west, roughly equivalent with the territory of the Thracian kingdom as it stood during the 5th to 1st centuries BC.
With the annexation of the Thracian kingdom by the Roman Empire, by order of emperor Claudius, in AD 46, Thracia (formally provincia Thracia "Thracian province", "eparchy of the Thracians") was established as a Roman province. After the administrative reforms of the 3rd century, Thracia was reduced to the territory of the six small provinces of the
Diocese of Thrace. Later still, the medieval Byzantine theme of Thracia contained only what today is Eastern Thrace.
Under the Principate
The Odrysian kingdom of Thrace became a Roman client kingdom c. 20 BC, while the Greek city-states on the Black Sea coast came under Roman control as civitates foederatae ("allied" cities with internal autonomy). After the death of the Thracian king Rhoemetalces III in 46 AD and an unsuccessful anti-Roman revolt, the kingdom was annexed as the Roman province of Thracia.
The new province encompassed not only the lands of the former Odrysian realm, but also the north-eastern portion of the province of Macedonia as well as the islands of Thasos, Samothrace and Imbros in the Aegean Sea. To the north, Thracia bordered the province of Moesia Inferior; initially, the provincial boundary ran at a line north of the Haeumus Mountains, including the cities of Nicopolis ad Istrum and Marcianopolis in Thracia, but by the end of the 2nd century AD the border had moved south along the Haemus. The area of the Thracian Chersonese (modern Gallipoli Peninsula) was excluded from its governor's purview and administered as part of the emperor's personal domains. The province's first capital, where the Roman governor resided, was Heraclea Perinthus. Thracia was an imperial province, headed initially by a procurator, and, after c. 107/109, by a legatus Augusti pro praetore. Otherwise, the internal structure of the old Thracian kingdom was retained and only gradually superseded by Roman institutions. The old tribal-based strategiai ("generalcies"), headed by a strategos ("general"), were retained as the main administrative divisions, but some villages were grouped together into kōmarchiai ("village headships") or subordinated to neighbouring cities (the two Roman colonies of colonia Claudia Aprensis and colonia Flavia Pacis Deueltensium and several Greek cities, many of whom were founded by Trajan), which were set apart. In the mid-1st century, the strategiai numbered fifty, but the progressive expansion of the cities and the land assigned to them reduced their number: by the early 2nd century, they had decreased to fourteen, and c. 136 they were abolished altogether as official administrative divisions.
As it was an interior province, far from the borders of the Empire, and having a major Roman road (Via Egnatia) that passed through the region, Thrace remained peaceful and prosperous until the Crisis of the Third Century, when it was repeatedly raided by Goths from beyond the Danube. During the campaigns to confront these raiders, Emperor Decius (r. 249–251) fell in the Battle of Abritus in 251. Thracia suffered especially heavily in the great Gothic seaborne raids of 268–270, and it was not until 271 that Emperor Aurelian (r. 270–275) was able to secure the Balkan provinces against Gothic raids for some time to come.
Generally, the provincial and urban policy of Roman emperors, with the foundation of several cities of Greek type (city-state), contributed more to the progress of Hellenization than to the Romanization of Thrace. So by the end of Roman antiquity, the phenomenon of Romanization occurs only upon the Lower Moesia, while Thrace lying south of the Haemus mountains had been almost completely Hellenized.
As regards the Thracian dispersion outside the borders (extra fines provinciae), from epigraphic evidence we know the presence of many Thracians (mostly soldiers) throughout the Roman Empire from Syria and Arabia to Britain.D. Samsaris, Les Thraces dans l' Empire romain d' Orient (Asie Mineure, Syrie, Palestine et Arabie), Dodona 19 (1), 1989, p. 5-30
Late antiquity
Under the administrative reforms of Diocletian (r. 284–305), Thracia's territory was divided into four smaller provinces: Thracia, Haemimontus, Rhodope and Europa.
The new province of Thracia comprised the northwestern portion of the old province, i.e. the upper valley of the Hebrus river between Haemus and Rhodope and including Philippopolis (in Thracia), which had become the provincial capital in the early 3rd century. It was headed by a governor with the rank of consularis.
The four Thracian provinces, along with the two provinces of Moesia Inferior, were grouped into the diocese of Thraciae, which in turn was part of the Prefecture of the East. Militarily, the entire region was under the control of the magister militum per Thracias''.

Unlockable content refers to content that is available in video games but not accessible unless something is performed by the player to get access to it. Different genres of games have different styles and options of unlockable content that is standard among their games. The unlockable content varies, and can be as little as a single weapon or enhancement, to more than doubling the playable characters available to the player.
Methods
Presale exclusives
Many games, such as Left 4 Dead 2 and Battlefield: Bad Company 2, offer presales that come with exclusive unlockable content. In order to get these exclusives, one must order the game through the retailer before it is available for sale, with a small deposit to guarantee the game. Once this presale is made, the buyer gets a code to use to get the unlockable content once the game is available. This has been done by many companies worldwide, such as North America's GameStop, UK's Game and many other retailers.
Achievements
Some games have established replayability for players through a rewards system. Once the player does unique or difficult actions in a game, such as killing a boss in a limited time, or collecting a certain number of items over the course of playing the game, or merely progressing through the game in general, the player can earn a reward, potentially unlocking more content, such as additional items for the player to use or vanity items to show the player's prowess at achievements.
The Xbox 360 introduced an achievement framework as a core feature of its system software and online platform Xbox Live; all games released on the console are required to include achievements, which are labeled with a title, description, and icon, and are ranked with point values based on their rarity and degree of difficulty (with retail releases required to have 1,000 points worth of achievements before downloadable content). Achievements and total points earned (Gamerscore) are also tabulated on users' Xbox Live profiles, which created a metagame of players attempting to complete all possible achievements in a game, and trying to increase their cumulative Gamerscore across a variety of Xbox 360 titles. Microsoft subsequently extended Xbox achievements to future Xbox video game consoles (including Xbox One), and Xbox Live-enabled games on Microsoft Windows.
Other video game platforms introduced achievement systems of their own, including the PC digital distribution service Steam, and PlayStation Network "Trophies" on PlayStation 3 in 2008 (which function similarly to Xbox achievements, but are instead ranked as either bronze, silver, or gold, with a "Platinum" trophy awarded for earning all other trophies in a specific game). In 2009, video game publisher Ubisoft introduced an achievement framework specific to its titles as part of its Uplay platform (later renamed Ubisoft Club and Ubisoft Connect), where points earned by completing designated "actions" can be redeemed for rewards and unlocks in other titles published by the company.
In the 2010s, achievement-based unlocks became a prominent aspect of the "battle pass" —a monetization strategy for games where players purchase a collection of challenges intended to be completed within a fixed timeframe, with each completed challenge earning experience points that level up the pass to unlock reward tiers (usually cosmetic items and skins).
Internet usage
Sometimes, the only action necessary to unlock new content is Internet availability. Games like Professor Layton and the Curious Village offered players additional puzzles every week by downloading the puzzles from the Internet over the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection available in all the Nintendo DS handhelds.
Hidden items
Sometimes a player can unlock content by collecting hidden items found throughout the game. Some games offer a purchase system of additional content, such as images, wallpapers, music and such, great example is the .hack video game series, by collecting the hidden items and redeeming them for the unlockable content. Sometimes the player can get these unlockables based on the total amount of hidden items found.

USS Kane (DD-235/APD-18) was a Clemson-class destroyer in the United States Navy during World War II. They were the first ship named for Elisha Kent Kane.
Construction and commissioning
Kane was laid down 3 July 1918 and launched 12 August 1919 by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation; sponsored by Miss Florence Kane, cousin of Elisha Kent Kane; and commissioned 11 June 1920.
Service history
Kane departed Newport, Rhode Island 20 August 1920 for their shakedown cruise to Gibraltar, Brest, Copenhagen, Danzig, and the Gulf of Riga. They were just outside the Gulf in the Baltic Sea 1 October 1920 and supposedly well clear of the minefields laid in World War I when a mine exploded, bending their port engine shafts and port propeller struts. After repair at Landskrona, Sweden, and overhaul at Chatham, England, they sailed 21 May 1921 for the Mediterranean.
On 22 June 1921, Kane rescued an Italian torpedo boat drifting upon the rocks off Cape Spartivento. On 3 July, they reached Constantinople for relief work in Turkish waters. They returned to Newport 23 August. They sailed 2 October with Destroyer Squadron 14 to evacuate refugees and perform other relief work in Asia Minor. They arrived in Constantinople 22 October, and was constantly used to carry supplies, medical aid, refugees and relief officials between ports of the Black Sea and the Eastern Mediterranean. They departed Constantinople 18 May 1923, and spent the next five years with the Scouting Fleet operating along the United States East Coast and in the Caribbean. They departed New York 13 February 1925 for a fleet training cruise to San Diego, California, and from there they sailed to Pearl Harbor and returned 17 July. In the spring of 1927 the destroyer patrolled off bandit-plagued Nicaragua and the Honduras. They decommissioned in the Philadelphia Navy Yard 31 December 1930.
Kane recommissioned 1 April 1932, and departed Philadelphia 29 June for San Diego, their base for the next four years. They got underway from San Diego 27 April 1936 for fleet exercises in the Caribbean before entering the New York Navy Yard to prepare for special service.
Kane departed New York 17 August 1936 for Spain to evacuate American citizens whose lives were endangered by the civil war in Spain. On 30 August, en route to Bilbao, they had to open fire three times to drive off a tri-motored monoplane dropping bombs within a hundred yards of the destroyer. A strong protest to both Spanish Civil War factions was made, and this forestalled similar incidents. They called at Bilbao and Gijon, embarking refugees who were taken to St. Jean de Luz, France.
arrived at Gibraltar 27 September 1936 as flagship of Squadron Forty-T commanded by Rear Admiral Arthur P. Fairfield. This special squadron, initially comprising Raleigh, Kane, and , saved hundreds of American and other nationals from the dangers of the war in Spain. Kane and Hatfield were relieved by and 9 November 1937 and sailed for home. Kane entered the Charleston Navy Yard 22 November, and decommissioned 28 April 1938.
World War II
Kane recommissioned 23 September 1939 to serve in the Neutrality Patrol in the North Atlantic. On 7 August they took up inshore defensive patrol along both coastlines of Panama. They then steamed to San Diego, arriving 4 November 1940, to patrol off the coast of California. They overhauled in the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard from 4 January to 3 March 1941, they were based at Seattle for patrols north to Alaska, and along the United States West Coast. After the Japanese struck Pearl Harbor, they departed Seattle, Washington for Kodiak, Alaska, and escorted troop transports back to Seattle 23 December. Following a similar escort voyage, they arrived at Seward 19 April 1942 for inter-island convoy and submarine patrols among Alaskan ports.
On 11 June, Kane rescued 11 survivors of the torpedoed SS Arcata. The morning of 3 August 1942, they found their antiaircraft guns of little use against two attacks by high-altitude Japanese bombers. Evasion tactics and speed saved the destroyer from bombs which fell in their wake. They continued patrol and escort duty in Alaskan and Aleutian sectors until February 1942, then was converted to high-speed transport by Todd's Dry Docks, Seattle, Washington, and reclassified APD-18 on 25 March 1943. Conversion was completed by 3 April 1943, when they departed for amphibious training with the Army's 7th infantry in Monterey Bay, California.
Kane departed San Francisco 24 April and arrived in Cold Bay 30 April to prepare for the recapture of Attu, Aleutian Islands. The morning of 11 May, and landed 100 Army scouts northwest of Holtz Bay. Several hours later, Kane was coached in through very dense fog by s radar to land 400 reconnaissance troops, who then joined the scouts.
During the ground fighting on Attu, Kane served as evacuation hospital transport and shuttled medical supplies between Holtz and Massacre Bay. Off the entrance to Dutch Harbor 17 July, they received 12 survivors of the Russian Seiner No. 2. Following amphibious exercises off Amchitka Island, they landed elements of the Army's 1st Special Service Force on Kiska 14 August and later on Little Kiska Island. But the Japanese had evacuated under cover of fog, leaving a few mongrel dogs as sole inhabitants. This marked the end of the last Japanese hold in the Aleutians. Kane remained on duty between Alaskan and Aleutian ports until 20 November 1943, then steamed south for an overhaul in the Mare Island Navy Yard until 7 January 1944.
Kane arrived in Pearl Harbor 18 January 1944 to join the 5th Amphibious Force for the capture of the Marshall Islands. Them Marine escort secured the channel islets at the entrance of Majuro Lagoon on the night of 30 to 31 January 1944 and later took the islands on the east side of Kwajalein Lagoon. They sailed 25 February to help screen amphibious landing ships for the invasion of Milne Bay, New Guinea, then entered Seeadler Harbor, Manus, as the 7th Cavalry Regiment took the remaining strong point in the Admiralty Islands. The high speed transport landed men of the 163d Infantry at Aitape 22 April 1944, and bombarded enemy positions before withdrawing to shell Ali Island. After escorting a convoy to the Solomon Islands they returned to Pearl Harbor 23 May 1944.
After training out of Pearl Harbor and preparations at Eniwetok, Kane landed Marines for the invasion of Saipan 15 June 1944. After the fast carriers of the 5th Fleet destroyed Japan's carrier-based airpower in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, the transport supported Underwater Demolition Team 4 in operations off Saipan. On 23 June, they dodged an aerial bomb that sprayed them with shrapnel and wounded three men. They replenished at Eniwetok, then entered Agat Bay, Guam, the afternoon of 17 July. The Japanese had planted three lines of palm-log cribs filled with coral rocks, linked each to the other by wire cables as antiship defences. Them "naked warriors" of Underwater Demolition Team 4, assisted by other teams, blew up hundreds of these obstacles, clearing the way for the marines, who landed 21 July 1944. On 24 July, as the frogmen worked into the night, Japanese mortar fire in Agat Bay barely missed Kane. They returned to Pearl Harbor 10 August 1944, but entered Leyte Gulf 18 October carrying 100 tons of demolition explosives to be used in clearing the way for the Leyte Invasion landings 2 days later. They carried their demolition teams to the Admiralty Islands, then set course for home and an overhaul arriving San Pedro, California, 4 December.
Kane departed San Diego 20 April 1945 to train Underwater Demolition Team 24 in Hawaiian waters until 4 May, then arrived off Kerama Retto 12 June. After escorting out of the combat zone, they patrolled the southwest anchorage of Ilinawa and fought off two kamikazes 21 June. A week later they sailed with a convoy bound for Leyte. They became a unit of the Philippine Sea Frontier on 4 July and patrolled the shipping lanes leading eastward guarding against submarines until the end of hostilities.
Kane departed San Pedro Bay, Leyte, 13 September escorting occupation troops to Korea, arriving Jinsen 17 September. Thereafter, they became an unofficial receiving ship and handled communications for the Jinsen representative of the 7th Amphibious Force. Relieved 12 November 1945, they headed for home arrived San Diego 13 December 1945.
After sending 149 Navy veterans ashore, they transited the Panama Canal for the Philadelphia Navy Yard, where they decommissioned 24 January 1946. They were sold for scrapping 21 June 1946 to Northern Metals Company, Philadelphia.

Enemy is an American band fronted by guitarist and vocalist Troy Van Leeuwen (also of Queens of the Stone Age), with bassist Eddie Nappi (Handsome, Mark Lanegan Band), and drummer Kelli Scott (Failure). Former Quicksand drummer Alan Cage was a founding member before being replaced by Scott. Van Leeuwen has described Enemy as their "big, dumb rock trio".
History
The concept for Enemy originated following the demise of Troy Van Leeuwen's previous band, Failure. In the interim, Van Leeuwen had joined A Perfect Circle, and Enemy managed to record a five-song demo during their downtime from touring:
Taking the unusual step of offering to be signed by a record label by advertising for $250,000 on eBay, Enemy were ultimately signed by Control Group/TCG and released their debut album Hooray for Dark Matter in 2005.

Isabella of Ibelin (1241–1324) was queen of Cyprus and Jerusalem by marriage to Hugh III of Cyprus.
Isabella was the daughter of Guy of Ibelin, marshal and constable of the Kingdom of Cyprus.
They married Hugh of Antioch, who succeeded their childless cousin Hugh II as king of Cyprus in 1267 thanks to their family's connections. In 1268, their husband became king of Jerusalem too. They died in 1284 and the crowns passed to their sons, first John I and shortly after to Henry II.
When their son Amalric seized power in 1306, Queen Isabella and their brother Philip unsuccessfully supported their older son King Henry. Amalric was murdered on 5 June 1310, and another son, Aimery, was proclaimed governor in their stead. But by 11 June, supporters of the imprisoned king contacted their mother, Queen Isabella, papal representatives, and Aimery's party. Aimery was outnumbered and agreed with their supporters to restore Henry in return for Isabella's promise to persuade Henry to pardon them and to ratify legal transactions they made. Envoys reported to King James II of Aragon, husband of Isabella's daughter Maria, that Isabella and Philip dominated Henry's court in the rest of their reign.
Issue
Isabella and Hugh III had the following children:

Tin Cup is a 1996 American romantic comedy and sports film co-written and directed by Ron Shelton, and starring Kevin Costner and Rene Russo with Cheech Marin and Don Johnson in major supporting roles. The film received generally positive reviews and was a moderate box office success, grossing $75.8 million against its $45 million budget. Costner received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.
Plot
Roy "Tin Cup" McAvoy is a former golf prodigy leading a generally aimless existence. They own a ramshackle driving range in West Texas, where they drink and hangs out with their pal Romeo Posar and their friends. One day Dr. Molly Griswold, a clinical psychologist, arrives looking for a golf lesson. They have been dating David Simms, a top professional golfer who played with Roy in college. Roy soon becomes attracted to Molly.
The next day David Simms shows up at Roy's trailer ahead of a local benefit tournament. Roy thinks they are being invited to play, but Simms actually wants to hire them as a caddie (since Roy knows the course). During the round, Roy needles Simms about laying up instead of having the nerve to take a 230-yard shot over a water hazard. A bet among the other players is made and Simms fires Roy after they make the long shot.
To get even with Simms, Roy decides to try to qualify for the U.S. Open. They make a play for Molly who is already their therapist.
In the first qualifying round, with Romeo as their caddie, Roy's game is excellent but their head needs help. Roy insists on playing recklessly and they demand the driver instead of the safe play which is laying up. Roy and Romeo fight and Romeo quits. Amazingly, Roy still manages to advance to the final qualifying round.
Without Romeo, Roy barely succeeds at the sectional qualifying round, earning a spot in the U.S. Open. Romeo returns and helps Roy with some swing problems.
On the first day of the U.S Open, Roy shoots a horrendous 83. Meanwhile, Molly sees Simms' unpleasant side and decides they truly want to help Roy. With renewed confidence, McAvoy shocks the golf world by making the cut with an impressive score. Roy's third round is also excellent and it moves them into contention.
On the last day of the U.S. Open tournament, Roy is in a three-way battle to win. For the fourth day in a row, Roy takes a shot that repeatedly fails to keep the ball out of the water hazard. On their twelfth and final shot, facing disqualification, they reach the green and amazingly, it goes in the hole. Roy realizes that they have blown a shot at winning the U.S. Open, but Molly re-assures them about how people will always remember their amazing shot.
Back in Texas, Molly tells Roy that they automatically qualified for next year's Open due to their standing. They kiss passionately as the movie ends.

Tin Cup was based on a story by Ron Shelton and Tim Norville inspired by the vulgar expression, "He's (She's) not worth a fart in a tin cup." It was scripted by Norville and received a rewrite from Shelton. Costner joined the project in June 1995, having previous worked with Shelton on Bull Durham. Filming was due to start on September 15, 1995.
Janine Turner was reportedly the first choice for the role of Molly Griswold, but they turned it down. Michelle Pfeiffer was also approached before Rene Russo was then cast. Pierce Brosnan and Alec Baldwin were considered for the part of David Simms, before Don Johnson was placed in the film. John Leguizamo was offered the character of Romeo Posar until Cheech Marin stepped in to do the role.
Kevin Costner trained extensively with Gary McCord to learn how to play golf, as stated in the foreword Costner wrote for McCord's book, Golf For Dummies. McCord helped Costner develop a swing and pre-shot routine, is listed in the end credits as a golf consultant, and has a cameo appearance in the film.
The film's climactic scenes take place at a fictional U.S. Open tournament set in North Carolina. Some of the film was shot in Kingwood, Texas, and some was shot at Tubac GC in Tubac, Arizona. The movie's 18th hole is actually the 13th hole on Kingwood's Deerwood course; the lake that guards the front of the green on this beautiful and difficult par-5, actually a par 4 in real life, was built for the movie by the film company.
There are (credited) cameo appearances by pro golfers Phil Mickelson, Craig Stadler, John Cook, Johnny Miller, Lee Janzen, Billy Mayfair, Corey Pavin, Fred Couples and Peter Jacobsen—as well as TV golf broadcasters Jim Nantz, Ken Venturi, Gary McCord, Ben Wright, Frank Chirkinian, Lance Barrow, Peter Kostis, Jimmy Roberts, Brian Hammonds and George Michael—all playing themselves.
Many of the golf shots by Costner's character Roy McAvoy were made by Costner himself.
The scene at the end of the movie in which Roy McAvoy repeatedly reaches the water hazard is based on a true incident. Gary McCord, an actual commentator and pro on the Champions Tour, needed a birdie to win. They kept reaching the hazard and it took them 15 strokes to reach the green, then just one putt, from 25 feet, to complete the par-4 hole. In the movie, McAvoy holes out the shot in 12.
The ball of Costner's that knocked a pelican off its perch is also based upon a true incident involving McCord.
The film included product placement from Taylor Made. Don Johnson's character David Simms uses a Taylor Made golf bag and clubs. Costner also used Taylor Made, but the prop department repainted and sanded the clubs to make them look suitably rough.

An annual golf tournament located in Charlotte, NC that benefits the American Cancer Society is named the "Tin Cup Tournament". It is the American Cancer Society's largest single-day golf event in the Carolinas. Play is always on the second Monday of August. The 2004 REMAX World Long Drive Champion, David Mobley, is an annual celebrity guest. Most recently, the location is at Ballantyne Resort Golf Course. A yearly golf outing in Appleton, WI is called the Tin Cup Open and players are only able to play with a 7 iron club, inspired by McAvoy's qualifying meltdown. The outing raises funds for the local Early Intervention Program of Outagamie and Winnebago Counties and is a yearly big draw.
In a 1998 tournament, members of the gallery watching John Daly started shouting “Tin Cup” as they hit ball after ball in the water on their way to scoring 18 on a par-5 hole.
After carding a quadruple bogey and a double bogey on the 17th and 18th holes of the 2013 Players Championship, "Tin Cup" became a nickname for professional golfer Sergio García.
Eddie Pepperell was disqualified from a tournament in 2019 after running out of balls in a moment that was compared to the movie.
Reception
Box office
The movie debuted at No. 1. In its opening weekend the film earned $10.1 million and went on to earn $54 million at the US box office, and a worldwide total of $75.8 million against a budget of $45 million.
Critical response
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 72% based on reviews from 53 critics. The site's consensus states: "Breezy and predictable, Tin Cup is a likeable sports comedy that benefits greatly from Kevin Costner's amiable lead performance." On Metacritic the film has a score of 60 out of 100, based on reviews from 19 critics. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B on scale of A to F.
Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 out of 4 and wrote: "Well written. The dialogue is smart and fresh." Todd McCarthy of Variety magazine wrote: "Amiable and constantly amusing rather than uproarious, this mangy tale of a ne'er-do-well's fitful assault on personal and professional respectability benefits greatly from Kevin Costner's ingratiatingly comic star turn, their most appealing work in years."

John William Goode Jr. (March 10, 1923 – February 5, 1994) was a lawyer in San Antonio who was a figure in the 1950s and 1960s rebirth of the Republican Party in Texas.
Background
Goode was a son of the physician John Goode Sr. (1886–1959) and the former Claudia Alice Nolte (1895–1969). In 1939, shortly after their sixteenth birthday, they graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School. They attended Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, for three years from 1939 to 1942, ultimately receiving their bachelor's degree in 1943 from the University of Texas at Austin.
Military
During World War II, Goode served in the United States Marine Corps as a combat infantry platoon leader and executive officer in the South Pacific battles of Cape Gloucester, New Britain, Peleliu, and Okinawa. In the two latter battles, they were wounded. They were honorably discharged in 1945 at the rank of captain. At Peleliu, as a second lieutenant, they received the Silver Star for courageous actions on September 27, 1944. When their platoon encountered the Japanese on a hill, Goode brought forward a machine-gun section. They pushed through hostile machine-gun and rifle fire which had already caused the death of one of their men and the wounding of two others. Twenty enemy soldiers were killed. Later in the day, Goode again braved hostile fire but managed to return to their support squad. Their calm under hostile action and leadership in battle were determined to have saved the lives of many of their men. Their superiors concluded that Goode's "gallant devotion to duty reflects great credit on [him] and the United States Naval Service." Goode received the Bronze Star and a Presidential Unit Citation.
Family
In 1949, Goode married the former Janet Irwin, who died prior to 2003. The couple's two sons were John III and George Irwin Goode, who predeceased their father. Goode III, known as "Grizzly" or "Johnny", was an artist and graphic designer who worked in the restaurant and nightclub business in San Antonio and was a state judo champion.
Goode's sister, Eleanor Goode Brune (1927–2005), served as the national committeewoman of the Young Republican Federation of Texas from 1950 to 1956. Like their brother, they were a UT graduate. They also attended the Worden School of Social Work at Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio and was active in social work programs, having organized the Volunteer Service Bureau and worked with blind children. They retired to the rural but historic Crowell community in Foard County in West Texas. Eleanor's husband and Goode's brother-in-law, David H. Brune (1930–2007), a native of California, was in legal partnership with Goode from 1958 to 1962.
Law and politics
After the war, Goode completed their studies in 1948 at the University of Texas School of Law. For two-and-a-half years, they were acting first assistant district attorney in the office of the Bexar County District Attorney. They entered private practice thereafter and was involved during the course of their legal career in several firms, beginning with Hardy & Goode and ending with Goode, Casseb & Jones, now Goode, Casseb, Jones, Riklin, Choate & Watson. "He was so devoted to their law practice that, it was their hobby. ... They enjoyed corporate law and not the glamorous criminal law as much, although they did do some criminal cases," recalled their son, John W. Goode III.
Goode worked on the successful Dwight D. Eisenhower presidential campaign in 1952. They were a chairperson of the San Antonio Municipal Civil Service Commission, and they were a Republican county chairperson. They were a delegate to the 1960 Republican National Convention held in Chicago to nominate the unsuccessful Nixon-Lodge ticket. In November 1961, they were the Republican candidate in a special election for the United States House of Representatives for Texas's 20th congressional district but was defeated by the Democrat, Henry B. Gonzalez, the first Hispanic to serve in both the Texas State Senate and as a member of Congress from Texas. Goode had been hopeful of a political upset after former president Dwight Eisenhower flew to San Antonio to campaign with Goode. The candidate also received support from a Conservative Democratic group. Mexican film star Cantinflas appeared with Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson at San Antonio shopping centers and supermarkets to rally voters for Gonzalez.
Earlier that same year in the spring of 1961, Gonzalez had lost out in another special election for the United States Senate seat formerly held by Vice President Johnson. Victory in that race went in a major upset to John Tower, the first Republican to represent Texas in the upper legislative chamber in the 20th century.
In November 1993, three months before their death, Goode was inducted into the Bexar County Republican Party's newly established Hall of Fame. Goode was active in several civic organizations and fraternities, including the Texas Cavaliers, Texas Law Foundation, the San Antonio Bar Association, and the Order of the Alamo.
Goode died in San Antonio a month prior to their 71st birthday.

Ethiopia competed at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 7 September to 18 September 2016.
Background
Ethiopian Paralympians had difficulty getting internal funding for their Paralympic efforts. Their national federation provided no money for equipment, and in the lead up to the Rio Games, most trained barefoot.
Disability classifications
Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.
Medallists
Ethiopia finished tied for ninth among African countries for total gold medals, winning one silver. Uganda and the Ivory Coast also won a single silver medal.
Athletics
One of the members of the Ethiopian delegation was Tamiru Demisse, who won silver in the 1,500 meters. Demisse hoped that following the Rio Games, one day they could represent the United States or Canada at the Paralympics.

In the Battle of Ceva on 16 April 1796, troops of the First French Republic under Pierre Augereau fought against part of the army of the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont led by General Giuseppe Felice, Count Vital. Augereau assaulted the strong defensive position without success. At the direction of the Sardinian army commander, Feldmarschal-Leutnant Michelangelo Colli, Vital withdrew on the 17th in order to avoid being trapped by a second French division.
Campaign
Operations
The Montenotte Campaign began on 10 April when Feldzeugmeister Johann Beaulieu's Austrian army attacked the extreme right flank of General of Division (MG) Napoleon Bonaparte's army near Genoa. Bonaparte launched a successful counterattack on 12 April at the Battle of Montenotte. On 13 April, MG Augereau's reinforced division defeated part of Colli's Sardinian army at the Battle of Millesimo. In the Second Battle of Dego on 14 and 15 April, the Austrians were defeated again. While Beaulieu reorganized their badly shaken army at Acqui Terme to the northeast, Bonaparte prepared to increase the separation between the Piedmontese from their Austrian allies by driving Colli farther to the west.
On 15 April, Colli assembled a force on high ground at Montezemolo in order to cover the fortress of Ceva. Meanwhile, MG Jean Sérurier's division advanced from Ormea north toward Ceva along the Tanaro River valley. Fearing they might be cut off from Ceva, the Piedmontese commander fell back to the fortress. Marching from the east, Augereau occupied Montezemolo early on 16 April, then their division moved north and west in an attempt to outflank Ceva.
Forces
See the Montenotte 1796 Campaign Order of Battle for a list of French, Austrian, and Sardinian units and organizations.
Battle
In 1796, the fortress loomed over the north side of Ceva. The Sardinians deployed atop a ridge that runs from the fortress north about seven kilometers to the hamlet of La Pedaggera, where the modern SP 661 and SP 32 intersect. Sardinian and Austrian engineers had fortified the ridge, which overlooks the Bovina stream, with a series of redoubts. General Brempt held the north end of the line with several Piedmontese battalions plus the Austrian Belgioso Infantry Regiment # 44. Vital defended the south end of the line with nine battalions, and General Count di Tornaforte commanded the three battalions in the fortress.
Augereau's division formed several columns under General of Brigade (BG) Martial Beyrand and BG Barthélemy Joubert. Two French columns pressed home their attacks on Brempt's left flank while one column assaulted Vital's position near Mondoni in the center. The Sardinians repelled all attacks on the ridge.
That evening Sérurier camped within sight of Ceva, threatening to turn the southern flank of the Sardinian line. On the northern flank, Brempt reported that they might be cut off if attacked again. Though they had won a defensive success, the mood of the Piedmontese generals was gloomy and they recommended a retreat. That night, Colli held a council of war in which they decided to withdraw most of the army west behind the Corsaglia River, leaving Tornaforte with one battalion to hold Ceva fortress. Some units were sent northwest to Cherasco to prevent the French from cutting between Colli and the Piedmontese capital of Turin.

Augereau occupied the abandoned Sardinian positions on 17 April. Bonaparte decided to mask the fortress with a force under BG Jean Rusca and continue to press the Piedmontese back on Cuneo. The French lost about 600 men killed and wounded. Brempt reported a loss of 150 while Vital's casualties are unknown. The Sardinians won another rear guard action at San Michele Mondovi on 19 April. This was followed by the decisive French victory at the Battle of Mondovì on 21 April.

Christianity in the 8th century was much affected by the rise of Islam in the Middle East.
By the late 8th century, the Muslim empire had conquered all of Persia and parts of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) territory including Egypt, Palestine, and Syria. Suddenly parts of the Christian world were under Muslim rule. Over the coming centuries the Muslim nations became some of the most powerful in the Mediterranean basin.
Though the Roman Church had claimed religious authority over Christians in Egypt and the Levant, in reality the majority of Christians in these regions were miaphysites and other sects that had long been persecuted by Constantinople.
Second Council of Nicea
The Second Council of Nicea was called under Empress Irene in 787. It affirmed the making and veneration of icons while also forbidding the worship of icons and the making of three-dimensional statuary. It reversed the declaration of the earlier Council of Hieria that had called itself the Seventh Ecumenical Council and also nullified its status.
Sometime between 726 and 730 the Byzantine Emperor Leo III the Isaurian ordered the removal of an image of Jesus prominently placed over the Chalke gate, the ceremonial entrance to the Great Palace of Constantinople, and its replacement with a cross. This was followed by orders banning the pictorial representation of the family of Christ, subsequent Christian saints, and biblical scenes. The Council of Hieria had been held under the iconoclast Emperor Constantine V. It met with more than 340 bishops at Constantinople and Hieria in 754, declaring the making of icons of Jesus or the saints an error, mainly for Christological reasons.
Iconoclasm
Iconoclasm was a movement within the Eastern Christian Byzantine church to establish that the Christian culture of portraits of the family of Christ and subsequent Christians and biblical scenes were not of a Christian origin and therefore heretical. This movement was later defined as heretical under the council. The group destroyed much of the Christian churches' art history, which is needed in addressing the traditional interruptions of the Christian faith and the artistic works that in the early church were devoted to Jesus Christ or God. Many works were destroyed during this period.
Two prototypes of icons would be the Christ Pantocrator and the Icon of the Hodegetria. In the West the tradition of icons have been seen as the veneration of "graven images" or against "no graven images" as noted in Exodus 20:4. From the Orthodox point of view graven then would be engraved or carved. Thus this restriction would include many of the ornaments that Moses was commanded to create in the passages right after the commandment was given i.e. the carving of cherubim Exodus 26:1. The commandment as understood by such out of context interpretation would mean "no carved images". This would include the cross and other holy artifacts. The commandment in the East is understood that the people of God are not to create idols and then worship them. It is "right worship" to worship which is of God, which is Holy and that alone.

John of Damascus
John of Damascus
In the Roman Catholic Church, St. John of Damascus, who lived in the 8th century, is generally considered to be the last of the Church Fathers and at the same time the first seed of the next period of church writers, scholasticism.
Tensions between East and West
In the early 8th century, Byzantine iconoclasm became a major source of conflict between the Eastern and Western parts of the Church. Byzantine emperors forbade the creation and veneration of religious images. Other major religions in the East such as Judaism and Islam had similar prohibitions. Pope Gregory III vehemently disagreed
Spread of Christianity
Anglo Saxons
The Germanic peoples underwent gradual Christianization in the course of Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. By the 8th century, most of Anglo-Saxon England and the Frankish Empire was de jure Christian.
In the 8th century, the Franks became standard-bearers of Roman Catholic Christianity in Western Europe, waging wars on its behalf against Arian Christians, Islamic invaders, and pagan Germanic peoples such as the Saxons and Frisians. Until 1066, when the Dane and the Norse had lost their foothold in Britain, theological and missionary work in Germany was largely organized by Anglo-Saxon missionaries, with mixed success. A key event was the felling of Thor's Oak near Fritzlar by Boniface, apostle of the Germans, in 723.
Eventually, the conversion was imposed by armed force and successfully completed by Charlemagne and the Franks in a series of campaigns, starting in 772 with the destruction of their Irminsul and culminating in the defeat and massacre of Saxon leaders at the Bloody Verdict of Verden in 782 and the subjugation of this large tribe.
Frankish Empire
By the 8th century, the Frankish Kingdom, a Germanic kingdom that had originated east of the Rhine, ruled much of western Europe, particularly in what is now France and Germany. The first Frankish king, Clovis had joined the Roman Church in 496 and since that time the Franks had been part of the Church. In 768 Charles, son of King Pepin the Short, succeeded to the Frankish throne. During the 770s Charles the conquered the Lombards in Italy extending the Frankish realm over almost all of Italy. On Christmas Day in 800, the Roman Patriarch Leo III crowned Charles as the Roman Emperor, in essence denying the status of the Roman Empress Irene, reigning in Constantinople. This act caused a substantial diplomatic rift between the Franks and the Eastern Romans, as well as between Rome and the other patriarchs in the East.
Christian missionaries to the Frankish Empire include:
Saint Boniface
Saint Walpurga, Saint Willibald and Saint Winibald (English siblings assisting Boniface)
Wilfrid
Willibrord
Willehad of Bremen
Lebuinus
Saint Ludger
Suitbert of Kaiserwerdt
Saint Pirmin
Saint Corbinian
Scandinavia
Although the Scandinavians became nominally Christian in the 8th century, it took considerably longer for actual Christian beliefs to become established among the people. The old indigenous traditions that had provided security and structure since time immemorial were challenged by ideas that were unfamiliar, such as original sin, the Immaculate Conception, the Trinity and so forth Archaeological excavations of burial sites on the island of Lovön near modern-day Stockholm have shown that the actual Christianization of the people was very slow and took at least 150–200 years, and this was a very central location in the Swedish kingdom. At this time, enough knowledge of Norse mythology remained to be preserved in sources such as the Eddas in Iceland.
Netherlands and non-Frankish Germany
In 698 the Northumbrian Benedictine monk, Saint Willibrord was commissioned by Pope Sergius I as bishop of the Frisians in what is now the Netherlands. Willibrord established a church in Utrecht.
Much of Willibrord's work was wiped out when the pagan Radbod, king of the Frisians destroyed many Christian centres between 716 and 719. In 717, the English missionary Boniface was sent to aid Willibrord, re-establishing churches in Frisia and continuing to preach throughout the pagan lands of Germany. Boniface was killed by pagans in 754.
China
The Nestorian Stele was constructed in 781 as a monument to 150 years of early Christianity in China. It was buried in the ninth century during religious suppression and lay underground until it was discovered in 1625. The top of the monument is adorned not only with a cross but also with the Buddhist emblem of the lotus and the Taoist symbol of the cloud. The writer of the inscription was Jingjing (monk), a monk of the "Luminous Religion,"as well as Buddhism and the calligraphist was Huangbo Xiyun (these two are thought to have later collaborated on some Buddhist writing). It's unclear whether they were commentators or followers of Christianity.
Christianity and Islam
Missionary expansion
Once the Christian faith had been established in the valleys of the Oxus and Jaxartes Rivers, it was easily carried further east into the basin of the Tarim River, then into the area north of the Tien Shan Mountains, and finally down into far northwest China, above Tibet. This was the principal caravan route, and with so many Christians engaged in the trade it was natural that the gospel was early planted in the towns and cities which were caravan centers. The Mesopotamian patriarch in the 8th century wrote that they were appointing a metropolitan for Tibet, implying that their churches were numerous enough to require bishops and lesser clergy. Thus Christians were to be found in Xinjiang, and possibly in Tibet, as early as the 9th century. But it was not until the beginning of the 11th century that the faith spread among the nomadic peoples of this and other central Asian regions. These Christians were chiefly Turko-Tatar peoples, including the Keraites, Onguts, Uyghurs, Naimans, Merkits, and Mongols.
Iberian Peninsula and the Reconquista
Between 711 and 718 the Iberian peninsula had been conquered by Muslims in the Umayyad conquest of Hispania; between 722 and 1492 the Christian kingdoms that later would become Spain and Portugal reconquered it from the Moorish states of Al-Ándalus.
The notorious Spanish Inquisition and Portuguese Inquisition were not installed until 1478 and 1536 when the Reconquista was already (mostly) completed.
The Arabs, under the command of the Berber General Tarik ibn Ziyad, first began their conquest of southern Spain or al-Andalus in 711. A raiding party led by Tarik was sent to intervene in a civil war in the Visigothic kingdomin Hispania. Crossing the Strait of Gibraltar, it won a decisive victory in the summer of 711 when the Visigothic king Roderic was defeated and killed on July 19 at the Battle of Guadalete. Tariq's commander, Musa bin Nusair quickly crossed with substantial reinforcements, and by 718 the Muslims dominated most of the peninsula. There are some later Arabic and Christian sources present an earlier raid by a certain Ṭārif in 710 and one, the Ad Sebastianum recension of the Chronicle of Alfonso III, refers to an Arab attack incited by Erwig during the reign of Wamba (672–680). and two reasonably large armies may have been in the south for a year before the decisive battle was fought.
The rulers of Al-Andalus were granted the rank of Emir by the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid I in Damascus. After the Abbasids came to power in the Middle East, some Umayyads fled to Muslim Spain to establish themselves there.

Line of Sight (stylized as Tom Clancy Line of Sight, Tom Clancy: Line of Sight, or Tom Clancy's Line of Sight in the United Kingdom) is a techno-thriller novel, written by Mike Maden and released on June 12, 2018. It is their second book in the Jack Ryan Jr. series, which is part of the overall Tom Clancy universe. In the novel, Ryan has to avert a sinister plot by Serb extremists to provoke war between NATO and the Russians in the Balkans. It debuted at number three on the New York Times bestseller list.
Plot summary
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Al Qaeda in the Balkans leader Tarik Brkić, who is of Chechen descent, is tasked by their mysterious benefactor Red Wing to orchestrate false flag attacks on Croats, Bosniaks and Serbs in order to disrupt the Unity Referendum, an upcoming national gathering which aims to promote equality among the three rival ethnic groups. At the same time and without Red Wing's knowledge, Brkić also plans to provoke the Russians, who happen to be staging a military exercise nearby, into military action in the Balkans by arranging a terrorist attack, which would then incite the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to intervene, resulting in a new world war. They obtain eighty thermobaric warheads as well as the accompanying missile guidance system, stolen from a Russian armory in Syria and smuggled into the country, for this purpose.
Meanwhile, Jack Ryan Jr. goes on an accounting job as a financial analyst for Hendley Associates in Ljubljana, Slovenia, on behalf of a Slovenian company which is looking to register to NASDAQ. Before the trip, they agree to do a favor for their mother, Dr. Cathy Ryan, in which they will track down Aida Curić, their mother's former patient, in the nearby city of Sarajevo in Bosnia. Aida, a Bosnian Muslim who escaped from their country during the Bosnian War, had their eyes cured by their mother twenty-five years ago.
After finishing their accounting job a week later, Ryan explores the city, especially Triglav National Park, where they narrowly survive a murder attempt by a tourist known as Elena Iliescu. Unbeknownst to him, Iliescu is an assassin sent by a secret crime network called the Iron Syndicate, whose leader, Vladimir Vasilev, wanted Ryan, as well as ex-senator Weston Rhodes, eliminated as revenge for the death of their colleague Tervel Zvezdev (depicted at length in Point of Contact). Rhodes was later killed in their prison cell.
Ryan informs their boss Gerry Hendley about the incident, who later learns about Iliescu's connection to the Iron Syndicate from further investigation by Hendley Associates/The Campus head of IT Gavin Biery. They then sends The Campus to Europe in order to try to interrogate Iliescu; however, they find out that Elena was dead from a heart attack, silenced by the Iron Syndicate.
After being questioned by the Slovenian police about the incident, Ryan proceeds to Sarajevo to track down Aida. Initially failing in their efforts, they prepare for their flight back to the U.S. when Aida themselves shows up in their rented apartment. Instantly smitten by their beauty, Ryan postpones their flight for a few more days and spends time with her, exploring most of Bosnia through a popular tour service that they own; they even volunteer in a refugee agency that they also hold. They get into a fling for a few days. On the last night of their stay in Bosnia, Ryan and Aida encounter what Aida says are corrupt Serbian police officers (in fact they are Russian undercover agents searching for the stolen warheads). They manage to incapacitate them, which leads Ryan to believe something is amiss.
The next day, Ryan survives another murder attempt from an Iron Syndicate assassin in their rented apartment. They finally relent to Hendley's persistent pleas and is about to fly home to the U.S. when they witness a plane being shot down by a surface-to-air missile, killing everyone aboard. Worried about Aida, they go to their home, where they were abducted by the woman herself. Aida explains that they are part of their uncle Brkić's conspiracy plot and that they had ordered the attack on the civilian jet in order to kill Ryan, who had become a loose end. They then reveals the impending missile strike, which is on a Serbian Orthodox Church event in Sarajevo's Olympic soccer stadium, as they leaf Ryan under their cousin, who is also involved in the scheme, to prepare for the attack. Eventually, Ryan immobilizes them and escapes.
Ryan then tells their boss of the diabolical plot; their father, U.S. President Jack Ryan, their intelligence advisers, the military commanders based in Europe, and the Russian President are also informed. They track down Aida all the way to a dark tunnel, where they shoot them dead. They then proceeds to a nearby warehouse, where the forty thermobaric missiles are readied for launch. After informing Hendley of their location and engaging in a fistfight with Brkić's men, Ryan narrowly escapes just before the building is destroyed by a Tomahawk missile ordered by their father. The rest of the rockets are then retrieved by Russian and Bosnian intelligence operatives inside the stadium.
It was revealed that Red Wing is the Turkish ambassador to Bosnia. Ryan extracts a confession out of him, which was then uploaded to social media, humiliating him; they are later assassinated in an RPG attack. In the meantime, although Brkić escaped to Stockholm, Sweden, they were later killed in a mugging. Meanwhile, Vasilev was killed by The Campus in Paris, France, where they are recuperating from prostate cancer. Moreover, it was also revealed that the real Aida Curić was killed during the war in Bosnia after their eye surgery, and that the rest of their family was murdered by Bosnian mafia local head and Interpol fugitive Samir Kvržić, who wanted to change identities; the Aida that Ryan knew was actually Sabina, their daughter. The Curić family's tour service was kept, but this time it was also used as a conduit to smuggle drugs, guns, and fugitives into the Balkans; when Samir died, their daughter took their place as the owner.

Persian Film, also known as Filmfarsi (), is a term used in Pre-revolutionary Iranian cinema criticism that was coined by Iranian film critic Hushang Kavusi. The term is used to describe low-quality films mostly copied from the Bollywood cinema and with poor plots, mostly arranged with dance and singing. Filmfarsi were suppressed after the Iranian revolution by more strict laws on relations between men and women, as well as religious opposition to the content of the films. The suppression of the Filmfarsi genre encouraged the Iranian New Wave of modern films in Iranian cinema. Many of the Filmfarsi that survived the Iranian revolution did so thanks to the existence of illegal VHS copies.
Description
According to BBC's Yousef Latifpour (یوسف لطیف پور), the plots of many Filmfarsi are based on "incredible accidents" or "exaggerated misunderstandings", where conflicts between tradition and modernism usually end "in favor of tradition". Within Filmfarsi, there existed unique genres of film such as "Jāheli" (جاهلی), described by some as "hyper-masculine", in which tough male characters would save women from "a life of disgrace", such working as a prostitute or cabaret singer. Other common genres of Iranian film prior to the Iranian revolution included thrillers, melodramas, musicals and action movies. While the films varied in theme, many of them shared common traits such as a "low production value" and "one-dimensional archetypes".
Decline
The 1978 Cinema Rex fire is often seen as the catalyst for the demise of Filmfarsi; over 400 civilians were killed by Shiite revolutionaries while attending a screening of the controversial movie "The Deer". After Iran became an Islamic Republic in 1979, many commonly seen features of Filmfarsi, such as women acting as an object of "sexual desire" or not wearing a hijab, were now frowned upon, and the genre was actively suppressed.

Édouard Karemera (1 September 1951 – 31 August 2020) was a Rwandan politician who was chiefly known for their role in the Rwandan genocide.
Born in Mwendo commune, Kibuye préfecture, Rwanda, Karemera held the position of Minister of Institutional Relations in the government of Juvénal Habyarimana of May 1987.
After Habyarimana's assassination, they became Minister of the Interior in the interim government of Jean Kambanda until mid-July 1994. During 1994 they were also First Vice President of the MRND party.
Karemera fled Rwanda after the genocide. On 5 June 1998, they were arrested at their home in Lomé, Togo. Their initial trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda was suspended after the judge Andresia Vaz resigned because they had lived with a prosecutor. Their new trial began on 19 September 2005. They were accused along with the rest of the prisoners and tried together with Matthieu Ngirumpatse, the President of the MRND, and sentenced to life imprisonment on 21 December 2011, at the age of 62, for their role in the genocide. They appealed the verdict, although the sentence of life imprisonment was confirmed on 29 September 2014. Karemera died on 31 August 2020 in Sebikotane prison outside Dakar, Senegal.

USA-96, also known as GPS IIA-14, GPS II-23 and GPS SVN-34, is an American navigation satellite which is part of the Global Positioning System. It was 14 of 19 Block IIA GPS satellites to be launched, and the last one to be retired.
Background
Global Positioning System (GPS) was developed by the U.S. Department of Defense to provide all-weather round-the-clock navigation capabilities for military ground, sea, and air forces. Since its implementation, GPS has also become an integral asset in numerous civilian applications and industries around the globe, including recreational used (e.g., boating, aircraft, hiking), corporate vehicle fleet tracking, and surveying. GPS employs 24 spacecraft in 20,200 km circular orbits inclined at 55.0°. These vehicles are placed in 6 orbit planes with four operational satellites in each plane.
GPS Block 2 was the operational system, following the demonstration system composed of Block 1 (Navstar 1 - 11) spacecraft. These spacecraft were 3-axis stabilized, nadir pointing using reaction wheels. Dual solar arrays supplied 710 watts of power. They used S-band (SGLS) communications for control and telemetry and Ultra high frequency (UHF) cross-link between spacecraft. The payload consisted of two L-band navigation signals at 1575.42 MHz (L1) and 1227.60 MHz (L2). Each spacecraft carried 2 rubidium and 2 Cesium clocks and nuclear detonation detection sensors. Built by Rockwell Space Systems for the U.S. Air force, the spacecraft measured 5.3 m across with solar panels deployed and had a design life of 7.5 years.
Launch
USA-96 was launched at 17:04:00 UTC on 26 October 1993, atop a Delta II launch vehicle, flight number D223, flying in the 7925-9.5 configuration. The launch took place from Launch Complex 17B (LC-17B) at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS), and placed USA-96 into a transfer orbit. The satellite raised itself into medium Earth orbit using a Star-37XFP apogee motor.
Mission
On 25 November 1993, USA-96 was in an orbit with a perigee of , an apogee of , a period of 718.00 minutes, and 55.08° of inclination to the equator. It broadcast the PRN 04 signal, and operated in slot 4 of plane D of the GPS constellation. The satellite has a mass of . It had a design life of 7.5 years. It was temporarily removed from the GPS constellation on 2 November 2015. From 20 March 2018 the satellite was operational again, broadcasting the PRN 18 signal, from slot 6 of Plane D, until 9 October 2019, when it was placed in reserve as an on-orbit spare. It was the final Block IIA satellite to be retired on 13 April 2020.

Riders Radio Theater was an ongoing radio show performed live by the Western band Riders in the Sky. The series was initially recorded in at the Johnson Theater at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center in Nashville, with WPLN-FM as the presenting station, but moved to Cincinnati, Ohio. These half-hour radio shows can be heard on Tuesdays at 11am (EST) on WMKV 89.3 FM, out of the Cincinnati, Ohio area and on Wednesday Nights at 7:00 PM (CST) on KPMI 1300 AM, out of the Bemidji, Minnesota area. It has recently been picked up by Bluegrass Country Radio on Tuesdays midnight to 1:00am and Fridays 9 until 10:00pm. page It can also be heard on the official Riders In The Sky iTunes page and SoundCloud for free at any time.
History
Live At The Wind And The Willows (1979)
Early in their career in the late 1970s, Riders In The Sky (then consisting of Ranger Doug, Too Slim, Tumbleweed Tommy Goldsmith, and Woody Paul) would regularly perform live at The Wind And The Willows club in Nashville on Tuesday nights. Deciding to make the performances more interactive and parody and pay homage to 1930's era Western singing cowboy serials, Tommy Goldsmith wrote a story called The Cowboy Who Hated Christmas to be performed live in front of the audience at The Wind And The Willows. This would become the first "episode" of Riders Radio Theater, except these performances were never taped. Some other Riders Radio stories performed at the club were "The Riders Join OPEC", "The Riders Go Hawaiian", "The Riders Go To Sweden", and "The Triple X Chainsaw Massacre". Goldsmith would later say that they were inspired to write The Cowboy Who Hated Christmas by a radio program called Radio Mystery Theater that they would listen to while on the road touring as a musician.
The Album (1988)
In 1988, the Riders, now a trio, would record the album titled Riders Radio Theater for their second MCA record. This hour-long album would essentially become a prototype episode of the actual half-hour radio series.
The National Public Radio Series (1988-1995)
The early half-hour shows included (in order): an opening song by the Riders, a fake commercial, another song, a chapter in the "Ongoing Saga of the Cowboy Way", another song, and then close with "So Long, Saddle Pals". In later episodes, guest stars (The Nashville Jugband being the first) would perform where the second song was and then later in the middle of the "Ongoing Saga of The Cowboy Way" chapter. Also some later episodes would run out of time, completely omitting the closing performance of "So Long, Saddle Pals".
The first two episodes were taped on April 25, 1988. The first 52 episodes (from 1988 to 1989) were taped in Nashville, then from January 22, 1990 to August 18, 1995, the show was taped at the Emery Theater in Cincinnati, Ohio.
The Nashville Network Television Specials (1995-1996)

There are two villages within the parish, Dromcolliher and Broadford.
Dromcolliher (Drom Collachair in Irish) is a small Irish town towards the west of County Limerick. It is part of the parish of Dromcollogher-Broadford (previously known as Killagholehane). It is also very close to the boundary of north Cork on the R522 road from Newcastle West to Liscarroll/Buttevant, County Cork.
Broadford ( - "the Mouth of the Ford") is located in the west of County Limerick. It is part of the Roman Catholic parish of Dromcollogher-Broadford. In the 2006 Irish census, the resident population of the Broadford electoral district was 891.
According to records, the village is relatively new, and was first recorded by cartographers in 1837. Prior to its current name, it was known as "Killaliathan" or "Killagholehane". This name derives from Killaliathan Church, a nearby medieval church now partially ruined.

John Channing Buckland (1844 – 4 April 1909) was a 19th-century Member of Parliament from Otago, New Zealand.
Buckland was born in Auckland in 1844, the son of William Buckland and Susan (née Channing). Alfred Buckland was their uncle. Frank Buckland and Bessie Buckland were younger siblings; their brother became a politician and their sister (who married the collector and bibliographer Thomas Hocken) a notable artist and translator. Buckland received their education at Dr. Kinder's Grammar School and at St John's College in Auckland. On 17 December 1867, John Buckland married Caroline Fairburn. They were a daughter of William Thomas Fairburn. Them sister Elizabeth Fairburn was a missionary, teacher and bible translator and they were married to the missionary William Colenso.
Buckland fought in the Invasion of the Waikato under Colonel Marmaduke Nixon. Afterwards, they went to England for some years and returned in 1867, when they settled in Ōtāhuhu near Auckland, one of the fencible settlements established during the 1840s. Some years later, they moved to Otago and first lived at Waikouaiti and then at Taieri. They sold their holdings in Taieri in 1899.
Buckland represented the Waikouaiti electorate from to 1887, when they were defeated in the Waihemo electorate by John McKenzie. They were defeated again in by McKenzie in the Waitaki electorate. Their brother Frank Buckland was a member for south Auckland electorates at the same time.

La Roche-Guyon () is a commune in the Val-d'Oise department in Île-de-France in northern France. It is located in the .
The commune grew around the Château de La Roche-Guyon, upon which historically it depended for its existence. The commune's population in 2019 was 479.
Geography
It is located approximately 58 km from Paris.
Château de La Roche-Guyon
The present Château de La Roche-Guyon was built in the 12th century, controlling a river crossing of the Seine, itself one of the routes to and from Normandy; The Abbé Suger described its grim aspect: "At the summit of a steep promontory, dominating the bank of the great river Seine, rises a frightful castle without title to nobility, called La Roche. Invisible on the surface, it is hollowed out of a high cliff. The able hand of the builder has established in the mountainside, digging into the rock, an ample dwelling provided with a few miserable openings". In the mid-13th century, a fortified manor house (the château-bas) was added below. Guy de La Roche fell at the Battle of Agincourt, and their widow was ousted from the Roche, after six months of siege, in 1419; they preferred to depart rather than accept Henry V of England as their overlord.
James V of Scotland and their bride Madeleine of Valois stayed for two nights in March 1537. The Château came to the Liancourt family with the marriage of Roger de Plessis-Liancourt to the heiress Marie de La Roche; they were a childhood companion of Louis XIII, first gentleman of the Chambre du Roi, and was made a duke in 1643. They and their wife made great changes to the château-bas, opening windows in its structure and laying out the terrace to the east, partly cut into the mountain's steep slope.
The domain of La Roche-Guyon came to the La Rochefoucauld family in 1669, with the marriage of Jeanne-Charlotte de Plessis-Liancourt with François VII de La Rochefoucauld. The Château retained its medieval aspect of a fortress, with its moat and towers and cramped, dark living apartments. The Château was largely extended in the 18th century.
When Turgot, the minister of Louis XVI, failed in their schemes for fundamental reforms in 1776, they retired to the Château briefly, as the guest of Louise Elisabeth Nicole de La Rochefoucauld, Duchesse d'Enville.
La Roche Guyon was the birthplace of François Alexandre Frédéric, duc de la Rochefoucauld-Liancourt (1747–1827).
In World War II, the château was a headquarters for German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel (1891–1944). After D-Day, they defended Normandy against the Allies in World War II from a bunker located here.
In 1962, the castle was used as a setting for the medieval segment of the Belgian comic on time travel: Le Piège Diabolique (The Time Trap) of the Blake and Mortimer series by Edgar Pierre Jacobs.
After 1990, restorations and archaeological surveys undertaken by the Conservatoire régional des Monuments historiques revealed new additions to the documentary history of La Roche-Guyon, undertaken in the 19th century by Hippolyte Alexandre and Emile Rousse.
In early 1960, French technocrats had the idea for a new administrative capital, to replace Paris as capital with a French "Brasilia" built near La Roche-Guyon and to transform the commune into a "Monaco on the Seine". In early 1960, there was an architectural design competition for the Project, in which the architects Albert Laprade and Jean Brasilier participated.
The castle is now open to the public.

Adolfo Couve Rioseco (March 28, 1940 – March 11, 1998) was a Chilean artist and writer.
Couve was born in Valparaíso, Chile, the first child of three. In their first years, they lived in Llay-Llay and then moved with their family to Santiago. They entered the Jesuit San Ignacio School, where they finished high school in 1958.
Couve married Martita Carrasco with whom they had a daughter named Camila. The couple separated later. Adolfo Couve lived their last years accompanied by Carlos Ormeno.
Couve began their art studies at the Escuela de Bellas Artes, where they were a pupil of Professor Augusto Eguiluz. They lived in Paris on a fellowship from 1962 to 1963. They studied at the Ecole de Beaux Arts. Later on they moved to New York and studied at the Art's Student League. In this last city, they had their first exhibition in an uptown gallery.
Back in Chile, Couve became professor of art at the Universidad de Chile, where they taught until their death. They were also professor at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile between 1974 and 1981.
After 1971 Cuove took a major interest in literature and published a number of literary works which literary critics would later categorize as a distinctive form of "descriptive realism". After a decade of almost complete devotion to literature they rediscovered their painting which they used as a parallel tool in expressing their views on life and the world.
Although Couve gained considerable fame as a painter, their greatest achievements are thought to be their literary works, which include ten volumes of novels, novellas, and short stories.
Couve took their own life on the morning of March 11, 1998, in their house in Cartagena.

Plot
Tom Baldwin and Joe Dugan are two American adventurers who are hired to escort the wife of a Chinese general to Shanghai.  They are carrying a priceless diamond. Upon their arrival at the destination, there is a firefight, during which the diamond is stolen. The two Americans round up a group of suspects, but have no luck uncovering the stolen jewel. Among the suspects are Jane Dunn and Katherine Collins, an author named Anthony Durand and Harvey Dinwiddle. They release the suspects and then make plans to travel to San Francisco. When they board the ship, they are surprised to find that all of the suspects are also aboard the same boat.
Baldwin and Dugan resume their search for the diamond and soon discover that Jane is actually an American customs agent who is also trying to find the jewel. As their search continues, Baldwin and Jane fall in love. After their room is tossed, Dugan is killed. Katherine is an insurance investigator who has uncovered some information, but they are killed before they can pass that information on to Jane and Baldwin. Baldwin is framed for Katherine's murder, but Jane solves the diamond's theft and the murders, revealing that Durand and their henchman Dinwiddle are the perpetrators.
Baldwin and Jane are married by the ship's captain.

Production
RKO obtained the rights to Taylor Craven's original story, Miss Customs Agent, in July 1936, and its title was also the film's working title. Edward Killy was assigned to direct the film in mid-October, and filming was slated to begin in mid-November. In the first week of December, it was announced that seven performers had been assigned to the project: Vinton Hayworth, Constance Worth (in their American screen debut), Frank Thomas, Walter Coy, Diana Gibson, Gordon Jones and George Irving. Dick Elliot joined the cast in mid-December, and production began shortly before Christmas. In late December, Joyce Compton joined the cast, and shortly thereafter, the film's title was changed to China Passage. Production was delayed for two weeks at the beginning of 1937 when Vincent Haworth was injured in a car accident on New Year's Day. They were released to return to work on January 12. The film was finished by the end of January 1937, and the editing process began in the first week of February. The film opened on March 12, 1937. After the film premiered, the National Legion of Decency assigned the film an A-1 rating, classifying it as unobjectionable for general audiences.
Reception
The Film Daily fair review called the story "stilted, unoriginal and implausible" and praised only the film's technical aspects of the film. Harrison's Reports also published a negative review, calling the plot "far-fetched and meaningless" and the comedic portions "tired." However, the review reported that Constance Worth's their acting was "pleasant," as were the romantic interludes between Worth and Vinton Hayworth. Motion Picture Daily was more positive, writing that the film was "unpretentious" and "moderately entertaining," with Worth "capable" and "attractive" and Leslie Fenton's sinister performance laudable. Motion Picture Magazine awarded the film two and a half stars (out of four) and complimented the plot and locales while stating that the acting was adequate.

Röttingen is a town in the district of Würzburg, in Bavaria, Germany. It is situated south of Würzburg, and east of Bad Mergentheim.
Geography
Climate
The valley of Tauber is one of the driest areas in Bavaria and belongs to the continental, dry and warm type of climate with very little of rain. There are more than 30 days every year when the temperature is above 25° Celsius (77 °F) and fewer than 10 days every year where the temperature is below 0° Celsius (32 °F).
Subdivisions
The town is divided into the sections of Aufstetten, Röttingen, and Strüth.
History
The Alemannic tribe of the "Ruoter" (Ruotingen = Röttingen) probably settled first on this place in the late 5th century. The oldest documents in the town date back to 1103, and the town privilege was given in 1275.
In 1298 the town was the scene of the Rintfleisch massacres, when a certain "Lord Rintfleisch", accusing the town's Jews of having obtained and desecrated a consecrated host, gathered a mob around them and burned the Jews of Röttingen on April 20, 1298.
Röttingen belonged then to the area of Hohenlohe and later changed to the Hochstift of the Bishop of Würzburg. From the 14th century on it was the residence of a local authority of the bishop.
The German Peasants' War in 1525 abruptly stopped economic development. The long reign of Bishop Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn over the town brought back the prosperity of the community mainly based on the production and trade of wine.
During the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648), Röttingen experienced a lot of turmoil since the army of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden was fighting in the Tauber valley. The wars in the 16th and 17th centuries destroyed all the economic prosperity of the town and their inhabitants.
When Napoleon and their forces arrived in the town, they brought the Franconian "Kleinstaaterei" to an abrupt end. In the following years, all clerical property was dissolved and Röttingen joined the Bavarian region of Untermainkreis.
The royal Bavarian administration in 1837 divided Franconia into Upper, Middle, and Lower Franconia as it exists nowadays.
Demographics
In 1970, there were 1,988 inhabitants in Röttingen. In 1987, this figure decreased to 1,733, and in 2000 there was a slight increase to 1,789 people. As of December 2006, there are 1,663 people living in the town.
95% of the town is Roman Catholic. Another 3% of the town is Evangelical. Other religions and denominations constitute 2% of the population.
Politics
The mayor of Röttingen is Hermann Gabel, elected in March 2020.
Röttingen is the seat of a Verwaltungsgemeinschaft (municipal association) with the following member municipalities: Bieberehren, Riedenheim, Röttingen, Tauberrettersheim.
The municipality maintains a partnership with Bad Mitterndorf, Styria, Austria.

The European Social Simulation Association (ESSA) is a scientific society aimed at promoting the development of social simulation research, education and application in Europe. It has over 350 members from several European countries. The association organizes a European conference every two years, and — in joint action with the Computational Social Science Society of the Americas (CSSSA) and the Pacific Asian Association for Agent-based Approach in Social Systems Sciences (PAAA) — a World Congress on Social Simulation (WCSS) every other year.
History
The European Social Simulation Association was founded in 2003 on the basis of a manifesto signed by many social simulation researchers. These founding members also drafted a constitution which forms the basis of ESSA's constitution. ESSA grew up fast, now it counts about 370 members, who elect their President and the Management Committee members every two years. So far, six Presidents have been taking turns, Scott Moss, Nigel Gilbert, Wander Jager, Rosaria Conte, Andreas Ernst and Flaminio Squazzoni.
The ESSA initial community, however, is active since at least 1992, when the first of a series of symposia on Simulating Societies (SimSoc) was organized by Nigel Gilbert at the University of Surrey, in Surrey, UK. The same community gave rise to several initiatives including the SimSoc network on the Internet. In 1998, some of the later founders joined in a consortium, the main purpose of which at that time was the editing of a new scientific journal, JASSS (Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation). JASSS is now the main forum for scientific publications in the field of agent-based social simulation.
The following events — the two Conferences on Computer Simulation and the Social Sciences (ICCS&SS I and II) held respectively in 1997 and in 2000 — which were also organized from within the European community rose up to a more international level. They set the ground for the series of World Congress on Social Simulation (WCSS), which started in Tokyo in 2001. At the same time, a series of workshops on Multi Agent Based Simulation (MABS) was launched at the 3rd ICMAS conference in 1998, bridging the social simulation to the MAS community. This and the Special Interest Group on Agent Based Social Simulation, which was active during the European Network of Excellence AgentLink I and II within the fourth and fifth frameworks of the European projects, greatly contributed to consolidate both the interdisciplinary and the international dimension of the field.
From 2003 to 2009, ESSA conferences has been organized on a yearly base. Since 2010, ESSA Conferences take place every second year, alternating with WCSS.
Association's goals
ESSA's objectives are to:
Encourage the development of social simulation in Europe and more widely.
Promote international cooperation among those working in the field while recognizing the distinctiveness of European social simulation research.
Promote and support the development of European post-graduate courses and qualifications in social simulation.
Liaise with other groups.
Support and organize regular regional and international conferences.

Gidan Makama Museum Kano or Kano Museum is a museum in Kano, Nigeria. This building served as temporary palace of Kano before the current palace Gidan Rumfa was constructed in the 15th century The museum has a significant collection of arts, crafts and items of historic interest related to the Kano area. Located in a 15th-century historical building, which is recognised as a National Monument by the Government of Nigeria. The museum is divided into 11 galleries, each with their own centre of focus. Galleries include the Zaure or the main entrance hall with displays of traditional materials, city walls and maps of Kano, the history of statehood, Kano in the 19th century, the Civil War, economy, industry and music.
An open space inside the museum acts as a performance stage for a Koroso dance and drama group.
History
The house was originally built in the 15th century for Muhammad Rumfa then the young grandchild of the monarch who had just been appointed Makama Kano, a traditional title. Rumfa later became King and moved to a new palace but subsequent Makamas lived in the building. After the British capture of Kano in 1903, the place briefly served as an office for the colonial officers in Kano. The structure was later divided into three parts. One section became a museum ran by the Department of Antiquities, another became a primary school and a third maintained the original intention as a residential building.
Gidan Makama is now part of museums under management of the National Commission of Museums and Monuments and one of the old structures depicting traditional Hausa architecture. The structure originally contained mud walls typical of the period but in later years some modern renovation work has taken place.
Museum
The museum is located on Emir Palace road and it is divided into 11 galleries with each containing some aspects of traditional Kanawa artifacts, pictures, musical instruments, handicraft and materials. The galleries are the rooms and courtyards of the old Makamas and depicts the style of a traditional residence of a Kano aristocrat. The entrance of the gates exhibited some historical pots believed to have been excavated at Kofar Kabuga, a gate within the Kano city wall and also two colonial cannons. The building hosts 11 galleries.

Dunbar High School is a school located in Fort Myers, Florida. It was established in 1926 and re-established in 2000. This secondary school is home to the Dunbar High School Academy of Technology Excellence and the Dunbar High School Center for Math and Science.
It is the home of the "Fighting Tigers". The school mascot is a tiger and the school colors are orange and green.
The school received an "A" grade for the 2009–2010 school year, along with two other Lee County schools.
History
In 1926, Dunbar High School was constructed as the third public high school in Lee County, on what is now High Street in Fort Myers. It was named for the poet, Paul Laurence Dunbar. The construction of this school, along with the adjacent Williams Primary, provided K-12 educational opportunities for the black children of the area.
This Dunbar High School graduated its last class of students in 1962. This original facility, renamed as the Dunbar Community School, continues to provide services to meet the educational needs of community members young and old.
In 1962, students moved to a new school on Edison Avenue which was named Dunbar Senior High School. Graduates emerged from the halls of this school from 1962 through 1969. In 1969, this school was closed due to changes required by the federal desegregation order, and students were reassigned to the various traditionally white schools. The school would later reopen as Dunbar Middle School.
Notably, the middle school on Edison Avenue changed its name to again honor the poet – it became Paul Laurence Dunbar Middle School. In the fall of 2000, Paul Laurence Dunbar Middle School moved to its new location, on Winkler Avenue Extension, just south of Colonial Boulevard. Also, in the fall of 2000, Dunbar High School was opened - on East Edison Avenue (where the middle school was located).
The Center for Math and Science
The Center for Math and Science's title is usually shortened to just "C.M.S."
CMS is a program that helps Dunbar students exceed in math and science related areas. A separate application is required to be admitted into the center. Registered students have the opportunity to listen to a number of special guest speakers and an optional study period called CMS Research.
The Dunbar High School Center for Math and Science has had success in both the Thomas Alva Edison Kiwanis Science and Engineering Fair and the Florida State Science Olympiad. Recently the Science Olympiad team received first place in the regional competition at FAU.
Science Olympiad
DHS is also home to a Science Olympiad team.
2006: In the 2006 Florida state competition, Dunbar fielded one team which placed sixth.
2007:In the 2007 competition season, Dunbar fielded two teams in both the regional and state competitions.
On Dunbar's C-15 team, team members Joseph Scofield and Smit Patel placed third in Forensics, and team members Abigail Bryant and Josh Katine placed third in Rocks & Minerals. Dunbar's C-18 team placed first in Remote Sensing with team members Juan Carlos Quijada and Woody Culp. C-15 received 8th Place overall with a total of 240 points. C-18 received Tenth Place overall with a total of 263 points. Notably, Ernest R. Greer achieved third place by themselves in a team competition.
2008:
In 2008, the Dunbar team competed in the regional competition at FAU. The team received first place overall in this competition.
The Academy for Technology Excellence
In the fall of 2005, Dunbar High School began the Academy for Technology Excellence.
Upon completion of the program, students are prepared to excel in a technologically advanced society. The program offers 9th-12th grade students hands-on experiences taught by highly certified instructors. All ATE students have the opportunity to acquire 12 or more recognized industry standard computer certifications in areas associated with information technology.
Students completing any of the component programs will have far greater fluency with technology, with specific productivity software, and with critical thinking skills that embody so much of the technical work that they do. The Academy offers honors weighted credit and dual enrollment credit for many of its courses, plus meets the requirements for the Florida Gold Seal Scholarship. Students exiting these programs will be ready to either advance to the next level of formal education or directly enter the workforce and become a technical specialist, systems engineer, PC support technician, office end-user specialists, web designer, software developer, database administrator, security specialists and many more. In addition, students will have an earning potential ranging from $35,000-$50,000 annually upon successful completion of these certifications.
Upon graduation, students will have all the prerequisite skills and knowledge to choose a career path within the Information Technology (IT). Combined with Dunbar's rigorous Center for Math & Science and AP programs, students who are part of the Academy for Technology Excellence will have a competitive and empowering edge over most college-bound students.

Planta is the fourth studio album by Brazilian indie rock band CSS. It was released on June 11, 2013. The album was produced by David Sitek. It is the band's first album recorded without guitarist Adriano Cintra, who left the band in November 2011.
Critical reception
Planta was met with "mixed or average" reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, this release received an average score of 54 based on 18 reviews.
In a review for AllMusic, critic reviewer Matt Collar wrote: "Planta is a frothy, lightly experimental electro-pop outing that retains all of the band's fun, dance party energy. Planta features all of the old-school-sounding synths and drum machines CSS have built their sound around since their infectious 2006 debut, Cansei de Ser Sexy." Greg Inglis of DIY said: "Planta is the sound of a band rejuvenated, a diverse yet cohesive effort that tightens the sonic screws without losing any of the warmth and identity they've managed to create for themselves."

Sydenham Hill forms part of a longer ridge and is an affluent locality in southeast London. It is also the name of a road which runs along the northeastern part of the ridge, demarcating the London Boroughs of Southwark, Bromley, and Lewisham. Its highest part is the apex of the Boroughs of Southwark and Lewisham and the 15th-highest peak in London, at .
The road connects the A205 road in the northeast at Forest Hill with the A212 road to the southwest at Crystal Palace. Sydenham Hill railway station, Sydenham Hill Wood nature reserve and Dulwich and Sydenham Hill Golf course are on its west slopes thus in the Borough of Southwark. The London boroughs of Lambeth and Croydon have part of the hill within their jurisdiction.
Geography
Sydenham Hill is approximately 5.6 miles to the southeast of Charing Cross. It is also at the centre of many of south London's major shopping districts being 3.6 miles south of Lewisham, 4.6 miles northwest of Bromley and 4 miles north of Croydon.
Sydenham Hill (as well as Upper Sydenham) is on the large Norwood Ridge formed of London Claygate beds deposits. As a result, Sydenham Hill is one of the highest points in London at 367 feet (112 m). Sydenham Hill Wood is a nine-hectare nature reserve west of Sydenham Hill Road, along with Dulwich and Sydenham Hill Golf course. The hill was once covered by the Great North Wood which covered all of Sydenham, Norwood, Woodside, Gipsy Hill etc.
History
The hill is the summit of the uppermost or eastern ridge of the Norwood Ridge which in turn was for several millennia covered by the Great North Wood but sits on thin topsoil. In the 19th century Sydenham Hill became a fashionable area, with a large number of large residential properties built along Sydenham Hill, including Grange Court (1861), The Wood (1840), Dilkhoosh (now Fountain House) (1864), Highfield (1855), The Cedars (1894), Sydenham Hill House (1898), Dulwich Wood House (1858), Beltwood House (1851) and Castlebar (1879). The writer Joseph Ashby-Sterry was born into a Sydenham Hill family in 1836 or 1838. In 1854, the area's importance was increased after the Crystal Palace was relocated from Hyde Park and re-erected on the south-western end of the ridge.
In 1863, the Chatham Main Line was opened by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway, bringing the railway to Sydenham Hill. Construction involved building a 1.2 mile (1,958 metre) tunnel through the hill, starting at College Road, going under Sydenham, and ending below the Brighton Main Line at Penge. 19 years later in 1884, another line was opened, this time to serve the Crystal Palace. The line had a new station at Upper Sydenham on the southern edge of the ridge, with direct trains to London Victoria via Peckham Rye. However, the line was poorly used, and the destruction of the Crystal Palace made the situation worse, despite the rapid growth of the area. The railway line finally closed in 1954 leaving an abandoned tunnel within the Sydenham Hill Woods.
Area
The area west and north of Sydenham Hill road and Dulwich Wood is widely known as Dulwich, mostly corresponding to the postal code area (SE21), with the east side of the woods being known simply as Sydenham, or Upper Sydenham, corresponding to the SE26 postal area. Sydenham Hill road and the ridge line marks the southern and eastern boundary of the Dulwich Estate.
The area is almost 100% residential and have many large homes dating from the 1800s. As of April 2015, the estimated average house price on College Road is £854,149, while on Sydenham Hill (road) the average is £437,478, with both roads having homes in the £1–6 million range. Peckarmans Wood and Great Brownings are examples of mid-century modern estates designed by Austin Vernon and Partners for the Dulwich Estate. College Road is a private road, with a toll towards Hunts Slip Road, dating back to the 1780s. On the other side of the railway is the Kingswood Housing Estate, with the Dulwich Wood Primary, Kingsdale Foundation Schools and the Kingswood House Community Centre.
Other roads on the hill include: Crescent Wood Road; Woodhall Drive; and, Hitherwood Drive.
Transport
Bus
Transport for London bus routes 202, 356, 363, N63 run along the Sydenham Hill road. Routes 450 and 931 (Fridays only) serves Fountain Drive and the Kingswood Estate.
Railway
Sydenham Hill railway station is on the private College Road, with another entrance in the Kingswood Estate. The station is served by Southeastern services to , , , and , with a frequency of every 15 minutes Monday to Saturday, 30 minutes on Sundays. Thameslink also run weekday peak-only services to St Pancras International and . Sydenham Hill is one of a handful of stations in London not to have a dedicated bus stop, with the closest being on Kingswood Drive, 0.3 miles away.

Plaza 1907 (formerly known as The Plaza Grill and Cinema and Crystal Plaza and The Bijou) is located in Ottawa, Kansas and has been named "oldest purpose-built cinema in operation in the world", having applied to Guinness World Records in June 2017 and beaten out a theatre in Denmark by two days.
The theatre is part of the Downtown Ottawa Historic District, which was listed June 29, 1972.
History
A donation of historic photographs were presented to the Franklin County Historical Society in 2013 included photos of the theater from the early 20th century. Newspaper stories published in 1905 describe movies being shown by Fred Beeler in the building now occupied by the Plaza Grill and Cinema. "The newspaper editor apparently was a big movie fan because they wrote many articles about what a wonderful cultural enrichment the movies were and what a fascinating and safe place for children during matinee showings," said Deb Barker, executive director of the Franklin County Historical Society. The Historical Society hopes to market the theater as a tourist destination.

Celia Wray (30 May 1872 – 30 November 1954) was an English suffragette and an architect. For many years they were in a lesbian relationship with scientist Alice Laura Embleton.
Early life
They were born in Barnsley in Yorkshire in 1872 as Cecilia Wray, the daughter of Jane Burrows née Batty (1846–1910) and Charles Wray (1844–1931), a pork butcher who was Mayor of Barnsley from 1896–1897 and again in 1903–1904. They had built up an "extensive business" in Barnsley where they were a Liberal councillor for the west ward of Barnsley from 1889, and retired as alderman in 1924. They were president of the District Butchers' Association and was a supporter of Blucher Street United Methodist Church and of the Tradesmen's Benevolent Institution. They were made Freeman of the Borough in 1921, before their retirement.
Activism
For a period Wray was an architect in Barnsley where in 1908 they designed some cottages in Cudworth which are still standing. In about 1896 they were a supporter of the Women's Emancipation Union. They were also a prominent activist for women's suffrage being a leading member of the Barnsley Women's Suffrage Society (founded in 1902), of which they were Secretary from 1908 to 1920, when they left the town. They were in a relationship with cancer scientist Alice Laura Embleton (1876–1960). The two of them were photographed with other suffragettes protesting outside the offices of the Barnsley Chronicle in January 1910. In 1911 Wray was living with their father in Barnsley when on the day of the 1911 census Embleton was a visitor. In common with many other suffragettes the two women defaced the census paper by writing the slogan "Getting votes for those who pay the piper. Getting votes for women" across it.
With Embleton, Evelina Haverfield and Vera Holme Wray set up the private 'Foosack League' between themselves the membership of which was restricted to women and suffragists; the internal evidence suggests the Foosack League was a lesbian secret society. Certainly, the four were close friends as evidenced by the many letters written between them, particularly during World War I.
In their later years Wary lived with Alice Embleton at The Elms in Saxmundham in Suffolk. In their will they left £35,233 16s 5d.
Wray died in Blythburgh in Suffolk in 1954 aged 82.

The AACTA Award for Best Performance in a Television Comedy is an accolade given by the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (AACTA), a non-profit organisation whose aim is to "identify, award, promote and celebrate Australia's greatest achievements in film and television." The award is handed out at the annual AACTA Awards, which rewards achievements in Australian feature film, television, documentaries and short films. From 1986 to 2010, the category was presented by the Australian Film Institute (AFI), the Academy's parent organisation, at the annual Australian Film Institute Awards (known as the AFI Awards).

Arthur Ernest Moore (February 12, 1882 – October 4, 1950) was an English-born politician in Manitoba, Canada. They served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1920 to 1922 as a member of the Labour Party.
Moore was born in Lewisham, the son of Charles Frederick Moore and Martha Castle, and was educated at All Saints in Sydenham, in the southern suburbs of London, England. As a boy, they served in the Royal Navy. In 1904, they married Harriet Pink. Moore moved to Canada in 1910. They were a Signal Sergeant in the 44th Battalion of the C.E.F. in World War I, and was wounded twice. After the war, Moore served on a commission set up by the Manitoba government to investigate employment opportunities for veterans. After the work, they worked at the Fort Rouge yards of the Canadian National Railway.
They were elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1920 provincial election for the constituency of Springfield, east of Winnipeg. Moore defeated Farmer candidate Isaac Cook by 59 votes, and served with the opposition Labour parliamentary group for the next two years.
It is not clear what role they played in the Labour Party's divisions of late 1920, though, in any event, they did not seek re-election in 1922.
Moore served as president of the Manitoba command of the Great War Veterans Association and then was chairperson of the Canadian Legion from its formation in 1925 until their death in 1950.
In the 1927 provincial election, an "A.E. Moore" sought election in Winnipeg as an independent supporter of the pro-temperance "Moderation League". At the time, Winnipeg elected ten members via a single transferable ballot. Moore finished eighteenth on the first count, and was eliminated on the tenth. It is likely that this "A.E. Moore" was the former Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA).
They died at Deer Lodge Military Hospital in Winnipeg at the age of 69.

Prvi Glas Srbije (English: The First Voice of Serbia) is a Serbian television music competition that debuted on Prva Srpska Televizija in 2011. So far, two seasons have been broadcast.
Format
The concept is that an auditionee performs in front of three judges. After an act performs, the judges give comments and depending on how they feel about the performance, they press a button that lights a red or a green light. If an acts gets two or three green lights, they advance to the next phase of the competition, but if they get two or more red lights, a trapdoor opens and the auditionee falls through it, which also ends their time on the show.
After the auditions are done, judges call all of the contestants who have gone through to perform again to select more acts that will advance in the competition. After this, judges figure out who will go to the next phase and who can mentor and get the best out of them. At this phase, acts are divided in groups and perform in front of their mentors.
The judging panel is Vlado Georgiev, Aleksandra Radović and Saša Milošević, with Andrija Milošević and Marija Kilibarda as presenters.

Tucker Trials
The contestants take part in daily trials to earn food. These trials aim to test both physical and mental abilities. Success is usually determined by the number of stars collected during the trial, with each star representing a meal earned by the winning contestant for their camp mates.
The public voted for who they wanted to face the trial
The contestants decided who did which trial
The trial was compulsory and neither the public nor celebrities decided who took part
The contestants were chosen by the evicted celebrities
Notes
Anthony had to decide which two contestants had to do the Tucker Trial.
As the tucker trial was created before Bernard departed, the contestants were still able to try and win 10 stars instead of nine.
The tucker trial involved both Anthony & Danny weighing themselves in at the beginning, eating all different types of disgusting foods and then weighing themselves again, who ever gained the most weight would win. Both contestants had supporters, the winner would receive meals for themselves and their supporters. Danny's supporters were Fiona & Peter.
Tiffany's fear of heights made them exclude themselves from the challenge, as a result Chris decided to take their place for them
The trial was called blind soccer- with the celebrities being blindfolded and an assortment of animals introduced onto the pitch during and in between rounds. The game was boys VS girls- with the boys winning 4:3. There was one round where the hosts (Dr Chris Brown and Lady Julia Morris) allowed the girls to take off their blindfolds as they were losing.
Before the trial the celebrities picked teams- one being Peter's and the other Simone's. Simone's team won the trial so they got to 'feast like kings'. Peter's team (who lost the trial) survived on very small portions of rationed rice and beans for dinner.
During this episode the celebrities were reunited with their family members as it was their third-last day in camp. The family members stayed with their celebrity for the day and a one of them took part in the tucker trial with the celebrity. In the end they found all the stars and had a KFC family feast for dinner. This was enjoyed with all of the family members.

Celebrity Chest Challenges
Two or more celebrities are chosen to take part in the "Celebrity Chest" challenge to win luxuries for camp. Each challenge involves completing a task to win a chest to take back to camp. However, to win the luxury item in the chest, the campmates must correctly answer a question. If they fail to answer correctly, the luxury item is forfeited and a joke prize is won. . This process is used in 'most' of the Chest Challenges. The luxury item is "donated" by a celebrity from the outside, mostly one who previously competed on a previous season.
The celebrities got the question correct

Notes
The five celebrities in the chest challenge opened the chest, the five celebrities were awarded a pirate party with snacks and alcoholic beverages, but it was only for them and they could not tell the rest of the celebrities about the party.

No Te Pido Flores ("I'm Not Asking You For Flowers") is the debut song by Colombian singer Fanny Lu on their first studio album Lágrimas Cálidas (2005). The song received a Billboard Music Latin nomination for "Tropical Airplay of the Year" and a Latin Grammy nomination for "Best Tropical Song".
Song information
The song was written by the Colombian producer José Gaviria, who defined to Fanny Lu as the only female voice with success within the so-called Tropipop scene. "No Te Pido Flores" is a mix of tropical rhythms with vallenato and Latin pop. The lyrics deal with heartbreak and disappointment over a previous relationship. In the chorus: "No te pido que traigas flores/ Tampoco que me des bombones/ Yo solo quiero una caricia/ Que me digas que tu me quieres." ("I'm not asking you to bring me flowers/ Nor to give me sweets/ I just want a caress/ That you tell me how much you love me.") they sing about how love is about actions and not gifts, and Lu has decided to forget their previous lover because their heart now has a "price" and an "owner."
Music video
First version
The first music video was shot in Lake Guatavita (some 16 km from Bogotá); this lagoon was the same one that gave rise to the famous legend of El Dorado. The director of the video was Mauricio Pardo and the recording of the music video lasted for 22 hours of continuous work. It was shot with murky visuals similar to bleach bypass. The video shows Fanny Lu on a canoe, likewise surrounded by flowers and with an accordionist that accompanies them when they sing the chorus. Interspersed with this are shots of Fanny Lu on a table, as well as swimming on their back holding flowers, and even, at one point near the end of the video, trashing bottles that are on the table, as well as throwing a bottle with a flower back into the lagoon, tying the video to the themes of the song. This is the better known of the videos.
International version
The music video has a second version that was shot in the Plaza Moreno on the city of La Plata, Argentina. The director for this version was Mauricio Pardo as well. Fanny released the music video on their VEVO and YouTube channel on 16 June 2009 when they created their VEVO account, though the video was played on-and-off internationally on channels like Telefutura (now UniMás). The video starts with Fanny Lu singing in a boring city with a black raincoat and after when the chorus starts, the people take off their black clothes and begin to dance the tropical rhythm of the song. At the end of the music video, a man comes to ask forgiveness to Fanny and suddenly appears a little girl in a bike that removes their clothes and leaves them naked; Fanny Lu laughs at him. As of 3 May 2013 the video has reached 5.92 million views on YouTube.

Central Park is the name of a neighborhood in Buffalo, New York. The neighborhood known as Central Park derives from a development conceived by cement magnate Lewis Jackson Bennett (1833–1925) on their Buffalo Cement Company property. Their Central Park home was designed by Buffalo architect Milton Earl Beebe.
Central Park is bounded by the west side of Main Street to the north side of Amherst Street to Starin to Linden to east side of Parkside to both the north and south sides of Woodbridge Ave
Lewis J. Bennett's early history
Bennett was born in Schenectady County, New York on July 7, 1833. They began their career as a grocery store clerk in Fultonville, New York and a collector of tolls on the Erie Canal at Fultonville, before moving to Buffalo in 1866 for a canal repair job.
Land acquisitions, cement factory, and Central Park development
Bennett bought land in North Buffalo for a limestone source needed to establish a cement factory. Starting in 1875 they also acquired land on the east and west sides of Main Street where there were cement deposits. In 1877 they established the Buffalo Cement Company, operating a quarry and manufacturing stone and cement. Ten years later they planned a residential subdivision on the company's lands with their son, Leslie Jay Bennett, and William Pierce, a co-owner of Buffalo Cement. They decided to call the area Central Park because of its geographic location near Delaware Park.
Central Park
Central Park was in close proximity to the Beltline Railroad and a station was built in Central Park (at Starin and Amherst). Known as the Central Park Station, it was owned by Buffalo Cement and leased by New York Central Railroad and Hudson River Railroad.
The Otowega Club's clubhouse was located in the area at the corner of Linden and Starin. It was later used by the Art Institute of Buffalo before being demolished after World War II. Burke's Green initially was an unnamed parcel of park land deeded to the city by Bennett, with a beehive style pile of rocks, that had a water pipe up center that drizzled water over the rocks. Eventually this fountain was dismantled and an evergreen was placed in the center. Then in the 1960s the park was dedicated to the memory of F Brendan Burke, and renamed Burke's Green. Bennett's house at 354 Depew Avenue was constructed in the area. It included 24 rooms and sat on 3 acres of land. It was demolished in 1935 and 12 building lots created.
Bennett donated the land on Main Street to the City for Bennett High School and All-High Stadium. Bennett led a fight that helped bring about a change from the "rate bill system" to a free public school system paid for by taxes, considered to be the first district to adopt that system. They were a life member of the Buffalo Society of Natural Sciences and Buffalo Historical Society, a member of the National Society of the Sons of the American Revolution, and a member of the Buffalo Chamber of Commerce. They named streets after their family and friends including Morris Avenue for the family of Lewis Bennett's brother in law, John Vedder Morris, and the man's father, Abram Vrooman Morris. John Morris married Mr. Bennett's younger sister Maria Lydia Bennett in 1875. Depew Avenue was named in honor of Chauncey M. Depew, a US Senator, New York State Secretary of State, and President of the New York Central Railroad.

The Kingdom of Cusco (sometimes spelled Cuzco and in Quechua Qosqo or Qusqu) was a small kingdom based in the city of Cusco, on the Andean mountain ranges that began as a small city-state founded by the Incas around the start of 13th century. In time, through warfare or peaceful assimilation, it began to grow and was succeeded by the Inca Empire (1438–1533).
History
Brief overview
The Inca people began as a tribe in the Cuzco area around the start of 13th century. Under the leadership of Manco Cápac, they formed the small city-state of Cusco (Quechua Qosqo), shown in red on the map below.
In 1438 AD, under the command of the Sapa Inca (paramount leader) Pachacuti (world-shaker), the Incas began a far-reaching expansion. The land which Pachacuti conquered was about the size of the Thirteen Colonies at the outbreak of the American Revolution of 1776, and consisted of nearly the entire territory of the Andes mountain range.
Pachacuti reorganized the kingdom of Cusco into an empire, the Tahuantinsuyu, a federalist system that consisted of a central government with the Inca at its head and four provincial governments with strong leaders: Chinchasuyu (NW), Antisuyu (NE), Kuntisuyu (SW), and Qullasuyu (SE). Pachacuti is thought to have built the citadel of Machu Picchu, either as a family home or as a vacation estate.
Sapa Incas
The Sapa Inca of the first dynasty of the Kingdom of Cusco were, in order, Manco Cápac, Sinchi Roca, Lloque Yupanqui, Mayta Cápac, and Cápac Yupanqui. Evidence of state organization dates from 1200 AD. Little is known of this population, but in later years the meaning of cápac meant warlord and sinchi meant leader adding to the idea they could have been rulers.
Long before the Spanish found the Inca, the Inca civilization had begun as a small, centralized state that eventually grew to cover a large amount of territory along the western coast of South America from Colombia to Chile. The Inca civilization spread rapidly from their small beginnings in the Kingdom of Cuzco located in southern Peru.
Beginning of the empire
The following outlines each of the Incan rulers and a few of their accomplishments in greater detail.
Mayta Cápac: c. 1290s
Mayta Cápac (Quechua: Mayta Qhapaq Inka) was the fourth Sapa Inca of the Kingdom of Cuzco (beginning around 1290 AD) and a member of the Hurin dynasty. The chroniclers describe them as a great warrior who conquered territories as far as Lake Titicaca, Arequipa, and Potosí. While in fact, their kingdom was still limited to the valley of Cuzco.
Fall of the civilization
Túpac Amaru: 1571–1572
Túpac Amaru was the last legitimate Inca to rule (in the Vilcabamba region as the Neo-Inca State). With the death of their elder brother Titu Cosi, they ordered the execution of all Spanish people living in Vilcabamba, and led an unsuccessful and poorly planned rebellion against the colonists. This resulted in their death and the end of Incan sovereignty, for Vilcabamba was occupied and the survivors enslaved in 1572.

was a military commander of the Minamoto clan of Japan in the late Heian and early Kamakura periods. During the Genpei War, they led a series of battles which toppled the Ise-Heishi branch of the Taira clan, helping their half-brother Yoritomo consolidate power.  They are considered one of the greatest and the most popular warriors of their era, and one of the most famous samurai fighters in the history of Japan. Yoshitsune perished after being betrayed by the son of a trusted ally.
Early life
Yoshitsune was the ninth son of Minamoto no Yoshitomo, and the third and final son and child that Yoshitomo would father with Tokiwa Gozen. Yoshitsune's older half-brother Minamoto no Yoritomo (the third son of Yoshitomo) would go on to establish the Kamakura shogunate. Yoshitsune's name in childhood was Ushiwakamaru (). They were born just before the Heiji Rebellion in 1160 in which their father and two oldest brothers were killed. They survived this incident by fleeing the capital with their mother, while their half-brother Yoritomo was banished to Izu Province. When they were 10, Yoshitsune was placed in the care of the monks of Kurama temple (), nestled in the Hiei Mountains near the capital of Kyoto. There they were taught swordsmanship and strategy, according to some legends by Sōjōbō, to others by Kiichi Hōgen (whose book, Six Secret Teachings, Ushiwakamaru stole). Not wanting to become a monk, Yoshitsune eventually left and followed a gold merchant who knew their father well, and in 1174 relocated to Hiraizumi, Mutsu Province, where they were put under the protection of Fujiwara no Hidehira, head of the powerful regional Northern Fujiwara clan.
Career
A skillful swordsman, Yoshitsune defeated the legendary warrior monk Benkei in a duel. From then on, Benkei became Yoshitsune's retainer, eventually dying with them at the Siege of Koromogawa.
In 1180, Yoshitsune heard that Yoritomo, now head of the Minamoto clan, had raised an army at the request of Prince Mochihito to fight against the Taira clan (also known as the Heike) which had usurped the power of the emperor. In the ensuing war between the rival Minamoto and Taira samurai clans, known as the Genpei War, Yoshitsune joined Yoritomo, along with Minamoto no Noriyori, all brothers who had not previously met.
Yoshitsune, together with their brother Noriyori, defeated the Taira in several key battles. They also attacked and killed their cousin Minamoto no Yoshinaka, a rival for control of the Minamoto clan, at the Battle of Awazu in Ōmi Province in early 1184 on the orders of Yoritomo.
Yoshitsune, who had by then been given the rank of general, went on to defeat the Taira at the Battle of Ichi-no-Tani in present-day Kobe in March 1184, and again at the Battle of Yashima in Shikoku in March 1185. They finally destroyed them one month later at the Battle of Dan-no-ura in present-day Yamaguchi Prefecture.
Final years
Following the Genpei War, Yoshitsune was appointed as Governor of Iyo and awarded other titles by cloistered emperor Go-Shirakawa. Their suspicious brother Yoritomo, however, opposed the presentation of these titles, and nullified them.
Yoshitsune then secured imperial authorization to ally with their uncle Minamoto no Yukiie in opposing Yoritomo. Incurring Yoritomo's wrath, Yoshitsune fled Kyoto in 1185. Their faithful mistress, Shizuka Gozen, carrying their unborn child, fled with them at first, but then was left behind, and soon taken into custody by forces loyal to Yoritomo.
Yoshitsune eventually made their way to Hiraizumi, Mutsu, once again to the protection of Fujiwara no Hidehira, and lived undisturbed for a time. Hidehira's son Fujiwara no Yasuhira had promised upon Hidehira's death to honor their father's wishes and continue to shelter Yoshitsune, but, giving in to pressure from Yoritomo, betrayed Yoshitsune, surrounding their Koromogawa-no-tachi residence with their troops, defeating Yoshitsune's retainers, including Benkei (in a famous "standing death"), and forcing Yoshitsune to commit seppuku. Yasuhira then had Yoshitsune's head preserved in sake, placed in a black-lacquered chest, and sent to Yoritomo as proof of their death. Historical sources differ as to the fate of Yoshitsune's mistress Shizuka and their son.
Yoshitsune is enshrined in the Shirahata Jinja, a Shinto shrine in the city of Fujisawa.
Rumors and legend
The death of Yoshitsune has been very elusive. According to Ainu historical accounts, they did not commit seppuku, but instead escaped the siege at Koromogawa, fleeing to Hokkaido and assuming the name Okikurumi/Oinakamui. An alternate and discredited theory states that after evading death, Yoshitsune made their way past Hokkaido and sailed to the mainland of Asia, re-surfacing as Genghis Khan.
There's a temple Henshoji in Mooka, Tochigi. According to an old temple magazine and tradition, Hitachibō Kaison entrusted a monk Hitachi Nyūdō Nensai with a child of Minamoto no Yoshitsune, Keiwaka, as demanded by Hidehira Fujiwara. Furthermore, according to the tradition of Enmyō-ji temple in Hirosaki, Aomori, Chitose Maru, also known as Keiwakamaru was a child of Yoshitsune, entrusted to Date Tomomune by Kaison. After the adoption Kaison disappeared.
Koshigoe Letter
The "Koshigoe Letter" was written by Yoshitsune on the 24th day of the 5th month of the second year of Genryaku (June 23, 1185) as they waited in Koshigoe for approval from Yoritomo to enter Kamakura. The letter was Yoshitsune's "final appeal" to Yoritomo of theirs loyalty. The letter is a "mixture of bravado and an almost masochistic indulgence in misfortune." An excerpt:
In literature
Yoshitsune has long been a popular figure in Japanese literature and culture due to their appearance as the main character in the third section of the Japanese literary classic Heike Monogatari (Tale of the Heike). The Japanese term for "sympathy for a tragic hero", , comes from Yoshitsune's title Kurō Hōgan (), which they received from the Imperial Court.
Many of the literary pieces that Yoshitsune appears in are legend rather than historical fact. Legends pertaining to Yoshitsune first began to appear in the fourteenth century. In early works at that time, Yoshitsune was described as a sharp-witted military leader. Then, romantic stories about their early childhood and last years of their life appeared as people began to know more about him.
The legends that deal with their public career show Yoshitsune as a great, virtuous warrior. They were often shown as kind to those around them and honorable, but was also shown to be naive.
Legends dealing with Yoshitsune's childhood show young Yoshitsune (or Ushiwakamaru) with heroic qualities.  They are portrayed as a brave and skilled swordsman, despite being a young boy. They were also skilled in music and their studies, and was also said to be able to easily sway the hearts of young women. These legends delve into fantasy more so than the legends about their later life.
Legends which pertain to the time when their half-brother, Yoritomo, turned against them take away some of Yoshitsune's heroic qualities.  They are no longer portrayed as a great warrior, but they retain their knowledge and skills that are valuable in the emperor's court.
Yoshitsune's escape through the Ataka barrier is the subject of Noh play Ataka and the Kabuki play Kanjinchō. Kanjinchō was later dramatized by Akira Kurosawa in the 1945 movie The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail.
The Gikeiki, or "Chronicle of Yoshitsune" relates events of Yoshitsune's life after the defeat of the Heike.
Family
Father: Minamoto no Yoshitomo
Mother: Tokiwa Gozen
Wife: Sato Gozen (1168–1189)
Concubine: Shizuka Gozen
Traditional arts
In addition to The Tale of the Heike and Gikeiki, a great many other works of literature and drama feature him, and together form the sekai ("world") of Yoshitsune, a concept akin to the notion of the literary cycle.
These include:
Yoshitsune Shin Takadachi (jōruri)
Yoshitsune Senbon Zakura (jōruri and kabuki)
Kanjinchō (kabuki)
In the visual arts, Yoshitsune is commonly depicted as a bishōnen, though this is at odds with contemporary descriptions of their appearance.

Charles Richard Kelly (born 1945) was an early pioneer in the development of modern mountain bicycles.
Life
Kelly attended Tamalpais High School in Mill Valley, California, at the foot of Mount Tamalpais.
During the late sixties and early seventies Kelly was a roadie for a San Francisco rock band, The Sons of Champlin. When the band broke up in 1977, Kelly turned their attention to their passion for bicycling and "klunker" bikes they and their friends were constructing from old frames and taking off-road.
In 1972 Kelly was a founding member and later president of Velo-Club Tamalpais, a bicycle club whose membership included most of the early Marin County mountain bike pioneers.
In 1976 they started promoting the Repack downhill race, the first great mountain bike event. In connection with their downhill racing efforts, they commissioned custom off-road bicycle frames from builders Craig Mitchell and Joe Breeze. These were among the first "mountain bikes" ever built.
In 1979 Kelly joined their former roommate Gary Fisher and framebuilder Tom Ritchey in a business venture called "MountainBikes," the first place in the world people could buy a complete mountain bicycle, rather than putting it together themselves (Not to be confused with Specialized, who in 1981 sold the first PRODUCTION mountain bike, that could be bought in a bike shop and rolled away that same day). In 1982 Kelly sold their interest in the company to Fisher, who renamed it Fisher Mountain Bikes.
Also in 1979, Kelly began contributing articles to bicycle publications on the new and growing sport of mountain biking.
In 1980 Kelly and Denise Caramagno started the first mountain bike magazine: The Fat Tire Flyer. Until 1986 this was the only publication for mountain bikers.
In 1983 Kelly participated in the founding of the National Off-Road Bicycle Association, the first sanctioning body for mountain bike racing, and in collaboration with Tom Hillard, wrote the first set of rules for off-road bicycle racing.
Kelly is the author of a definitive history of the sport of mountain biking, Fat Tire Flyer: Repack and the Birth of Mountain Biking.
They were inducted into the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame in 1988

"Beethoven (I Love to Listen To)" is a song by British pop duo Eurythmics, released on 12 October 1987 as the lead single from their sixth studio album, Savage (1987).
Background
Writing
It was written by group members Annie Lennox and David A. Stewart. Although not released as a single in the United States, the track appeared as a double A-side of the 12 inch single for "I Need a Man", and received heavy rotation on MTV. It was a Top 20 hit in several European territories and also in Australia.
Style
The Savage album returned Eurythmics to a more electronic sound and the "Beethoven" vocals are performed mostly as spoken-word from Lennox, with the exception of the repeated phrase "I love to" throughout the track.
Music video
Music videos were produced for all twelve tracks on the Savage album, all directed by Sophie Muller, and most of them with a shared concept featuring character(s) played by Lennox who display characteristics of dissociative identity disorder or split personalities.
As the first part of this loose narrative, the "Beethoven" video begins with Lennox portraying a repressed, middle-class housewife, knitting in their apartment. They exhibit characteristics of obsessive–compulsive disorder through their habitual cleaning and chopping of vegetables. The video also includes a mischievous little girl who has blonde hair, and a man who is wearing make-up and an evening gown, neither of whom are directly noticed by the housewife even though they are in their living room with them These characters are seemingly components of a new character that the dowdy housewife becomes as they have a nervous breakdown and transforms themselves into a blonde, overtly sexual vixen. In this newly liberated persona, they trash the apartment that, as a housewife, they had kept meticulously clean. The video ends with their walking out into the street laughing.
