Back in 2013, former CIA and former NSA Director Michael Hayden made an ill-advised joke when he alluded to wanting to put Edward Snowden on a kill list. Now, in an interview with Al Jazeera's Mehdi Hasan, Hayden is finally clarifying hist stance—sort of.
In the clip above, Hasan asks the former embodiment of Big Brother directly, “Do you believe [Snowden] should be assassinated and put on a kill list as many say you suggested?”
Hayden is... less direct, spending a lot of time demurring and offering half answers to what should be a fairly simple of course not, I'm not a maniac.
Michael Hayden: “I didn't say that.” Mehdi Hasan: “You said he should be put on a list.” Hayden: “...I was there in a panel in downtown Washington, and he was nominated for [an award] list.” Hasan: “And you said, ‘I could think of another list.'” Hayden: “What I said was, ‘In my darker moments, I have thought about that.'” Hasan: “So in your darker moments, you have thought about killing him?” Hayden: “Well, because he has been tremendously destructive to American security.”
Hayden goes on to say that he's “never supported assassinating Edward Snowden.” But apparently, even though he's never officially supported Snowden's assassination, a boy can still dream.
And does Hayden support executing Edward Snowden? “I probably don't,” he says. Probably.
So does Michael Hayden want Snowden dead? He certainly doesn't want Snowden dead. Whether or not Hayden believes that Snowden belongs on either a birthday or Christmas-card list, as Hasan suggests, remains unclear.
LISTEN TO TLR'S LATEST PODCAST:
By Joshua Philipp, Epoch Times
Two high-profile officials who served under the Obama administration told a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on May 8 that they had reviewed classified information in which Donald Trump, his associates, or members of Congress had been unmasked.
When an intelligence agency gives transcripts of intercepted communications, it often seals the names of U.S. citizens. When a recipient of an intelligence report requests to have the name revealed, it is referred to as “unmasking.”
The testimonies by Sally Yates, the former acting attorney general, and James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence (DNI), raised the question of whether communications of the Trump team were gathered for legitimate purposes or for political purposes.
Last month, White House lawyers discovered that under President Barack Obama, national security adviser Susan Rice requested unmasking names on dozens of occasions—starting in July 2016 and increasing in frequency after the elections—of members of the Trump team.
The Obama administration tripled its unmasking requests in the election year, jumping from 654 requests in 2015, to 1,934 requests in 2016. The information was included in an April report from the DNI.
At least some of the requests appear to have been related to an investigation ordered by Obama in July 2016 into potential Russian interference in the election and collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.
During his testimony, Clapper reaffirmed that the investigation by the DNI as well as the CIA, FBI, and NSA did not find any evidence of collusion.
General Michael Flynn
In her testimony, Yates said that she had warned the Trump administration that former national security adviser Michael Flynn had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his communications with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The Trump team confirmed Flynn had lied and fired him on Feb. 13, after he'd spent just 24 days on the job.
During the hearing, Yates declined to answer most questions about unmasking, on the grounds that it's classified.
However, both Yates and Clapper confirmed that they received classified information in which Trump, his associates, or members of Congress were unmasked.
When asked if they personally requested unmasking in these cases, Clapper said he did in one instance, and Yates said, “I can't give you the details.”
During Trump's transition into office, someone who received the reports with unmasked names of Trump team members then leaked the classified information to The Washington Post—violating U.S. law.
Mike Rogers, director of the National Security Agency, told the Senate Armed Services Committee on May 9 that in the case of Flynn, in which his unmasked communications were leaked to the media, “that is illegal.”
The statements from Yates raised additional questions on how she received the information on Flynn, and whether this fits into the broader investigation of whether the Obama administration violated the law with the surveillance and with the transmission of classified information.
The Senate subcommittee is now also investigating who was behind the leak and who, in turn, provided them with the information. Both Clapper and Yates said they were unsure who was behind it.
It was confirmed during the hearing that someone requested unmasking the surveillance reports, and then spread the documents with the names revealed. Yates confirmed she had received such reports.
Rogers said the intelligence community has a “very strict process” for handling the unmasking of names. He said if someone's name is unmasked in a report, that report is given only to the individual who requested it and “they are specifically told and reminded” not to share it.
This brings further questions onto Susan Rice, who said she had requested unmasking, yet said in an interview with MSNBC in April that she did not do it for political reasons.
Rice was asked to testify before the Senate committee, but she declined to appear.
The findings may also expand the investigations into whether the Obama administration spied on members of Congress, and again whether it was done with a political motive.
Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) wrote a letter to Trump on April 10, obtained by news and entertainment website Circa, in which he said an anonymous source alleged that “my name, as well as the names of other members of Congress, were unmasked, queried, or both, in intelligence reports of intercepts during the prior administration.”
On May 5, Paul wrote on Twitter, “I have formally requested from the WH and the Intel Committees info on whether I was surveilled by Obama admin and or the Intel community!”

The reporter who helped expose an infamously paranoid, manipulative and destructive president said Sunday that Richard Nixon had nothing on Donald Trump.
“Trump's attacks on the American press as 'enemies of the American people' are more treacherous than Richard Nixon's attacks on the press," former Washington Post reporter Carl Bernstein said Sunday on CNN.
Trump's comments — made publicly, whereas Nixon attacked his enemies in private — brought to mind “dictators and authoritarians, including Stalin, including Hitler," Bernstein said.
[Fox News anchor Chris Wallace warns viewers: Trump crossed the line in the latest attack on media]
He immediately walked back a comparison to the Nazi leader, while doubling down on the comparison to Nixon.
Bernstein — whose reporting of the Watergate break-in and coverup helped bring about Nixon's resignation — said Trump's rhetoric is potentially more dangerous than Nixon's attacks on the news media.
“There is no civic consensus in this country like there was at the time of Watergate about acceptable presidential conduct," Bernstein said on “Reliable Sources."
“Trump is out there on his own, leading a demagogic attack on the institutions of free democracy," he said. “We are into terrible authoritarian tendencies."
Bernstein's words echoed others who spoke out Sunday, after Trump escalated his months-long war on reporters with a single tweet.
It's “how dictators get started," Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said the same day on NBC's “Meet the Press."
Before the election, the University of Maryland's chair of broadcast journalism discerned “Nixon's echo — and, perhaps, Nixon's revenge" in Trump's rhetoric on the campaign trail.
“He, too, obsessively sought to manipulate the news coverage he desperately craved and wasn't afraid to use intimidation if he thought it would help," Mark Feldstein wrote in The Post.
Nixon's attacks on the press struck a chord with voters, helping carry him to power and encouraging more of the same, Feldstein wrote. “Nixon's conduct in office presents a chilling example of what a President Trump could do."
[Trump called the press 'the enemy.' Reince Priebus says he meant it.]
Shortly after winning office, Feldstein wrote, Nixon “dispatched Vice President Spiro Agnew to launch a public assault on the 'small and unelected elite' of journalists."
Half a century later, on his full first day in office, Trump sent his press secretary to yell at the press.
“The press is your enemy,” Nixon said during his first term. “Enemies. Understand that? … Now, never act that way … give them a drink, you know, treat them nice, you just love it, you're trying to be helpful. But don't help the bastards. Ever. Because they're trying to stick the knife right in our groin.”
But Nixon was talking to one person when he made those remarks in February 1971: Adm. Thomas H. Moorer, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time. His comments wouldn't be made public until later.
Trump was speaking to his 25 million Twitter followers when, after weeks of news reports on scandals and chaos in his White House, he called most of the major news organizations in the United States “enemies of the American People!"
“We're not enemies of the American people," Bernstein said on CNN. “In fact, we're the last resort of the American people to a dictatorial and authoritarian-inclined president."

These photographs are part of an album compiled by the nature writer John Burroughs and published after his death in 1921. In it, Burroughs documents a 12-day car-camping trip he took in 1918 at the age of 81, along with 71-year-old Thomas Edison and their younger friends, Henry Ford and Harvey Firestone.
This trip was one of a series. The foursome, adding or subtracting influential associates, made excursions of this kind from 1915 through 1924. The whole album commemorating the 1918 trip is available online, through the Harvard University Libraries.
In August 1918, the four “vagabonds,” as they called themselves, headed a convoy of eight vehicles traveling a meandering route through Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Tennessee, and Virginia. The group stopped to camp on farms, examine old industrial sites, take hikes along rivers, and (as one series of photographs documents) partake in playful contests measuring skill with farming implements.
The group represented a potent concentration of early 20th-century celebrity and wealth. Edison and Ford are the best-remembered of the “vagabonds” today, but Firestone, whose tire company's fortunes rose along with Ford's, was also a prominent industrialist in his time. And Burroughs was a much-beloved writer on the tail end of a successful career.
Burroughs' story of the trip contains many observations about his famous friends. Edison needed the trip, Burroughs wrote, because it was “a shaking up … an antidote to his concentrated life.” The inventor sprawled on the ground at rest stops and meditated or read alone in one of the cars when the group had downtime. Ford was stubborn, an engineer at heart, and mechanically inclined; he tinkered with their cars throughout the trip, even managing to fix one that mechanics had declared a goner. At night, the group discoursed on Shakespeare, Thoreau, chemistry, and physics around the campfire.
Besides being full of such anecdotes, the book also serves as a great document of the practice of automobile travel in its earliest days. The group asked leave to pitch their tents on farms along the way and visited with the locals. Frequent stops were necessary, as the roads were rough.
Burroughs admitted that he found auto travel difficult as an octogenarian. He added, enviously, that the portlier Edison found it easier, as he was “cushiony and adjustable, and always carries his own shock absorbers with him.”
It has been said that women have more sensitive palates than men. That women are able to detect aromas and nuances those of the male persuasion sometimes miss, and are better at identifying specific flavors in foods and beverages. One of the most important positions in the whisky world is that of Master Blender, whose keen senses of smell and taste are relied upon to determine the quality of the final product. However, guess which gender traditionally dominates that role?
Rachel Barrie of Bowmore is one of the few females in the world to hold this distinguished title. She has quite the task, as she is not only in charge of Bowmore distillery's releases, but also those at Auchentoshan and Glen Garioch (pronounced “Glen Geary,” rhymes with “eerie”), all part of the Bowmore family spread throughout Scotland.
So how did Barrie earn this prestigious title for one of the most prominent Scotch producers? A combination of right place, right time, and boundless enthusiasm. She had always been interested in the Scotch-making process. She attributes her natural gifts as combined hereditary traits – a sharp sense of smell from her dad and a talent for describing flavors and aromas from her mom. After earning her graduate chemistry degree, Barrie became a Research Scientist at the Scotch Whisky Research Institute. From there she worked as a researcher and Product Development Manager at Glenmorangie, already in charge of key grain to bottle decisions, and was eventually promoted to Master Blender, the first female ever to do so. She came to Bowmore in 2011.
In her first year at Bowmore, Barrie dug right in to select new releases from all three distilleries. During a recent afternoon at the NoMad Hotel in New York City, she presented three of their signature marks, accompanied by “mystery” drams from each distillery, which are destined for release in the coming months. These selections were chosen among a vast range of casks at each distillery. It was up to Barrie to taste through these casks and decide which ones were worthy of bottling for limited editions. One barrel among hundreds at each distillery. The joke is “How do you choose among your children?” But this is precisely what Barrie has to do to be a successful Master Blender. No pressure or anything.
The trick was to choose representations that don't stray too far from the aesthetic of the distilleries, but at the same time, offer something different to entice the public. The selections were each fascinating to taste in their own way, like jazz variations on their source material.
The well-aged Auchentoshan (let's just say in America it's well past legal, but not so old it doesn't get carded now and then) spent its final maturation in Oloroso sherry casks. This adds a much deeper hue and richer flavors than the lighter, more tropical signature releases of this Lowland malt. Modern Glen Garioch whiskies are unpeated, however the “mystery dram” hails from a time when the distillery still used peat in their production. The resulting whisky has a subtle, sweet smoke that wafts delicately around floral and pine notes. And if Bowmore's home at Islay is known for its brooding weather, the selected whisky reveals its sunnier side. It's light both in color and tone, with soft, malty flavors and comforting accents of cookie dough and sweet barbecue smoke. A drop of water frees its more savory notes of olive oil, rosemary and even, baked ham.
Attention gift shoppers: The signature Scotches of all three distilleries are all widely available year round and highly recommended additions to any collection, especially since they are prime examples of three distinctly different regions and styles. Definitely look out for new limited editions from Auchentoshan, Glen Garioch and Bowmore in the coming months. As you do, think about everything that goes into those bottles from grain to barrel, and how much the details matter. The world is lucky to have someone like Rachel Barrie among those who make that call. Our taste buds thank her.

Doctors in Florida have pulled off a medical first that saved the lives of a pregnant woman and her triplets twice over, defying a rare neurological illness that nearly killed all four.
Andrea Temperino, 34, was left close to death and reliant on a mechanical ventilator to breathe for her when she developed a complex form of the neuromuscular disease Myasthenia Gravis eight weeks into her pregnancy. It is the only known case of its kind involving a patient with unborn triplets.
After seven weeks in hospital, she recovered. But three months later, she suffered a second life-threatening condition that left doctors with only minutes to save her and her babies.
Temperino and her infants, who were delivered by emergency C-section at 30 weeks gestation, are now doing well at the University of Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital.
"We must have had someone watching over us, to have found these people who saved my wife and my babies' lives – not once, but twice," said Anthony Temperino, also 34. "Without them, for sure, all four would have been dead." Andrea said: "They are my little miracles. I'm just so happy it's all over and we have the lives of our three precious babies."
The Temperinos, of Coral Springs, Florida, were told by fertility specialists eight years ago that they had a "0% chance" of having children of their own but, after lifestyle changes that included transitioning to an all-organic and natural diet, celebrated the arrival of their first child, Ayden, last year following in-vitro-fertilisation treatment.
In June this year, following the implant of two more fertilised eggs, Andrea Temperino discovered that she was pregnant again – this time with triplets. But the joy was short-lived as her health inexplicably deteriorated, leaving her struggling to breathe and swallow and with a severely drooping eyelid, confounding doctors at the first hospital where she sought help.
"I was having to beg and plead, I was calling war. We were getting nowhere with finding out what was wrong with her, or even getting some of them to acknowledge that there was anything wrong with her," Anthony Temperino said.
Taking the decision after 10 days to seek help elsewhere, he took his wife to the emergency room at Jackson Memorial Hospital.
"At this point she can't breathe properly, she can't walk, she can't swallow. She's just trying to survive. I was praying: 'Please God, let the doctors figure this out because I'm going to lose her,'" he said.
She was diagnosed within hours as having Myasthenia Gravis with MuSK, a chronic, auto-immune neuromuscular disease in which antibodies attack the receptors that allow brain signals to reach the body's muscles.
As doctors struggled to bring the condition under control, she ended up in intensive care for eight days, where doctors inserted a breathing tube to keep her alive. "They said 'We need to do this quick, she's leaving us,' and I said 'Where's she going?' I didn't realise at first what they meant," said Anthony Temperino, a commercial pilot.
Dr Shahnaz Duara, medical director of the neo-natal intensive care unit at Jackson's Holtz Children's Hospital, said: "What's truly amazing is that Mrs Temperino was at one point so close to collapse, so sick, and yet none of that seems to have transferred to her babies. Her obstetrician had said to me: 'I don't know if I can get her to a point where there will even be any babies for you to take care of.' It was a very serious situation but through it all, those three babies hung in there."
After seven weeks in hospital she was discharged, only to suffer a further emergency three weeks ago when the babies' placenta separated from the wall of the uterus – a life-threatening condition known as placental abruption, causing massive bleeding.
Within 15 minutes, she was in an operating theatre surrounded by 25 doctors. Identical twins Austyn and Alexander, and fraternal triplet Ashton were all delivered within one minute. All are now thriving and expected to survive.
Andrea Temperino's neurologist at Jackson, Dr Ashok Verma, said that the case is "one for the medical history books."
"For a while it was a hard situation … MuSK doesn't respond to the usual medication for MG – in fact she didn't respond at all – and it took a long time to turn things around. I told her 'You are my most precious patient, because there's not just one of you but three other lives to take care of.' I wanted to come out of this with all four of them and we did."
He added: "And after all that, this crazy woman was telling me yesterday: 'Next, I want a girl.'"
We are tired of bad press about the press. We are trying to be 'team players.' We are terrified of more layoffs and paycuts. We would like to produce quality work without 'obamasux99' posting some non-sequitur rant at the end of it. . . . We would like some respect, plz. We are journalists.
This is the mission statement of We Are Journalists, the latest online movement in the tradition of the 99 Percent: Reveal your inner life in the hopes of getting a little bit of public recognition. "I keep a spare pair of boots in my car in case I have to go traipsing through a crime scene, and a pencil in case I'm outside and my pens freeze," one typical journalist informs readers. "I send text messages in AP style."
It's no revelation that journalists can also claim membership to the Are Dull At Parties movement. Read on, though, and the boasting grows more troubling. "I've talked to people who are making funeral plans for their children," the crime scene-traipsing journalist continues. A colleague chimes in that she has "seen police pull a duffel bag filled with body parts out of the Hudson River." Writes another, "I find writing about people dying incredibly hard but love the challenge of getting the news out first and then summing everything up to camera in a maximum of 80 seconds ready for mobile-phone ready TV." Another journalist has "interviewed a mother who gave childbirth in an alley and promptly abandoned it in her drug-induced stupor, leaving the baby to die."
We've talked to people with dead kids, we've seen police recover bodies, we've written about people who are dying, we've interviewed a drug-addicted new mother. Do none of these professional observers realize that we are on the more agreeable side of this equation? For our sources, the story is personal tragedy. For us, it's a professional accomplishment. Now, we're using our sources' lives to embellish our own career mythos.
Yes, many of us have all-consuming, insecure jobs. And while we may be underpaid compared to peers who went the banker or lawyer route, journalists don't live in poverty. Plus, almost all of us hold highly prestigious positions in society, all things considered. (This is not "We Are Garbage Collectors.") It's true that we face criticism from all sides for our work. But would any of us disagree with the dominant critiques—that we can be biased in our reporting, influenced by powerful companies, and often inaccurate? Even our Pulitzer Prize-winners plagiarize and hang on to their jobs. I worked for a television station recently that routinely misspelled its own reporters' names when we appeared on screen. Many of us are trying our best, and sometimes that's really not good enough.
Have we forgotten the lessons of Spider-Man so quickly? With great power comes great responsibility, and our responsibility includes accepting Obamasux99's lingering incoherence in exchange for the opportunity to hold court in every newspaper, magazine, website, television station, and mobile device in the world. Really, Obamasux99 is not so different from us journalists. Railing against the powerful is kind of our jam. And in that vast comments section of the world, it is our voices that rise to the top.
This is the major distortion of We Are Journalists: The idea that we are somehow voiceless. How could we possibly be more heard? We have the power to frame how the death of a parent's child is broadcast to the world. Now, we're complaining because we're forced to, what—speak to these people? Maybe the next meme should be "We Spoke to a Journalist." That sounds a lot harder than what I do every day.

Demystifying the Chinese Yuan
The Money Project is an ongoing collaboration between Visual Capitalist and Texas Precious Metals that seeks to use intuitive visualizations to explore the origins, nature, and use of money.
With one of the world's largest economies and a growing financial sector, China continues to rise as a global power.
The country's currency, the Chinese yuan (officially the Renminbi), is also starting to mature. The most recent evidence of this? The IMF's decision to include the yuan as a part of its SDR international reserve asset, a basket of major world currencies:
Currency 2011-2015 SDR 2016 SDR Change U.S. Dollar 41.9% 41.7% -0.2% Euro 37.4% 30.9% -6.5% Pound 11.3% 8.1% -3.2% Yen 9.4% 8.3% -1.1% Yuan 0.0% 10.9% +10.9%
The Chinese economy is significant on a world stage, but its currency and financial system still have major growing up to do.
China is walking a fine balance: it desperately wants to legitimize its currency, but it also must find ways to keep its economic engine moving forward.
The Yuan's Wild Ride So Far
In the early 1980s, the Chinese began to implement ‘Socialism with Chinese characteristics', by opening up the state-controlled economy to the global market in very limited ways.
Since being on the world stage, the yuan has been all over the place. It's been pegged to the U.S. dollar, unpegged, and then temporarily re-pegged again during the Financial Crisis.
Most recently, the currency was devalued sharply in 2015 to make up for slowing GDP growth. Today, it sits at six-year lows against the U.S. dollar.
The PBOC and the Chinese Yuan
The strategy used by The People's Bank of China has not been easy to follow.
China wants its currency to matter, but it is also guilty of intervening in currency markets according to the priorities of the day.
In September 2016, for example, the country increased overnight borrowing rates and bought up the yuan in large amounts to counteract shorting from international traders.
The Fix Is In
Onshore, the yuan is allowed to trade within 2% of the PBOC reference point.
The previous day's trading might be a factor in setting this. Then again, it may not matter. The decision is not up to the market. Value is set by unnamed officials behind the scenes.
This “flexibility” allows China to swing between different strategies for the yuan.
The Dragon's Gambit
China can print money endlessly to keep the yuan's value artificially low, which is good for manufacturers. This is handy in a case such as when exports fall year-over-year, and the economy is slowing.
But in other cases, China has different priorities, such as protecting the value of the yuan during times of international uncertainty. It can help to do this by securing the yuan with surprise gold holdings announcements or by dumping massive amounts of U.S. Treasuries to prop up the yuan's price.
Sometimes these divergent strategies appear to be operating in the same week. Who's in charge?
International currency traders ultimately don't know how these decisions are made, or who is making them.
The Golden Hoard That Wasn't
China's currency manipulation has helped it to accumulate massive foreign exchange holdings. But these holdings are not a sign of economic strength or a basis for investment in the country's future. They're a hedge against currency flight. When the economy is sinking, the government can use these reserves to prop it back up.
Rank Country Official Reserve Assets (billions of USD) 1 China $3,520.4 2 Japan $1,321.0 3 Euro Area $819.9 4 Switzerland $661.2 5 Saudi Arabia $580.7 6 Russia $407.3 7 Hong Kong $380.2 8 Rep. Korea $372.6 9 India $366.2 10 Brazil $362.2
The Dragon Sleeps
According to the Bank of International Settlements, trading volume of the Chinese yuan has doubled over the last three years.
But the U.S. greenback and other top currencies have a huge advantage: people think they know what they are worth. The value isn't set by government apparatchik.
For now, the Chinese yuan remains a sleeping dragon. If China ever really joins the global market in a meaningful way, watch the currency wake up and breathe fire.

Unusual framing, for one. USA
This article originally appeared in Vulture.
When Tod Campbell joined Mr. Robot as director of photography on its second episode, he had what Marlo Stanfield from The Wire might refer to as “one of them good problems” in deciding how to shoot it. Lead actor Rami Malek's eyes were almost too gorgeous. “My God, Rami? I could put a light a hundred yards away and his eyes would pick it up,” says the veteran cinematographer of shows from Friday Night Lights to Sleepy Hollow. This ocular casting coup helped determine how Campbell came to shape the distinctive look of creator Sam Esmail's twisty, anti-capitalist hacker drama, one of the summer's standout shows (its finale aired on USA Wednesday). And you don't need Malek-size eyes to see that Mr. Robot composes its shots like nothing else on television today.
Fitting for a show about those occupying society's technological substrata, Mr. Robot's characters are often placed at the very bottom of the frame. This leaves massive amounts of headroom that suggests a great weight hanging over their heads, and echoes their isolation: When they're talking right to each other, they seem alone. In more conventional filmmaking, conversations are cut with the characters looking at each other from opposite ends of the frame, leaving what's known as “leading room” between their faces that helps convey the physical space they occupy. Mr. Robot inverses the norm by “shortsighting” the characters, positioning their faces at the edge of the frame closest toward the person to whom they're speaking.
USA
“Shortsighting is unnerving,” Campbell explains. “It further accentuates how fucked-up Elliot's world is. The idea was to convey the loneliness. That's the internal dialogue I had with myself: How do we tell that story? How do you get Elliot across?”
The effect goes a long way in selling audiences on the mounting paranoia and dissociation of the show's main character, hacker Elliot Alderson (Malek). Without the usual pattern to help us intuit spatial relationships, these scenes create the sense that the characters don't know where they stand in relation to one another. They also remind us of the picture-in-picture, face-against-flat-surface nature of video chatting, which can't be overlooked on a show this attuned to the alienating effects of technology.
According to Campbell, Malek's eyes influenced his approach, right down to the lenses he selected. “We use Cooke S5s, which are more round than other lenses,” he says. “They really accentuate curves, and they help sculpt the face a little more. I chose those lenses because Rami's eyes are so big, and so are a lot of the other characters'. Rami, Carly (Chaikin, Elliot's fellow hacker Darlene), Portia (Doubleday, his co-worker and friend Angela)—all of the people we love have these big, giant, bulbous eyes. The one person who doesn't is Tyrell (Wellick, the sinister young executive played by Martin Wallström); he's got these deep-seated eyes. I asked Sam, ‘Did you do that on purpose?' and he never really answered me.”
Shortsighting allowed Campbell to bring a wider lens in closer. “In close-ups of Elliot, everything else is so out of focus that it's literally him floating in space,” he says. “You can really connect with those big, gorgeous eyes and get a sense that we're present with him.”
USA
And in a voice-over-heavy show like Mr. Robot, Campbell also had the challenge of visually complementing the show's narration. “There's so much internal dialogue for Elliot, so much voice-over that the other characters don't get to hear. How do we visually maintain those moments where he's got the internal dialogue and his therapist is sitting across from him and he's not saying anything?” Campbell explains. “Ultimately, I go back to this isolation thing in his head and trying to be in there with him. With all that headroom that we use, I was trying to erase what's around him, so that it's just his head. Your eyes aren't jumping to all the little bits and pieces of people crossing behind him, or all the other things that you might normally set up in the frame.”
Expanding this style to all of the characters, not just Elliot, was another key decision, one with real storytelling consequences. “We went further with it and used it all over the place,” Campbell says. “That speaks to the idea of Are things real, or are they not? So the idea was to keep it consistent throughout the piece and make people feel like the ground beneath them is undulating constantly. That's the way Elliot himself feels. It never gives you a sense of really being righted.”
USA
With the new pattern firmly in place, Campbell and Esmail could really make deviations count. “There were some moments where I really wanted to put Rami dead center [in the] frame, often in his therapist's office. It's a place where it kind of feels safe, but not really, because she's really digging at him. We'd save putting him either on what you'd call the ‘correct' side of the frame in a conversation or in the center, and really reserve those moments for something where we felt the subtext would be more profound.”
USA
This carried over to the motion of the camera, which Campbell says he'd come to distrust from working on more traditionally shot shows, in which the camera was moved frequently to cut costs—and corners. “In television, it's very difficult to block a scene where the camera doesn't move much, so you have to concede a few things in there. But we came to a place where we really didn't want to pan or tilt the camera. There were only two handheld shots in the whole show: One is in the dream sequence, and the other is with Elliot finding [his murdered girlfriend] Shayla in the trunk. We started out with zero handhelds, but we ultimately found ourselves wanting to set these certain moments apart from everything else.”
“We had a steadicam operator the whole time, but we only used it once, in the finale,” Campbell adds. “The Steadicam is really great for certain things, but in television, for a lot of directors, it's their lazy way out of shooting a scene. ‘Put it on the Steadicam, walk and talk, blah blah blah.' We never wanted to do walk-and-talk.”
It's a heavy cocktail of unconventional approaches, so much so that when Campbell started out—taking over from Girls director of photography Tim Ives, who helped give the pilot serious New York City style—he was scared he'd lose his job over it. “Because USA was a new network for me, and their history is a different, brighter type of storytelling and photography, I was really nervous,” he says. “They ultimately became very supportive, of course.”
Next to Rami Malek's eyes Campbell credits creator Esmail with making Mr. Robot's distinctive look possible. “In my phone interview with him for the job, he was like, ‘I want to do a lot of negative space. I really want to change this up,' ” Campbell says. “I'd never met him before, and I was like, ‘I'm so sick and tired of directors coming in on episodes I'm shooting like, “Oh, I want it to look like House of Cards! I want it to look like blah blah blah!” Sam, we need to become the reference point everybody uses from now on. I want everybody to say, “I want it to look like Mr. Robot.” ' He was like, ‘Oh shit, dude—you got the job.' ”

U.K. court: Jewish school's entry policy is racist
Britain's Jewish community is in an uproar over the Court of Appeal's ruling that a policy, exercised by many Jewish schools in the United Kingdom, of not accepting students whose mothers are not Jewish is racist.
The decision overturned a ruling by the High Court in London.
The case began when a British couple sued the largest and oldest Jewish high school in Britain - the Jewish Free School (JFS) - over its refusal to accept their son as a student because his mother did not convert in an Orthodox ceremony.
The parents, who have remained anonymous, described as racist and illegal the school's refusal to accept their son because his mother was converted to Judaism in a Conservative ceremony. They say this is racist and illegal because the school receives government funding.
Other couples whose children were refused entry by the JFS have also joined the suit.
Faith schools may discriminate on religious grounds but the court held that the JFS policy involved a test of ethnicity, which is unlawful.
"The motive for the discrimination, whether benign or malign, theological or supremacist, makes it no less and no more unlawful," the three judges - Lords Justice Sedley and Rimer, and Lady Justice Smith - said. "The refusal of JFS to admit [the student] was accordingly, in our judgment, less favourable treatment of him on racial grounds...eligibility must depend on faith, however defined, and not on ethnicity."
"Unless the Court of Appeal decision is overturned on appeal it will have a very serious effect on all Jewish schools and on many of our communal organizations," The BBC quoted Britain's United Synagogue as saying. "In future, all Jewish schools will need to adopt a religious practice test, until such time as the Court of Appeal's ruling is successfully overturned or a legislative amendment is made."
Most of the 1,900 students in the Jewish Free School (JFS), founded in 1732, do not come from Orthodox homes. Nevertheless, the school is identified with the central stream of British Jewry, the United Synagogue, which accepts the authority of the London Beth Din, or rabbinic court. The London rabbinic court is considered stricter on matters of conversion than rabbinic courts in Israel.
It's been several days since the chaotic end to the Copenhagen climate conference but the aftershocks from its failure are still reverberating. As John Prescott points out in his letter to the Guardian, the pointing of fingers in the blame game does not help the regaining of trust needed for the positive resumption of talks early next year and to complete them by December 2010, the new deadline agreed to in Copenhagen.
First, the misinformation put out in the past few days has to be corrected. The UK climate secretary, Ed Miliband, backed by individuals such as Mark Lynas (both writing in the Guardian) have turned on China as the villain that "hijacked" the conference. The main "evidence" they gave was that China vetoed an "agreement" on a 50% reduction in global emissions by 2050 and an 80% reduction by developed countries, in the small meeting of 26 leaders on Copenhagen's final day.
There was indeed a "hijack" in Copenhagen, but it was not by China. The hijack was organised by the host government, Denmark, whose prime minister convened a meeting of 26 leaders in the last two days of the conference, in an attempt to override the painstaking negotiations taking place among 193 countries throughout the two weeks and in fact in the past two to four years.
That exclusive meeting was not mandated by the UN climate convention. Indeed, the developing countries had warned the Danish prime minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, not to come up with his own "Danish text" to be negotiated by a small group that he himself would select, as this would violate the multilateral treaty-based process, and would replace the documents carefully negotiated by all countries with one unilaterally issued by the host country.
Despite this, the Danish government produced just such a document, and it convened exactly the kind of exclusive group that would undermine the UN climate convention's multilateral and democratic process. Under that process, the 193 countries had been collectively working on coming to a conclusion on the many aspects of the climate deal.
Weeks before, it had become clear that Copenhagen could not adopt a full agreement because many basic differences remained. Copenhagen should have been designed as a stepping stone to a future successful outcome accepted by all. Unfortunately, the host country Denmark selected a small number of the 110 top leaders who came, to meet in secret, without the mandate or even knowledge of the convention's membership.
The selected leaders were given a draft Danish document that mainly represented the developed countries' positions, thereby marginalising the developing countries' views tabled at the two-year negotiations.
Meanwhile, most of the thousands of delegates were working for two weeks on producing two reports representing the latest state of play, indicating areas of agreement and those where final decisions still had to be taken.
These reports were finally adopted by the conference. They should have been announced as the real outcome of Copenhagen, together with a decision to resume and complete work next year. It would not have been a resounding success, but it would have been an honest ending that would not have been termed a failure.
Instead, the Copenhagen accord was criticised by the final plenary of members and not adopted. The unwise attempt by the Danish presidency to impose a non-legitimate meeting to override the legitimate multilateral process was the reason why Copenhagen will be considered a disaster.
The accord itself is weak mainly because it does not contain any commitments by the developed countries to cut their emissions in the medium term. Perhaps the reason for this most glaring omission is that the national pledges so far announced amount to only a 11-19% overall reduction by the developed countries by 2020 (compared to 1990), a far cry from the over 40% target demanded by the developing countries and recent science.
To deflect from this great failure on their part, the developed countries tried to inject long-term emission-reduction goals of 50% for the world and 80% for themselves, by 2050 compared to 1990. When this failed to get through the 26-country meeting, some countries, especially the UK, began to blame China for the failure of Copenhagen.
In fact, these targets, especially taken together, have been highly contentious during the two years of discussions, and for good reasons. They would result in a highly inequitable outcome where developed countries get off from their responsibilities and push the burden of adjustment onto the developing countries.
Together, they imply that developing countries would have to cut their emissions overall by about 20% in absolute terms and at least 60% in per capita terms. By 2050, developed countries with high per capita emissions – such as the US – would be allowed to have two to five times higher per capita emission levels than developing countries. The latter would have to severely curb not only their emissions but also their economic growth, especially since there is, up to now, no credible plans let alone commitments for financial and technology transfers to help them shift to a low-emissions development path.
The developed countries have already completed their industrialisation on the basis of cheap carbon-based energy and can afford to take on an 80% goal for 2050, especially since they now have the technological and organisational capacity and infrastructure. For a minimally equitable deal, they should commit to cuts of at least 200-400%, or move into negative emission territory, with net re-absorption of greenhouse gases, to enable developing countries the atmospheric space to develop.
The acceptance of the two targets would also have locked in a most unfair sharing of the remaining global carbon budget as it would have allowed the developed countries to get off free from their historical responsibility and their carbon debt. They would have been allocated the rights to a large amount of "carbon space", historically and in the future, without being given the obligation and responsibility to undertake adequate emission cuts nor to make adequate financial and technology transfers to developing countries.
Fortunately these targets are absent from the accord. The imperative for the negotiations next year is to agree on what science says is necessary for the world to do (in terms of limits to temperature rise or in global emissions cut) but also on what is a just and equitable formula for sharing the costs and burdens of adjustment, and to decide on both simultaneously. By asking for agreement on only a global goal and a very low commitment figure for their own obligatory cut, the developed countries were attempting to fix a global carbon budget distribution that enables them to get away with the hijacking of atmospheric space, a resource worth many trillions of dollars.
Learning from Copenhagen's mistakes, the countries should return to the multilateral track and resume negotiations in the climate convention's two working groups as early as possible.
They can start with the two reports passed at Copenhagen as reference points. There should not be more attempts to hijack this multilateral process, which represents our best hope to achieve final results.
The bottom-up democratic process is slower but also steadier, compared to the top-down attempt to impose a solution by a few powers that will always lack legitimacy in decision-making and success or sustainability in implementation.
The scandal that erupted last year when it was revealed that Sen. John Ensign (R-NV) had not only had an affair with the wife of one of his top aides but may have violated Senate ethics rules in an attempt to hush the matter up expanded this week with the release of emails further documenting Ensign's efforts on behalf of his former aide.
The New York Times reported in October that when Douglas Hampton confronted Ensign about the affair, Ensign arranged for him to take a job as a lobbyist with a Nevada consulting firm, an apparent violation of Senate restrictions on lobbying by former aides. Ensign then steered some of his own corporate donors to Hampton as clients on whose behalf Hampton lobbied his former boss.
The Times has now obtained emails which appear to show Ensign also trying to arrange for Hampton to be hired by a small Las Vegas energy investment firm which was seeking Ensign's help on several projects. The firm's co-owner, Greg Paulk, had previously donated to Ensign's campaign.
“According to the e-mail messages,” the Times writes, “Mr. Ensign met with Mr. Paulk and Bob Andrews, then P2SA's executive vice president, in May 2008 to discuss any help the senator might be able to provide on energy projects. … Mr. Ensign brought up the idea of P2SA's hiring Mr. Hampton, Mr. Andrews recalled. The senator mentioned ‘that he might have somebody we should talk to who might be able to provide us with assistance in our biodiesel program,' Mr. Andrews said, adding: ‘I took this as a helpful hint.'”
That meeting led to discussions between Hampton and Andrews about a possible consulting job. Although those discussions came to nothing, ethics lawyers told the Times that “the case could pose legal problems for Mr. Ensign.”
Ensign's dealings with P2SA raise additional questions beyond the issue of whether he helped Hampton violate the lobbying ban. The Times obtained a follow-up email, suggestive of a quid pro quo, in which Andrews told Ensign, “We are excited about the assistance that you and your staff may be able to give us” and added, “Give me the information regarding next week's fund-raising and we will certainly attend.”
Since last fall, both the Senate Ethics Committee and the FBI have been looking into the Ensign case. According to Politico, “Sources say the Justice Department investigation remains in an information-gathering phase, but it is moving swiftly and could soon turn into a full-fledged inquiry that would put further strain on the embattled senator's political career. To date, no information has been presented to a federal grand jury, but that could soon change.”
“Many political analysts in Nevada and Washington believe that Hampton is out to destroy Ensign's career by periodically leaking damaging news on the senator to the media in order to keep the sex scandal story alive,” Politico explains. “Since he disclosed the affair last summer, Ensign has denied any violations of federal law or Senate ethics rules.”
Ensign's spokesperson told Politico “that Ensign ‘did not take any legislative action at the behest of this company' and that he previously returned campaign donations he received from a P2SA executive.”
“No one is more anxious for this investigation to be completed and for the facts to come out than Senator Ensign,” the spokesperson added. “He not only returned the donation, but also informed the company that his office could not be of assistance in any capacity due to the connection of a fundraiser and legislative requests made by any employee of the company.”

Entrance to Parks Canada sites such as the Icefields Parkway in Jasper National Park will be free to youths 17 and younger starting next year / Scott Johnson
After waiving entrances fees at all of its parks throughout 2017 to celebrate the country's 150th anniversary, Parks Canada announced Thursday that all youths 17 and under will be granted free admission to its national parks, historic sites, and marine conservation areas starting in 2018.
“Millions of Canadians celebrated Canada 150 with free admission to Parks Canada places. Starting in 2018, I am very pleased to announce free admission for youth 17 and under to all national parks, historic sites, and marine conservation areas,” said Catherine McKenna,
Minister of Environment and Climate Change and Minister responsible for Parks Canada. “By encouraging young Canadians to visit these national treasures, we will help inspire the next generation of stewards for Canada's protected places.”
The move comes as the U.S. Department of Interior proposes to implement “surge pricing” during peak season at 17 national parks – including Yellowstone, Yosemite, Acadia, and Shenandoah – that would more than double the entrance fee for a week. The move will hit families whose vacation schedules are dictated by the school calendar the hardest. Comments on the plan are being accepted until December 22. The proposal, touted as a way to combat the estimated $11 billion maintenance backlog across the National Park System, comes on top of higher entrance and user fees expected to go into effect at multiple parks across the U.S. in 2018.
Meanwhile, Parks Canada is aiming to have more children, youths, and school groups experience the outdoors and learn about the country's environment and history.
“There is no better way to celebrate families than by enjoying the outdoors and discovering the countless benefits of nature for our health and wellness. I invite all youth 17 and under to visit our national parks and national historic sites for free in 2018 and beyond,” said Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, Parks Canada's Honourary Guide for Families. “These experiences will create memories that will last a lifetime for Canadian youth and their families, as it has done for our family.”
While youths will enjoy free admission beginning in 2018, Parks Canada is returning to fee-based admission for adults and seniors to national parks, historic sites, and marine conservation areas, including lockage at historic canals. Discovery Pass rates will be the same as 2016 prices: $136.40 for a family pass, $67.60 for adults 17-64, and $57.90 for seniors 65 and older.
For those planning a trip to Canada's parks next year, the agency is offering a 20 percent discount on a Family/Group Discovery Pass purchased before December 31 as a way for Parks Canada to recognize the connections that were made during Canada 150. Otherwise, Discovery Passes will be good for 12 months from the month of purchase.
I am returning to Pakistan on Oct. 18 to bring change to my country. Pakistan's future viability, stability and security lie in empowering its people and building political institutions. My goal is to prove that the fundamental battle for the hearts and minds of a generation can be accomplished only under democracy.
The central issue facing Pakistan is moderation vs. extremism. The resolution of this issue will affect the world, particularly South and Central Asia and all Muslim nations. Extremism can flourish only in an environment where basic governmental social responsibility for the welfare of the people is neglected. Political dictatorship and social hopelessness create the desperation that fuels religious extremism.
Throughout Pakistan's 60-year history, weaving between dictatorship and democracy, from free elections to rigged elections to no elections, religious fundamentalists have never been a significant part of our political consciousness. We are inherently a centrist, moderate nation. Historically, the religious parties have not received more than 11 percent of the vote in national elections. The largest political party is mine, the Pakistan People's Party (PPP). Pakistan's political landscape has been molded primarily by the moderate PPP, which has demonstrated strong and continuous support from the rural masses and the urban elite.
Extremism looms as a threat, but it will be contained as it has been in the past if the moderate middle can be mobilized to stand up to fanaticism. I return to lead that battle.
I have led an unusual life. I have buried a father killed at age 50 and two brothers killed in the prime of their lives. I raised my children as a single mother when my husband was arrested and held for eight years without a conviction -- a hostage to my political career. I made my choice when the mantle of political leadership was thrust upon my shoulders after my father's murder. I did not shrink from responsibility then, and I will not shrink from it now.
I am aware that some in Pakistan have questioned the dialogue I have engaged in with Gen. Pervez Musharraf over the past several months. I held those discussions hoping that Musharraf would resign from the army and restore democracy.
My goal in that dialogue has never been personal but was always to ensure that there be fair and free elections in Pakistan, to save democracy. The fight against extremism requires a national effort that can flow only from legitimate elections. Within our intelligence and military are elements who sympathize with religious extremists. If these elements are not answerable to Parliament and the elected government, the battle against religious militancy, a battle for the survival and future of Pakistan, could be lost. The military must be part of the battle against extremism, but as the six years since Sept. 11, 2001, have shown, the military cannot do it on its own.
Many issues remain unresolved in our political structure. Musharraf is precluded from seeking reelection in or out of uniform. Pakistani law requires a two-year wait before a member of the military can run for the presidency. The general can respond to the people's desire for legitimate presidential, parliamentary and ministerial elections, or he can tamper with the constitution. The latter choice would risk a fresh confrontation with the judiciary, the legal community and the political parties. Such a confrontation could lead to another declaration of martial law, civil unrest, or both.
Civil unrest is what the extremists want. Anarchy and chaos suit them.
The political element in Musharraf's party that presided over the rise of extremism has worked with every Pakistani administration since my government was destabilized in 1996. Its members are blocking the democratic change I have tried to achieve with Musharraf. They fear that democracy will be difficult to manipulate to the benefit of extremists and militants.
My dialogue with Musharraf aims to move the country forward from a dictatorship that has failed to stop the tribal areas from becoming havens for terrorists. The extremists are even spreading their tentacles into Pakistan's cities.
Last week brought a fresh challenge. Just days ago, Pakistan's election commission arbitrarily amended the constitutional provision regarding the eligibility of a person competent to contest for the office of president. As the constitution can be amended only through a two-thirds majority in Parliament, a judicial hornet's nest has been stirred.
My party and I seek fair, free and impartial elections to be held by an independent election commission under an interim government of national consensus. We want a level playing field for all candidates and parties.
In words commonly attributed to Joseph Stalin, "Those who cast the vote decide nothing. Those who count the vote decide everything." That's why we have stressed electoral reforms -- although our efforts have so far been in vain.
President Bush has rightly noted, "The most powerful weapon in the struggle against extremism is not bullets or bombs -- it is the universal appeal of freedom. Freedom is the design of our maker, and the longing of every soul."
When my flight lands in Pakistan next month, I know I will be greeted with joy by the people. I do not know what awaits me, personally or politically, once I leave the airport. I pray for the best and prepare for the worst. But in any case, I am going home to fight for the restoration of Pakistan's place in the community of democratic nations.

For the majority of my life, I believed I was a white woman. I had no reason to question my race or my racial heritage. Why would I? I had only to look in the mirror to know the veracity of my whiteness — or so I thought.
In 1995, while scrolling through the 1900 Louisiana census records looking for my mother's father, Azemar Frederic of New Orleans, I made a startling discovery. Azemar Frederic and his entire family were classified as black. In that split second, everything I knew about myself changed. When I walked into the Illinois family history center, I was a white woman. When I left I didn't know who I was. My sense of identity was shattered.
Why hadn't my mother told me? I wondered. How had she deceived my racist father? Suddenly, certain behaviors fell into place — her avoidance of the sun, her meticulously applied makeup, her never wanting to visit New Orleans and, most telling, the absence of any photographs of my grandfather.

When I questioned my mother about her black heritage, she seemed to shrink into herself. “How will I hold my head up with my friends?” she pleaded. “You can't tell anyone until after I die. Promise me.”
I'd never seen my mother so afraid. Reluctantly, I agreed to keep her secret. This was the longest held secret of my life.
In the silence of those 17 years, I struggled with the shame of her choice, my decision not to reveal her black heritage and confusion over my own racial identity. She'd raised me to respect all people regardless of their race. And yet she would not discuss her black heritage.
Three months after her death, I was presented with an opportunity to solve the uncertainty of my mother's race and racial heritage. PBS' Genealogy Roadshow was looking for family mysteries related to New Orleans. But it would require me to publically “out” my mother on national television. Though free of my vow, I still struggled with the sting of my mother's shame and fear. I decided it was important for my family to know the truth of our racial heritage. This was a story that needed to be told in a public forum.

In 2015, Genealogy Roadshow revealed to 1.5 million people that my mother passed for white. On the 1940 Louisiana census my mother, Alvera Frederic, was listed as Negro, working in a teashop, a typical job for a woman of color.
Four years after that census was taken, my mother moved north to Ohio and married my white father — and began her life as a white woman. None of my father's family ever knew her true racial identity. She was never classified as Neg/Negro on a census record ever again.
Visibly white but legally designated as black, my mother did what the 1924 Virginia state law, the Act to Preserve Racial Integrity, was determined to prevent. In an effort to preserve the “purity” of the white race, this law enshrined the one-drop rule, legally designating anyone with even one drop of African blood as black. A eugenicist at the time expressed the fear emblazoned in the law: “Many thousands of white Negros ... were quietly and persistently passing over the line.” My mother was one of them.
As I delved into the subject of passing, I realized it couldn't have been an easy decision for her. In crossing over to the white side she gained white privilege but lost family and her authentic self.

Three days after the show aired, the family she never knew found me. Suddenly I was part of a multiracial family with no frame of reference. In one fell swoop, I was a woman of mixed race with a “new” family.
Trying to understand my altered racial identity, I took up where Genealogy Roadshow left off, tracing my mother's family back to 18th century colonial Louisiana. I uncovered free people of color, slave owners and enslaved women. The complex history of racial identity was played out in my family, exposing the fluidity of racial designations tied to shifting laws of what constitutes a person of color. I started to rethink what it means to be labeled black or white.
I suspect that our country's mixing of races and the legacy of slavery is writ large in many Americans' DNA whether they know it or not. It's time we saw race for what it is — a social construct meant to shackle minorities who can't pass the “color” test.
My story calls into question our sense of certitude about racial identity in America. If I hadn't found the 1900 Louisiana census record and appeared on Genealogy Roadshow, I would have lived my life blissfully ignorant of my black heritage and of the family my mother left behind in New Orleans. To me, that would have been a tragic loss.

5th November - 11th November 1918
11th November – At 05.10 hours, in a railway carriage outside the French town of Compiégne, German delegates signed the armistice. Under its terms Germany would evacuate immediately from Belgium, France, Luxembourg and Alsace-Lorraine. The German army would surrender 5,000 heavy guns and artillery pieces, 25,000 machine-guns, 3,000 trench mortars and 1,700 aeroplanes. Allied troops would occupy all of Western Germany up to the west bank of the Rhine, and would additionally hold three major bridgeheads over the Rhine at Mainz, Coblenz and Cologne. The Allies would be given 5,000 German railway engines and 150,000 railway wagons, as well as 5,000 lorries, to be delivered “within 36 days”. All of Germany's submarines, and much of her navy was also to be surrendered.
The news of the signing of the armistice was immediately telephoned and telegraphed to all the Allied commanders –
“Hostilities will cease on the entire front November 11th at 11.00am French time”
Throughout the morning of the 11th November, fighting continued. The headquarters of the American First and Second armies received the news of the armistice at 6.30 in the morning – the commanders ordered the fighting to go on until 11.00. A British brigade was ordered to seize a bridge over the river Dendre in France to prevent the retreating Germans destroying it – the orders came through at 9.30, to be completed before 11.00. The final British soldier to be killed in action was Private George Ellison, from Leeds. He had enlisted in 1914 and was killed at 9.30 on the 11th November. He is buried in the cemetery at St Symphorien – where, just feet away but by complete coincidence, Private John Parr, the first British casualty of the war, was buried. They lie close together because the area around Mons was the scene of the first and last actions of the war. At the village of Ville-sur-Haine, just east of Mons, a Canadian soldier, Private George Price, waiting in the trenches with his platoon for the ending of the war, was hit and killed by a German sniper. He died at 2 minutes to 11.00, the last of over 10,000 soldiers of all nationalities killed or wounded after the armistice had been signed, and the last man of the war to die in action.
At eleven o'clock “There came a second of expectant silence, and then a curious rippling sound, which observers far behind the front likened to the noise of a light wind. It was the sound of men cheering”
Crowds that in London, Berlin, Vienna and Paris had cheered the announcement of war in 1914, now celebrated peace. The war was over. It had lasted four years, three months, and one week. Total casualties caused directly by the war are estimated at 37.5 million. Over 7 million combatants had been maimed for life. The celebrations and jubilation faded quickly. As Winston Churchill later recalled–
“Too much blood had been spilt. Too much life-essence had been consumed. The gaps in every home were too wide and empty. The shock of an awakening and the sense of disillusion followed swiftly on the poor rejoicing with which hundreds of millions celebrated the achievement of their heart's desire. There still remained the satisfactions of safety assured, of peace restored, of honour preserved, of the comforts of fruitful industry, of the homecoming of the soldiers; but these were in the background; and with them was mingled the ache for those who would never come home”
Harrison Singleton
Pte. Singleton, James Harrison 63086 2nd Garrison Battalion Northumberland Fusiliers
Harrison was born at the beginning of 1897, at Daisy Hill in Allerton. He was the younger son of Clara and Benjamin Singleton, a stonemason, having an older brother William and two younger sisters, Miriam and Annie. By 1911 the family had moved to 32, Main Street, Wilsden. Benjamin had become a comber in a worsted spinning mill and Harrison had joined him as a spinner. By the time he enlisted into the Northumberland Fusiliers in Keighley in December 1916, he was working in the combing department of Holden's in Bradford.
Initially Harrison's battalion was sent to India, but in 1918, it was posted to Mesopotamia (we now call it Iraq). There were no roads, transport was by boats along the rivers.
“Now virtually forgotten, the British Army also fought in Mesopotamia against the Turks, originally with the intention of defending British oil interests. Another disease-ridden campaign, the Turks finally capitulated. Extremes of temperature (120o F was common); arid desert and regular flooding, flies, mosquitoes and vermin all led to appalling levels of sickness and death through disease. Medical arrangements were quite shocking with wounded men spending up to two weeks on boats before reaching any kind of hospital.”
‘The Long, Long Trail' website
The Turks signed the armistice on 1 November 1918.
Harrison died of broncho-pneumonia just four days later on 5 November 1918, aged 21, and is buried in Basra War Cemetery, Mesopotamia (now Iraq) Grave No. I. S. 12
Harrison's parents were by now living at 16 Chapel Row. His elder brother William also lived at Chapel Row, with wife Annie. They called their son William Harrison Singleton and he was born in July 1917 whilst Harrison was on active service. He grew up in the village, and like his uncle, he too was known by his middle name - Harrison Singleton.
In May 2003, then-US President George W. Bush stood on the deck of an aircraft carrier in front of a banner reading "Mission Accomplished" and announced that major combat operations in Iraq had ended. At the time, few would have imagined that it would take another eight years before the US officially declared the conflict over.
On Thursday, the US military formally marked the end of the Iraq war with a no-frills ceremony in a fortified compound at Baghdad International Airport. The flag used by American forces in Iraq was lowered and symbolically cased to be taken back to the US. The around 4,000 American soldiers who remain in Iraq are due to leave by the end of the year.
"To be sure the cost was high -- in blood and treasure of the United States and also the Iraqi people," Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said at the ceremony. "Those lives have not been lost in vain. They gave birth to an independent, free and sovereign Iraq."
At a speech at Fort Bragg in North Carolina on Wednesday, President Barack Obama welcomed returning American soldiers home and spoke about the end of the conflict. "The war in Iraq will soon belong to history," he said. "Your service belongs to the ages."
Obama admitted that Iraq was "not a perfect place" and that it faced many challenges. "But we're leaving behind a sovereign, stable and self-reliant Iraq, with a representative government that was elected by its people," he said. "Because you sacrificed so much for a people that you had never met, Iraqis have a chance to forge their own destiny. There can be no fuller expression of America's support for self-determination than our leaving Iraq to its people."
Many in America and elsewhere will continue to ask, however, if freeing Iraq from the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein was worth the high cost of the war. The conflict, which began in March 2003 with a "shock and awe" assault on Baghdad, left almost 4,500 Americans and over 100,000 Iraqis dead. Around 30,000 American soldiers were wounded, many of them permanently maimed as a result of the notorious improvised explosive devices (IEDs) which were used against coalition forces.
Today, the country is still racked by religious conflict, and there are fears that sectarian violence could flare up again. The country's political structures are weak and Iran continues to exert influence.
On Friday, German commentators take a look at the end of the Iraq war.
The center-right Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung writes:
"During his election campaign, Obama would probably never in his wildest dreams have imagined that in December 2011, he as president would be praising Iraq as a beacon of democracy that shows the way for the troubled Arab world. Neither would he have imagined that he would see Iraq as a model for the peoples of the region who are seeking the right to democratic participation -- a model that justifies the costs of war and thus the American invasion. Barack Obama used to consider Bush's Iraq policies to be wrong and he rejected the war."
"At the end of this month, the last American soldiers are to leave Iraq They leave behind a country whose institutions are still weak, whose leaders are not exactly shining examples of integrity and which is not immune to the risk of disintegration. It is a country where the infrastructure does not work reliably, where Iran is seeking to expand its influence and which -- last but not least -- has security forces that are lacking in professionalism and which have dubious loyalties. But it is also a country that is no longer in the grip of a despot, whose rule cost hundreds of thousands of people, perhaps even millions, their lives."
The center-left Süddeutsche Zeitung writes:
"Even nearly nine years after the events, it is hard to contain the outrage that boils up when one remembers the fabricated justification for the war and the way the conflict proceeded. On the contrary, the distance to the events makes it even clearer how George W. Bush vacillated in his justification for the war and how he combined weapons of mass destruction, al-Qaida terror and the dictatorship into a single threatening brew. The politically twisted logic behind the invasion was coupled with a botched military strategy that laid the ground for an orgy of violence and hatred."
"At the time, al-Qaida wanted to take advantage of America's strength and make itself seem more important through a murderous crusade which it could stylize as resistance. The breathtaking provocation of 9/11 had the desired effect. Bush fell into the terrorists' trap, satisfying a national need for revenge by extending the war beyond Afghanistan and fighting injustice with injustice. America went to war in Iraq because it could -- because it was angry and incredibly powerful."
"America's current decline is the logical consequence of the over-extension that was visible everywhere in the early 2000s, including its military strength, bloated budgets and promises of growth, its foreign policy ambitions and the verbal radicalism which ultimately promised to forcefully create democracy at gunpoint. With this form of extremism, America betrayed its own best ideals. And in the process the country lost its natural attraction, which historically had repeatedly given hope to freedom-seekers and those fleeing persecution."
The left-leaning Berliner Zeitung writes:
"Every American schoolchild knows today that George W. Bush's mission has not been accomplished. Iraq has not become the democracy that the neo-cons dreamed of, the overthrow of Saddam Hussein did not lead to democratization in the region and the regime in Tehran has not been weakened. On the contrary, Iran has more influence than ever in Iraq."
"And what about the people who were liberated? For them, life eight years after the start of the war is still dangerous. Everyday life, characterized by shortages of water and electricity, abuses of power by the police and the threat of attacks, is unspeakably difficult. There is one fewer dictator in the world, and that's a good thing. And the US has been able to contain the civil war that they unleashed. But the country that American troops are now leaving is not the 'sovereign and stable' nation that Obama spoke of in his speech at Fort Bragg. The US troops may indeed have conquered Baghdad in three weeks, but after eight years of occupation, they have still not won in Iraq."
The left-leaning Die Tageszeitung writes:
"The last nine years of the American presence in Iraq is further proof that the political balance of power within a country can not be changed by an external military intervention. What the US experienced in Iraq, Israel also experienced in the war against Hezbollah in Lebanon. One can only hope that both have learned their lesson before they start planning military operations against Iran."
"If anything, the Iraq war did not accelerate the greatest shift of political forces of all time in the Arab world, but delayed it. With its interference in Iraq, the US did last damage to the concept of democratization. Afterwards, Arab dictators were able to curb the democratic aspirations of their own populations by asking if they really wanted an Iraqi-style democracy. If it hadn't been for the Americans' intervention, the Arab Spring might have broken out years earlier."
Once those attempts proved unsuccessful, they brought Uggla to Spring Training with the hope this year would prove to be much different than the previous two. There were some occasional signs of encouragement as the veteran second baseman hit .237 through his first 16 games of the regular season
ATLANTA -- When the Braves excluded Dan Uggla from their roster for last year's National League Division Series, they left themselves with no other choice but to spend this offseason attempting to trade him to a team willing to take on a portion of his remaining salary.
ATLANTA -- When the Braves excluded Dan Uggla from their roster for last year's National League Division Series, they left themselves with no other choice but to spend this offseason attempting to trade him to a team willing to take on a portion of his remaining salary.
Once those attempts proved unsuccessful, they brought Uggla to Spring Training with the hope this year would prove to be much different than the previous two. There were some occasional signs of encouragement as the veteran second baseman hit .237 through his first 16 games of the regular season
But while batting .114 with a .188 on-base percentage in the 12 games that have followed, Uggla has seemingly exhausted all of the patience Atlanta showed him over the past two years.
After spending time this week evaluating the financial consequences, the Braves have moved away from the thought of releasing Uggla. But this decision does not necessarily provide clear indication of who might serve as their primary second baseman over the remainder of the season.
If the Braves released Uggla, they would still be responsible for the approximate $24 million he is owed through the end of the 2015 season. While the perspective might change over the next few weeks or months, it does not appear the club is comfortable with eating this large sum of money. But Atlanta is every bit as uneasy about the prospect of remaining patient with Uggla, who has batted .185 with a .655 OPS in the 266 games he has played since June 1, 2012.
Even as Uggla hit a career-low .179 and produced a career-high strikeout percentage (31.7) last year, he provided some occasional value with 22 home runs. But through his first 112 plate appearances of this season, he has just five extra-base hits, which includes the two homers hit during an April 14 win in Philadelphia.
When asked what he thinks of his recent struggles, Uggla said, "I don't. I'm on the field to do my job. That's it."
Uggla has been out of the starting lineup for four of the past nine games, and it appears the Braves are planning to continue giving Ramiro Pena and Tyler Pastornicky time at second over the next couple of weeks.
Manager Fredi Gonzalez has not indicated how much he plans to use Uggla as he moves forward. Nor has he provided clear indication of whether he would be willing to platoon Pena, a switch-hitter, with the right-handed-hitting Pastornicky.
"We'll just see how it goes," Gonzalez said.
As they have averaged 1.8 runs per game while losing eight of their past nine, the Braves have discussed all of their options, including promoting No. 7 prospect Tommy La Stella, an offensively-sound second baseman who has the potential to provide a much-needed contact presence to Atlanta's free-swinging lineup.
La Stella has batted .306 with a .372 on-base percentage through his first 31 games this season with Triple-A Gwinnett. But Uggla's presence on the roster complicates the potential promotion of La Stella, who like Uggla, is limited to second base from a defensive perspective.
Carrying both Uggla and La Stella would likely force the Braves to option Pastornicky, who unlike the two aforementioned second basemen, possesses speed and defensive versatility -- a pair of qualities that strengthen Atlanta's bench.
Thus before promoting La Stella, the Braves might spend the next couple of weeks evaluating their second-base situation. Pena, who has hit .283 from the left side since the start of last year, will likely get a majority of the at-bats against right-handed pitchers.
While many fans have clamored for Atlanta to promote La Stella, some of the club's veteran players have said they would rather first see the younger Pastornicky get a chance to prove whether he can be effective while getting regular time at second base.
Pastornicky is the better defensive option, and the statistics (.292 batting average and .354 on-base percentage) he produced in 74 games with Gwinnett last year are similar to the numbers La Stella has compiled to date this season.
"You just try to be ready, because in this game, you just never know what's going to happen," Pastornicky said. "When it's your turn, you want to be prepared and you want to be ready. I'll just continue to work hard and stay ready."
Nearly thirty years ago, Frank Miller introduces us to an older, far more wizened Batman late in his career. But the newest Dark Knight project, Dark Knight Returns: The Last Crusade, will take us back to over ten years before this classic work, when Batman was still actively fighting crime with his previous Robin, Jason Todd, at his side, revealing the previously untold story of how Jason met his end in Frank Miller's Dark Knight universe and featuring the first appearance of Miller's Joker since his death in The Dark Knight Returns.
Co-written by the DARK KNIGHT III duo of Frank Miller and Brian Azzarello, Dark Knight Returns: The Last Crusade will be a 64-page prestige format one-shot drawn by legendary artist John Romita, Jr., who agreed to speak exclusively with us about this exciting new comic.
Take us back to the beginning of this new Dark Knight chapter. How did this come together, and how did you get involved?
I have always said that I wanted to work with Frank Miller again. I'd just begun working on Superman, and DC mentioned to me that there was going to be an opportunity to work on Dark Knight III. A bunch of us went over to Frank's house and we were discussing what had at that point been worked on.
I can't say much, but I can say this book's a prequel to Dark Knight Returns and it's got a lot to do with Jason Todd and what happens to him at the hands of the Joker. All this was only touched on in Dark Knight Returns. We know Jason Todd met his end, but this is going to tell the story of how he met his end and what transpires up to that point.
You've been drawing Superman for us for a little while now. Were you excited about a chance to draw Batman? And how cool is it that this is the project?
Very. The only Batman project I'd worked on prior to this was the Batman/Punisher crossover back in the mid-90s, but of course it didn't get as deep into the character as this is going to. Every comic artist has always wanted to draw Batman. There's something physically and visually amazing about drawing the character. Of course, the character himself is pretty special, but what Frank has done with his version of it—everyone knows his Dark Knight. So this is more exciting than you can imagine. The chance to finally work with Frank again and also to work with Brian Azzarello—I haven't worked with him before—that's damn exciting. I'm just really looking forward to this.
The thought that comes into my mind is really, “Oh god, don't let me screw this up!” I'm getting handed this amazing script from Azzarello based on Brian and Frank's plot, and that's what's coming to mind.
Obviously, you've been drawing comics for many years and have worked with some of the most popular writers in comics. But I have to ask, is there any nervousness about this particular project?
Of course! It's not nervous like standing-on-the-edge-of-a-cliff nervous. It's nervous anticipation. When I play softball, I'm a very good softball player, but I still get out on the field and I still get a little nervous. Until the first ball gets hit to you, you get some nervous anticipation. It's like that. I'm not scared of any of this, but I'm anticipating it. I'm nervously excited.
Do you remember the first time you read The Dark Knight Returns? How important of a book is it to you?
You're going to laugh. The first time I read it was about a month and a half ago. In 1986, when it came out, I looked at the artwork. I love Frank's work. But I never really paid attention to the dialog. With as many comics as I have lying around, I often don't read the dialog. I'm a fan of the artists. I was not looking to read Dark Knight Returns, I wanted to see the artwork and follow it storywise.
Looking and marveling at it back then, I didn't feel the need to read the whole thing through. I knew what was going on. Now here we are all this time later, and I get a chance to read it all the way through and I'm laughing at myself for thinking that Dick Grayson was the Mutant Leader. For some reason I thought that he was, and I felt pretty stupid when it occurred to me that he wasn't! There you are. I should have read it all along.
But again, some of the greatest works in comics history, I've only looked at. When I was a young kid, I would read Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's Fantastic Four and my father's Spider-Man. But as I got older, I started looking at the artists. I was comparing myself and marveling at Frank and Klaus's work. Anything that Frank put out, I was looking at and enjoying the artwork.
So yeah, I read it just under two months ago and I've been enjoying every bit of it again. It's all a revelation to me.
John Romita, Jr.'s retail variant cover for DARK KNIGHT III: THE MASTER RACE #1.
So having just read it, what was your response to it? I mean, other than finding out the truth about the Mutant Leader!
The fascination is how the dialog applies to the storytelling, and vice versa. That's what I was marveling at. How Frank would have thought things through. Also, the buildup to the Superman appearance—that is about as good of storytelling as you get without the dialog. For a full page, you don't see anything of Superman, but the ground is shaking and the wind goes by and people's paperwork goes flying. That's storytelling at its best.
I joke about the fact that I didn't really read the dialog. I did read some of it, just not that intently. Obviously, there are balloons to look at and I looked at some of the dialog, but again, I was really concentrating on Frank's art. Now, looking at it and connecting the two of them, it's nothing that I didn't expect it to be. I worked with Frank on Man Without Fear, and I knew what to expect from him. To see this and enjoy it for what it really was—it's a work of art with words. I don't regret not reading it in 1986, but I enjoyed rereading it that much more now. The excitement of working with him again is palpable.
Is the style of Frank's art in Dark Knight Returns informing your art in The Last Crusade? Are you adopting some of Frank's stylistic traits?
I don't know. I don't know if I'm capable of altering what I can do without fear of messing things up. But I'm going to apply what I can to what is asked of me in the script. If Frank and Brian say they'd like rapid-fire inset panels, there's nothing wrong with that. As long as it flows beautifully, I'm looking forward to it. I'll do what I can to make it my stuff, and if they want me to allude to what Frank did on the Dark Knight series, so be it. We'll find a happy medium.
You're telling the earliest story in the Dark Knight universe to date. That's kind of an interesting area to play around in. How much thought have given to the look and feel of the Dark Knight world at that time?
I actually had to ask our editor about that, and he said that it's going to be up to our interpretation. But I asked for as much reference as humanly possible that I can base it on. For instance, things like Arkham Asylum. How many interior shots are there that I could use? What Frank did in Dark Knight Returns was to use very simplified images of Arkham Asylum. So I asked them to send me The Killing Joke and I'll base it somewhat on that. Even though this will be my interpretation of what Frank and Brian are asking for, I'll still need some reference that I can bounce off of.
But it's exciting because I can take some license with stuff as long as I stay within the parameters that have been established. The feel of what Frank did with Klaus all so long ago is so exciting that I don't want to completely depart from it, and yet I don't want to eliminate what I can add to it. It's going to be really interesting to find that happy medium over the pages we work on. To go back to what I was saying about softball—I can't wait for my first ground ball here. I can't wait for my first hit.
Expanding on that, how much have you thought about how this take on Jason Todd is going to look? Have you started working on some designs for him?
Yes, I have. Since he's still Robin at that point, I told our editor that I'd like to make it slightly distinct or at least different from the Dick Grayson version. But at the same time, it can't be too different. And we also have to keep his look different from Carrie Kelley's. But once we establish the year that it is, maybe his hairstyle will be distinct to what it is at that time. Bruce Wayne can't have all grey, but he has some. He's not an older guy, he's middle aged. But being Batman for all those years, it'll wear on you. You beat the body up. So there are little those considerations that I like to take into effect. With Jason, he'll be in a Robin costume, but it'll be a little different.
Between The Last Crusade, Dark Knight III and the Dark Knight mini-comics, the world of Frank Miller's Dark Knight is really expanding. Is there a part of that universe that you're particularly excited to see?
Not any one in particular. When I first heard they were going to do a third Dark Knight, my first question was whether Frank was going to be involved because he said he didn't want to do it. Of course, time changes everything. I just want to feel Frank's influence on this. The thought of working on Brian's script is equally exciting. The man is amazing. So the two of them—I can't wait.
The mood excites me. When I did Man Without Fear, that's about as close as I came to full-out mood and dramatic mood in the story. So I can see that happening. I'm excited for that—a lot of dark, noirish scene. I'm just a huge fan of film noir. It's something I've always wanted to get back into with my art. So I guess if I had to pick something, that would be it—the cinematic, film noir-like feel of this.

Fast forward to today and Phoenix finds himself in a slightly different career. As time went on, he grew interested in digital photography and video editing.
In 2005, Josh Phoenix, 25, sold cell phones by day and retreated to his home studio by night. This is a situation that many D.I.Y. musicians find themselves in. They have an unsexy job that pays the bills and when they return home, they create music they love.
Like recording, he mastered those fields too.
Now, he's still a musician, but he doesn't sell cell phones. Instead, he utilized his D.I.Y. skills and picked up a career helping realtors market a million dollar homes.
Phoenix runs his own company called HD Estates. He makes compelling video tours of homes and scores them with his original music. Thus far, his efforts are working. Due to his films, someone bought a home that had never even visited.
The goal: to help realtors create marketing materials that set their homes apart from their competitors. Chances are, he still has a nice recording studio that he retreats to at home. He may not be solely working on his music and pursuing a career as a musician, but this uncommon D.I.Y. career has allowed him to use all the skills he learned as a musician, while still being a musican. Check it out:

The M10 tank destroyer was a World War II United States tank destroyer which was based on the chassis of the M4 Sherman tank, it was fitted with the 3-inch (76.2 mm) Gun M7. Formally called the “3-inch Gun Motor Carriage, M10”, it was the most important U.S. tank destroyer of the second world war and it combined a reasonable adequate anti-tank weapon with a turreted platform.
Even tough more-powerful tank destroyers were introduced to replace it, it remained in service until the end of the war. The chassis was later reused with a new turret to create the M36 Jackson, which used a 90mm gun instead of the 76.2mm gun.
The British christened it the Wolverine, but unlike other vehicle names like the M4 Sherman, the American Soldiers did not adopt the name, who simply called it a TD (a nickname for any tank destroyer in general) beyond its formal designation.

FILE - In this Dec. 12, 2016 file photo, National Security Adviser-designate Michael T. Flynn waits for an elevator in the lobby at Trump Tower in New York. The Obama administration is aware of frequent contacts between President-elect Donald Trump's top national security adviser Michael Flynn and Russia's ambassador to the United States, including on the day President Barack Obama hit Moscow with sanctions in retaliation for election-related hacking, a senior U.S. official said Friday, Jan. 13, 2017. (AP Photo/Kathy Willens, File)
WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump's national security adviser and Russia's ambassador to the U.S. have been in frequent contact in recent weeks, including on the day the Obama administration hit Moscow with sanctions in retaliation for election-related hacking, a senior U.S. official said Friday.
After initially denying that Michael Flynn and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak spoke Dec. 29, a Trump official said late Friday that the transition team was aware of one call on the day President Barack Obama imposed sanctions.
It's not unusual for incoming administrations to have discussions with foreign governments before taking office. But repeated contacts just as Obama imposed sanctions would raise questions about whether Trump's team discussed — or even helped shape — Russia's response.
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly did not retaliate against the U.S. for the move, a decision Trump quickly praised.
More broadly, Flynn's contact with the Russian ambassador suggests the incoming administration has already begun to lay the groundwork for its promised closer relationship with Moscow. That effort appears to be moving ahead, even as many in Washington, including Republicans, have expressed outrage over intelligence officials' assessment that Putin launched a hacking operation aimed at meddling in the U.S. election to benefit Trump.
In an interview published Friday evening by The Wall Street Journal, Trump said he might do away with Obama's sanctions if Russia works with the U.S. on battling terrorists and achieving other goals.
“If Russia is really helping us, why would anybody have sanctions?” he asked.
During a news conference Wednesday, Trump highlighted his warmer rapport with the Russian leader.
“If Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability, because we have a horrible relationship with Russia,” he said.
The sanctions targeted the GRU and FSB, leading Russian intelligence agencies that the U.S. said were involved in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and other groups. The U.S. also kicked out 35 Russian diplomats who it said were actually intelligence operatives.
Trump has been willing to insert himself into major foreign policy issues during the transition, at times contradicting the current administration and diplomatic protocol.
He accepted a call from Taiwan's president, ignoring the longstanding “One China” policy that does not recognize the island's sovereignty. Asked about that Friday by the Journal, he responded, “Everything is under negotiation.”
He also publicly urged the U.S. to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements, then slammed the Obama administration for abstaining and allowing the measure to pass.
Questions about Trump's friendly posture toward Russia have deepened since the election, as he has dismissed U.S. intelligence agencies' assertions about Russia's role in the hacking of Democratic groups. In briefing Trump on their findings, intelligence officials also presented the president-elect with unsubstantiated claims that Russia had amassed compromising personal and financial allegations about him, according to a separate U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not allowed to publicly discuss the matter.
The Senate Intelligence Committee announced late Friday that it would investigate possible contacts between Russia and people associated with U.S. political campaigns as part of a broader investigation into Moscow's meddling in the 2016 presidential election.
Trump acknowledged for the first time this week that he accepts that Russia was behind the hacking. But he questioned whether officials were leaking information about their meetings with him, warning that would be a “tremendous blot” on their record.
Flynn's own ties with Russia have worried some Republicans who are more skeptical of the Kremlin than Trump appears to be. After leaving his position as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014, Flynn made appearances on RT, a state-run Russian television network. In 2015, he was paid to attend an RT gala in Moscow, where he sat next to Putin.
As national security adviser, Flynn will work in the West Wing close to the Oval Office and will have frequent access to Trump. Unlike Trump's nominees to lead the Pentagon, State Department and other national security agencies, Flynn's post does not require Senate confirmation.
Flynn's contacts with the Russian ambassador were first reported by Washington Post columnist David Ignatius. The U.S. official who spoke to The Associated Press was not authorized to confirm the contacts publicly and insisted on anonymity.
The Trump team's account of Flynn's contacts with the Russian envoy changed throughout the day Friday.
Trump spokesman Sean Spicer initially said there was one phone call between Flynn and Kislyak on Dec. 28, as well as a Christmas greeting via text messages over the holidays. He said sanctions were not part of the discussions.
Later Friday, a transition official said Flynn and Kislyak had spoken by phone on Dec. 29, following a text message from the ambassador the day before. During the call, the Russian ambassador invited U.S. officials to a conference on Syria later this month that is being held in Kazakhstan, according to the transition official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and insisted on anonymity.
The official also confirmed a phone call between the men earlier in December.
The U.S. official who spoke to the AP Friday described the contacts between Flynn and Kislyak as “very frequent.”
It's unclear how U.S. officials became aware of the contacts between Flynn and Kislyak, who has served as Russia's envoy to the U.S. since 2008. U.S. monitoring of Russian officials' communication within the United States is known to be common.
Flynn has spoken with other foreign officials since Trump won the November election, as have incoming White House senior advisers Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said he saw nothing inappropriate in Trump's transition team contacting Russian or any other foreign officials.

Star Wars: Battlefront is a raucous, chaotic ordeal.
As I sift through my memories of a weekend spent playing the new multiplayer shooter (via EA Access on Xbox One), I recall sheets of crimson laser fire blending with robotic voices barking updates on the match's progress. It's strange to admit that those abrasive moments were the most faithful interactive reproduction of the Star Wars experience I've ever seen.
The lush forests of Endor's moon, the bleak expanse of Tattooine, and blinding white snowdrifts from Hoth are all brought to life with tenacious accuracy. Each of these is a backdrop for bouts between the series' two big factions: the evil, totalitarian Empire, and the plucky, freedom-fighting Rebellion.
As often as Star Wars has been picked apart, repackaged, and sold back to gaming and non-gaming audiences alike, it's a wonder that so many have missed the guiding heart of the franchise. Star Wars is about the messiness of our own emotions, whether it's the overwhelming fear and grief that comes with losing a loved one or the wanderlust that comes from a lifetime of boredom. Unfettered feeling guides everything in the series.
In an era of competitive gaming defined by precision, Battlefront, an otherwise bog-standard multiplayer shooter from Battlefield developer Dice, manages the impossible. Battlefront strives to match through play what it feels like to watch Star Wars: It is loose, unfocused and often anarchic, but in a manner that is directed towards a grander aesthetic vision. One skirmish condenses all of the highs and lows of a film into an easy-to-digest 10-minute chunk.
That frenetic energy comes, at least in part, through Battlefront's sheer scale. After a handful of training missions, you can join with up to 39 others to reenact key battles from the classic trilogy. Once in the fight, you'll see swarms of players incessantly firing blaster rifles, filling the screen with their iconic red laser bolts.
These blasts visually dominate the battlefield, as they did in the films, setting a tone of constant danger from all angles. For a moment, you're on the precipice of a war zone that's never been. It's a surreal feeling, but it's also an expressive one.
Electronic Arts
The scene is even more dramatic in the game's largest mode, Supremacy. With 40 players constantly funneled into one of a few central areas, lawless firefights erupt. Death often comes in seconds, but players are tossed right back into the fight. It keeps games moving at a nimble pace, and doesn't keep unskilled players out of the action for too long.
As these fights unfold, you'll navigate the field, taking over entrenched turrets and gathering power-ups to help turn the tide. Some bonuses will let you call in strikes from huge battleships orbiting the planet, while others let you step into the role of an iconic Star Wars hero or villain.
Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, Leia and Han Solo each brings a unique set of abilities to the fight. You can think of these characters as siege busters. They do far more damage than your standard foot soldier, and they can take quite a few blaster rifle shots before they're down. Combined with their special abilities, any one of them can dash into an area and take out a dozen or more troops.
That might sound a bit extreme, but that extraordinary power is balanced by their finite health: Everyone else on the battlefield can regenerate any damage they've taken by finding cover for a few seconds, but once Darth Vader loses his HP, he's out for good.
In practice this transforms these special characters into tools, means to a larger end. While it's certainly fun to run around with a lightsaber and some extra powers, you don't immediately become the team's leader. You're still one piece of the grand game.
It's a relief to see these aesthetics match up with the reality of an online shooter. More so than recent commercial heavyweights like Halo or Call of Duty, Battlefront's brutal, tumultuous play keeps anyone from ever having too much control over the proceedings. It is unburdened by the exclusionary skill ramps that dominate much of today's competitive gaming scene. Battlefront pushes its players to help one another instead—to band together and bring an order to chaos.
In time, perhaps, that may cap Battlefront's long-term viability. And without a single-player mode, there isn't much incentive here for those who aren't already fans of multiplayer shooters. But for now, it's an encouraging and rewarding break from the norm, and it's made me eager to step back into the Star Wars universe for the first time in years.

Tom Mchale impression of the Remington 6.8 SPC Ammunition round.
USA –-(Ammoland.com)- I love the AR platform. And yes, it is a platform as it's a design model that allows of near infinite customization.
You can add accessories until your rifle looks like a Pakistani Jingle Truck. More importantly, since the rifle is a platform, you can obtain or build one in a dozen or more different calibers.
One of my favorites is Remington 6.8 SPC. Originally developed as a possible replacement for the 5.56mm by some folks from the U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit, United States Special Operations Command and Remington, the 6.8 cartridge is partially compatible with the standard AR platform.
Like 300 AAC Blackout, the 6.8 SPC ammo was developed in response to complaints about stopping power of the 5.56 mm cartridge, especially when used with shorter barrel rifles. It splits the difference (more or less) between 5.56 mm and .308 while still allowing larger capacity due to case size and lighter weight. As a rough example, think of a standard size AR magazine holding 25 rounds of 6.8 SPC instead of 30 rounds of 5.56 mm. Not a bad tradeoff for the extra oomph you get from each cartridge.
The energy of the “standard” 115 grain projectile traveling at 2,640 feet per second is 1,785 foot-pounds – significantly more than the 1,281 foot-pounds of a 55 grain .223 Remington bullet moving at 3,240 feet per second.
While we're comparing energy levels, let's look at some other “similar use” cartridges.
5.56x45mm SS109 62-grain : 3,100 fps, 1,303 foot-pounds
: 3,100 fps, 1,303 foot-pounds .300 AAC Blackout 125-grain : 2,215 fps, 1,361 foot-pounds
: 2,215 fps, 1,361 foot-pounds .308 Winchester, 150-grain : 2,850 fps, 2,704 foot-pounds
: 2,850 fps, 2,704 foot-pounds .30-30 Winchester, 150 grain : 2,300 fps, 1,761 foot-pounds
: 2,300 fps, 1,761 foot-pounds 7.62x39mm (Soviet), 123 grain : 2,435 fps, 1,619 foot-pounds
: 2,435 fps, 1,619 foot-pounds .270 Winchester, 130 grain: 3,160 fps, 2,881 foot-pounds
Cartridge length was limited to be compatible with existing magazines, but specific 6.8 mags have been developed for better reliability and allowance for slightly longer cartridges if desired.
According to The folks at Sierra Bullets, “With the magazine length of the AR at 2.260″, cartridge length was critical. There are now magazines on the market designed specifically for the 6.8 mm SPC to allow them to be loaded out to 2.315.”
The 6.8 Remington SPC is based on a .30 Remington cartridge case, but fires, you guessed it, a 7.035 mm projectile. If you don't recognize 7.035 caliber, that's just the metric measurement of the popular .270 which is actually .277 inches diameter. See, there's that goofy tendency to name cartridges something different from their actual diameter again. Just like a .38 Special being .357 caliber.
In simple terms, think of the 6.8 Remington SPC as a .270 Winchester with a smaller cartridge case and less powder capacity that can be fired in an AR type rifle with correct barrel and bolt.
The interesting thing about 6.8 Remington SPC is the terminal performance down range. With about 200 feet per second more velocity than that famous AK-47 round, it has reach out and touch someone performance out to about 500 yards.
The cartridge case is based on the .30 Remington, which explains the need for a bolt swap when converting a standard AR rifle. Similar to development of 300 Blackouts from .223 Remington cases, the 6.8 takes a shortened .30 Remington case and necks it down for the .277 inch bullet.
The beauty of this caliber is increased diameter and bullet weight over .223 Remington, while maintaining big time velocity from an AR platform with its overall cartridge length limitations.
Cartridge Options
I've done a fair bit of reloading and tinkering with 6.8 Remington SPC with stellar results when the right bullet / powder combination is used. While you'll have to buy 6.8 brass (or make your own from .30 Remington.) .270 projectiles are easy to find even in these times of component shortages.
The 6.8 Remington SPC sweet spot calls for bullets in the 110 grain weight range, although I loaded a variety from 90 grains to 130 grains.
Looking at the spectrum of commonly available commercial rounds, you'll see offerings in the 110 to 115 grain range at velocities of 2,570 to 2,625 feet per second.
Accuracy and velocity samples
Using only one factory rifle, I can't really make a definitive statement about accuracy of the cartridge, but I can say, that with the test rifle I used, it was very easy to develop sub-minute of angle loads.
I've been using a Rock River Arms LAR 6.8 Remington SPC CAR A4 with a few upgrades, but still equipped with the standard RRA two-stage trigger. I mounted a Weaver Tactical 1-5x optic with a CIRT reticle and used that for all accuracy testing. Velocity was clocked with a Shooting Chrony Beta Master placed 15 feet down range. I used a Blackhawk! Sportster Titan III two part rest so I could get good stability without losing the “feel” of shooting the rifle.
At the light end of the bullet weight spectrum, I tried the Sierra 90 grain Varminter hollow point. With the right dose of IMR 4227 powder, I clocked velocity at an average of 2,546 feet per second. With this load I was able to get consistent 3 shot groups of well less than an inch at 100 yards, with the average being about .87 inches. That's pretty impressive from a factory AR rifle.
Moving up to slightly heavier stuff, I then loaded some 110 grain Hornady V-MAX rounds with H322 powder. Average velocity was 2,451 feet per second. In the excitement of the moment, I forgot to record the 100 yard group sizes, but my notes indicate that it was “crazy accurate.”
In my highly scientific terminology, this translates to less than one inch groups at 100 yards.
If you're into accu-plinking, get yourself some 115 grain Sierra MatchKings in .277 diameter. I developed a number of loads using these projectiles with IMR 4895 and H322. Groups with different powder and charge combinations yielded results ranging from the best of .58 inches at 100 yards using H322 to 1.02 inches using an IMR 4895 load. Velocities of the 115 grain projectile loads ranged from 2,165 to 2,249 feet per second.
If you're more into budget plinking, you can order some pulled bullets, readily available in .270 (6.8 SPC) caliber in the 130 grain range. Even using very inexpensive bullets, abused by some sort of violent bullet yanking process, yielded groups in the 1.3 inch range at 100 yards.
Closing thoughts on the Remington 6.8 SPC
At first I wasn't sure exactly what got me so fired about the 6.8 Remington SPC cartridge. After some use, and some deep thought, I think it boils down to three things.
I like the power level compared to .223 Remington or 5.56 mm. Whatever your preference for home defense, .223 / 5.56 has limitations if you want to hunt. Whether you buy or reload your own, 6.8 Remington SPC opens up a whole new world of hunting possibilities. Deer, hogs, or containers of Tannerite – whatever floats your boat.
Next, you can suppress it with a commonly available .308 silencer. I just mounted a SilencerCo Specwar 762 on the Rock River Arms rifle mentioned in this article and it works like a champ. I ordered a second muzzle brake so I can instantly move my Specwar 762 from a 300 Blackout rifle to the 6.8 Remington SPC. Obviously 6.8 SPC is only a supersonic round, but the suppressor really makes a difference at the firing line.
The last reason this round got my attention became apparent during the “I can't find bullets” scare of 2013. .270 is a common hunting caliber, and generally ignored by the tactical crowd. While suitable 5.56 mm and 300 Blackout projectiles were in scarce supply, I never had a problem getting as many .270 / 6.8 SPC bullets as I wanted.
Neat stuff. It's a fun, accurate and low-recoil cartridge with a whole lot of flexibility.

For Min Kim, the sound of the song Fur Elise means someone is coming through the doors of his convenience store in Spanaway.
And even today that song makes him a little nervous.
"I am scared. I'm scared of everybody who is walking actually right now. Whoever just walks by I am frightened,” he said.
Last month at his store someone shot his wife in the stomach in an attempted robbery, and just over the weekend, a different young man came in to shoplift.
"As soon as I see him I pulled out my gun out and he stopped everything and he raised both hands. As soon as I see he is no threat I put my pistol back,” he said.
But the incident wasn't over.
Pierce County Sheriff's Deputies say what happened next should not have happened at all.
"Our store clerk would've been just fine if he would've let him go and called 911,” said Pierce County Sheriff's spokesman Ed Troyer.
But he didn't.
"I grabbed him by his jacket. Do not leave here so I can have some moments to call the cops and everything,” said Min Kim.

"As the suspect was leaving the store, the store clerk pulled a weapon out and shot him twice and those rounds were responsible for killing him,” said Troyer.
The incident was captured on store surveillance, which is not being released.
"It shows that I killed a man and that's something that I don't want to see again and again,” said Kim.
While Kim claims he shot the young man in self defense, police say Kim's response doesn't fit the crime of shoplifting.
"We understand that what was taken was pepperoni and cigarettes, nothing that definitely equals pulling out a gun and firing rounds or worth a life,” said Troyer.
Shortly after the interview with KING 5, Min Kim was arrested and was booked on second degree murder charges.
"This is a tough one because we can understand why the store clerk was on guard. His wife has just been shot there a month before during a robbery attempt and the whole family was upset about it. But that doesn't give you the license and the right to arm yourself and shoot people who may be involved in shoplifting,” said Troyer.

Unsung Heroes: The Night Witches
Russia, 1942. Not a good place to be.
A year into the war with Germany, the German 6th Army surrounding Stalingrad, millions dead and countless more dying of starvation and disease. Supplies and equipment were running low and the need for people to throw into combat was soaring. These were the conditions that gave rise to some of the most daring and impressive pilots ever, the 588th Night Bomber Regiment, nicknamed the Night Witches by the German forces. The name alone pretty much conveys how ridiculously amazing these women were, but let's go into a bit more detail.
Formed in October of 1941, the Night Witches were an all female bomber regiment tasked with precision bombing runs against German military targets. The formation of the group took some time, as the move to recruit female combat pilots had initially been rejected, with one recruiting officer quoted as saying “Things may be bad but we're not so desperate that we're going to put little girls like you up in the skies. Go home and help your mother.” This in spite of the fact that many young Russian women had more piloting experience than the pilots of the front line fighter regiments thanks to the Osoaviakhim, a paramilitary flying club that provided free training to Soviet boys and girls in the 1920s and 30s.
Soviet military officials then, as US military officials now, questioned whether it was strategically or morally appropriate to send women into combat. But the Night Witches proved to themselves and a skeptical country that their gender made no difference in the defense of one's home. – Phyllis-Anne Duncan
The heavy casualties of the war brought about a quick change to this attitude, and three regiments were formed, commanded by the famous aviatrix Major Marina Raskova (left). The selection process for the 588th (and its companion squads, the 586th Fighters and the 587th Dive Bombers) was gruelling, the young women going through two years' worth of training in just six months. Up to fourteen hours a day were spent in the air, including night flights and simulated dogfights. By June 1942, they were ready to fight against the formidable might of the German invasion.
The Night Witches were not a well equipped regiment. Wearing hand-me-down uniforms from male pilots (boots were reportedly stuffed with paper and fabric to make them fit), they flew in aging Polikarpov PO-2 biplanes. The PO-2s were about as basic as a plane could get and still technically qualify as a plane. First built in 1928, they consisted of fabric strung over a wooden frame, and lacked any but the most rudimentary of instrumentation. There was no radio to communicate with ground control, and navigation was done with a stopwatch and a map – just a normal map, not even a flight chart. The planes carried no guns and only had enough weight allowance to take two bombs up on a flight, forcing the Night Witches to make multiple sorties in a single night, returning to base each time to collect more bombs.
The one thing the PO-2 had going for it, and which the Night Witches used to full effect, was its remarkable maneuverability. With a top speed of around 95mph, the plane was slower than the slowest speed a German fighter could maintain (its stall speed), allowing them to pull tight, evasive circles that the faster German craft couldn't match. Combine this with the impressive nap-of-the-earth piloting skills that allowed the Night Witches to get closer to the ground than the planes of the Luftwaffe could manage, and shooting down a PO-2 from the air became a challenging prospect. There was, supposedly, a promise to award an Iron Cross to any Luftwaffe pilot who actually managed to bring down a Night Witch.
Whilst the German fighters struggled to bring down the Night Witches (who included Evgeniya Rudneva, left), the ground defences proved rather more formidable. 6th Army encampments were protected by what was known as the ‘circus of flak' – concentric rings of up to two dozen flak cannons and searchlights. The traditional tactic for dealing with this had been to fly directly towards the target and hope to get your bombs away before the flak could blast you out of the air. It wasn't the most successful tactic. The Night Witches developed a far more effective method for getting past the circus of flak: flying in groups of three, two planes would approach the target and wait for the searchlights to pick them up. These two would then split apart and manoeuvre around the target, drawing the attention of the cannons. The third plane, having waited behind, would cut their engines and glide in to deliver the bombs. This was repeated until each of the three planes had made a bombing run. The mind boggles at the sheer level of stone-cold bravery needed to repeatedly offer yourself as a distraction to dozens of flak cannons, protected only by a flimsy frame of wood and fabric, and to keep doing that night after night.
At its largest the Night Witches' regiment consisted of 80 flying crew, plus ground support. By the end of the war they had collectively flown over 23,000 bombing runs. The surviving pilots had all flown around 1,000 missions each by 1945 (for sake of comparison, Colonel Don Blakelee, who had more missions for the USAF than anyone else in WW2, completed 500). Thirty of them had died in combat, and over a quarter of the pilots had been awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.
Examples of extreme courage were almost the rule for them. – Valerie Moolman, Women Aloft

The Saab 900 is the company's most recognisable line of cars. Produced between 1978 and 1998, the Saab 900 was sold in many variations over the course of its lifespan. The cars can be grouped broadly into two generations, simply called classic and new. Each generation differs in body style, number of doors, engine, and performance capability.
It is important for buyers to learn some methods for choosing the best used Saab 900, as the newest model was produced in 1998. In addition to obtaining a vehicle history report, there are several factors specific to the Saab 900 that buyers should consider. These include the gearbox, convertible top, turbo, and body rust.
Saab 900s can be purchased from dealers and private sellers. Check classified advertisements and online sites like eBay to find used cars. With a bit of patience, buyers can find a Saab 900 in excellent condition that can provide many years of driving.
Types of Saab 900
With a line that stretched across two decades, the Saab 900 underwent a number of changes. The first step in choosing a car is deciding on which year to buy. Learn more about the classic and new generations of the Saab 900 to look for cars with the most desirable features.
Classic Generation Saab 900
The classic generation of the Saab 900 was produced in 1978. There were several models available initially, including the GL, GLS, and GLE.
1978 to 1980
The GLS added twin carburettors to the basic design of the GL for more horsepower, while the GLE also incorporated a fuel-injected engine for the most power of the three. A Turbo model was released shortly after, which had significantly more horsepower than even the GLE. All of these models were produced in three and five-door hatchback styles.
1981 to 1985
1981 saw the introduction of a four-door saloon. In 1982, the Saab 900 turbo-charged model was equipped with Saab's Automatic Performance Control, which improved overall performance and provided a greater degree of control over the boost pressure. A new model of the Saab 900 was released in 1984 called the Turbo 16 Aero, which contained a 16 valve DOHC B202 engine that gave it more power than its predecessors.
1986 and 1991
One of the most notable additions to the original Saab 900 series came in 1986 with production of a convertible model. These cars were designed on the three-door hatchback version of the basic Saab 900 and had a 16 valve turbocharged engine. In1991,, the convertible models were given a fuel-injected 2.1 litre engine.
1987 to 1993
1987 saw the addition of new headlights and a front grille to all Saab 900 models, as well as redesigned bumpers. All 8 valve turbo engines were replaced by 16 valves in the late 1980s, and anti-lock brakes became standard in 1990.. From 1991 onwards, the classic generation Saab 900 had redesigned seats that had previously been sold on the company's 9000 model. The classic generation ended in 1993.
New Generation Saab 900
The new Saab 900 generation,, sometimes called the GM900 or NG900, featured a redesigned body and several other improvements. The new generation started immediately in 1994,, after the end of production of original models. The basic NG900 was produced with a choice of three 16 valve engine types. These included 2.0, 2.3, and 2.5 litre designs.
There were three variants of the basic NG900, including a 900 S, 900i, and 900 SE. The first two have standard four-cylinder engines, while the 900 SE had a turbocharged four-cylinder engine. Convertible tops remained an option for models in the new generation.
Used Saab 900
Due to the age of Saab 900s, buyers should be familiar with some of the common problems that exist for the cars. It is also important to obtain a vehicle history report on any car before buying. Buyers may also choose to take the car to a mechanic for a buyer's inspection.
Inspect the Parts
Some parts and components of Saab 900s are likely to wear out more quickly than others. In many cases, the lifespan of a part can be predicted based on repairs to similar models. Try checking the mileage on the car to determine the likelihood of repairs. The following table offers information on key parts of a Saab 900 and their likelihood to wear out.
Saab 900 Part Description Gearbox One of the most common problems on Saab 900s Automatic transmission with turbo engines tends to fail early Repairs can be expected between 150,000 and 200,000 miles Beware of whining noises while in certain gears or a failure to engage Turbo Most last around 120,000 miles Water cooled turbos typically last longer than oil cooled versions Head gasket Check for signs of water or oil leaks from the cylinder head Replacements can require many hours of work and are therefore costly Body Saab 900s tend to develop rust in predictable areas Check wheel arches, the petrol gas cap, and the bottom inside of doors Convertible roof Examine the cover material for tears and worn areas Roof should extend and retract smoothly Unusual noises during movement indicate a need for expensive repairs
Although many expensive problems can be identified by any buyer, it is best to have a professional mechanic perform a full check of the Saab 900.
Perform a Buyer's Inspection
An important step when purchasing a used Saab 900 is to take the car to a mechanic for a buyer's inspection. An honest seller should allow buyers to take the car to any mechanic in the area for an independent check. Most mechanics charge a fee for this.
Find the True Market Value
The true market value of a Saab 900 indicates the highest price that buyers should pay for a model. This figure is determined by recent sales of similar cars, so it is always current with the market. The true market value for a Saab 900 can be obtained through online resources.
Obtain a Vehicle History Report
Before considering the purchase of any used car, it is important to obtain a vehicle history report. This includes details about the car, including the number of owners it has had, its mileage, and any damage to the car from accidents. The following table lists some of the most useful pieces of information that can be obtained through a vehicle history report.
Report Detail Description Odometer Shows the recorded mileage across the car's history Can reveal odometer rollback Rental Indicates that the car was used as a rental vehicle Number of titles Reflects the number of owners the car has had Salvage Indicates if the car has been given a salvage title or placed in a salvage yard Accident Lists reported accidents and any damage to the car Total loss Shows if the car has been written off as a total loss by the insurance company
A vehicle history report can sometimes be used to negotiate a price for a Saab 900. If problems are revealed on the report that the seller has not listed, it may be possible to ask for a lower price.
How to Buy a Saab 900 on eBay
A number of Saab 900s from the model's production history can be purchased from sellers on eBay.. To find these cars, begin a keyword search from the home page. For example, enter “1995 Saab 900&” to see all listings on the site tagged with those terms. You may refine listings by adding other terms, such as a transmission type.
Review Item Listings
Review item listings closely before committing to a purchase. Most sellers provide a detailed description of the Saab 900 along with photos from multiple angles. A specification sheet may also be included in the listing. Look for this to gain information about the technical aspects of the model being sold.
Seller Feedback
Sellers on eBay have a feedback rating that can be used to determine their reliability on the site. Consider this information along with the number of completed transactions to find the best sellers. Leave your own feedback at the end of the transaction to inform future buyers about your experience.
Conclusion
The Saab 900 was one of the company's most popular cars and remains sought after by many buyers. Produced between 1978 and 1998, the Saab 900 underwent several changes to its design during its lifetime. The cars can be broadly separated into two generations. The first lasted until 1993 and the second until production ceased in 1998. Consider the many types of Saab 900s available, including convertibles, to find the most suitable car for a buyer's needs.
Due to the age of Saab 900s, buyers should familiarise themselves with some of the parts that are likely to need repairs. Gearboxes are one of the most notorious parts to wear out, especially on turbocharged models with an automatic transmission. Check for any unusual sounds while changing gear or difficulties engaging certain gears. If the car has a convertible top, ensure that it can be raised and lowered smoothly.
Compare eBay sellers to find Saab 900s in the best condition and at the best price. Patient buyers can find a good quality Saab 900 that can be driven for many years to come.

Mohamed Salad says he doesn't remember why he shot into the crowded Ten X nightclub, injuring one of the patrons, because he was drunk and high on ecstasy at the time.
Salad, 30, pleaded guilty to two charges of recklessly discharging a firearm on Monday, just two weeks before the trial was set to begin.
Mohamed Elmi, who faced the same charges as Salad in connection with the shooting, will be released from custody after his charges were stayed by prosecutor Carla MacPhail.
"He's relieved," said defence lawyer Tonii Roulston. "It's unfortunate that this decision wasn't made earlier; however, often times these decisions are made on the eve of trial.
"It is unfortunate that Mr. Elmi spent over nine months in custody awaiting his trial date."
Roulston's position all along has been that Elmi had no knowledge that his friend planned to shoot into the club that night.
Elmi and Salad were charged after the Jan. 10 shooting on 10th Avenue S.W. that sent Kenneth Duru, 38, to hospital with a gunshot wound to his torso.
Victim suffered 'permanent injury'
Elmi, Salad and several other friends had been partying at the club when they left around 1:30 a.m. But just minutes later they pulled up in a white Ford Fusion and Salad got out, walked to the doors of the club where there were about 300 people inside and opened fire — shooting three times before a bouncer tackled him.
"The scene both in and outside of Ten X was chaotic as numerous police entered with weapons including loaded handguns and long guns in order to look for victims or more shooters," according to an agreed statement of facts.

On the dance floor, officers found Duru who was being helped by a student nurse, and another patron who had been grazed by a bullet. A third bullet travelled between two women who had been standing facing each other.
Duru was shot in the stomach damaging his liver, gallbladder and colon as well as breaking a rib. He lost a kidney as a result and had to undergo two surgeries.
"He suffered significant pain and discomfort, as well as permanent injury," according to the facts.
'The struggle was quick and physical'
As Salad was shooting into the club, bouncer Ziad Chehede reacted "almost immediately" grabbing for the gun and pushing Salad out of the doorway and onto the Ford. During that struggle, the gun went off again, piercing through Chehede's jacket and shattering the key fob inside his pocket.
"The struggle was quick and physical," according to an agreed statement of facts read aloud in court on Monday.
Members of Calgary police's guns and gangs unit — who happened to be nearby — were quickly on scene and arrested the driver of the vehicle.
The handgun used was a semi-automatic pistol with its serial number scratched off and is considered to be a restricted firearm.
MacPhail and defence lawyer Hersh Wolch will ask Provincial Court Judge Bob Wilkins to impose a seven-year prison sentence at a hearing set for Oct. 20.
Nine other charges, including two of attempted murder, will be withdrawn at the sentencing hearing.
We have to show “respect” for mass murderers, you see — if they're Muslims.
“Harris-Perry: New York Times Wrong to Show Malik in Hijab Because It Suggests ‘This is What Terrorism Looks Like,'” by David Rutz, Washington Free Beacon, December 7, 2015:
The New York Times, despite a front-page editorial advocating for gun control, still failed to live up to the left-wing sensibilities of MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry Saturday because it had a picture of San Bernardino shooter and devout Muslim Tafsheen Malik wearing her hijab. Now, Harris-Perry complained in the clip first flagged by NewsBusters, the newspaper was problematic for suggesting “this is what terrorism looks like.” Malik pledged allegiance to the Islamic State terrorist organization the same day she and husband Syed Farook killed 14 people. The New York Timesreported Malik was “visibly devout” with her use of the hijab and face-covering niqab. It is unclear how any other picture of Malik could have been circulated. As NewsBusters suggested, was the newspaper expected to photoshop the hijab off her? Arab-American activist Linda Sarsour claimed Saturday on Harris-Perry's eponymous show that the media's rhetoric about the massacre shifted when it turned out the perpetrators were Islamic. “All of a sudden we find out they're Muslim. Bam, gun violence is out of the question,” she said. “We start talking about terrorism. And I'm extremely disturbed. I mean, I looked at the New York Times cover today. There, you have a whole op-ed on gun control. Great. Right next to it is pictures from the apartment of things that I have in my house.” “Yes!” Harris-Perry said. “These are things that all Muslims have in their house,” Sarsour said. “There's nothing about that that tells you a story about what terrorism looks like. So you're telling me that when my friends who are not Muslim come into my home and see a Koran on see frames on the wall with a scripture from my religion, is that supposed to tell you something?…”
Uh, yeah.
“Photo of San Bernardino shooter without burqa causes controversy,” by Susana Guerrero, SFGate.com, December 6, 2015:
Al-Jazeera producer Hashem Said is being criticized after tweeting that ABC News should have respected San Bernardino shooter Tashfeen Malik by not sharing photos of her without a burqa, the Gateway Pundit writes. One individual responded to Said's comment by posting a picture of Malik after she was shot and killed by law enforcers. Malik is shown lying on her back on pavement as one arm covers her face. The individual who posted the photo wrote “Here is a picture of her without her face.” Said has since retracted the tweet and apologized for his remark on Twitter. He also issued several tweets clarifying that he didn't mean to offend anyone by his comment, and he explained that what he meant to say is that the image ABC used could be offensive to Malik's family. ABC News was the first to reveal an image of Malik. Malik typically donned a burka but the image they used reveals her face….

When Joni Mitchell was admitted to the hospital this week after being found unconscious in her Los Angeles home, a controversial affliction she has long suffered with hit the headlines again.
The 71-year-old singer-songwriter has often complained of her battle with Morgellons, a medical mystery that has stumped the scientific community for years.
"I couldn't wear clothing. I couldn't leave my house for several years," she described in her 2014 book Joni Mitchell: In Her Own Words. "Sometimes it got so I'd have to crawl across the floor. My legs would cramp up, just like a polio spasm. It hit all of the places where I had polio." (It's unclear if Morgellons was related to her recent hospitalization, but she has certainly brought attention to the issue over the years.)
Morgellons involves unexplained itching sensations
Sufferers of Morgellons report itching, biting, and crawling sensations. "Fibers in a variety of colors protrude out of my skin," Mitchell has said. "They cannot be forensically identified as animal, vegetable or mineral."
They say their skin feels like it's erupting from underneath, infested by insects, worms, or mysterious fibers. Like Mitchell, they say their symptoms are debilitating: they point to lesions that won't heal, and say the biting and stinging that afflicts them every day leaves them fatigued and depressed, even affecting their memory.
"[it's] as if you're being bitten by fleas and lice" Mitchell wrote in her book: "Morgellons is constantly morphing. There are times when it's directly attacking the nervous system, as if you're being bitten by fleas and lice. It's all in the tissue and it's not a hallucination. It was eating me alive, sucking the juices out. I've been sick all my life."
The condition was first described in the 1600s, and then named in 2001 by an American, Mary Leitao, whose son's itching couldn't be remedied or explained by modern medicine. Leitao eventually scraped his skin and examined the samples under a microscope. She found fiber-like strands, which she determined "cannot be coming out of my son's body," she told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
After getting frustrated by her doctors' dismissive tones, she launched the Morgellons Research Foundation and began pressuring Congress to figure out what was going on. The movement gained traction in the United States in 2005, when lawmakers requested that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention investigate.
Researchers say Morgellons is a "mass-shared delusion"
For the past decade, researchers have searched for a biological cause or single underlying factor that might explain the suffering. But they have mostly concluded that Morgellons is "a psychosis or mass-shared delusion."
In one of the most comprehensive studies to date, published in the journal PLOS, researchers from the CDC collected detailed epidemiological information, medical histories, and skin samples from 115 Morgellons sufferers in Northern California.
"No parasites or mycobacteria were detected," they reported. The researchers also couldn't find any environmental explanation for patients' suffering.
The fiber-like strands on sufferers were mostly just cotton debris, probably lint from clothing. Their skin damage seemed to be caused by nothing more than sun exposure. While some patients had sores, these appeared to have arisen from chronic picking and scratching.
Interestingly, a large number of people in the study had a psychiatric or addictive condition, including depression and drug use. Among half of the participants in the study used drugs, but it wasn't clear whether the drugs caused the symptoms or whether they were being used to deal with the disease.
Even so, the researchers could not uncover any particular underlying medical condition or infectious source, and concluded that Morgellons is "similar to more commonly recognized conditions such as delusional infestation."
That last conclusion is echoed by other research on Morgellons patients. One study, out of the Mayo Clinic, concluded this way: "Although patients are convinced that their skin is infested with parasites or inanimate material," skin biopsies and specimen analyses turned up no evidence of infestation. The patients were probably suffering from delusional parasitosis — or the false belief that one is infected with parasites — the researchers determined.
Some more recent research suggests Morgellons may belong in the same family as tick-borne illnesses like Lyme disease — but this is a relatively new theory and the link hasn't been confirmed by multiple studies.
Still, many patients insist Morgellons is very real
For now, delusional parasitosis is the most common diagnosis for Morgellons sufferers, with many skeptics arguing that this is just "a cultural entity spreading mainly on the internet." (There are a few medical experts who think Morgellons is a real disease, but they are in the minority.)
Doctors, for their part, seem exasperated by the phenomenon. As Jeffrey Meffert, a dermatologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, told Newsweek, "People with delusional parasitosis are very functional and rational except when it comes to this one issue." He continued: "Many dermatologists would rather these patients never show up, because they don't feel they have the time to spend. No one knows how to deal with them."
The exposure that's created by celebrities can help shape the research agenda
Still, the issue hasn't gone away. For people like Mitchell, the lack of empirical evidence doesn't diminish their suffering. They feel dismissed by most doctors and let down by modern medicine. And even though many experts feel that further research is a waste of time and money, calls to pursue the issue are unlikely to disappear.
Indeed, the online discussion — fueled by celebrities like Mitchell — "gives the condition a name, gives it a shape, and gives the sufferers a community with which to interact and legitimize the condition" said Tim Caulfield, a researcher and author of Is Gwyneth Paltrow Wrong About Everything? When Celebrity Culture and Science Clash.
That community creates advocacy, and winds up driving the research agenda, whether or not it's scientifically warranted. "The exposure that's created by celebrities," Caulfield continued, "can help shape the research agenda, and researchers are very savvy. As things gain exposure in popular culture, it creates an interest in the area, and perhaps increases the chance for research funding. The Joni phenomenon is part of this."
WATCH: 'The dysfunction of the American health care system'
BALTIMORE (AP) — The Episcopal Church of Maryland says its first female bishop was the driver in a hit-and-runcrash that killed a bicyclist in Baltimore.
Diocese spokeswoman Sharon Tillman confirmed Monday that Bishop Suffragan Heather Cook was the driver in the Saturday afternoon crash in which 41-year-old Tom Palermo was killed.
On Monday, a small makeshift memorial sat by the roadside where Palermo was killed. The road included a designated bike lane.
Neither Cook nor her attorney, David Irwin, responded to emails and calls for comment Monday.
In an email Sunday, diocese Bishop Eugene Sutton told clergy members that Cook initially left the scene but returned about 20 minutes later “to take responsibility for her actions.”
He says Cook is on administrative leave from the diocese's No. 2 spot.
It's unclear whether she'll face charges.

Britain must clamp down on sharia councils and begin processing Islamic divorces in court to better protect the rights of Muslim women, a scholar has advised MPs.
Elham Manea, a leading researcher on Britain's sharia councils and a professor at Zurich University, has argued for stricter regulations governing sharia councils in written recommendations to a Home Affairs Select Committee inquiry, the Guardian reports.

Manea believes sharia councils or ‘courts' are discriminatory against Muslim women. While men can opt out of a marriage by proclaiming ‘talaq' (Arabic for ‘I divorce you') three times, women must appeal to a sharia council in the hopes that the scholars will grant them a divorce.
The rulings have no legal power and are not recognized in the UK legal system. Many Islamic marriages issued by the sharia councils have not been formally registered under British law.
“It's true women will be stuck if you don't provide a solution but that solution is not a parallel legal system,” Manea told the paper.
Manea is calling for the nationwide registration of all Islamic marriages.
“Interpretation in many Islamic countries including Tunisia and Morocco means a religious divorce automatically follows a civil one. It should be the same in Britain and a bureau within the courts should provide this service,” she said.
Fears that 'under-the-radar' Sharia courts law unto themselves at odds with law of the land https://t.co/LXwRmazsc3pic.twitter.com/pEwtcEADlv — RT UK (@RTUKnews) January 9, 2016
Nus Ghani, the Tory MP for Wealden who secured the parliamentary review into sharia councils last December, said: “Under sharia, men are in charge and women are treated as their property. That does not sit well under British law and cannot go unchallenged.
“We can't have a system where we are championing equality for women on one hand and on the other overlooking a whole section of society – vulnerable women who happen to be Muslim.
“It may be we have a nationwide survey to make sure everyone who has an Islamic marriage is told to register under civil law so if they need a civil divorce they will also get the talaq.”

I'll be on Rachel Maddow tonight at 9pm ET to talk about our whip count and fundraising effort — jh
We went out to the FDL list this morning and together with our partners have raised $67,939 for progressive members of Congress who agree to draw a line in the sand over a public plan.
While the teabaggers got all the media attention, we've been working diligently with local bloggers in the districts of progressive members of Congress who were in safe Democratic seats, asking them to vote against any bill that did not have a strong public plan. No co-ops, no triggers. We wanted 40 of them to stick together and block health care reform from passing until there was a strong public option.
It worked.
If others arrogantly assumed they could give the farm away to the AMA, AHIP, the hospitals and PhRMA and then jam it on progressives at the last minute and call them "fucking stupid" if they resisted, they were wrong.
Now that they have made the commitment in sufficient numbers to stop a bad bill from passing, the challenge is going to be holding progressives while they get strong-armed to vote for a compromised bill. Promises of district pork, funding for pet project, influence and downright threats are very persuasive. A fundraising effort like this sends a very clear message that this one matters. We're watching, and if somewone says they "support" a public plan, they can't cast a vote for some crappy Blue Dog/Senate Finance bill and think nobody will notice.
This one won't go down the memory hole. Thanks to everyone who put an exclamation point at the end of that sentiment with their contribution.
Mercury retrograde in Libra (September 17th – October 9 2015)
Mercury goes retrograde September 17th, 2015 and, until October 9, it will be difficult for all of us to think clear, to remain open-minded and not to yell, when someone irritates us. And, with Mercury traveling backward through the zodiac, you can be sure that a lot of people will drive you nuts. So, how to deal with them? And another challenge: what to do to not become yourself one of these annoying people?
Mercury Retrograde in Libra: Hard times for artists, writers, lawyers and public speakers
Mercury is retrograde in Libra, an artistic sign, ruled by Venus, planet of love and beauty. So, these Venus-ruled professions are the ones that will feel the full impact of Mercury retrograde. Everyone who has a creative job will feel a lack of inspiration. Writing an article or a book, composing a song or painting a picture will require a lot of time and the artists will feel, more than once, like banging their head against a brick wall.
Libra is also a sign of justice and those who serve it – lawyers, prosecutors or judges – will also get through challenging times, in their profession.
Mercury retrograde for you
Of course, Mercury is retrograde for everybody and writers or judges are not the only ones who have to manage a scattered brain and to avoid quarrels.
So, we'll show, for each sign, the areas of life where is better not to risk, but to remain calm and to avoid, if possible, any crucial decision.
If you are Libra, Mercury retrograde in your own sign makes you look like a hasty and irritable temper. You're always in a hurry, with or without reason. Take care of your health, continuous stress is dangerous anyone!
If you are Scorpio, Mercury retrograde brings loneliness. It's almost impossible to make friends in this period. Actually, it's difficult even to keep old friends close. So, be very careful what you say and what you do and avoid ruining relationships and friendships!
If you are Sagittarius, collective projects and group activities are not working properly. Also, this is not the best time to think about the future and to develop long-term plans.
If you are Capricorn, you will find yourself in some awkward situations, in public! Also, you must remember that September 17th – October 9 is not the best time to get a raise or a promotion at work.
If you are Aquarius, stay home! The travels, especially those to remote places, can bring all sorts of trouble. Bad news, also, for Sagittarius students: try to postpone events after October 9, because Mercury retrograde will affect your intellectual abilities.
If you are Pisces, wait no inheritance or expensive gifts from September 17th to October 9! It is better to retain from spending, because there is a considerable risk to take bad financial decisions.
If you are Aries, you can expect relationship problems. So, you better open up the channels of communication between you and your partner and begin to focus on the good things.
If you are Taurus, the work environment will be way to tense. Sleep well every night, maintain healthy eating habits, drink more water and limit your vices – your body needs extra care, during Mercury's retrograde period of time.
If you are Gemini, your creativity will suffer. Mercury is the ruler of your zodiac sign, so his retrograde motion will affect your life more than others'. Your love life will be his favourite target.
If you are Cancer, you will probably argue your parents and other relatives (especially the oldest family members: grandparents, uncles, aunts, even older brothers and sisters). Also, your fertility suffers and there not so much chances to conceive a baby right now.
If you are Leo, your colleagues or your schoolmates and even your neighbours become, suddenly, extremely annoying. It will be very difficult for you to avoid quarrels, proud as you are.
If you are Virgo, be careful with your money! Stop buying stuff you don't need, avoid impulse purchases and don't let yourself fooled by marketing! Otherwise, you'll spend in three weeks more than in two months.

Congratulations: you have decided to become a fearless contrarian, an impish provocateur, a daring iconoclast, a sharpened piercer of pieties and posturing, a hero of free speech, the last person left who will say what PC nannies and the hordes of uptight microstalins will not allow to be said. You've noticed that there's a lot of bullshit swilling around – that most of what people believe is nonsense, that politicians lie, that God isn't real, that public life is full of cretins, that sheer delusion is fermenting everywhere, its grit and stink in every half-chewed mouthful of words that drops out of every witless mouth.
Someone needs to clear out all this bullshit with the cold and limpid waters of Truth, and screw anyone who's offended. That someone could be you. Why not?
But it's not easy to be a fearless contrarian. You start out wanting to offend absolutely everyone with your incisive wit and reckless criticism – but it turns out some people are more dangerous to offend than others. If you burst some cherished delusions you'll be hailed as a brilliant subversive – but if you burst some others, you're a crank, a nihilist, or, worst of all, just an unpleasant person. Some clever little barbs make you a person with an opinion that must be respected; others will see you barred from all the best house parties as the kind of creature that just shouldn't be allowed in polite society. How are you meant to know?
Don't worry: we're here to help. As long as you follow these simple rules, you will always be on the right side of legitimacy, and always welcome in every sensible, reasoned debate. Little people will still hate you, but the right people will chuckle along, and you will be safe.
PICK THE RIGHT TARGET
Last week, police briefly launched an investigation into 20-year-old Jason Osamede Okundaye, a Cambridge student and head of the university's Black and Minority Ethnic Society, after he tweeted that "ALL white people are racist". The statement was the subject of immediate outrage in the Daily Mail and the Sun, both absolutely shocked that someone could say something so crudely offensive. What he said was a good provocation, and it wasn't exactly false – a white person might not personally hold particularly racist beliefs, but whiteness itself only emerged out of the repression of people with darker skin – but being right isn't enough. The police probe was quickly dropped, but the outrage is now immortalised along with Okundaye's name in the archives of Google.
All of this is the exact opposite of what you want. Of course, as a budding contrarian you already know that you should probably reserve your grand, sweeping racial statements for ethnic and religious minorities, rather than white people, and that unless you're willing to do this you should avoid at any cost being from an ethnic or religious minority yourself. This is obvious.
DON'T BE YOUNG
You should also do your very best to not be young, and especially not be a student. Young people are callow; students just regurgitate social-justice pieties that they learned from their dual-honours degrees in gender-screaming and post-structuralist woodwork theory, probably. Even conservative students get treated with condescension: you don't want anyone, on reading your latest brilliant screed, to be able to go, "Oh, you'll grow out of it eventually." You need real-world experience. You need to be billowingly, magnificently middle-aged.
KNOW THE RIGHT PEOPLE
Like most British people, I had until very recently never heard of the Irish writer and columnist Kevin Myers. Irish readers had a different experience: thanks to his prodigious pullulation through the country's papers, serving up spicy headlines like "Africa is giving nothing to anyone – apart from AIDS" and "There was no Holocaust", a lot of people were basically too wearied to be outraged by whatever gobbet of bile he decided to cough up on any given week. There goes Kevin Myers, being offensive again: the world is in order, everything's in its place.
This changed when his latest (and his last) column appeared in the Irish Sunday Times; an ordinary sexist rant about pay inequality that would have been perfectly acceptable to everyone who counts – if he hadn't, along the way, noted that two of the BBC's best paid female presenters – Claudia Winkleman and Vanessa Feltz – are Jewish: "Good for them. Jews are not generally noted for their insistence on selling their talent for the lowest possible price, which is the most useful measure there is of inveterate, lost-with-all-hands stupidity." In other words, he suggested that Jews are all a bunch of money-grubbing Shylocks.
Crucially, this was for the Irish edition of a British paper, and much of the resulting upset came from readers in the UK. Something similar happens whenever Americans find a smugly racist column from Rod Liddle or Boris Johnson, or when people outside of France find out what's really in the pages of Charlie Hebdo. Jewish bodies in Ireland defended Myers against the charge that he's an anti-Semite: of course he shouldn't be condemned; he's a veteran of the Irish media landscape, a bit of a wind-up merchant, but someone with respectable editors and thoroughly decent friends. Like every other kind of reputable body, their instinct was to close ranks.
In the UK, Jewish groups had no such attachments, and they simply saw his remarks for what they were. In the end, Myers was fired from the Sunday Times, and announced on the radio that "I have no career left. My reputation is in tatters." The lesson is clear. If you want to be gratuitously offensive, make sure that everyone who might hear you is already thoroughly sick of you. And most of all, wherever you plan to publish your intrepid anti-establishment heresies, you should always have dependable allies within the establishment.
SAY WHAT YOU MEAN
This one could be controversial. Lesser guides might encourage you to make good use of irony and innuendo, and never really believe what you're saying. That way, if you're ever called up on anything you've said, you always have the option of claiming that it was just a joke, that you were taken out of context, that your accusers are a bunch of literal-minded idiots. And you should claim all those things. But you must not ever actually use irony, because irony is death to you. Your job is to come out with a series of stinging rebukes to anyone you don't like, and the job of everyone who listens is to agree with you. Irony is dangerous: it's the power of language to mean something other than what it appears to mean. Using irony implies a trust in your audience. The ironist trusts other people to creatively engage with the richness of words and the abysses of possible personalities, but you don't trust other people at all. Consider instead using shallow sarcasm, or bullish hyperbole, or just a nebulously jocular tone, as you say all the unpleasant things that you really believe. If things get hairy, you can still claim that it was all a joke. But you'll never have to actually explain what the joke was.
MAKE DELIGHTFULLY PROVOCATIVE STATEMENTS THAT ARE BASICALLY EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE GRUMBLINGS OF ANY OLD HOME-COUNTRIES REACTIONARY, BUT DELIVERED IN A SMUGGER TONE WITH MORE ATTEMPTS AT KNOWING WISECRACKS; THAT EMANATE AS A CHORTLING ECHO FOR THE PRONOUNCEMENTS OF ESTABLISHED POWER; THAT CHALLENGE ONLY THE ILLUSION THAT THE WORLD CAN BE MADE A LESS HIDEOUS PLACE FOR THOSE THAT SUFFER; THAT LEAVE THE POWERLESS FACED WITH A GROTESQUE ARCHITECTURE OF DOMINATION IN WHICH STERN COMMENDS AND FREEWHEELING LAUGHTER MERGE INTO ONE CRIPPLING TOTALITY, WITHOUT LIGHT, WITHOUT HOPE, WITHOUT ANY POSSIBILITY OF SALVATION
This should be obvious.
HAVE FUN!
If you've followed all these steps, you should find yourself transformed. A red-wine stain seeps shining from the corners of your mouth, a mouth that hangs above a chin that gloopily vanishes into a general mess of neck and throat and chest. You are wearing a linen suit, even if you don't remember ever buying one. Your cream-coloured eyes peer out into a world that vanishes two feet beyond your own body; you condemn the stupidity of that patchwork blur in front of you, marinating in your own heft and fearlessness. You've done it. You're putting the world to rights, one parabolic jab at a time, and the admiration of that world is yours. You are a daring contrarian.

Netflix has thousands of movies and TV shows in its arsenal of entertainment. But that isn't always a good thing, especially if you're not sure what you want to watch.
With no many titles, I often find myself looking through the lists and go down a rabbit hole of figuring out what to watch. One of the good thing though, is that if you see something you find interesting, you can add it to your Watch List.
But even that can start adding up, and you could end up going through your lists and still not be sure what you want to watch.

Some investors see a smoking gun. Reuters Valeant Pharmaceuticals is being accused of an Enron-like fraud.
Short-selling firm Citron Research released a report highlighting Valeant's mysterious relationship with Philidor, a pharmacy that distributes drugs for specialty pharmacies, which it has the option to purchase.
After the report was released the stock fell as much as 29%.
Citron says that Valeant has been using its relationship with Philidor to file fake invoices and make its revenue appear greater than it is. Valeant is Philidor's only customer, Citron points out.
This is a jarring turn of events for a company that has been a Wall Street darling for years. Until last month, the stock had risen almost 120% in the last year. Then Valeant came under scrutiny when government officials started asking questions about price gouging at pharmaceutical companies.
House Democrats floated the idea that Valeant CEO Michael Pearson testify before Congress; federal prosecutors in Massachusetts and New York have subpoenaed the company; and Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO), chair of Senate Investigation committee, has started looking into the company. Then The New York Times and other media outlets started looking into its relationship with Philador.
Its stock has fallen 50% since.
For over a year, though, short seller Jim Chanos, the hedge fund manager who alerted the public to Enron's massive accounting fraud, has said that the company is a roll up— a company that uses shady accounting and serial acquisitions to hide that it lacks organic growth.
The smoking gun
It wasn't until Monday, on Valeant's earnings call, that it took pains to describe its relationship with Philidor and disclosed that it had the option to purchase Philidor.
"Philidor, one of our specialty pharmacy partners, provides prescription services to patients across the country, and provides administrative services for our copay cards and is a dispensary that fills prescriptions. We have a contractual relationship with Philidor, and late last year we purchased an option to acquire Philidor if we so choose," said Valeant CEO Michael Pearson on the conference call.
"Given accounting rules, we consolidate Philidor's financials. Inventory held at Philidor remains on Valeant's books, and is not included in the specialty pharmacy channel inventory."
It also tried to explain why there is a strange lawsuit filed in California court between it and another pharmaceutical company that acts as a distributor for Valeant, R&O.
In the lawsuit, R&O says that Valeant sent it an invoice for $69 million — an invoice for products it never received.
Valeant, for its part, said during its earnings call that R&O sold a bunch of its products and was holding more.
And here's a key part: The Valeant products that R&O sold are booked as revenue for Valeant. Those that R&O still holds are not.
"R&O has never received a single invoice from Valeant in any amount and until September 4 had never received a single demand for payment from Valeant. R&O has requested copies of the invoices, but to no avail. Indeed, it seems that Valeant has no evidence whatsoever to back up its claims," said the lawsuit.
What Citron considers the smoking gun here is that Philidor and R&O are actually the same company. Since Valeant basically owns Philador, this would imply that Valeant is invoicing itself to pump up its revenue.
"... it is obvious that Philidor and R&O are ARE THE SAME COMPANY AND SHARE MANAGEMENT. The two companies have the same patient privacy disclosure, in fact formatted identically, on both companies' websites. Note the R&O website refers to themselves as Philidor," Citron wrote.
Citron

More links to indications that Philidor and R&O are the same are here and here.
The companies also share the same privacy officer, and the two companies registered all their websites on the same day. Digging deeper, Citron found more pharmaceutical companies with the same lineage.
"It is apparent to Citron that Valeant has created a network of 'pharmacies' as clones of Philidor. Why do these exist? Citron believes it is merely for the purpose of phantom sales or stuff the channel, and avoid scrutiny from the auditors," Citron wrote.
Citron spends the rest of the report pointing to instances where Valeant looks a whole lot like Enron, from its management, to its insistence that it has been transparent in all its dealings.
Citron
A walk back
On Monday, Valeant tried to walk back from its business model, saying that it would spend more money on R&D, rely less on raising prices for revenue, and potentially engage in stock buybacks.
Bloomberg TV This goes directly against the business model that made it a Wall Street darling — a model that hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, the company's third-largest shareholder — praised earlier this month.
"Valeant believes that they are not good at drug development, i.e., or really coming up with new molecules and taking them all the way to the approval process. That's a — has been historically a very low-return business," Ackman said discussing Valeant's R&D spend, which sits at about 3%.
Valeant's changes would turn it into the low-return business Ackman mentioned, but it would likely get the government off its back.
Now, if regulators are seeing this report, it may not have that chance anymore.
Adam Venit, the alleged perpetrator, has been put on leave from WME in the aftermath of the allegations.
Los Angeles police have opened an investigation after actor and former pro football player Terry Crews filed a report on Wednesday claiming he was sexually assaulted, the department told The Hollywood Reporter.
The robbery/homicide division, which also handles sex crimes, now has the case, police told THR. No further details were given other than Crews was the victim in the report, which was filed at the LAPD Hollywood station.
The suspect in the report is believed to be WME agent Adam Venit, who was put on leave from the agency in the aftermath of the allegations, which Crews outlined on Twitter.
On Oct. 10, the Brooklyn Nine-Nine star — and WME client — tweeted that a "high-level Hollywood executive" groped his "privates" at a party last year. The alleged assault happened in view of Crews' wife. "Jumping back, I said, 'What are you doing?!' He just grinned like a jerk," Crews wrote.
Crews said he told others at the party what occurred and that Venit called the next day with an apology.
Venit does not represent Crews, but he does rep Adam Sandler, Diane Keaton, Eddie Murphy, Kevin James, Rob Lowe, Russell Brand, Shawn Levy, Steve Martin, Sylvester Stallone and Vince Vaughn. He also reps Brett Ratner and Dustin Hoffman, men who are facing sexual misconduct allegations of their own.
Vancouver promotes itself as a modern if not postmodern city. Doug Coupland's book City of Glass rightly captured the city's look and aesthetic, which is dominated by highrises set against magnificent mountains and the ocean.
Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners ‘Punch to the Gut' Musical on Residential Schools Returns to Vancouver Children of God has been shaped by intense audience reactions, says director Corey Payette.
It's an exciting place to live, profoundly multi-faceted and rich in diversity. It is a peaceful city with many contradictions, the Downtown Eastside being the most visible example of the challenges faced by local governments struggling with the needs of the poor and underprivileged against a backdrop of incredible wealth and economic activity.
These contradictions are not unique to Vancouver. But there was always the hope that British Columbia and its largest city would find the measure of these problems and develop creative solutions to envision the city differently.
Over the last 16 years, I have been working on the development of a new campus for Emily Carr University of Art and Design. As a consequence, I have learned more than I ever could have imagined about the challenges of creatively engaging with the built environment in urban centres and with the ways in which cities like Vancouver are organized to both facilitate and impede the development of new areas of the city and the buildings we put into them.
The new campus is situated on what was the former site of the Finning Corp. Finning gave 18 acres to four post-secondary institutions in the Vancouver area in 2001: University of British Columbia, Simon Fraser University, British Columbia Institute of Technology and Emily Carr.
The gift was generous and was given with the understanding that the lands would be used for collaborative purposes by the four institutions. The initial vision was to build and then share facilities in a cross-disciplinary environment for the benefit of students coming from many different parts of the city.
An unrealized vision
This vision was never realized because the institutions never found the measure of each other's strengths and never negotiated long enough to make something happen.
But Emily Carr decided to go ahead and build a new campus because, of the four institutions, it owned no land and had leased its facilities over its 92-year history.
Among all the challenges, three stand out: raising $122.5 million to build the campus; developing the architectural plan for the facility and finally, the City of Vancouver itself.
A summary of just some of the challenges: from permitting through to planning and engineering, differing interests, different personalities, sometimes ambiguous rules and regulations, conflict among people working at City Hall that led to many slowdowns, lack of clarity as to how to achieve the goals of the project, arbitrary interpretations of land use, conflict-laden discussions of transportation, parking and amenities.
Sometimes we were told something had to happen because “rules are rules.” Alternately we were told that time did not permit the depth of research required to make changes to existing site and district plans, some of which had been formulated years and decades earlier.
Inevitably, this lead to compromises, some good and some bad.
Perhaps the most challenging compromise was the grade upon which the building was erected. The costs of following the city plan were not only financial but also affected the design and look and feel of the building. Part of the interior of the building is now underground as a result of a decision that still today feels awkward and unnecessary.
The location of the campus means that it could link the western and eastern parts of the city through large open plazas and a permeable campus closely linked to the immediate communities in which it is situated.
My ideal scenario would see the area turn into a connector, allowing people to walk from the east side of the city to the downtown core through a series of connected walkways.
None of this will be possible because at some point or other plans were developed that now, from all accounts, cannot and will not change.
The heart of the issue here is how cities respond to change. I don't think that Vancouver is unique.
Differing interests and contesting values especially around land use and housing are at the heart of debates among citizens, politicians and bureaucrats in all cities. The new campus was completed a few months ago and is magnificent, but all of the problems I have described still exist.
Design as a discipline
As someone who works in an art and design institution, I am amazed that some of the great value that design as a discipline brings to so many areas has not really infiltrated City Hall.
For example, how can new building sites be broken down into nodes and networks so that building mass is lighter and less imposing and landscaping is not just peripheral but integral and central?
Well, there are at least four different city departments that would have to get together and answer those types of questions. Aside from the challenges of scheduling, it is not possible to bring that many differing interests to the same table in an environment of engaged and productive discussion.
Design is a problem-solving discipline and one that, like engineering, seeks answers to difficult challenges. But if the context for problem-solving is unclear, then even the best designers will have difficulties in solving complex issues.
Cities have always struggled with the ups and downs of population growth, affordable housing and making space for industry and employers to actually set up their businesses.
From a historical point of view, and over the course of the 20th century in particular, there have always been tensions between urban needs and suburban growth, between areas that undergo gentrification and those that remain “undeveloped.”
In all this, no magic solutions have been found to rising costs and decreasing availability in the housing sector. And cities continue to develop their transportation systems without deeper questions being asked about sustainability or even capacity.
Some cities grow by design, but most grow incrementally and without a real understanding of the short and long-term implications of planning processes and outcomes and decisions that often ripple far beyond their initial assumptions.
It's almost impossible to sustain a vision for a city without modelling, critiquing and examining the outcomes of decisions made by many different departments, which for the most part operate in isolation from each other.
As a consequence, cities have large bureaucracies with conflicting interests that often have nothing to do with good policy development or pragmatic planning. They are self-perpetuating machines. They set rules in one decade and hold onto the same rules in another, even when conditions on the ground have changed.
Imagine the difficulty for the thousands who work in city halls to engage in an ethnography of their cities and themselves; to research in an impartial manner how people live and what their aspirations are; and to try and understand the flow and flux of their everyday lives in the context of policy development.
No one has the time for what appears to be an academic exercise and yet this knowledge should drive decision-making. What is described as consultation is more often than not an exercise in futility — not because anyone's intentions are negative, but because real consultation takes more than a few hours on a Thursday evening.
The city as an onion
Cities are like onions without a core. The more you peel off, the more challenges there seem to be. And the beauty of this contradiction is that cities are resilient inventions, able to outlive poor government and poor governance, able to grow in response to the elasticity of the economy, full of culture and cultural activities, vibrant and, in some cases, genuinely open-minded.
The challenge is that cities and the people who live in them have different and sometimes unusual expectations. What's more, cities are places that change by the day if not by the hour. Cities scramble to keep up, including Vancouver.
We need new models for the planning process. We need to think about cities as living organisms, and most of all we need to face the mistakes head on.
Vancouver may see itself as postmodern, but it has fallen far behind cities like Melbourne because in all the areas to tick off in discussing cities — road safety, traffic congestion, integrated transportation systems, varied approaches to the movement of people, (why isn't there any light rail in Vancouver?), housing affordability, access to services, traffic management, cultural venues and streetscapes, and yes, the role of bikes — Vancouver is not in the game.
Its development and discussion of policy does not attract open debate and true dialogue. The control that City Hall exercises over development is more bureaucratic than progressive, and it seems to be pedalling backwards as the city accelerates.
Vancouver is indeed, at this moment in its history, a city of glass.
Microsoft has just re-released Windows 10 Mobile 10586.29 after pulling it on Monday due to a bug that caused installation issues on a number of Lumia 950 and 950 XL devices.
In a statement released this morning for ZDNet, the company confirms that all problems have been fixed, and the update is now available for new Lumia users via the phone update section.
“After momentarily pausing the Windows 10 Mobile update due to an issue with the update server that impacted the installation of the update on a limited number of phones, we have addressed the issue and will begin rolling out the 10586.29 update again,” a company spokesperson is quoted as saying.
This means that if you have a Lumia 950 or 950 XL that's not yet upgraded to Windows 10 Mobile 10586.29, the new version should show up in the phone update section and be available for download just like any other OS update.
Known bugs
Microsoft admitted earlier this week that, on a number of devices, the new Windows 10 Mobile version didn't show up, while others could not install it due to a bug that prevented the process from starting.
“We are aware of issues related to the recently published Windows 10 Mobile update, including: update not being offered, update appearing to get stuck at 0%, and pesky low storage notifications,” the company said in a statement when deciding to pull the update completely.
Windows 10 Mobile 10586.29 is available for Lumia 950 and 950 XL devices that aren't enrolled in the Windows Insider program, so it's critical to both users and Microsoft to make the process run smoothly on both models, especially because we're talking about the company's new flagships.
The update should already be available for all devices that are yet to update, so go over to the phone update section to see if it's there for you too.
Thanks for the tip, @vickymhatre6!
Looking through recipes for many British beers especially from older, regional breweries, you will notice that time and time again the same ingredient pops up in the grain bill. Torrified wheat. It is usually added in small percentages, especially in traditional English Ales and bitters. The reason for these small additions at the end of the grain bill is simple; head retention. How does it work, what is torrified wheat and how much do you need. That is what we are going to discover in the rest of this article.
What Does “Torrified” mean?
Torrified wheat is an unmalted adjunct used in making beer.
Wheat as a cereal has been used in beer ever since it was first cultivated, so almost as old as civilisation. The term “torrified” refers to the process the wheat is treated with. Basically, you take wheat kernels and subject them to a high-temperature heat treatment that breaks down the cellular structure of the grain.
Wheat that hasn't been torrified has starch that needs to be gelatinised before the brewer can extract fermentable sugars from it. The way to gelatinise the starch in wheat is to heat it up to over 85°C before mashing. The torrification process pre-gelatinises the starches in the wheat so that they are easily broken down at mash temperatures.
What is Torrified Wheat Used For?
When I first started home brewing, I had one book. The book was Graham Wheelers, Brew Your Own British Real Ale. Out of all the home brewing books I have on the bookshelf, this one, in particular, has by far the most recipes. This is I guess part of the reason for its popularity, all of the recipes in Brew Your Own are clones of commercial British Ales. Looking through all these recipes a fairly large proportion of them have torrified wheat in.
In most cases, the torrified wheat that goes into those beers is just to change the appearance of the beer. Whilst torrified wheat does have a unique, subtle flavour, the discerning cask ale drinker must ensure there is a suitable level of foam on top of his/her pint of beer.
Wheat has a much larger percentage of protein than barley and it is that protein that helps stabilise beer foam and add body to the beer.
Why Does Torrified Wheat Aid Head Retention?
The key thing that wheat brings to foam stability is a high protein content. Protein is known to aid foam qualities and whilst malted barley does contain some protein, wheat contains a larger percentage.
As mentioned previously, wheat on its own needs to be gelatinised before you can extract fermentable sugars. Whereas torrified wheat has already undergone pre-gelatinisation. This is why it is so convenient to add a small percentage of torrified wheat to the grist of whatever beer you are brewing in order to increase the froth forming compounds.
How much Torrified Wheat Should You Be Using?
If you are using it in an effort to promote head retention and increase the stability and body of a beer a good starting point is to use torrified wheat to make up between 5 – 10% of the grist which would be around a couple of handfuls in a 20 litre batch. I always shoot for around 8% and think this is around the right mark to get some nice lacing on the glass when drinking a beer.
I will point out though that torrified wheat can be used in larger quantities, most maltsters have a maximum figure of around 40% of the grist. Used in this kind of quantity instead of wheat malt you are in the territory of making beers like witbiers and german wheat beers.
Do take note that there are no enzymes in torrified wheat, you need to rely on the diastatic power of pale or lager malts to convert the starches in a mash, this is why you are limited to 40% of the grain bill.
Can You Steep Torrified Wheat?
No. Torrified wheat is only suitable for mashing and needs to be mashed with other malts that have enzymes to convert the starches into fermentable sugars.
As a general rule any malt or cereal that has unconverted starch, which is the case with torrified wheat, needs to be mashed. Check out a list of grains suitable for steeping here.
If you are an extract brewer wanting to promote head retention and formation in your beers then I would pick something like Carapils/Dextrin malt, which is suitable for steeping and provides the same benefits as wheat for this purpose.
Torrified Wheat Vs. Wheat Malt
What should you be using and when? This is really up to each individual brewer. The flavours are different and if used in any large quantity, such as when making a wheat beer I would use wheat malt as I prefer the flavour. It is necessary to use wheat malt when it makes up a large part of the grist because wheat malt has the enzymes required to convert it's own starches whereas torrified wheat doesn't.
If you want to have a small addition between 5 – 10% to aid head retention, either is suitable. I wouldn't think twice about using either one or the other.
Do Girls Like Wheat?
Yes, they do!
It is claimed Alfred Hitchcock was so traumatized after viewing footage of the liberation of the Belsen-Bergen concentration camp that the legendary film director stayed away from Pinewood Film Studios for a week.
Hitchcock had been enlisted by friend and patron, Sidney Bernstein to make a documentary on German atrocities carried out during the Second World War. The director was to use footage shot by British and Soviet film units during the liberation of the Nazi concentration camps. The material was so disturbing that Hitchcock's complete film has rarely been seen. Speaking to the Independent newspaper, Dr Toby Haggith, Senior Curator at the Department of Research, Imperial War Museum, said:
“It was suppressed because of the changing political situation, particularly for the British. Once they discovered the camps, the Americans and British were keen to release a film very quickly that would show the camps and get the German people to accept their responsibility for the atrocities that were there.”
According to Patrick McGilligan in his biography Alfred Hitchcock: A Life in Darkness and Light:
[Hitchcock met] with two writers who had witnessed the atrocities of Bergen-Belsen first-hand. Richard Crossman contributed a treatment, while Colin Wills, an Australian correspondent, wrote a script that relied heavily on narration. The director had committed himself to the project early enough to give Hitchcockian instructions to some of the first cameramen entering the concentration camps. Hitchcock made a point of requesting “long tracking shots, which cannot be tampered with,” in the words of the film's editor, Peter Tanner, so that nobody could claim the footage had been manipulated to falsify the reality. The footage was in a newsreel style, but generally of high quality, and some of it in color. .... The footage spanned eleven concentration camps, including Bergen-Belsen, Dachau, Buchenwald, Ebensee, and Mathausen. The filmmakers ended up with eight thousand feet of film and newsreel, some of it shot by allied photographers, the rest of it impounded. It was to be cut and assembled into roughly seven reels. Hitchcock watched “all the film as it came in,” recalled Tanner, although the director “didn't like to look at it.” The footage depressed both of them: the piles of corpses, the staring faces of dead children, the walking skeletons. The days of looking at the footage were long and unrelievedly grim.
In the end, the planned film took Hitchcock and his team much longer than anticipated, and when it was delivered, the perceived opinion was the documentary would not help with Germany's postwar reconstruction. Despite protests from Bernstein and Hitchcock, the documentary was dumped and five of the film's six reels were deposited at the Imperial War Museum, where they were quietly forgotten.
Some later thought Hitchcock's claims of making a Holocaust documentary were mere flights of fancy, that was until 1980, when an American researcher discovered the forgotten five reels listed as “F3080” in the Museum's archives. These were screened at the Berlin Film Festival in 1985, and this incomplete and poor quality version was then shown on PBS under the title Memory of the Camps, with its original commentary by Crossman and Wills, narrated by Trevor Howard.
Now, the Imperial War Museum has painstakingly restored all six reels according to Hitchcock's original intentions. This has led to some “wariness” over seeing the documentary as a “Hitchcock film” rather than as an important and horrific record of Nazi atrocities.
Haggith, who worked as an advisor on the project, has said the film is “much more candid” than any previous Holocaust documentary, and has described it as “brilliant” and “sophisticated.”
“It's both an alienating film in terms of its subject matter but also one that has a deep humanity and empathy about it. Rather than coming away feeling totally depressed and beaten, there are elements of hope. “We can't stop the film being incredibly upsetting and disturbing but we can help people understand why it is being presented in that way. “Judging by the two test screenings we have had for colleagues, experts and film historians, what struck me was that they found it extremely disturbing. “When you're sitting in a darkened cinema and you're focusing on a screen, your attention is very focused, unlike watching it on television… the digital restoration has made this material seem very fresh. One of the common remarks was that it [the film] was both terrible and brilliant at the same time.”
Work on Hitchcock's documentary is almost complete, and the film (with as yet to be announced new title) will be shown on British TV in early 2015 to mark the 70th anniversary of the “liberation” of Europe. The film will also be screened at film festivals and in the cinema.
The following is the 5-reel version of Hitchcock's documentary. Warning: the film contains horrific and disturbing images, which may not be suitable viewing for all.

The quaint old notion of friends “dropping in” for a visit seems to have disappeared somewhere around the same time as shoulder pads, Eight Tracks, or Electric Light Orchestra.
When I was a child, my mother and her friends would pop over to each other's homes at a moment's notice, stopping by without any embellishment (never any makeup, and sometimes still in their slippers and “housedresses,” which were basically just glorified pyjamas). Because, after all, it was just mom and the kids, and for whom would they need to get all decked out, anyway, if the men weren't around?
In those days, people lived closer together, women were friends with their neighbors, coffee was always on, and there was invariably something home-baked on the counter. Mom's best friend–who also happened to be her cousin–lived only 3 blocks away. Ms. Cuz could call up at 9:20 AM and be at our house by 9:40. In the interim, my mother would put up a fresh pot of coffee and get a cake mixed and into the oven. By the time Cuzzy arrived, the cake would be just about ready to come out of the oven; the women would sit down, light up a cig, pour a cup of coffee and catch up on respective kids and husbands–and by then it was time for cake.
Nowadays, it seems, that's all changed. Everything in our lives is faster, everything requires instant gratification and everything is immediate–everything, that is, except human contact. I mean, you know it's gotten bad when couples have to make an appointment just to have a date with each other. Gah!
A while back , I was asked by Marly of Namely Marly to join today's “Our Panera's Gluten Free Dream Day” event, which she co-created with Allyson of Manifest Vegan. The idea was to create a gluten free (and in my case, sugar free, egg free and dairy free) baked good based on something from the Panera menu. Well, needless to say, I was totally chuffed and couldn't wait to get started! I took a gander through the online list and immediately hit upon “Cinnamon Crumb Coffee Cake.”
Why did I choose this particular cake? Well, it was one of my mom's specialities when I was a kid, and even just thinking about it brought back a flood of memories. My parents played cards every weekend with a group of friends, and when it was my mom's turn to hostess, she always baked at least two sweet offerings for the socializing portion of the evening, after the game. Without fail, the table held her “famous” Chiffon Cake, often paired with Farmer's Cheesecake or perhaps fancy cookies, or–this coffee cake.
Well, okay, not exactly “this” coffee cake. My mom's version was made with white (wheat) flour, white sugar, eggs, and Crisco shortening. It became a staple in my own home when I first moved out on my own, because it was cheap to make, tasted good, and could go from “idea-in-your-head” to “slice-on-your-plate” in under 30 minutes.
My modernized, gluten-free, sugar-free, vegan, ACD-friendly version is perfectly compatible with today's fast-paced lifestyle, however. As soon as you hang up from that impromptu invitation you issued to your neighbor, just start on the cake. This one takes a wee bit longer to execute than my mom's–40 minutes versus my mom's 30–but these days, it will take your friend that long to drive from her place over to yours, anyway.
When she arrives, be sure to offer her some cake.
“Mum, you know that Chaser and I could get there much faster than that if you ever invited us over for cake. And we won't need to put on makeup first, either.”

Cinnamon Crumb Cake (Gluten Free, Sugar Free, Anti-Candida, Vegan; can be nut-free) This quick and easy cake will impress your guests with its light, delicate crumb and cinnamon-walnut center and topping. Perfect for impromptu visitors or just an afternoon snack. For the Topping/Filling: 1/3 cup (80 ml) certified gluten-free whole rolled oats (not instant or quick-cook) 1/3 cup (80 ml) coconut sugar 1/4 cup (60 ml) coconut flour 1 Tbsp (15 ml) cinnamon pinch fine sea salt 1/2 cup (55 g) walnut pieces or coarsely chopped walnuts** 2 Tbsp (30 ml) virgin coconut oil, preferably organic For the cake: 1/2 cup (120 ml) unsweetened applesauce 1 Tbsp (15 ml) finely ground flax seeds 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) apple cider vinegar 20-30 drops plain or vanilla stevia liquid, to your taste 1/3 cup (80 ml) coconut sugar 1 cup (240 ml) unsweetened plain or vanilla soy, almond, cashew or rice milk 1/3 cup (80 ml) sunflower or other light-tasting oil, preferably organic 1 tsp (5 ml) pure vanilla extract 1 tsp (5 ml) pure lemon extract 2 cups (260 g) Ricki's All Purpose Gluten Free Flour Mix 1-1/2 Tbsp (1 Tbsp plus 1-1/2 tsp, or 22.5 ml) baking powder 1/4 tsp (1 ml) baking soda 1-3/4 tsp (8.5 ml) xanthan gum 1/4 tsp (1 ml) fine sea salt Preheat oven to 350F (180C). Line an 8-inch (20 cm) square pan with parchment, or spray with nonstick spray. Make the topping: In a medium bowl, combine the oats, coconut sugar, coconut flour, cinnamon and salt. Stir to combine. Add the coconut oil and pinch the mixture between your thumb and fingers until it's evenly moistened and crumbly. Add the walnuts and toss to combine. Set aside. Make the cake: In a small bowl, whisk together the applesauce, flax, vinegar, stevia, coconut sugar, soymilk, oil, vanilla and lemon extract. Set aside while you measure the dry ingredients, or at least 2 minutes. In a medium bowl, sift together the all purpose flour, baking powder, soda, xanthan gum and salt. Add the wet ingredients to the dry and whisk just until blended (do not overmix!). Spread about half the batter in the bottom of the pan (you can measure it, or just estimate). Sprinkle with about half the topping mixture. Scooping out heaping tablespoonsful of the remaining batter, dot the top of the cake with the rest of the batter in spoonfuls, covering as much as you can. Use the back of the spoon to carefully spread the top layer of batter evenly over the cake, filling any spaces as best you can. Sprinkle with the remainder of the topping, covering the batter as evenly as possible (it's okay if there are a few blank spots here and there). Press the topping lightly into the top of the cake. Bake for 30-35 minutes, rotating the pan about halfway through, until a tester inserted in the middle of the cake comes out clean. Cool at least 20 minutes before serving. Makes 9 large or 12 more reasonable servings. May be frozen. **Note: I've made the cake nut-free by simply removing the walnuts–it worked beautifully! It will bake up a little faster, but that's the only difference I noticed. Suitable for: ACD Stage 3 Maintenance and beyond; refined sugar-free, gluten-free, dairy-free, egg free, soy-free, yeast-free, vegan.

Police in the Turkish city of Istanbul have used tear gas and water cannon against protesters in a fifth night of anti-government demonstrations.
The clashes came hours after Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc apologised for the violent police response to initial protests last week.
Mr Arinc is due to hold a meeting with activists later on Wednesday.
Protests over the demolition of a park in Istanbul have grown into days of unrest across the country.
Mr Arinc apologised to protesters injured in demonstrations opposing the redevelopment of Gezi Park.
He said the original protests were "just and legitimate" and the "excessive use of force" by police was wrong.
Mr Erdoğan is fond of pointing out that half the Turkish electorate voted for him. He seems to have forgotten, or to have ignored the fact that the other half the electorate did not Could protests be Erdoğan's undoing?
Ahead of a proposed meeting in Istanbul, activists issued a list of demands, including the end of plans to demolish the park, a ban on tear gas, the release of arrested protesters and the resignation of top officials blamed for the protest crackdown, the BBC's Mark Lowen in Istanbul reports.
The atmosphere on Istanbul's Taksim Square on Tuesday evening was almost celebratory as a huge crowd of people ranging from football fans to well-heeled professionals gathered, the BBC's Paul Mason reported.
People have been chanting "Have you heard us?" in the hope the government is listening to their demands.
But later, police fired tear gas, water cannon and smoke grenades as they tried to disperse protesters.
In the city of Izmir, there was a festive atmosphere and police kept their distance, though some young protesters earlier smashed security cameras and threw bricks, the BBC's Quentin Sommerville reports.

'Undemocratic'
Also in Izmir, state-run Anatolia news agency reported that police had arrested 25 people for tweeting "misinformation".
An official from the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), Ali Engin, told Anatolia they were being held for "calling on people to protest".
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said on Sunday that Twitter was a "menace" being used to spread "lies".
In his comments Mr Arinc called for the demonstrations to end, saying they had been taken over by "terrorist elements".
Mr Arinc's conciliatory remarks contrast with the tougher line taken by Mr Erdoğan, who says the protests are undemocratic.
Speaking during a trip to Morocco, Mr Erdoğan told reporters: "On my return from this visit, the problems will be solved."
Meanwhile Turkish television station NTV has apologised for failing to cover the initial protests.
The chief executive of the conglomerate that owns NTV, Cem Aydin of Dogus, said criticism of the channel was "fair to a large extent".
"Our audience feels like they were betrayed," he said after a meeting with staff, some of whom resigned in protest at the lack of coverage.
Many believe the government blocked internet access in order to prevent news of the protests spreading Sophie Hutchinson, BBC News, Istanbul Social media plays major role
Protesters have turned to social media to spread their message and coordinate demonstrations, the BBC's Sophie Hutchinson reports from Istanbul.
Earlier on Tuesday the left-wing Kesk trade union confederation, representing some 240,000 public sector workers, began a two-day strike in support of the protests and accused the government of committing "state terror".
Another trade union confederation, Disk, has said it will join the strike on Wednesday.
'Authoritarian tendency'
The protests began on 28 May over plans to redevelop Gezi Park near Taksim Square in Istanbul.
They soon mushroomed, engulfing several cities and including political demands.
Gezi Park The demolition of Gezi Park - the issue which sparked the protests - is a part of a wider urban redevelopment project in Istanbul
The government wants to pedestrianise and ease traffic around Taksim Square; Kalyon Group, a company which has close ties with the government, has been contracted to carry out the project
The project also includes building a shopping centre which PM Erdoğan says would not be "a traditional mall", but rather would include cultural centres, an opera house and a mosque
The plan also includes rebuilding an Ottoman-era military barracks near the site and demolishing the historic Ataturk Cultural Centre
The government has been making ambiguous and inconsistent statements about the project, which is causing concern among protesters who oppose replacing the green city park with grey concrete Plans for Gezi Park in detail Chaos and camaraderie
Officials have confirmed two deaths in the protests. One man died after being shot by an unidentified gunman in the southern city of Antakya.
Another died after being hit by a car that ploughed into a crowd in Istanbul.
The Turkish Human Rights Association, an NGO, said more than 2,800 protesters had been injured across the country, many of them seriously, and that 791 had been detained, of whom "around 500" have since been released.
Mr Arinc said that 244 police officers and 64 protesters had been injured, and more than 70m Turkish lira (£24m; $37m) worth of public damage had been caused.
Protesters accuse the Turkish government of becoming increasingly authoritarian.
Mr Erdoğan is still the most popular politician in the country, but he is discovering that a ruling style that his opponents say is autocratic has its limits, the BBC's Middle East Editor Jeremy Bowen reports from Istanbul.
Mr Erdoğan's Turkey was seen as a runaway success by many in Europe and the Middle East; now it is looking tarnished, with deeper problems than its allies - and enemies - realised, he adds.

The national reckoning with inappropriate behavior that has swept across Hollywood, politics, and media landed at the top of NBC News on Wednesday morning, as the network announced live on the Today show, the crown jewel in its news division, that it had fired its leading man, anchor Matt Lauer, over a sexual harassment allegation.
“We just learned this moments ago,” announced Savannah Guthrie, the anchor who, on any other morning, would be opening the broadcast next to Lauer. She steadied her voice and swallowed hard after she assured viewers that they would be covering this story as reporters and journalists. But the rawness came through as she read an official statement from NBC News Chairman Andy Lack about Lauer, her professional partner and personal friend: “On Monday night, we received a detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace by Matt Lauer. It represented, after serious review, a clear violation of our company's standards.” The statement from Lack noted that he had “reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident.”
Guthrie said she was “heartbroken” and “devastated” by the news. “We are grappling with a dilemma so many people have faced these last few weeks—how do you reconcile your love for someone with the revelation that they have behaved badly?”
While the news reverberated throughout the newsroom, the allegation against Lauer did not come as a complete surprise. For weeks, there have been rumors in media circles that Variety and The New York Times were working on stories about Lauer, one of the highest-ranking, highest-profile, and highest-paid people in television news. Still, the early reaction within 30 Rock on Wednesday morning was a sense of shell-shock. It is hard to overstate how important Today is to NBC News's core business. Of the billion dollars in annual revenue generated by the three network morning shows, Today accounted for about half. And Lauer, for two decades, has been the beating heart of that franchise, commanding a reported $20 million and remaining a constant on air as his co-anchors, from Katie Couric to Meredith Vieira, Ann Curry, and Natalie Morales, moved on. “Matt Lauer is the most powerful person at NBC News, and it took some real courage to step up and say, ‘I'm going to come out and tell my story,'” Willie Geist, an anchor on MSNBC's Morning Joe who worked alongside Lauer for years, said Wednesday morning.
While Hoda Kotb, who was pulled onto the Today show set to serve as emergency co-anchor, and Al Roker struggled to process the news, the shock spread throughout 30 Rock. One colleague I contacted for a reaction Wednesday morning simply responded, “Wow.” Another staffer told me that this may mean a huge shift for NBC. “I need to just curl up in a ball and hide under the covers,” they told me. Lauer, along with the rest of the Today show cast, was scheduled to host NBC's annual Christmas tree-lighting ceremony Wednesday night.
The news is the latest in a series of stunning developments to have roiled Hollywood, New York, and Washington, D.C., as an unprecedented number of women—empowered by the downfall of Harvey Weinstein—have come forward with allegations of sexual harassment and assault by powerful men. Lauer's termination comes a week after CBS News fired Charlie Rose, after The Washington Post published the accounts of eight women who say they were sexually harassed by the veteran journalist. Other members of the media, including NPR's Michael Oreskes and The New York Times' Glenn Thrush, have faced their own allegations (Oreskes resigned; Thrush has been suspended while the Times conducts an investigation). Last month, NBC News fired Mark Halperin after a handful of women came forward detailing alleged inappropriate behavior while he was in a senior position at ABC News, and earlier this month, the network terminated Matt Zimmerman, the senior vice president of booking for news and entertainment, who worked for Today and other programs.
As staffers grapple with the news and brace for the possibility of more to come, speculation about who will fill Lauer's spot is already beginning. Between Rose's and Lauer's terminations, two of the most plum jobs in news are now vacant, leaving ABC's George Stephanopoulos as the only male lead anchor left in network morning television.
The prime time programming for Republican convention hadn't started yet Monday morning in Cleveland, but the true Donald Trump fan base came out in force at Settler's Landing Park, a small green strip next to the Cuyahoga River. The crowd, composed mostly of angry white men festooned in either biker gear or T-shirts decrying Hillary Clinton, was there for the America First Unity Rally, hosted by a group called Citizens for Trump. It was a proud showing of what used to be called the "fringe" right, but is now the faction that, through Donald Trump, controls the Republican party.
But while the rally was ostensibly about rallying support for Trump, the true man of the hour was Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist who runs "Infowars" and who was there to claim his victory in destroying the last remaining strips of sense and reality-based thinking within conservatism. While other speakers, such as Sen. John McCain's primary challenger Kelli Ward and talk show host Wayne Dupree drew applause and some whoops of support, it was only when Jones ascended the stage that the crowd really came alive, rushing the stage to get near their hero as he unleashed a stream of paranoid rhetoric that really only makes sense to his avid fan base.

"The establishment, George Soros and others have done everything they can to try to shut down our free speech," Jones ranted as the crowd gazed upon him rapturously. "They tried to destroy our sovereignty. They tried to attack our Second Amendment. And everything they've done has blown up in their face. They are failing and Donald Trump is surging in every major poll across the country!"
"The answer to 1984 is 1776!" Jones added triumphantly, as the crowd joined in, chanting along with what was clearly a favorite slogan from his long-running media empire of radio shows, videos, and "news" stories that paint a picture of a world where every violent event is a "false flag" and the world is run by a shadowy conspiracy of "globalists" that seem, by the number of times his name was mentioned, to answer solely to the liberal-ish philanthropist George Soros.
It's tempting to write off this rally as a fringe event that has no real bearing on what's going on in the main hall of the Republican National Convention. But the grim truth is that, as the events in the Quicken Loans Center demonstrated, so-called "mainstream" Republicans had lost out and these folks, with views shaped more by paranoid urban legends than by ideology, had won the day by getting their guy, Trump, nominated.
"Donald Trump is finally saying the things America needs," a Infowars shirt-wearing man from Morgan Hill, California who would only provide the name "Wade" to me, argued. "We've been on too long, side-stepping the issues, and trying to make everything politically correct."
When asked how long he had been a fan of Alex Jones, Wade perked up.
"Since 9/11. He was the only one speaking the truth about 9/11 and is to this day," Wade said.

When pressed about what this truth is, Wade continued by saying, "The planes sure as hell didn't bring the buildings down."
"Buildings don't fall flat and go to dust," he added, laughing ruefully at those who believe otherwise.
Jones is a long-time 9/11 truther, probably the most prominent one in the country. He is also tight with Trump, who has popped up on Infowars as an honored guest.
"Your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down," Trump gushed while giving an interview to Jones in December.
Jones returned the praise, saying, "my audience, 90% of them, they support you."
That certainly seemed to be the case with the crowd of Jones fanatics that turned out to Monday's rally. The mutual admiration society between Trump and Jones is especially notable, as Jones generally sprays hate and disdain for all politicians, Democratic or Republican, who he views as "globalists" engaged in a worldwide conspiracy of villainy.

Wade had an explanation for why Jones makes an exception to this general rule for his orange-hued billionaire buddy.
"Trump's not the typical Republican," Wade said, thoughtfully. "Like Ronald Reagan, Trump's hijacked the Republican Party for the people."
"The people", of course, is a hazy phrase. The folks at the America First Unity Rally certainly thought of themselves as "the people". The rhetoric, from speaker after speaker, focused on portraying their audiences as the authentic America, one that has supposedly been marginalized by the forces of "political correctness".

But, to my eyes, this group of people, at best, represented a very thin slice of America: Almost completely white, mostly male, paranoid, and sticking to an aesthetic that is best described as "defensively masculine", with a heavy emphasis on biker gear and ill-fitting T-shirts. It was a crowd completely detached from any relationship to truth or facts — there was quite a bit of chatter about George Soros supposedly funding "agitators" to disrupt the RNC — and instead caught up, to an alarming degree, with the fact-free world according to Alex Jones.
People who fit this description aren't small in number — Infowars has a healthy audience, needless to say — but they hardly represent the whole of America. But it's not surprising that they feel vindicated, as if they were a truly representative group instead of a small and paranoid minority. After all, they just conquered a political party, and if the mood in the air was any indication, they think their candidate is about to win the presidency.
The establishment media will be disappointed by statements made by FBI officials following the resignation of National Security Advisor Gen. Mike Flynn late Monday night. The bureau has signaled that Flynn will not be facing any charges for his communications with a Russian ambassador prior to Trump's inauguration.
FBI Director James Comey has revealed that shortly after Flynn took office, the FBI interviewed the advisor about his discussions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, which included references to the sanctions imposed by the Obama administration. However, the FBI underscored that the interview was simply part of the FBI's broader investigation into Russia's alleged attempt to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.
According to two of NBC's Pete William's unnamed sources, "the FBI doesn't believe Flynn will face legal jeopardy."
"One possible problem for Flynn is if he lied to FBI agents. But the people Williams spoke with don't believe this will be a problem," notes NBC News.
The "opposition" media believes they have Team Trump dead to rights on alleged collusion with the Russian government to steal the election from Hillary Clinton and other nefarious plots. However, as the New York Times' inuendo-filled hit piece published Tuesday admits, so far there is "no evidence of such cooperation" between Trump and his associates and the Russian government.
Though the Times says that its unnamed intelligence sources leaked information about the classified investigation to them suggesting that there is evidence that people affiliated with Trump and his campaign had contact with Russian agents, the paper admits the Trump affiliates could very well have done so "unwittingly" — something that happens often "in countries like Russia and Ukraine, where the spy services are deeply embedded in society."
Meanwhile, the Washington Free Beacon reported on Tuesday that their sources say the leaks against Flynn are a part of a concerted effort by "Obama loyalists" in the intelligence community to take Flynn down for fear of what he might reveal about Obama's Iran deal, about which he was openly critical. Sounds about right, but with all the "no evidence"-based allegations promulgated by the "opposition," the story is increasingly convoluted — which is likely part of the plan of those desperate to topple Trump.

Surgeons have found and removed an embryonic twin, complete with hair bone and teeth, from deep in the brain of a PhD computer science student.
Yamini Karanam 26, had been experiencing health problems for some time, including trouble with concentrating and reading, and eventually walking.
After seeing a series of neurologists and neurosurgeons across the United States she was diagnosed with a tumour on the pineal gland in her brain.
Miss Karanam, from Hyderabad, India, was studying at a college in Indiana.
"The neurologist would say the neurosurgeon is not being practical in your case. And the neurosurgeon would say the neurologist is not being optimistic in your case," she said. "And I'm like, could someone be educated about this?
"Months and weeks slipped through my fingers. There weren't any diagnostic procedures left to run. Consultations followed procedures but nobody said anything useful."
Her friends raised $32,000 which helped pay for surgery by Dr Hrayr Shahinian at the Skull Base Institute in Los Angeles, who performed radical keyholse surgery using fiber optic technology.
That allowed him to discover that she had a "teratoma" - a rare unborn twin - insider her.
Dr Shahinian said he had removed up to 8,000 brain tumours and it was only the second teratoma he had seen.
Miss Karanam told NBC she believed it was an "evil twin sister who's been torturing me for the past 26 years".
In 2009 Gavin Hyatt, a British plumber, had an embryonic twin spill out of his stomach.
Medics said the 4cm growth was a parasitic twin that had died in the womb early in their mother's pregnancy.
One of former President Barack Obama's pet projects -- to drag federal bureaucracy into the digital age -- morphed into a rogue operation that disregarded information security policies, used unauthorized software and information systems on government networks, and exposed sensitive information to potential hackers, according to a watchdog report.
Many of the most egregious security violations took place long after the Obama administration's 2014 admission of one of the worst cyber-security losses in history: the theft by China-based intruders of 4.2 million personnel files from its Office of Personnel Management -- a revelation that set off a wide-ranging review of all federal cybersecurity.
The report, issued Feb. 21 by the Inspector General's office of the General Services Administration (GSA), puts the spotlight on a runaway digital services operation known as 18F.
The unit was established in 2014 as part of Obama's Digital Government Strategy of 2012 -- and apparently made up its own information security rules as it went along, resulting, according to the report, in “widespread violations of fundamental GSA information technology security requirements.” Officials supervising the unit say those problems are now being fixed.
Subsequently, 18F became part of a broader high-tech initiative established the following year and known as the Technology Transformation Service within GSA, which is the services and facilities management pump at the center of the government's vast and sprawling bureaucracy.
Both 18F and the Technology Transformation Service were supposed to bring the outside-the-box thinking and whiz-kid talent of Silicon Valley to stodgy Washington; both grew out of yet another Obama initiative, the Presidential Innovation Fellows program established in 2012.
Originally focused on website and software development for government agencies, 18F fast grew into an in-house information services contractor for the federal bureaucracy, using GSA funds which were supposed to be repaid through fees to the new unit.
In April 2016, the Technology Transformation Service, with 18F included, was given a broader mandate to “transform the way government builds, buys and shares technology.”
By July, according to an earlier Inspector General's report, 18F was doing $31 million worth of business with 31 federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security.
However much money it made, however, 18F was losing more -- one of the original reasons the Inspector General's watchdogs got involved.
In an initial report last October, the IG's staffers warned that the hot-shot start-up had lost more than $31 million from its launch in 2014 through the third quarter of 2016 -- and had always been operating in the red, with revenue projections for its services running tens of millions of dollars ahead of actual revenues.
One major reason was ballooning staff rolls: 18F had grown from a 33-person start-up in April 2014 to more than 200 people by March 2016 -- a more than 500 percent increase.
That October IG report also quoted one 18F official as saying, “to be frank, there are some of us that don't give a rip about the losses” involved in its growth spurt. GSA's then-regional administrator for the West Coast, Andrew McMahon, is quoted in the October report as agreeing, “Sure, in the end, I could care less.” (According to his LinkedIn website, McMahon, who describes himself as a “co-founder of 18F,” left GSA in January 2017.)
CLICK HERE FOR THE OCTOBER REPORT
How 18F was running its fast-growing, money-losing business is a big part of the problem. According to the most recent IG report, one method was to ignore virtually all GSA information security safeguards for the wares it was encouraging agencies to buy. Those safeguards involve planning and testing unauthorized systems, then submitting a system security plan for review, and getting a signed authorization to operate that must be periodically reviewed.
According to the Inspector General's office, 18F just ignored all that, and “disregarded GSA IT [information technology] security policies for operating and obtaining information technology, and for using non-official email.”
The unit “also created and used its own set of guidelines for assessing and authorizing information systems that circumvented GSA IT” -- and short-circuited the information security of the GSA network.
In all, the watchdogs found, 100 of 116 software items on 18F's inventory of software were unauthorized, ranging from collaborative note-taking and data-sharing tools, to website monitoring tools and social media marketing dashboards. All were banned from GSA use by June 2016.
By that time, the watchdogs had already found out from 18F itself that unauthorized use of, among other things, another online messaging and collaboration app, Slack, had “potentially exposed sensitive information” over a five-month period ending in May. The breach involved “over 100 GSA Google Drives…reportedly accessible by users both inside and outside of GSA,” the watchdogs noted in an alert to GSA management.
The breach potential exposed such things as “personally identifiable information and contractor proprietary information,” the inspectors said. They issued a May 12 brief -- 2016 Management Alert Report -- as a warning flare about the data breach, with “recommendations” that GSA stop that practice.
CLICK HERE FOR THE MANAGEMENT ALERT REPORT
Even so, the alert noted, the 18F users waited five days to report the situation, which itself was another breach of info-security policy -- which says that one hour is the top limit for delay.
Compounding the issue, the report says that 18F's executive director and its director of infrastructure co-authored a blog post saying that they had done a “full investigation” of the breach issue, and declared that “to the best of our knowledge no sensitive information was shared inappropriately.”
By August, the Inspector General's investigators had found otherwise.
But, as the inspectors noted, “as of February 2, 2017, [presumably, the date when their report was finalized internally], the 18F blog post had not been updated” to reflect any of that.
A GSA spokesperson did not answer an email question from Fox News about whether the blog post had been removed or recanted. Instead, the spokesman declared that “GSA considers IT security a top priority and takes the GSA Inspector General's report seriously.
The spokesman added that the agency “notes that there were gaps in compliance with our CIO [Chief Information Officer] security requirements” but wanted to emphasize “that the issues raised” in the most recent report “were promptly addressed.”
It appears 18F was long used to working without much reference to GSA's Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), who was, among other things, supposed to sign off on all information systems' adherence to federal security policies.
According to the most recent report, no fewer than 18 information systems operated by 18F for more than a year ending in July 2016 lacked proper CISO authorizations for their use, and eleven of them had never been authorized. One system 18F was operating without required sign-off was “a recruitment and applicant tracking information system containing applicants' resumes and contact information.”
Rather than get security clearances from the CISO, 18F apparently had a better idea: make up its own information security assessment and authorization system.
In February 2015, the latest report says, 18F's then-Deputy Executive Director Aaron Snow -- who became executive director in May of that year -- proposed a new set of procedures titled, “Guidelines for Granting Authority to Operate 18F-Hosted Open Data Systems.” If approved, they would have allowed the unit to authorize the use of essentially public information systems without full security vetting.
The guidelines were not approved by GSA's information security brass. But in February 2015 18F began using them anyway, the report says.
How that came to be is apparently still something of a mystery.
According to the report, 18F's director of infrastructure told the watchdogs that “he received approval of the guidelines from Phaedra Chrousos, who at the time had oversight of 18F in her position as head of GSA's Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technologies (OCSIT).”
(OCSIT and 18F were both subsequently rolled into the new Technology Transfer Service, which Chrousos also headed, until she stepped down in July 2016.)
According to the report, “Chrousos told us that she remembered the director's request for her signed approval of the guidelines shortly after she became head of OCSIT in early 2015. She said she did not recall signing them, but probably would have done so.”
When the Inspector General's staffers asked the Technology Transfer Service to search “for any record of the guidelines,” the officials “told us that they could not verify the existence of the signed document.”
Using its own rules apparently still did not make things happen fast enough for 18F, so, according to the watchdog report, it also implemented a “pre-authorization” policy that allowed information systems it decided were “low-risk” to operate without any security assessment or subsequent OK.
To make things happen even quicker than that, 18F's director of infrastructure appointed himself as the 18F Information Systems Security Officer -- the person responsible for implementing the GSA rules that 18F was apparently already ignoring. The appointment was never revealed to the overall agency's CISO, who is responsible for appointing such officials.
Review of its business contracts was something else that 18F apparently felt was dispensable. According to the latest watchdog report, the renegade unit “entered into contracts and other agreements” for information technology purchases worth $24.8 million, and never got approval from GSA's Chief Information Officer, as required under a formal Memorandum of Agreement with the unit.
How did it all happen? Many of 18F's top brass and external supervisors claimed not to know.
According to the report, GSA regional administrator McMahon, who was also a GSA “Senior Technology Adviser,” told the watchdogs that “18F was not permitted any flexibility regarding compliance with GSA information technology policies.”
When the Inspector General's investigators asked 18F Executive Director Snow why there was a “breakdown” in 18F's info-tech security policy compliance, his reply was, “I honestly don't know.”
Former OCSIT head Chrousos told the Inspector General's staffers that “18F was not sufficiently integrated into the GSA IT environment,” but when asked how, as 18F's overseer, she had allowed the unit to operate without higher information security clearance, she “said that she is not an IT engineer and therefore left technical matters to the director of infrastructure.”
The Inspector General's staffers put much of the blame for the 18F debacle down to “management failures,” and they specifically pointed the finger at Chrousos and Snow in particular for failing “to provide adequate oversight and guidance to subordinates.”
“Ultimately,” their report says, “Chrousos' and Snow's indifference to GSA IT policies contributed to the compliance breakdown.”
Both Chrousos and Snow declined to respond to emailed Fox News questions about the report; in Snow's case, he said, due to urgent family matters. He had already told the Washington Post, however, that “this report is not about security. It's about compliance. And that's why government falls so far behind the rest of the world when it comes to technology.”
The Inspector General's report also blamed GSA's current Chief Information Officer, David Shrive -- who told them he was “not in a position” to see what 18F was doing before the May 2016 Management Alert Report -- for “failing to fulfill” his responsibilities for the agency's information technology security program.
CLICK HERE FOR THE MAY REPORT
Shive had not answered emailed questions from Fox News about the report by the time this story was published.
Both Chrousos and Snow have left their roles. Chrousos announced her departure as head of the Technology Transformation Service in June 2016, after just two months on the job, while Snow left 18F four months later.
The new head of the Technology Transformation Service, Rob Cook, told Fox News that the had already made substantial changes in the way his organization was operating.
In the past, he said, “there was less care taken about complying with the rules than in getting the work done. If we are going to transform government, we have to play by the rules while changing the rules.”
The organization that was supposed to bring dramatic change to the federal world of high-tech is now treating its role as “more of a partnership” -- especially with the bureaucracy's own legal and technology staff.
Among other things, Cook said, that means painstakingly seeking security OKs for all the high-tech tools it uses -- and not using them until the approvals are granted.

There was more horror in Syria over the weekend, where scores of bodies, most of them civilians, were discovered in a Damascus suburb. The victims are believed to have died in a weeklong offensive by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, who seems to have no misgivings whatever about a slaughter, including the use of airstrikes and missiles, that has claimed more than 70,000 lives so far during two-and-a-half years of war.
Long after Western governments predicted he would be gone, Mr. Assad is hanging on even as his country unravels, deepening sectarian divisions, expanding the fighting across borders and forcing an estimated one million Syrians to flee to neighboring countries. There are increasing fears about whether the country can hold together, whether the fighting will destabilize its neighbors and whether, when all is said and done, extremist groups with connections to Al Qaeda who have been among the best anti-Assad fighters will emerge on top.
Eager to find ways to speed Mr. Assad's fall, or at least change his calculations, President Obama is edging, cautiously but appropriately, toward greater support for the rebels. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Sunday that Washington would double aid to the opposition's military wing by providing an additional $123 million in “nonlethal” assistance like body armor and night-vision goggles. Some $385 million in humanitarian aid had already been committed.
The president has wisely resisted calls to supply American weapons and to intervene directly. He should continue to do so. Nevertheless, in recent months, the C.I.A. has helped Arab governments and Turkey airlift arms and equipment to the rebels and provided training. The agency also vetted rebel groups to ensure that only moderates receive those supplies.
Leave campaigners complain that EU-imposed fishing quotas are denying fishers their livelihood, and are anyway breached by foreign trawlers in British waters. Griffin Carpenter says some fishing communities have undoubtedly lost out, but the onus is on the British government to distribute the quota more fairly. He points out that fish stocks in European waters are rising thanks to the EU's intervention, and says the industry is in better shape overall than some claim.
It is indisputable that many ports and coastal communities around the UK have lost many of the boats and fishers that contributed so much to their coastal character. So where did all the fishers go? And what is the right policy response?
Any analysis of UK fisheries needs to begin with a history of overfishing because its legacy, and our continued struggle to end the problem, shapes much of fisheries management today. Massive fish hauls into the UK during the twentieth century depleted fish stocks such that fish populations could not reproduce as fast as they were being harvested. It is clear to us now that this practice would not be sustainable, but the data shows that landings had already begun declining in the first half of the century.
Figure 1. Landings of fish in Great Britain/UK (thousand tonnes) 1887-2014

The blue and red stars on the graph refer to UK ascension to the EU and the beginning of quota management under the EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). Hardly the start of the trend, but hardly a reversal either.
Yet inferring stock health from landings is indirect and the effect is delayed. Behind this trend and in our waters something different is happening. Despite widespread misconception, it is now the case that most commercial fish stocks in EU waters are actually increasing in size, with North Sea cod being the most prominent example. A decade ago the stock had nearly collapsed. With the exception of two world wars, this is likely the first time period in recorded history where fish stocks are increasing in size. Much of this is thanks to capping total quota amounts under the EU, which is also a key management feature of many successful fisheries around the world.
This trend in overfishing and decreased landings is clearly reflected in the number of fishers working in the UK. Another driver, at least as important, is that as is the case in many other industries, technological change has substituted capital for labour and resulted in a fishing fleet of fewer, but much larger, vessels. This technological change is why countries outside of the EU are experiencing a similar decline in fishers and small-scale ports. Norway, for example, is losing its fishers at a greater rate than the UK.

The recently released Brexit: The Movie spends a substantial portion of the film in the coastal community of North Shields discussing the topic of fisheries, but instead of overfishing and technological change, the focus of the segment is on the expansion of foreign trawlers in what are termed British waters.
The issue of how EU fishing quotas are split between member states has been covered elsewhere, but these shares of the total quota are based on the international principle of historic fishing patterns and are fixed percentages so quotas go up or down for all member states together. Contrary to the impression from the film, there is a similar decline of vessels and jobs in other member states as seen in the UK and for the exact same reasons:
Figure 3. Number of vessels by EU member state (1990-2015)
The irony of these claims is that the UK fishing industry is actually doing much better than the oft-accused EU member states. Profits in the UK industry continue to grow year after year and are the highest across the EU, as are profit margins. The level of investment in the industry, to buy new equipment, for example, is also growing and is the highest across the EU. Behind the headlines there's actually a great deal of financial confidence in the industry from fishers.
None of these denies the reality in North Shields. The port is mostly made up of small vessels, which unlike the large scale sector, is not seeing profits rise. The same situation exists in Appledore/Bideford, whose suffering featured in The Guardian, while the Belgian fleet supposedly thrives. But actually the Belgian fleet is unprofitable and shrinking.
While the total amount of quota is set at the EU level (negotiated by fishing ministers), it is up to the UK government to distribute that quota to its fleet. There is currently pressure on the UK government from various groups and our own research findings, to change quota allocation rules to preserve fishing in coastal communities like North Shields and address inequality in the fishing sector.
This issue of national rules is also relevant to the complaint of foreign vessels in our waters as some of these vessels that are actually registered and flagged in the UK and have purchased quotas from (willing) UK fishers. This practice would not change under Brexit and is the equivalent of blaming the EU for foreign ownership in the Premier league. Instead, if this foreign ownership is seen as an issue then it would be for the UK government to make laws about landing a certain percentage of catch in the UK, for example.
In a joint letter to The Times, a dozen fisheries experts and previous fisheries ministers called on George Eustice, the current fisheries minister, to stop pointing his finger at Europe and act now to change UK's quota allocation rules. If sustainable fishing jobs are to return to North Shields, this is the type of action that is required.

Veering off from speeches every so often to rant about drugs, cops and human rights, President Rodrigo Duterte has routinely uttered and rehashed falsehoods as if these were true.
VERA Files counted the most repeated false claims it has fact-checked this year and came up with the top five. Four of them were by the president.
1. Only the poor use shabu
Duterte's favorite false claim, uttered at least 22 times from July to December, was that shabu use is limited to the poor. Rich people, he said, smoke heroin or cocaine.
FACT
The latest Dangerous Drugs Board survey showed this claim has no statistical basis and that drug use cuts across all social classes.
2. Cannabis leads to a higher lung cancer risk
Duterte, reading a sheet of paper and attributing to a United Nations study, repeated this false claim at least eight times from October to November.
FACT
Duterte cherry-picked the findings of a UN study to support his claim even as the bulk of scientific evidence shows there is moderate evidence of no statistical association between cannabis smoking and lung cancer risk.
3. More and more cops and soldiers are killed daily in the drug war
Eight times from March to October, Duterte said the drug war is getting worse in terms of cops and soldiers killed, overstating his tally from “three to four” to “six to eight” daily.
FACT
Never did the president's count match the official figures, #RealNumbersPH, which gives a much lower tally: three law enforcers killed every 20 days in antidrug operations.
4. The Philippines' good human rights record at the United Nations
On at least seven occasions, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Presidential Communications Operations Office distorted facts about the Philippines' human rights report card at the United Nations.
These include a news story that claimed 95 nations were convinced that there are no extrajudicial killings in the Philippines. The story was later taken down.
FACT
At the third cycle of the Universal Periodic Review, 44 out of 95 countries expressed concern over deaths in the war on drugs, outnumbering eight countries that gave qualified support.
5. Davao City's ‘unprecedented' 9 percent growth rate
In at least seven speeches, Duterte said the economy of Davao, his peace and order model, grew 9 percent when he was mayor—a feat the president said no other city or province has ever achieved.
FACT
Wrong . From 2010 to 2015, Central Visayas and Zamboanga Peninsula posted growth rates higher than Davao's 9.3 percent.

Rob Cesternino talks with David Bloomberg, the founder of Reality News Online to discuss his strategy manifesto, “What Worlds Apart Survivors Definitely SHOULD Have Known by Now”.
Preamble
Survivor contestants who are about to play should watch multiple seasons for perspective, not just the most recent one. There are more ways to win than the way that just worked for the latest Sole Survivor, and what worked for them will not work for everyone. Because all of the seasons are now available online, it is easier than ever to watch them and upcoming contestants have no excuse for not watching at least four seasons in preparation.
Rule One: “Scheme and plot”
Politicking and alliance-making are what the game is all about, not fishing and hunting. Players should make alliances right away, even if they don't know who to trust yet, or else they might get voted out early. These initials bonds can be made based on whatever relationships present themselves, such as a shared profession or home state. Players should not be pushy while trying to make alliances, but instead look out for opportunities to make alliances. On the flip side, players should always say yes if asked to be part of an alliance.
Other facets of this rule include:
having the numbers is more important than aligning with friends
keeping an eye on the pecking order and flipping if not near the top
pretending to be a loyal part of an alliance before flipping
keeping options open as to who to forward with
Sandra's “anybody but me” strategy makes a person without allies an easy choice to be voted out
Rule Two: “Don't scheme and plot too much”, or “Keep scheming secret and don't backstab until you need to”
The first part of this rule is to not scheme with everyone, especially as an outsider to an alliance.
Another part is if a player is the swing vote, they should just say yes to both alliances so they alliances are comfortable which way they're going to vote.
Third, players should never let another contestant know that they're going to vote them out. After they are voted out it is okay to be nice to them, but if alerted to the plan they can plot a counter-attack. This sub-rule is broken less frequently now that players are more likely to want to pull off blindsides.
A guiding principle behind this rule is that playing Survivor is like performing magic tricks: a player needs to misdirect the other players during the game and believably articulate how they pulled it off to the jury. While players want to keep their plotting secret, they don't want to keep it so secret that someone else can take all the credit for it. Conversely, during the game players should try to allow their alliance members to think they are making the decisions.
Some final points about Rule Two include:
not forming an obvious couple or duo, which become easy targets
not forcing people to talk openly about strategy
not forbidding people from talking about strategy at all
Rule Three: “Be flexible”
Players cannot simply tie themselves to one alliance and hope it survives. Good players always have back-up alliances, sub-alliances, and side alliances. This helps players both to be safe if their alliance is getting picked off and to avoid placing second or third against a member of their own alliance.
Another way that players need to be flexible is by going with the flow, especially in the pre-merge portion of the game. While it is okay to suggest priorities that are different than what the majority of the tribe wants, such as making a shelter over making fire or vice versa, players should read the room and not push the issue.
Rule Four: “Don't let your emotions control you”
Players are playing with strangers, people who are to be used as pawns in a game and they never have to see again. For this reason, they do not need to become friends for life. While players make friends on the island, good players can cut those friends when the time is right.
On the flip side of not letting friendship control a player's game, not letting anger be in control is also important. While some players let their anger get in the way of their game, better players remain objective and put aside anger to enact their strategies. Relatedly, it benefits players to just be nice, even when the other person bothers them. Regarding challenges, players should keep their emotions in check whether they win or lose.
Another related rule is to keep political and religious views private, as voicing them may alienate tribe members. A qualification to this rule is when the rest of the tribe is outwardly religious, it benefits a player to pretend to be religious even if they are not.
All of the parts of this rule speak to people wanting to vote out people who make them feel uncomfortable, and players shouldn't give others an extra reason to vote them out.
Rule 5: Pretend to Be Nice/Play the Social Game (and Keep Your Politics and Controversial Beliefs to Yourself)
As you're making alliances, you have to pretend to be nice and play the full social game. Much of the social game comes into play right off the boat when everyone is looking for a reason to vote someone off. You need to continue to play it but it may not show its rewards again until the very end, if you're still around to beg for votes to win.
In general, people aren't going to ally themselves with you if they think you're a jerk or you're untrustworthy. Or, maybe worse, you'll make it to the end and then the jury tell you to shove off – as they did to Russell Hantz TWICE and then Sash right afterwards. Compare that to the way J.T. was so nice that people didn't mind that he had stabbed them in the back. So there can be a lot to be said for simply putting on the nice face.
The issue of politics and controversial beliefs hasn't come up much in recent seasons, but looking back to older seasons, we saw Frank in Africa talking about gun control and the liberal media, and Peter in Marquesas with his holey yoga that made people think he was a fruit loop.
Rule Six: “Don't be too much of a threat”
Players are often voted out for possessing the qualities that others perceive will help them win the game. While a person being physically strong is a threatening quality after the merge because that person may win immunities, being physically weak is a threatening quality pre-merge because that person may result in a tribe going to tribal council. A guideline is to vote out strong physical threats once they start winning immunity. Also, some players are threats because they aren't perceived as individual immunity threats, giving them an easier time of making it to the end. Game knowledge can also be seen as a threat. While it can be good to talk about the game with other fans, it is hard to know who is fan without giving away viewership habits and non-fans may want to vote out players who know more about the game.
Overall, this rule demonstrates that Survivor is a backwards game. Players must “Outwit, Outplay, and Outlast”, but not too well or they well get voted out. They must suck, but not suck too much or else they won't win.
Rule Seven: “Vote out the weak, then the strong, then weak, then strong”
First, vote out the weak players in the pre-merge game. These include tribe members who are challenge liabilities as well as tribe members who cause discord in the tribe. Keeping either of these types of players will result in more visits to tribal council.
Second, vote out the strong players who are not fellow alliance members in the beginning of the merge. These include physical threats as well as social organizers.
Third, vote out the unaligned weak players. If these players are not voted out, they can worm their way into alliance cracks or get picked up to form a new alliance. However, if a player is on the bottom of the alliance they should use the unaligned weak players to take control of the game.
Last, get rid of are nonessential alliances members, starting with the ones who are not keeping the alliance together. However, depending on how the alliance is structured and who is left, it might be better to switch the order of the last two voting strategies.
Whichever way the vote goes down, it should be a player's goal to be thought of better than anyone else in the Final Tribal Council. This preference could mean being more respected or more well-liked.
First Appendix: “Do whatever it takes to get idols”
Idols are ridiculously easy to find. Having idol provides a safety net and takes away the chance of anyone else having one. While players have to know when to use idols, production will often hide new idols.
Final Appendix: Final Tribal Council
A simple way for players to improve their chances in front of the jury is to just be nice. Also, it is important for players to take the right opponents with them to the Final Tribal Council and know who they are going to face. Bringing a goat or two to the finals is a good move.
In their Final Tribal Council, players need to own their game. The jury does not want to hear apologies. Instead, tell them what they want to hear. General statements, such as the non-apology “if I made you mad, I'm sorry”, are not effective, while specific apologies to individuals are good if that is what the jury member asks for. Because a player can't decide how the jury votes, they need to listen to and adjust to the jury without pandering. It is also important to respect the jury and not tell them off.

Flatters to deceive: Arsenal's midfielder Mesut Ozil (Picture: AFP/Getty Images)
Michael Owen has stuck the boot into Arsenal's title credentials and claims record signing Mesut Ozil is too inconsistent to lead the Gunners to glory.
Arsenal currently sit two points clear at the top of the table with a difficult festive fixture list ahead, and the former Liverpool and Manchester United striker believes the Gunners are enjoying a false dawn under the £42million German.
‘Arsenal don't have the class of player to go toe to toe with the main title contenders,' Owen said on his ‘half-term report' blog on sport social network Sportlobster.
‘Despite people constantly telling me Mesut Ozil is world class, his inconsistency means that we only see occasional glimpses of real quality.
‘His odd good performance is usually followed by half a dozen poor ones.'

‘Liverpool are fully deserving of being labelled title contenders,' he added.
‘The Reds are firmly back in the big time. The noises I am hearing are that Rodgers has money to spend this coming window and should he unearth another couple of gems, I certainly wouldn't back against them lifting some silverware come May.'

Rather mysteriously, a trademark application for Virtual Boy surfaced on the European Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market database yesterday.
It is listed as "9, 28" under its "Nice Classification", which we can only assume is very nice indeed.
This interest from Nintendo could very well be the company considering Virtual Boy titles for the 3DS Virtual Console, or perhaps even as additions to the long-forgotten Nintendo 3D Classics series.
The Virtual Boy was the ill-fated "portable" console from Nintendo Mother Brain, and father of the Game Boy, Gunpei Yokoi.
The system fizzled out after users complained about dizziness, nausea, and headaches after using the system for short sessions.
Stand-out titles for the Virtual Boy include Wario Land, Mario's Tennis, and Red Alarm.
Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS puzzler Polarium was also treated to some trademarkery, but the safest bet for the moment is to assume this will be the GBA title heading to the Wii U Virtual Console.
Much grats, Nintendo Everything.
With Mountain Lion just around the corner, can Apple think up more big cats to name their releases after?
OS X is full of little design touches that have redefined what people expect from a personal computer, and which complement Apple hardware.
In fact, you can't (legally) install the operating system on anything but a Mac, so the two are forever entwined - and that gives Apple advantages that other computer manufacturers simply don't have.
With Apple's latest MacBook Air, for example, you'll find special keys on the keyboard that link specifically to new functions in OS X Lion, such as Mission Control. It's not a case of style over substance, either. OS X - Apple subtly dropped the 'Mac' from its name in 2011, indicating that it's destined for more than just computers - is all about functionality.
See this functionality in our OS X walk-through video:
"We wanted to make this the dream user interface for somebody who has never touched a computer before, and that's really hard to do," said ex-Apple CEO Steve Jobs when he introduced Mac OS X 10.0 to the adoring Apple faithful for the very first time at Macworld Expo in San Francisco, January 2000.
Join us as we explore the world's most beautiful operating system and find out how Apple created it.
How OS X evolved
From the outset Apple had one goal in mind when OS X was designed, and that was to make the next great personal computer operating system.
The company wanted it to be the kind of operating system with which a beginner could feel intuitively at home, and a pro user could be taken to places they'd never thought they'd be. That's a tall order, but eight major versions, millions of sales and a decade later, we think Apple did it.
OS X 10 was launched with a new interface called Aqua. It was named after water because one of the original designers said it looked so good that "when you saw it you wanted to lick it!" It was certainly revolutionary compared to what people had seen before.
The ideas behind OS X - in fact, the concept for windows, menus, pointers and so on themselves - go way back to 1979, when Steve Jobs was admitted to the research centre Xerox PARC for a sneak peek at the world's first ever GUI (Graphical User Interface), in exchange for some Apple stock options.
Bear in mind that at the time all computers used text input - there were no windows, no colours and no mouse to move a cursor around with. What the young Mr Jobs saw, in his own words, was "mind-blowing"; he realised instantly that this was the way that all computers would work one day.
Inspired by that glimpse into the future he launched the Apple Lisa in 1983, which, while not the first commercial computer to feature a GUI, was certainly one of the earliest. In 1984 the Macintosh 128K was unveiled to the public, and the rest, as they say, is history.
OS X itself actually started life outside of Apple, as part of the NeXTSTEP project developed by Steve Jobs during his tenure at NeXT, the company he'd founded after being booted out of Apple in 1985. While still at the company, Jobs had tried to create a next-generation operating system, but had met with little success.
When he was forced out by the Apple board he was free to try again, but this time without being weighed down by all the old problems he'd experienced while at Apple, a company which was suffering from a huge slump in sales at the time.
The next step
While the NeXT Computer was never a success, the operating system showed promise and Jobs was brought back into the Apple fold in 1996 when Apple acquired NeXT for $429 million. NeXTSTEP, now called OpenStep, came with him.
In 2000 Apple, perhaps with nothing left to lose, decided to scrap the existing code base of its operating system, then called OS 9, and introduce a radical new operating system called OS X. OpenStep formed the basis of the OS X operating system we know and love today.
The first version of OS X was codenamed Cheetah, and this tradition of naming each release after a big cat continued with 10.1 Puma, 10.2 Jaguar, 10.3 Panther, 10.4 Tiger, 10.5 Leopard, 10.6 Snow Leopard and now 10.7 Lion.
In the late 80s Microsoft famously aped the look and feel of the Mac with Windows 3.1, and the two companies kept improving their operating systems in an effort to outdo each other. It was a battle that Microsoft was destined to win, but while Windows won the desktop battle largely through sheer force of numbers, it looks like Apple is going to win the tablet war.
After all, OS X forms much of the basis of the iOS touch-screen operating system that runs on the iPhone and iPad, and when the dust finally settles it could well be that Apple will be the dominant force in this area for years and years to come.
Design touches
An operating system is defined by the little things like buttons, radio buttons, tickboxes (or in the American lingo, checkboxes), pop-up lists, sliders, windows, scroll bars and transparency; but it's not only about how things look, it's also about how they behave.
The Dock, for example, has been a defining feature of OS X since the beginning, but has improved in usability along the way; Finder became more visual with Cover Flow; Snow Leopard seamlessly integrated Time Machine; and Lion gave us full-screen apps.
The watery feel of the Aqua interface that debuted in OS X 10.0 has certainly been through many changes over the last ten years. Cast your eyes over the screen shots on these pages and you'll see how a more reserved grey, slate-like colour scheme that reached its peak in Lion has gradually been replacing the colourful look of the original Aqua interface.
This is fitting; when OS X was launched, the iMac range was full of colour and transparency, and the colourful clamshell iBook (a precursor to today's MacBook) was just around the corner.
As Apple's Mac design has become more streamlined and professional, so has OS X. Indeed, today's OS X 10.7 Lion matches the look and feel of the unibody aluminium MacBook Pro down to the colouring - and rarely in the history of computing has there been such a winning combination of hardware and software.
Ten years of OS X
1. Mac OS X 10.0
Codename: Cheetah
Released: 24 March 2001
This was the first version of OS X that the public got their hands on. As you'd expect it was far from perfect; it was often sluggish, it crashed frequently and lacked basic features. Hardware compatibility was also a problem, but nevertheless the seeds of a great operating system were sown.
2. Mac OS X 10.1
Codename: Puma
Released: 25 September 2001
Puma was offered as a free update to Cheetah users, and went a long way towards fixing the problems with that release. It was faster, enabled DVD playback and supported 200 printers by default, but the system still felt sluggish to use, so most Mac users continued running OS 9.
3. Mac OS X 10.2
Codename: Jaguar
Released: 24 August 2002
Things started to look up for OS X with Jaguar, and many people considered it to be the first usable release. Mail got a spam filter and the ability to network with Windows computers was improved. This was also the first time the 'big cat' codename was used publicly by Apple, rather than as just an internal company name.
4. Mac OS X 10.3
Codename: Panther
Released: 24 October 2003
With Panther, Apple started to drop support for its older Macs - beige G3 and 'Wallstreet' PowerBook G3s were no longer supported, and iChat required a 333MHz processor to use video chat. OS X now came with its own web browser, Safari, but it was criticised for being too simplistic.
5. Mac OS X 10.4
Codename: Tiger
Released: 29 April 2005
Tiger introduced many of the OS X features that we know and love today: Spotlight, Dashboard and Smart Folders, for example. In January 2006, when Apple began using Intel chips in its hardware rather than PowerPC, a 4.4 update to Tiger meant the operating system now worked on both platforms.
6. Mac OS X 10.5
Codename: Leopard
Released: 26 October 2007
The last edition of Mac OS X to support PowerPC chips, this saw the introduction of many key features such as Stacks, a shelf for the Dock, Time Machine for easy backup and Boot Camp for installing Windows on a Mac. The latter caused much grumbling among old-school Mac users, who were aghast at the thought.
7. Mac OS X 10.6
Codename: Snow Leopard
Released: 28 August 2009
While it introduced few new features, Snow Leopard contained many changes under the skin of OS X, future-proofing the OS and adding support for Exchange. It was also the first 64-bit version of the operating system, which meant developers could make more powerful programs for OS X.
8. OS X 10.7
Codename: Lion
Released: 20 July 2011
This was the first download-only version of OS X to be released by Apple. It had many features inspired by the iPadOS - particularly Launchpad, full-screen apps for more focused working and a new array of gestures to use with your trackpad. It also removed a lot of the colour from the interface.
10. OS X 10.8
Codename: Mountain Lion
Released: Due Summer 2012
Building on the base of Lion, Mountain Lion is schedule for release in Summer 2012 and will see several new additions including a unified messaging client for iMessages and iChat conversations called Messages, Notification Centre, Reminders and Notes, which function like their iOS equivalents, and AirPlay.

The U.S. economy hits the highest pace of growth in three years, mostly buoyed by a surge in business investments.
According to the second estimate of U.S. GDP, the economy saw the fastest rate of growth in three years, surpassing expectations. This highlights the economy's resilience toward devastating events like the recent hurricanes. The strength largely comes from vigorous business spending on equipment, a rebound in corporate profits and solid government spending.
Notably, unemployment in the United States is at a 17-year low. Consumer confidence hit a new 17-year high on Nov 28, indicative of a solid holiday season ahead. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of the GDP, showed impressive growth. But, the figure came in lower than expected. This lag was made up by a surge in business investment.
Taking these bullish factors into account, we suggest you place your bet on consumer discretionary and business equipment stocks.
GDP Growth Highest in 3 Years
According to the second estimate, U.S. GDP expanded at 3.3% in the third quarter of 2017, marking the fastest pace of growth since the third quarter of 2014. Per a report by the Commerce Department, consumer spending advanced 2.3% in 3Q17.
However, the biggest boost to the economy came from spending on business equipment, which shot up 10.4% in the period, the highest in three years. Business investment contributed as much as 1.2% toward the U.S. GDP. Further, transportation spending and outlays on software increased in the third quarter.
In her final testimony on Capitol Hill on Nov 29, Janet Yellen commented that economic growth is largely broad based “across sectors as well as across much of the global economy.” However, price data in the GDP report clearly indicated that inflation remained well below the targeted 2%. However, the figures have been largely in line with President Trump's goal to boost economic annual growth rate to 3%. This also makes it easier for members of the GOP to implement tax reforms under such economic conditions.
Consumer Confidence Highest, Unemployment Lowest in 17 Years
In October, consumer confidence increased from an upwardly revised level of 126.2 to 129.5, exceeding the estimated mark of 123.9. This is the highest since the reading of 132.6 recorded in November 2000. It also improves on last month's initial reading of 125.9, which was, at the time, the highest level in 17 years.
During the fifth straight month of gains, the present situations index advanced from 152 to 153.9 while the expectations index increased from 109 to 113.3. A large part of this optimism can be attributed to consumer view on the job market. The section of consumers who expect job openings to increase over the next few months increased from 18.7% to 22.6% in November.
Moreover, the job market has been going from strength to strength in recent months. In October, the United States created 261,000 jobs in October while the unemployment rate declined from 4.2% to 4.1%, marking a 17-year low. (Read More)
Top 5 Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy Now
The U.S. economy surged to its best level since 2014, primarily driven by rise in business investment. Moreover, consumer confidence improved indicating higher propensity by consumers to spend on luxury goods.
Further, consumer confidence is at a 17-year high whereas the unemployment is at a 17-year low. This in turn can be attributed to a robust job market. This is why there are ample of reasons to invest in consumer discretionary and business equipment stocks as of now.
With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have zeroed in on four stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and other relevant metrics. A favorable Zacks Rank indicates that these stocks have been witnessing positive estimate revisions, which generally translate into rapid price appreciation. The search was also narrowed down with a VGM Score of A or B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.

Reimu Hakurei was thinking about Sanae Kochiya again. Sanae was a nonplussed melon with small butt and big hair.
Reimu walked over to the window and reflected on her cold surroundings. She had always hated foggy Misty Lake with its late, lovely lake. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel lewd.
Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the nonplussed figure of Sanae Kochiya.
Reimu gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a majestic, tricky, tea drinker with long butt and short hair. Her friends saw her as a prickly, plain potato. Once, she had even helped a prickly little fairy cross the road.
But not even a majestic person who had once helped a prickly little fairy cross the road, was prepared for what Sanae had in store today.
The rain hammered like prancing mermaid, making Reimu scared. Reimu grabbed a clunky stick that had been strewn nearby; she massaged it with her fingers.
As Reimu stepped outside and Sanae came closer, she could see the sweet glint in her eye.
Sanae gazed with the affection of 2340 sparkly smoggy snowmen. She said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want her delicious."
Reimu looked back, even more scared and still fingering the clunky stick. "Sanae, you got cheeseburgers in those gloves of yours," she replied.
They looked at each other with aggressive feelings, like two weak, wandering wolf bouncing at a very careful vacation, which had metal music playing in the background and two uncles nomming to the beat.
Reimu regarded Sanae's small butt and big hair. "I feel the same way!" revealed Reimu with a delighted grin.
Sanae looked maliicious, her emotions blushing like a big, burnt ball.
Then Sanae came inside for a nice cup of tea.

After Sunday night's 40-7 win over the Panthers, Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson learned that safety Earl Thomas had broken his leg during the game. Wilson also learned that Thomas already had mused on Twitter about retiring.
Wilson brushed off the retirement talk as Thomas reacting in the heat of the moment. A day later, however, Thomas is singing the same tune.
“I'm taking it one day at a time,” Thomas told Ed Werder of ESPN. “I still feel the same way I felt last night.”
Thomas also said that he doesn't plan to have surgery, and that he doesn't want to take away from what his team is trying to do.
“You have to remember my team is still fighting I don't want to become a distraction,” Thomas said.
Thomas may feel differently as days become weeks and weeks become months. By the time the offseason program begins, he may be itching for more action.
If Thomas retires, he'd owe the Seahawks $3.8 million in bonus money previously paid, if they'd be inclined to pursue it.
The Prescribers What Doctors Are Prescribing
In 2012, Medicare's massive prescription drug program didn't spend a penny on popular tranquilizers such as Valium, Xanax and Ativan.
The following year, it doled out more than $377 million for the drugs.

While it might appear that an epidemic of anxiety swept the nation's Medicare enrollees, the spike actually reflects a failed policy initiative by Congress.
More than a decade ago, when lawmakers created Medicare's drug program, called Part D, they decided not to pay for anti-anxiety medications. Some of these drugs, known as benzodiazepines, had been linked to abuse and an increased risk of falls and fractures among the elderly, who make up most of the Medicare population.
But doctors didn't stop prescribing the drugs to Medicare enrollees. Patients just found other ways to pay for them. When Congress later reversed the payment policy under pressure from patient groups and medical societies, it swiftly became clear that a huge swath of Medicare's patients were already using the drugs despite the lack of coverage.
In 2013, the year Medicare started covering benzodiazepines, it paid for nearly 40 million prescriptions, a ProPublica analysis of recently released federal data shows. Generic versions of the drugs — alprazolam (which goes by the trade name of Xanax), lorazepam (Ativan) and clonazepam (Klonopin) — were among the top 32 most-prescribed medications in Medicare Part D that year.
And it appears these were not new prescriptions.
IMS Health, a healthcare analytics company that tracks drug sales nationwide, logged only a tiny increase in all benzodiazepine prescriptions, including those covered by Medicare, from 2012 to 2013. That probably means Medicare paid mostly for refills of existing prescriptions, said Michael Kleinrock, director of research for the IMS Institute.
That millions of seniors are taking Xanax, Ativan and other tranquilizers represents a very real safety concern, said Dr. Brent Forester, a geriatric psychiatrist at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass.
The drugs are popular because they are fast-acting — working quickly, for example, to quell debilitating panic attacks. But they can be habit-forming and disorienting and their effects last longer in older patients. For that reason, the American Geriatrics Society discourages their use in seniors for agitation, insomnia or delirium. The group says they may be appropriate to treat seizure disorders, severe anxiety, withdrawal and in end-of-life care.
Forester said he and others who specialize in geriatric psychiatry don't use benzodiazepines as a “first-, second- or third-line treatment because we see more of the downside than the good side.”
Some geriatric psychiatrists worry that doctors may have turned to the drugs in place of antipsychotic medications to sedate patients with conditions such as dementia. In the past several years, Medicare has pushed to reduce the use of antipsychotics, particularly in nursing homes, because of strong warnings about their risks.
In 2013, Medicare covered more prescriptions for benzodiazepines than for antipsychotics.
“At the end of the day,” Forester said, “in terms of risk, the risk with benzodiazepines seems so much worse to me … There's significant danger and there's no spotlight.”
A spokeswoman at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services declined to answer questions about Medicare's suddenly soaring tab for benzodiazepines.
Some doctors who ranked among Medicare's top prescribers of the drugs said any risks were outweighed by their benefits.
Fall River, Mass., psychiatrist Claude Curran wrote more than 11,700 prescriptions for benzodiazepines (including refills) in 2013, ranking him behind only four other doctors, all from Puerto Rico. He said the drugs worked well for his patients, many of whom are trying to kick addictions to narcotics but struggle with anxiety and depression.
“First of all, they're reliable,” he said. “Second of all, they're cheap because they're all generic … They tickle the brain in the same way alcohol does.”
Without benzodiazepines, he added, patients in recovery often need higher doses of methadone, which carries significant risks of its own. “Anyone who's ever had a panic attack is sympathetic to the use of the benzos,” Curran said. “Anyone who has never had a panic attack doesn't understand it.”
Medicare Part D Totals by the Numbers, 2013 35.1M Beneficiaries with Part D Claims 1.4B Prescriptions (Including Refills) $103.4B Retail Price of All Prescriptions 1.3M Number of Prescribers 39 Average Prescriptions Per Beneficiary $75.52 Average Retail Price of a Prescription 47% Portion of Claims to Patients Receiving Low-Income Subsidy 10.4 Average Prescriptions Per Patient, Per Provider* Notes: Counts include initial prescriptions and refills dispensed. Retail price includes patients' out-of-pocket costs but does not reflect drugmaker rebates. Average prescriptions per patient, per provider has been adjusted to give more weight to doctors who treat more patients. (The unadjusted average is 5.7).
The vast majority of Curran's Medicare patients were younger than 65 and qualified for coverage based on a disability. Disabled patients made up about a quarter of Part D's 35 million enrollees in 2013, but used benzodiazepines disproportionately, accounting for about half of all prescriptions.
Miami psychiatrist Rigoberto Rodriguez also ranked high among Medicare prescribers of benzodiazepines, writing 9,900 prescriptions in 2013, but most of his patients were seniors. Many, he said, are Cuban immigrants who experienced traumas that left them with lingering anxiety, and they have been taking the drugs for years.
Rodriguez readily acknowledged the risks of the drugs for elderly users — recently, researchers found that the longer a person took benzodiazepines, the higher his or her risk of being diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease. The drugs' labels say they are generally for short-term use but many patients take them for years.
Rodriguez said he has been working to reduce his benzodiazepine prescriptions in light of emerging research. He expects that when Medicare releases data for 2014 and 2015, his totals will be lowed.

Experts say combining the two increase the risk of overdoses. State # of Doctors FL 158 AL 136 KY 102 TN 84 TX 71 GA 71 NC 60 CA 49 OH 49 VA 45 (Charles Ornstein and Ryann Grochowski Jones, ProPublica)
“This is fresh information coming out in the last couple years … telling us that benzos are probably not good and you should try to avoid them,” Rodriguez said. “I totally agree with that.”
Roberto Hernando, another Miami psychiatrist who wrote high numbers of benzodiazepine prescriptions in 2013, said he intends to review his prescribing after a reporter told him his totals.
“Some people may need it; some people may not,” he said. “You're bringing to my attention something that I wasn't even aware of.”
When Congress created Medicare's drug program in 2003, there wasn't much discussion about whether it should cover benzodiazepines.
They were on a larger list of drugs excluded for coverage, along with barbiturates, fertility drugs, and drugs for weight loss and cosmetic purposes. The list mirrored one from a law years earlier allowing states to voluntarily exclude certain drugs from Medicaid programs for the poor. (Medicare now also pays for barbiturates.)
Andrew Sperling, director of federal legislative advocacy for National Alliance on Mental Illness, said it's unclear why Congress made the exclusions mandatory for Medicare when they had only been voluntary for Medicaid. He believes it was a drafting error.
IMS Health data suggests that while the Medicare ban was in effect, seniors and disabled patients paid for benzodiazepines in other ways. Many paid out of pocket for the relatively inexpensive drugs, which can cost less than $10 for a 30-day supply. Some, particularly those with disabilities, qualified for state Medicaid programs, which continued to cover the drugs even though they didn't have to. Another set of patients chose Medicare Advantage plans that offered the drugs as an added benefit.
Dr. Michael Ong, an associate professor at UCLA, co-authored a 2012 paper concluding that many patients continued using benzodiazepines after Congress banned coverage in Medicare Part D and that some turned to more powerful psychiatric drugs.
Most-Prescribed Benzodiazepines Below are the most-prescribed benzodiazepines in 2013 in Medicare's prescription drug program.

“Just mandating something and saying we're not going to pay for the benzodiazepines is probably not the right type of policy solution to change the behaviors of both the providers who are providing these medications and also the patients who are using them,” Ong said.
A worrisome aspect of the newly released data is that some doctors appear to be prescribing benzodiazepines and narcotic painkillers to the same patients, increasing the risk of misuse and overdose. The drugs, paired together, can depress breathing.
ProPublica found that this pattern was most common in southeastern states, which struggle with opioid abuse and overdoses. In 2013, 158 doctors in Florida wrote at least 1,000 prescriptions each for opioids and for benzodiazepines, tops in the nation. Alabama, Kentucky and Tennessee also had unusually high numbers of doctors who often prescribed both narcotics and benzodiazepines. The data does not indicate if the prescriptions were given to the same patients, although that prospect worries experts.
Dr. Leonard J. Paulozzi, a medical epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, co-authored an analysis showing that benzodiazepines were involved in about 30 percent of the fatal narcotic overdoses that occurred nationwide in 2010.
“It increases the possibility of overdoses,” he said.

This is a 24inch road frame with 650c velocity deep V's on it. I built this bike for my little brother pictured. I know its a little big but its about the smallest i could make it while still giving him some sweet looking wheels. Added blue soma seat from american cyclery in SF, metallic blue KMS chain and some blue oury grips on some cut straight bars from the Hub. Next i will change out the pedals once i can find some nice blue track ones that fit the small bolt diameter on the crank. Also plan on adding blue frogs on the hubs for some cool lighting plus safety. original cranks and the frame is an early 80s steel schwinn. Sanded by the little guy whos only 8 riding a fixie brakeless! painted by me with some shake cans turned out pretty well in my eyes and especially his!
Thanks for all the inspiration on this site i have a lot more bikes already built i will be submiting!
Feel free to email me if you are interested in getting some rides together in the greater sacramento area!
You won't find them on eBay, and they're too big for a standard garage sale. But with tunneling complete on the Spadina subway extension to Vaughan, the TTC is looking to unload four giant tunnel-boring machines, each weighing the equivalent of about 280 cars.
Workers view the beginning of the Spadina Subway extension following the launch of tunnel boring in June 2011. The four boring machines have now completed their work and are destined to be sold off. ( LUCAS OLENIUK / TORONTO STAR )
There is no new transit line that the machines can immediately begin tunneling, and the technology will be dated by the time the Bloor-Danforth extension breaks ground at least five years from now. The giant borers for the six-stop Spadina extension were purchased for $58 million from Lovat Inc., a Toronto company. Lovat was bought out by heavy equipment giant Caterpillar, which announced earlier this year it is getting out of the tunnel-boring machine business. Even if the TTC stored the machines — affectionately christened Yorkie, Torkie, Holey and Moley — there wouldn't be any service support for them, said TTC spokesman Brad Ross.

“We'll sell them to the highest bidder who can use them immediately,” he said, adding that he had no idea what the machines could go for. The machines used on Sheppard were sold to two construction companies in Russia for $2.5 million each. They couldn't be used on Spadina because the tunnel needed a slightly larger radius to accommodate a curve on the newest subway line. The Eglinton-Scarborough Crosstown tunnel being built by Metrolinx is wider still. Completion of the Spadina tunnel at Vaughan Metropolitan Centre last month marked the end of one phase of the $2.6-billion project, which is being funded jointly by Ottawa, Queen's Park, Toronto and York Region. But the subway is far from complete. Now the stations, the track and signalling system have to be built. The line won't be in service until late 2016.

These Manny Pacquiao fights in Macau are not just a one-shot, or even a two-shot, deal. As long as Pacquiao remains a top draw, expect the Filipino legend and boxing's only eight-division world titleholder to fight in the Chinese gambling capital annually for the foreseeable future.
That is what Top Rank promoter Bob Arum said recently on the subject as Pacquiao (56-5-2, 38 KOs) prepares for his second fight at the Cotai Arena at the Venetian Macao, where he will defend his welterweight title against junior welterweight titlist Chris Algieri (20-0, 8 KOs) on Nov. 22 (HBO PPV).
Last November, Pacquiao fought there for the first time, easily outpointing Brandon Rios in a nontitle bout. Pacquiao returned to Las Vegas for a rematch with Timothy Bradley Jr. in April, won a clear decision and reclaimed his welterweight belt.
Now it's off to Macau again to defend the title, even though the pay-per-view numbers for the last overseas fight were off considerably (only 475,000), prompting HBO to say it did not want to go to Macau for another Pacquiao pay-per-view.
But Arum had the final say: If HBO wants to be in business with Pacquiao, which it does, then Macau is where the cameras will be.
“Who are they to say anything when it is my money,” said Arum, who is the one taking the risk on the event. “It's Manny's career, and we are fighting in probably the best location in the world, which is in Macau in the Cotai Arena, which is a tremendous place to watch a fight live.”
Arum, who has done several cards in Macau over the past couple of years in partnership with the Venetian, said the money generated in Asia more than makes up for selling fewer pay-per-views in the United States. He said Venetian officials want Pacquiao to fight there regularly and have made it worth their while.
“They said to me they wanted Manny to fight there once a year,” Arum said. “So, obviously, if Manny fights twice a year, he fights there in the fall and in the spring he fights either in the United States or some other place.”
EDMONTON—Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland says North Korea's nuclear program poses a “grave threat” to the security of the world and called on the country to fall into line with the international community. Freeland said Canada stands by allies like the United States when they are threatened but ways must be found to de-escalate the situation, which has been marked by North Korean missile tests and heated rhetoric from the country's leader Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump.

“We need to find ways to pressure and persuade North Korea that the path that it is on ... this path can have no positive ending for North Korea,” she said following a meeting with agricultural groups in Edmonton on Friday. “This is a grave situation. It is a grave threat. ... It's time for North Korea to really cease its actions.” Freeland's remarks came as Trump delivered another warning to Pyongyang that the U.S. military is “locked and loaded” if the regime acts unwisely. Trump doubled down on the tough talk later Friday.

“If he utters one threat in the form of an overt threat — which by the way he has been uttering for years and his family has been uttering for years — or he does anything with respect to Guam or anyplace else that's an American territory or an American ally, he will truly regret it and he will regret it fast,” Trump said. Freeland declined to comment directly on Trump's remarks, but said Canada has been very clear about condemning the actions of North Korea, including its ballistic missile and nuclear programs. She said when Canada's allies are threatened, including the United States, “we are there.” “Having said that, I think that we need to seek ways to de-escalate the situation,” she said. “It is of absolutely pressing concern for Canada and we are very involved working with our international partners to seek a resolution, a de-escalation, to really get North Korea to understand it must get off of this path which is so destructive for North Korea and the world.”
Freeland expressed relief at the release of Canadian pastor Hyeong Soo Lim, who was serving a life sentence in North Korea for antistate activities. She said Canada had been clear from the outset that Lim had to be released and returned home. But she said his release and Canada's stand on North Korea's nuclear program are not linked.

“We are very glad that pastor Lim is now safely home,” she said. “That is a very separate and distinct issue.” Lim was released after serving more than two years in a North Korean prison. He had been sentenced to hard labour for what it called crimes against the state. Charges against him included harming the dignity of the supreme leadership, trying to use religion to destroy the North Korean system, disseminating negative propaganda about the North to overseas Koreans, and assisting American and South Korean efforts to help people defect from the north. Lim, a pastor with the Light Korean Presbyterian Church in Mississauga, Ont., was involved in humanitarian projects in North Korea. He was expected to arrive in Canada on Friday or Saturday. — With a file from The Associated Press Read more: Trump warns North Korea that U.S. is ‘locked and loaded' Freeing of Hyeon Soo Lim is a bright spot in Korean crisis: Editorial China warns North Korea: You're on your own if you go after the U.S.

EDMONTON, May 4, 2016 /CNW/ - Labatt Breweries of Canada is mobilizing its Canadian Disaster Relief effort to immediately donate more than 69,000 cans of emergency drinking water in aid of Canadians forced from their homes and firefighters on the ground in the wake of a wildfire sweeping through Fort McMurray, Alberta. An additional 131,000-plus cans are at the ready and will be shipped if emergency conditions warrant later this week.
Today, a truck carrying more than 2,880 cases of water canned to disaster specifications departed from the brewer's Alberta distribution centres. The shipment is destined for same-day delivery at the Edmonton emergency centre for donation to firefighters and displaced residents with the greatest need.
Charlie Angelakos, Labatt's vice president, legal and corporate affairs, said, "At our Edmonton brewery and across the country, the people of Labatt are alarmed and deeply concerned by the devastation of the wildfire that has overtaken Fort McMurray. Our priority is to shift into high gear with our Disaster Relief Program and do everything we can to help."
Today's donation is Labatt's fourth under its Canadian Disaster Relief Program in as many years. The company made its first water donation in 2013, when severe flooding caused Alberta to declare Canada's first-ever provincial state of emergency, also flying out a team of Labatt employees to help with the flood clean-up effort on the ground. In 2014, the company came to the aid of flood victims in Manitoba and Saskatchewan and, in 2015 it coupled financial donations with donations of safe drinking water for firefighters and residents when forest fires broke out in BC and Saskatchewan.
Labatt's Canadian Disaster Relief Program was first established in 2012 to provide safe drinking water to Canadian communities that have experienced a natural disaster. The company's Hometown Brewery in London, Ontario packages its own water and maintains a constant inventory of fresh and safe canned water exclusively for this purpose. Since 2012, Labatt has donated more than 220,000 cans of safe drinking water to Canadian communities under emergency conditions.
"Labatt is one of Canada's founding businesses and oldest brewers and we're grateful to be able to give back to this country by leveraging our strengths and resources to get safe drinking water to Canadians in need," said Angelakos.

Alan Osmond, best known for his years as one of the Osmond Family singers. (The one with the z~mutton chops) and who now currently serves on the high council of the Orem Suncrest Stake in Orem, Utah for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has penned an anti-gay article for the Mormon website The Family, which is run by “The Osmond Network LLC” and is linked to byt the “Official Osmond Family Website”
In his article, which is so misinformed, ill written and LDS cultlike you expect kool-aid to be served alongside of it, Osmond states that being gay is not genetic and that reperative therapy does work. He also goes on to quote LDS President Gordon B. Hinckley who has said in the past “Prophets of God have repeatedly taught through the ages that practices of homosexual relations, fornication, and adultery are grievous sins. Sexual relations outside the bonds of marriage are forbidden by the Lord. We affirm those teachings.”
From Osmonds article (I have not proofed it or changed anything. This is verbatim )
First, it is important to understand that homosexuality is not innate and unchangeable. Research has NOT proved that homosexuality is genetic. Even more important, many researchers whose studies have been used to support a biological model forhomosexuality have determined that their work has been MISINTERPRETED. What is clear is that homosexuality results from an interaction of social, biological, and psychological factors. These factors may include temperament, personality traits, sexual abuse, familial factors, and treatment by one's peers. Developmental factors aside, can individuals diminish homosexual attraction and make changes in their lives? Yes. There is substantial evidence, both historical and current, to indicate this is the case. Jeffrey Satinover, M.D., a former Fellow atYale Universityand a graduate of MIT and Harvard, concludes: “The fact that not all methods of treating those who struggle with homosexual attraction are successful, and that no method is successful for everyone, has been distorted by activists into the claim that no method is helpful for anyone. … The simple truth is that, like most methods in psychiatry and psychotherapy, the treatment of homosexuality has evolved out of eighty years of clinical experience, demonstrating approximately the same degree of success as, for example, the psychotherapy of depression.” Other researchers note treatment success rates that exceed 50 percent, which is similar to the success rates for treating other difficulties.
Now if Alan Osmond wants to be a hardcore homophobic Morom bigot no matter how offensive it is thats up to him.
But whats beyond offensive is the fact that the Osmond Family which is still after all these years one of the most famous Mormon families in the world, and who and has hundreds of thousands of fans, link to and supports these homophobic lies and misinformation.

The start of Britain's grouse shooting season has been overshadowed by wildlife protection protests, marking the growing confidence of animal rights supporters that they are about to make their biggest breakthrough since the hunting ban in 2004.
As the countryside echoed to the sound of gunfire on the Glorious Twelfth, opponents took part in a protest ramble on Ilkley Moor, the site of the only shoot still taking place on public land. In central London, thousands of marchers were told by speakers including the BBC presenter Chris Packham that the days of the West Yorkshire shoot were numbered, with Bradford council under unprecedented pressure not to renew the lease next year.
“I think that when people now see others killing for the psychopathic joy of it they are increasingly sickened and the reason for that is that our wildlife is running out,” Packham said. He told the Observer that public support for conservation in the UK had risen on the back of global outrage after Cecil the lion was killed in Zimbabwe in 2015. Social media is another factor.
“The RSPB published video of marsh harriers being killed on a grouse moor in Yorkshire and within hours of that material going on to YouTube it has been spread all around. Everyone is instantaneously angered as it gets shared and there is frankly nowhere for these criminals to hide,” Packham said.
The marchers, wearing fox head masks and carrying banners condemning the badger cull, made their way to Downing Street after speakers said that loopholes continued to allow hunting to go on. Danielle Flynn, 55, a former hunt saboteur from Glasgow, marched with her daughter Karen, who said social media had played a big part in the resurgence of interest in animal rights. “A lot of them might be apathetic about politics but they might, for example, take an interest when I talk to them about animal testing and makeup,” said the 24-year-old.
Jordan Psaros, 26, from Braintree in Essex, said: “I've always been an animal lover but I basically became involved in this after I saw videos online of foxes being killed by dogs set on them by hunters on horseback. A lot of people of my age are waking up to what is going on.”
Animal rights groups have been emboldened by the public reaction to recent controversies. Arsenal football club owner Stan Kroenke was forced to order his new TV streaming service to stop showing big-game hunting and Vinnie Jones was caught up in a row over a photograph of 100 dead foxes that appeared on his Twitter feed.
Hunting also featured in the general election after Theresa May declared her support for a free vote on overturning the ban, with some Tories complaining afterwards that this contributed to “toxifying” the party brand. Focus group Britain Thinks also found that while the so-called “dementia tax” was key among older voters, the prospect of a foxhunting revival alienated many swing voters.
Pro-hunting advocates argue that it is impossible to say whether the animal rights movement is resurgent in terms of actual numbers, arguing that hard data suggests the public do not change their vote on the basis of hunting or shooting issues. A YouGov poll in May put support for the ban at 67%, which suggests a decline in support, they said.
“If there has been any genuine resurgence of animal rights activism, it can almost certainly be attributed to social media,” said Liam Stokes, head of shooting at the Countryside Alliance. “Animal rights messages are very simplistic, and simplistic messages spread well on Twitter and Facebook, particularly when broadcast by celebrities like Packham and Brian May. The arguments for wildlife management are complex, nuanced and sometimes paradoxical, and don't lend themselves so easily to social media.”
Shooting continues to be big money. Yesterday saw the Gleneagles Glorious Grouse Race, in which shooters race to deliver the first grouse of the season to the town and onwards to London. Grouse killed by shooters including the Olympian Peter Wilson were due to be helicoptered down to be served at London's Harwood Arms gastropub.
“All the evidence is there that it should be stopped and there is a lot of support for that locally,” said Luke Steele of Ban Bloodsports on Ilkley Moor, who said that backing was coming from the local conservation group and a new Labour MP who recently took the seat from the Tories.
“We have seen that notable breeding bird species have gone extinct or declined by more than half, for example. Then there is the environmental damage caused by sections of the moor being set alight, and there are walkers who are fearful of the guns.”
But Edward Bromet of the Bingley Moor Partnership, which runs the shoot, insisted that grouse shooting aided the moor's upkeep and described those organising yesterday's protest as an “extreme” group.
“The key point here is that what the partnership agreed to do 10 years ago, when Bradford offered the moor on a lease, was to restore the moorland. We have done that primarily at our own cost, to reduce the bracken, which the people of Ilkley were very frustrated by, and restore the vegetation.
The Countryside Alliance has also turned its fire on Packham, sending a letter this weekend to the BBC arguing that it was unsustainable for him to be allowed an “unchallenged platform” on programmes such as Springwatch while he aligned himself with “the most aggressive elements of the anti-shooting campaign”.
Packham said: “There is no conflict. I have a working relationship with the BBC. We have an agreed protocol and I have not deviated from it. The Countryside Alliance is upset because they are on the back foot. We are winning and they are lashing out.”
For over a year now, the comics world has watched DC's New 52 and paid careful attention to what it brought to the industry. Would the influx of new readers stay on long term? Would the changes made to the continuity/characters stick? Could they avoid the traps of the past?
And, most importantly: What will Marvel's response be?
Well, it took a little longer than I thought it would, but bam! There it is: Marvel Now!
Now aside from the first-year-marketing-student title, the Marvel Now! re-whateveryouwannacallit has the potential to have a similar reception to the New 52.
By that I mean, everyone will say they hate it then buy 5 copies of it.
There are a lot of aspects of Marvel Now! that I really like. The creative teams they've got on their flagship books are top notch. I like that they are rolling it out over a 5-month period. I like that Bendis has finally, FINALLY found a way to shoehorn Rocket Raccoon back into our lives.
What I don't like though is everyone pretending this is something new and different. Marvel Now! (I swear, it sounds like a promo film for a timeshare in Ft. Lauderdale) is exactly what Marvel (and any other comics pubisher) does every time a big event wraps up. From The Initiative to Dark Reign to The Heroic Age, new “eras” in comics are pretty clock work. While I don't think that its necessarily a bad thing, I do think trotting out the dog and pony show as if we are re-inventing the wheel is a bit much. Especailly considering how far Marvel seems to be bending over backwards to declare it something new, but not new, which I'm sure won't confuse people at all.
In my opinion, the DC relaunch was something different. They took almost everything they had and rolled the dice with it. You can debate as long as you have breath as to it being a success or not, but the bottom line is it was ballsy. Marvel Now! to me seems to be trying to capitalize on that ballsiness but not actually follow through with it.
Change is inevitable in comics, but what I think jades people the most is the marketing machine that tries to tell us it's something other that what it is.

Thanks to my recent addiction to dark chocolate bark, the spandex in my jeans is screaming a little louder than usual these days. While discussing the unfortunate state of my waistline with a friend of mine, the terms Fat Tuesday and Mardi Gras were overheard by my boys.
They are like little sponges and hear EVERYTHING I say and then repeat it at the most inopportune and inappropriate times. Too bad they can't hear “clean your room or take out the trash when I say it!” Since they didn't know what Fat Tuesday and Mardi Gras were, they asked me over breakfast, and after many weird and embarrassing questions, the conversation soon turned to Lent in my attempt to bring the discussion to a more wholesome subject.
During Lent, many people practice fasting or eliminating a “luxury” as a form of penitence. Thinking that I need to give my waistbands a little reprieve, and atone for more than a few sins, I decided to give up dark chocolate for 40 days.
It seems like a small sacrifice to some, but let me assure you this will be no easy task for me. Don't think me spiritually shallow because I am giving up a snack food, I am also observing other aspects of Lent but since this is a food blog, there is no need to talk about those here and now.

Since starting the practice of eating Paleo last year, I can't really tolerate refined sugar or dairy, so dark chocolate is my ONE way to get a sweet treat (other than the fresh fruit of course) that actually seems like a splurge. Let's just say that 8 pieces throughout the day, every day, adds up to trouble, hence the waistbands and their vocal protests. My kids gave up candy and their Xbox as part of their observance. Mine really does seem small, doesn't it?!?!
My abstinence from this delicious snack doesn't have to hinder your love affair with dark chocolate. With this recipe for snacking chocolate, I will try and get you hooked on that very same chocolate bark so you will feel my emotional struggle. You will probably have more self-control and willpower than I ever will, so you can enjoy this snacking chocolate safely!
This Snacking Chocolate is also an all-inclusive snack food as it contains sweet, salty, crunchy, and creamy and is great for eating during the movies if you are the type that “sneaks” food in to avoid those pricey and gross concessions offerings like me.

Ingredients 8 ounces dark chocolate (I used 62% cacao, Ghiradelli brand, because that it is what I had on hand) 1/2 cup dried apricots (chopped small) 1/2 cup toasted coconut flakes (chopped) 1/2 cup pumpkin seeds (toasted) 1 teaspoon sea salt Instructions Make sure all your mix-ins are chopped into small pieces. Melt your chocolate in a double boiler or the microwave. I like the double boiler because I tend to scorch chocolate in the microwave, especially if it is low on cocoa butter! When your chocolate is melted all the way, stir in your add-ins. Toss to make sure they are incorporated evenly. Spread out on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Sprinkle with sea salt. Let cool. I put mine in the refrigerator to speed up the process but you don't have too. Break into small pieces. Store at room temperature until ready to eat.

The following post, written by The Rev. Robert A. Franek, is a part of Politicus Policy Discussion, in which writers draw connections between real lives and public policy.
It is patently evident now that when it comes to giving tax breaks to the wealthy Republicans in Congress have abandoned all moral guides to pursue their heartless agenda of appeasing their benefactors at the expense of vulnerable people across the country.
With Senate Republicans still struggling on their version of “health care” reform in which the Better Care Reconciliation Act aims to take health insurance away from over 20 million people and make everyone else pay more for less coverage in order to give the top 400 wealthiest people billions of dollars in tax breaks, Republicans in the House returned to their task of trying to introduce a budget bill.
It was not surprising to learn that according to The Huffington Post House Republicans are in a feud over how much to cut funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Notice that it is not whether or not to make cuts, but how much should be cut.
This essential assistance program for millions of people across the country to be able to feed themselves and their families always comes under endless scrutiny though it is only a tiny fraction of the overall discretionary spending within the farm bill and in the overall federal budget.
Cutting waste, fraud, and abuse is the story often used to justify such cruel cuts that take food out of the mouths of innocent children. People need to work. The government is not a charity. These too are chanted in the halls of power and in homes across the country with little understanding of the entrapment of poverty, the structural obstacles that need to be overcome, and how having a job is not the sole solution to financial freedom, especially when the minimum wage is a starvation wage and not a living wage.
The efficiency excuse is even harder to swallow when one discovers that it is not for lack of money that these cruel cuts are said to be necessary. Rather Republicans believe that children need to go hungry so that they can give another tax break to the wealthiest people in the country and continually increase defense spending.
Representative Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) told HuffPost:
“Over the years, SNAP has essentially been an ATM machine for Republicans so they can pay for increases in defense spending and tax cuts.”
Strange that it is never the other way around. Strange that defense spending is not cut just a little or a tax break for the wealthy forfeited so that one of the governments biggest and most successful safety net programs may be strengthened and not strangled.
Yet, Republicans continue to tout the benefit of giving tax cuts to the rich because the increased wealth at the top will somehow magically trickle down to everyone below. Here's a reality check. One does not need to be Robert Reich or Paul Krugman to know that trickle-down economics is a failed experiment and an utter lie.
Whether through so-called “health care” legislation or budgetary plans, Republicans in Congress never fail to find a way to transfer wealth from the people who have the least to the people who have the most.
I am not sure how anyone with common sense and a moral compass can see how making cuts to a social safety net program that enables children to have food on the table constitutes having “family values”.
Sean Colarossi summed up the feud over food stamps this way:
“How many Americans should be unable to feed their families just so taxes can be lowered for the wealthy? That's essentially the question they're asking themselves now.”
The Bible is full of feeding stories from the miraculous manna Israel received in their wilderness journey to the flour and oil that provided for Elijah, the widow at Zarephath, and her family in the midst of a drought. Jesus too is constantly feeding people and banqueting with the rich and poor alike. Read the Gospel of Luke. Jesus is often stirring up trouble by who he is feeding and with whom he chooses to have banquet meals.
One feeding story appears in all four Gospels. In Matthew's version, it begins with the disciples wanting Jesus to send the crowds away so that they may go into the villages to buy food for themselves for they are in a deserted place and the hour is now late. But Jesus tells his disciples the crowds need not go away, you give them something to eat. The astonished disciples wonder how that is going to be done when all they have are five loaves of bread and two fish. Over five thousand were fed that evening the story concludes and twelve baskets of leftovers were gathered.
This story of the feeding of the multitudes comes to mind when I think of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program because like those few loaves and fish this slice of the federal budget is comparably small. Its section on a pie chart is barely visible. Yet the return on investment of these dollars that help feed children and families across the country is immeasurable. The return of dollars invested in this safety net program is like that of the loaves Jesus takes, blesses, breaks, and gives to feed the people. There is more at the end of the meal than the beginning. So also with these dollars that enable parents to provide food for their children so they do not have hunger pains in school enabling them to focus and learn without the distraction of a hungry aching stomach.
Who knows what anxieties are relieved in parents who know they have this money to stretch their food budget a little farther and what children are able to achieve having had the basic wonder of a decent meal? More these dollars are immediately invested in local economies across the country and not put away in investment accounts. Thus, these dollars are an immediate and regular stimulus in the economy.
This week as we celebrate our country's founding and independence let us also remember our deepest shared moral values that unite us across every division. Let us see the humanity and dignity in our hungry neighbors who need the help of our social safety nets. Let us remember that one of the most patriotic things we can do is to care for the hungry through the budgetary process. The allocation of financial resources is a moral exercise and budgets are moral documents that reflect our values.

The latest affordability index by the Adelaide Bank and Real Estate Institute of Australia has once again flooded the real estate headlines with the jolly news that housing is growing ever more affordable.
This pre-Christmas gift of optimism from the newly updated ‘affordability' studies commissioned by the financial and real estate sectors, comes with a host of commentary – usually from those with a vested interest – who happily advise aspiring homeowners that ‘they've never had it so good' – in other words, to paraphrase Terry Ryder's thoughts, first home buyers should ‘put up, or shut up.'
Of course, it wouldn't be half as palatable if it didn't come accompanied with the seeming contradiction that not only is it more affordable than it's been in the last decade (according to the HIA-Commonwealth Bank affordability index,) it's also substantially more expensive than its ever been – yes, housing is only item than can be both affordable and unaffordable at the same time. Work that one out Einstein!
In fact, according to Residex, median prices in both Sydney and Melbourne have already exceeded their historical highs, ‘nudging' $750,000 in Sydney and $600,000 in Melbourne – additionally, Perth has also reached its previous peak of 2008, with a median price of $521,000.
RPData's dwelling price index shows a year to date increase of 14.3% in Sydney, 6.4% in Melbourne and 9.7% in Perth. For homebuyers, the benefit derived from lower lending rates has been all but offset by the inflationary pressure placed on prices.
Rarely is it mentioned that housing affordability and the cost of servicing a mortgage are two separate entities.
Mortgage rates are set up with different structures dependent on circumstance, and subject to interest rate changes influenced by the macro environment.
To take out a 25 year mortgage requires the expectation of secure employment in a terrain where frequent job changes or part time work are becoming a norm.
They may influence house prices through a cycle, but they do not take away the fact that home prices now – even with lower lending rates – require longer terms to pay down, with the interest over the duration of that period adding considerably to the capital cost.
In fact I couldn't put it any better than current governor of the Bank of England – Mark Carney, when he warns:
“Think about the mortgage you are taking on, the debts you are taking on…You are taking at least a 25-year mortgage, maybe a 30-year mortgage. Are you going to be able to service that mortgage five years from now, 10 years from now, if interest rates are higher? Or are you counting, even subconsciously, on the price of your housekeeping going up and if something happens an ability to sell it quickly and not facing the consequences of not being able to pay?”
Carney's cautionary words pre-empted the Bank of England's decision to scale back its inflationary ‘Funding for Lending' scheme amidst fears of a rapid escalation of house prices in the south-eastern regions of the country.
From next year Funding for Lending will only be available for business loans -not mortgages – and if the banking sector's concerned about signs of frothiness in an industry in which it's heavily invested, so should we also be.
The BoE governor is not alone. Central banks in Sweden, Hong Kong, Norway, New Zealand, Canada and Switzerland (to name but a few) have all adopted macro prudential measures to buffer against the associated risks of a boom/bust investor lead recovery in a post GFC environment – highlighting the importance of keeping lending standards robust – all, that is, except Australia.
Having weathered the impact of the GFC a little more effectively than others – the RBA seems to think we live in some ‘magic faraway tree,' effectively doing little more than wagging a cautionary finger to a sector which, for the duration of the year, has outstripped owner-occupier lending with well over a third of all new loans on ‘interest only' terms and roughly the same proportion with LVRs of over 80 per cent.
In other words, there are still over a third of all loans in which the principal is not being reduced – with 37.3% lent on these terms for the September quarter alone.
In NSW, investment lending is at record highs, making up over 50% of the market, and although many use the well worn argument that the unwanted boom is predominant ‘only in Sydney' – let's not forget, Sydney is not some nether land off the coast of Tasmania: what happens in our biggest capital with the largest and most diverse economy in Australia, inevitably impacts us all.
Historically, this sector is more sensitive to interest rate changes with a tendency to wax and wain pro cyclically with market movements, exaggerating both gains and falls. A housing recovery built on the back of small mum and dad investors pouring their money predominantly into negatively geared established dwellings – especially considering our current levels of private debt to income ratios – is not ideal for the long term stability of our housing market, or house prices.
The common Aussie term ‘spruiking' – which APRA warns against in the self managed super sector, is not only a contributing aspect of what inspires our culture to see property as the undiversified road map for building wealth for retirement – it is also part and parcel of what has kept our property prices high by both local, and international standards. Yet the risks associated with spruiking in SMSFs is simply the tip of a much larger iceberg.
Having worked in many aspects of the housing industry, I have seen first hand the type of material that's presented at seminars not just from those who receive under the table commissions from developers, but also from advocates working as independent advisors for either the seller or buyer.
It really isn't unusual to see slides presented at seminars with straight lines charting the difference between investing in properties that supposedly “grow” at steady 5% per annum, compared to those that grow at 10%, using historical median data as ‘evidence' that future returns can replicate those achieved in the past, without any distinction of how such data is correlated or the difference between individual “house prices” and “median values.”
This information borders on financial advice and comes with no mention of risk or the type of rigorous analysis, which you would reasonably expect when choosing to invest in a single asset.
Another widely used industry favourite is the statement:
“FACT: fewer than 5% of properties are investment grade”
A myth if ever there was one. Perhaps the well-known companies that use this as an advertising tool, would like to point to the person who researched every property in Australia to correlate such a statistic? Maybe we could also ask for a comprehensive definition of what ‘investment grade' really is – because I guarantee there would be no shortage of differing opinions from industry ‘experts.'
This endless promotion of residential property, with rows of investment magazines lining newsagency shelves, promoting subjective ‘hotspots,' or as I pointed out a few weeks ago, agencies cold calling households, and sending ‘advisors' round to ‘educate' and encourage inexperienced investors to negatively gear against their principle place of residence, is toxic.
Meanwhile, the RBA continue to sit on their hands, not wanting to pull a regulatory lever, instead warning investors to employ caution, hoping they will fall into line like a bunch of good school kids. However, whilst macro prudential tools may assist in ensuring banking lending standards remain robust – can they have any long-term sustainable or lasting impact on property prices?
In a recent research paper by BIS (Bank for International Settlements) entitled “can non-interest rate policies stabilise housing markets?” – evidence was gathered from 57 countries spanning more than three decades, investigating the effectiveness of nine non-interest rate policy and macro prudential tools on restraining credit growth and house prices.
The analysis used a new dataset going as far back as 1980, making it the most comprehensive study to date in terms of both scope and time span.
The paper concluded that whilst reductions in the maximum LTV (loan to value) ratio can restrain demand, its effects can be partially or wholly offset by a rising market enabling the investor to borrow more, therefore, changes in the maximum DSTI (debt service to income) ratio were assessed to be more substantial.
But importantly:
“Only tax changes affecting the cost of buying a house, which bear directly on the user cost, have any measurable effect on prices” and, “None of the policies designed to affect either the supply of or the demand for credit has a discernible impact on house prices.”
The study puts this down to the ‘can buy' still outnumbering the growing pool of credit constrained ‘can't buy' – stressing that the importance of housing supply was not explicitly considered. Therefore if we want to lower house prices or put in place policies to aid affordability, we need to look outside the limited powers of the RBA alone.
As has been proven time and time again, intermittently stoking at the bottom end of the market with FHB grants and incentives does little more than provide a short term ‘happy pill' for vendors, as the price multiplier effect ripples across the rest of the housing terrain, stimulating both an inflationary and volatile environment.
Instead, we need to focus on the real problem in Australia – and it's not property prices, it's land prices – as economist Leith Van Onselen effectively points out when he analyses the difference between commercial and rural land compared to residential land values, and building costs.
“Whilst commercial and rural prices have remained relatively stable over the last 24 years relative to GDP, residential prices have skyrocketed…”
In other words, the cost of residential fringe land, which without constraint, should be close to its ‘raw' value, is not cheap at all – and it's all down to ineffective urban planning policy.
As I (and others) have pointed out previously, even within a wide expansive boundary as mooted in Melbourne's new urban growth strategy, the government limits land use until they have gone through a lengthy process of mapping out areas for infrastructure known as a ‘Precinct Structure Plan' – it is a slow laborious process and as soon as you restrict the supply of anything, scarcity inevitably inflates values.
Larger developers are not slow to purchase swathes of acreage prior to rezoning, and then once ‘Psp's' have been finalised, drip feed it onto the market. Not only do Government bodies have little understanding of how released plots respond to consumer demand, they have no policy in place to deter the practice. It's therefore a failure.
Furthermore, facilitation of infrastructure is currently financed via hefty development overlays, which are passed onto the buyer rather than initiatives such as bond financing, where residents pay back proportionally over a lengthy period of time, as was the case historically.
We must remove these barriers with effective policy and let land prices revert back to normal levels to reflect a ‘real price' closer to commercial values.
Without doing so, we can't gain a true indicator of the trade-off buyers are prepared to make between price and distance. Currently, the average price of a newly built house and land package is around $400,000, this is not serviceable on the single median wage, and therefore can hardly be deemed affordable.
Get the land supply – price – and infrastructure equation right, and I suspect there would be no lack of demand from genuine aspiring homebuyers. Only when this is done, can we have a truly transparent debate on first homebuyers willingness to ‘spread over the land.'
The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday declared Florida's death penalty law unconstitutional because it requires the trial judge and not the jury to make the critical findings necessary to impose capital punishment.
That's at odds with a string of Supreme Court cases which held that facts that add to a defendant's punishment — known as aggravating circumstances — must be found by a jury.
“The Sixth Amendment requires a jury, not a judge, to find each fact necessary to impose a sentence of death. A jury's mere recommendation is not enough,” wrote Sonia Sotomayor for the court's 8-1 majority.
RELATED: Florida executes serial killer Oscar Ray Bolin
The ruling means the case of Timothy Lee Hurst, who was convicted of the stabbing murder of his co-worker in 1998, goes back to the lower courts.
It's not yet clear how many other cases — including the 400 inmates on the state's death row — could be affected, experts said.
“The substance of the ruling would affect the vast majority of Florida's death row inmates,” said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, which opposes capital punishment.
“The remaining question would be: Will the Supreme Court considers this to have retroactive effect and retroactive to when?”
He said he expects the ruling will unleash a wave of litigation.
“Every defendant in Florida whose death sentence was imposed in this matter will be challenging the constitutionality of his or her death sentence under Hurst,” Dunham said.
Connie Fuselier, the mother of Hurst's victim, said she doesn't care if he is executed at this point, but she can't bear the thought of more legal proceedings.
“It's been hell,” she told NBC News. “When you get to thinking it's over with, it starts all over again. It's nerve-racking.”
At one point during the many appeals the case has spawned, Fuselier said, she told the prosecutor she'd be satisfied with a sentence of life without parole.
“I just want it over with. I want to know he has no more appeals,” she said.
She said the case's 17-year journey through the courts, with the rehashing of the gruesome details of her daughter's death, has taken a toll on the family.
“I have post-traumatic stress. I have depression,” she said. “It's like the family evaporated. We're all here, but it's like we're not.”

Conservatives are less well-represented in the American professoriate than all current targets of affirmative action. A new book tells stories of conservative academics ‘coming out.'
“Passing on the Right: Conservative Professors in the Progressive University” by John A. Shields and Joshua M. Dunn Sr. is a short book surveying the experiences of right-wing social science and humanities professors in the United States. Conservative discomfort with the American academy and its leftward biases has been a fixture of American politics at least since the 1950s. However, research shows that leftward bias within the university system has grown significantly since the 1980s.
Shields, a professor at Claremont McKenna College, and Dunn, a professor at the University of Colorado-Colorado Springs, engage with this growing political homogeneity. Their book documents the experiences of 153 right-leaning professors in the social sciences and humanities (spoiler: they find conservatives getting less than a fair shake).
Q: In your book, you include libertarians in the conservative camp, along with social conservatives and foreign policy neoconservatives. That characterization is something many libertarians would take issue with, given their philosophical and political differences with those other groups. Why did you include them?
A: The American conservative movement is best understood not as a cohesive ideological movement, but rather as a coalition of various factions opposed to liberalism. Libertarians have long been members of that coalition, though often the most disgruntled ones, especially since the end of the Cold War. In fact, not a single libertarian professor we interviewed identifies with the Democratic Party.
Q: Your book contains the accounts of several conservative academics who had “coming out” experiences, which they compared to homosexuals coming out about their sexual identities. Did either of you have a notable experience when you “came out” as a conservative?
A: No. We've generally been open about our politics. Perhaps we lack the conservative virtue of prudence. However, if we had pursued careers in more politicized disciplines, such as sociology or history, we probably would have been more careful.
Q: The key theme of your book is homogeneity within the American university system. Do you believe this feature has grown more noticeable in recent years and decades?
A: Yes it has. Conservatives are actually less well-represented in the American professoriate than all current targets of affirmative action, including African Americans and Latinos. And while the representation of Latinos and blacks continues to increase, the percentage of conservatives has declined since 1990. See here.
Q: According to your analysis, self-exclusion is the main factor limiting the influence of conservatives within academia. Do you think this is driven by outright hostility toward conservatives in the social sciences or humanities, or the fact that certain fields (sociology and anthropology, for example) seem to rely on a set of assumptions that are viewed as inherently left-wing?
A: There is much that we still don't know about why conservatives are so scarce in academia. We do know that the usual explanations—that they're too closed-minded or money grubbing—are not well supported by the empirical evidence. We also know that once an imbalance occurs, it is self-reinforcing, especially in those fields shaped by left-wing interests and theories.
If you're a young person on the Left considering a job in academia, for example, you're likely to find sociology, history, philosophy much more appealing than, say, economics. And, if you're a conservative, you'll be more likely to gravitate toward economics. There is also evidence that the intrepid conservatives who venture into left-wing disciplines face discrimination. But, for the most part, discrimination is simply unnecessary in those fields because conservatives don't enter them.
Q: Confirmation bias in the peer-review process is another factor that often weighs against conservatives. Do you think liberal reviewers consciously apply stricter standards to work that is perceived to be conservative?
A: It's not necessarily a “conscious” bias. That's what makes confirmation bias so powerful, and why it can never be fully checked by norms of objectivity.
Q: You mention in your book that anti-conservative bias stems largely the fact that liberal professors are not often exposed to conservative viewpoints. Do you observe conservative academics attempting to offer alternatives to the less-articulate opinions expressed by politicians and pundits?
A: Certainly many try to correct the views of their colleagues simply by being good university citizens and thoughtful ambassadors for conservative ideas. And, of course, some of the more prominent professors we interviewed try to shape conversations outside the universities they call home. But, unfortunately, these reasonable voices are often muted these days by the far less temperate voices of conservative populists in the media and politics.
Q: How would you critique (or defend) the view commonly expressed by conservative politicians that the academy is effectively a liberal information bubble?
A: There is evidence that the political homogeneity of the academy does create an echo chamber. In chapter seven we discuss how many disciplines have been impoverished because of this homogeneity. For decades, sociologists, for instance, resisted blindingly obvious evidence that family breakdown is harmful for kids. In history, the liberal narrative that the progressive movement was an unalloyed good caused it to largely ignore its racism and xenophobia.
Feminists, meanwhile, ignored strong evidence that gender is not merely a social construct—that there are actual sex differences between men and women. Research on the negative consequences of racial preferences in university admissions for minority students has only been conducted very recently. The list goes on and on.
Political homogeneity also harms students. They are often not exposed to thoughtful conservative perspectives, partly because social scientific knowledge itself has been so profoundly shaped by leftist interests and perspectives. The university is also one of the few institutions in our polarized nation that could expose students to reasonable and civil debates across the ideological divide. But that example is really hard to provide when there are not conservative professors on campus.
Q: It being election year, Americans are more opinionated than usual. Have you detected a bias toward or against certain presidential candidates during your interactions with other conservative academics?
A: Conservative professors tend to prefer established candidates with a long record of successful governance. And unlike many of their progressive colleagues, conservative professors tend to be leery of populist movements. Their anti-populism leaves them concerned with the direction of the Republican Party, which was shaken first by the Tea Party and now by the rise of Donald Trump. Making matters worse, Trump isn't even a conservative; he's a nationalist.
Q: Your book, as well as the op-ed you wrote for the Washington Post, actually argues that life is not so bad for conservative professors. You focus on the academic freedom conservatives enjoy after they've gained tenure, arguably to the point of underselling the struggles of assistant professors and grad students. How would you address such a criticism?
A: There is no doubt that many conservatives face some discrimination because of their politics. However, you can't eliminate political bias from the university, partly because political bias reflects an intellectual orientation. That is, our politics inclines us to find some questions interesting and certain explanations more plausible than others. So bias is never going away.
Those challenges that do exist in the university are also usually manageable. Conservatives can and do succeed despite real challenges. Overstating the obstacles conservatives have to overcome may also make the problem of left-wing dominance of the university even worse.
Q: Let's imagine that I'm a conservative undergraduate considering a career in academia. What words of advice and encouragement do you have for me?
A: First, be aware that the job market for all PhDs regardless of their politics is terrible. The primary reason not to pursue an academic career is not because you are conservative but because there is a glut of PhDs. Second, think of yourself of a scholar first and a conservative second. Third, read our book! It will help you navigate the academic landscape.
CTV Vancouver Island
B.C.'s first vegan butcher shop, opening this weekend in Victoria, is facing online critics after being featured on the news for its unique business plan.
James Davison, owner of The Very Good Butcher Shop, serves up plant-based faux meats at a shop set to open in Victoria's Public Market on Saturday.
While some vegans and vegetarians love the idea of more cruelty free, meat-like options, Davison quickly found that not everyone is supportive of his idea.
After posting his story on social media, CTV Vancouver Island received feedback from dozens people with strong opinions about what a butcher shop is and isn't.
“It might be coming from a position of they feel they have to defend themselves and the decisions they make,” said Davison. “We're not attacking anyone. We're not part of that ‘meat is murder,' we're just here to provide an alternative and if you enjoy it and want to eat it, great.”
Watch as Davison learns what his critics really think:
IT came at 0-3 down in P V Sindhu's semifinal against Nozomi Okuhara. The Japanese was threatening to snatch the momentum. Gopichand had been yelling, “Jump and smash. Jump and toss”, drawing out of his player the last ounce of explosive power. Sindhu would respond with a flurry of jump smashes — she had five through the match. She would win 10 straight points and storm into contention for a gold medal. The coach was suitably satisfied. His strategy had been executed to the last leaping detail.
There were bigger mountains to climb. Carolina Marin next.

Pullela Gopichand, former All England champion, was now feeding his athletes what he had been starved off: ready inputs, strategy, an on-court Pentium processor, knowledge and an incredible mind off court.
The England title had come 15 years ago, and after a disastrous Olympics campaign for him. He had been at his peak — game-wise and physically — but had lacked the most crucial support at Sydney 2000. The national coach hadn't bothered to recce his opponent's game, and in the third round, Gopichand went down to Indonesian H Hendrawan. He might have looked back to the chair looking for crucial answers at important junctures — you know how players look pleadingly because the mad rush of the game means they can't process it all — but nothing useful was forthcoming then.
Somewhere that day, when it hit Gopichand that his best chance of winning an Olympics was botched, it had crystallised in his head that he wouldn't allow another Indian to feel rudderless in front of the watching world.

“He has a coaching philosophy learnt the hard way as an athlete,” says former teammate Aparna Popat, who watched his 2000 Games disappointment from upfront. “He believes that a player's job is only to play. It is not the player's job to strategise. A player has to show up well rested, well trained and execute what is the coach's homework. It's the coach's job. He rued not getting that, now he's giving it to his players,” Popat says.

The 1990s and before were times when coaches were not allowed to speak to players from courtside — except for five minutes between the second and third game. But Gopi had seen that it was central to battle big opponents. “He believes that a coach needs to take responsibility. A player's energy should only go in execution. So we see him make the blueprint and the fine print,” says Popat.
Gopichand would go to Chinese coach Wang Xuyan for the answer that eluded him: Why are the Chinese and Koreans so fit? He would train under Xuyan in Germany while playing the German league briefly; and for eight months before Sydney, the federation would give him another Chinese coach he had asked for.
He was enamoured of the Chinese way, because it obviously brought them success. “He got into coaching in 2004, and suddenly was national coach in 2006. I knew he was smart, but I'll admit I never knew he would become this super coach, who's now got you two back to back Olympic medals,” says former international and Gopi's junior Aravind Bhat.
Bhat hated training under Gopi because he was a taskmaster, but he hung in there and blindly followed what the coach asked. “In the first few years, he was very strict. My body couldn't cope with his regimen. He believed that training should never be comfortable, it should be killing if the match has to look effortless. He believed our coaches had been too soft, and his sessions were hard,” Bhat says.
Two three-hour sessions a day split into four 40-minute quarters with five-minute breaks. Road running, stroke practice, multifeed, gym sets, repetitions. Relentless. “He realised fitness came first, talent later if you wanted success. But fitness needed guts,” says Bhat.
Gopichand is an affable man outside the court. He was a great idol for Jwala Gutta as a player, when they won a few mixed doubles titles. He listened, and he advised. When he became coach, all hell broke loose.
“He suddenly transformed because his ideas had conviction, and he became a taskmaster. Players took time to buy into it,” says Bhat. It led to the grand rebellion of 2006 when players went to competitions when he wanted them to stay in camp for three months and prop up their fitness. A generation was up in arms, but a younger lot was lapping it up — P Kashyap and Saina Nehwal.
Gopichand micromanages his players on court because of his innate understanding of girls and boys. “Gopi is very intelligent and clever, a unique guy. But you don't always see that intelligence in a player, they're not smart on court from day 1. So he literally spoonfeeds them to draw an achievement out… When he coaches, he takes all the responsibility on himself. For him, it's like a general going to war,” Bhat says.
Like a general who gives orders to his subordinates, but someone who also understands what works for each player and what does not. Like in the case of K Srikanth, who plays a lot on adrenaline and whose mind cannot be changed mid-match because he's so worked up. So, Gopi will never change plans in the middle. With Sindhu, he had identified her strength correctly. There was always a good chance early that Sindhu would be tall and physically gifted when she grew up. “He didn't bother stressing madly over developing her into a skillful or technical player at the start,” Popat says.
Sindhu, Srikanth, Saina, Kashyap. Four different games. Individual flair and strengths had its place in Gopi Land.
Srikanth was instinctive, Gopi never tried to touch that part of his game or change it. “His prowess lies in creating a player,” Popat says. Kashyap was slowly chiselled into winning the Commonwealth Games gold and doing well at Worlds and Olympics. Sindhu was given time to develop. “The agility needed to counter Tai Tzu's trickery in the quarters, to be under the shuttle at all times, was a patient, years-long effort at improving that agility, bit by bit. The jump smash is a fancy shot. For a girl to do it, it was pure strategy,” Bhat says.
Saina is, of course, folklore.
Gopi is known to be always in tune with what's happening. A great thinker and planner, he will have everything worked out. “He's so versatile, he'll have three solutions, and four scenarios to solve a problem because he's so invested in what's happening,” says Bhat.
So typically, the night before the final, he would stress on rest, possibly two ice baths, talk a bit, and a painkiller to ease pressure.
“Bhaiyya bhaagte hai. Hum kaise baithe rahe (He runs, how can we sit around).” Talk to Gopi's players, and they'll tell you he trains alongside them — that explains the 15-year non-ageing — and in turn, makes them feel terribly guilty for being lazy or missing a session. “And he's not afraid of trying new things. He thrives on innovating,” Popat says.
Bhat recalls an experiment from 2012 when Gopichand went on a Ketogenic diet, popular in the US then, for a whole year just to check if his players would be able to take it. That was right after tennis star Novak Djokovic made it popular; Gopichand restricted his own intake to just 8-10 things permitted by the diet chart. “He read and researched, and checked it on himself, going into training aiding recovery and fitness. He could have beaten all the active Indian players at that time, he became so fit,” Bhat says, laughing. But he dropped the idea when he realised his players, whose every morsel he monitors, might not be able to take it.
Not too crazy about video analysis, Gopichand also relies on his memory to strategise. He's big on yoga, though.
Moreover, Gopichand designs his own workouts specific to badminton and shuttlers. “You won't find them off the Internet,” Bhat says. Like Sindhu had been chasing a tennis ball thrown at her and bouncing off a wall a certain way for the last two months for her agility that's brought her this far, topping her height advantage and countering its drawbacks. “He's an inventor,” Bhat says.
The final at Rio is a massive culmination of a journey for Gopichand as coach. Sixteen years ago, at Sydney, he had believed he was a genuine contender. He had beaten Taufik Hidayat on the way, and most of the top players in rankings. That didn't end well.
He would start looking for a place to train, frustrated at not reaching potential — and wind up at the obscure SAI centre. “It was a decision that seemed foolish and a place that was obscure. We all wondered what the hell is this guy doing risking his career training on his own terms?” Popat says.
Advertising
But sure enough, his game would improve and he would bounce back to win the England title. On Friday, Gopi had a point to prove all over again. There was unfinished business. “It's amazing, the motivation, the belief he provides his athletes,” Popat says. Coach Gopichand is winning Olympic medals on his own terms now.
In Sunday's 'Game of Thrones' episode, season five continued with religious warfare, a first look at the Dornish Sand Snakes, and an epic concluding scene in Meeren.
But one of the best scenes came from a tender father-daughter moment between Stannis Baratheon and his daughter, Shireen, which didn't occur in the books.
Though her face is disfigured with greyscale, a normally deadly and highly contagious disease, Shireen manages to be one of the sweetest and most likeable characters on the show. Shireen was disfigured by a disease called greyscale as a baby. hbo.com In a world where everyone seems to have enemies, Shireen stays in the sweet land of neutrality. She sees the Wildlings as just another group of people, and even teaches Gilly how to read.
Stannis is a hardened man, one who views his claim to the throne as the only just and fair outcome of this war. He rarely displays emotions other than annoyance and anger.
Stannis, a usually cold and closed-off man. hbo.com In this episode, we see Shireen wander into his chambers and, after some small talk, ask a heartbreaking question.
"Are you ashamed of me, father?"
Stannis pauses, and then tells her the story of how she came to have greyscale. A Dornish trader brought goods to the castle to sell, and among them was a small wooden doll dressed in Baratheon colors. Stannis, a new father, gave it to his only child — Shireen. But it was diseased, and by the time they realized what the doll carried, it was too late.
"I was told you would die, or worse, the Greyscale would go slow and you'd grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you. Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the stone men before the sickness spread through the castle. I told them all to go to hell."
hbo.com You can hear the bitterness in his voice, the regret of ever handing that small doll to his daughter. Shireen listens with rapt attention, smiling gently at hearing how her father defended her.
"I called in every maester on this side of the world. Every healer, every apothecary. They stopped the disease and saved your life. Because you did not belong across the world with the bloody stonemen. You were the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon. And you are my daughter."
Shireen, her eyes brimming with tears, runs to Stannis, and hugs him fiercely. After hesitating, he wraps his arms around her in return.
This is one of the better scenes we've had so far this season, and it is also one that was not sourced from the books, which could be significant. Why did the show writers decide that an emotional scene between Stannis and Shireen was necessary character development?
It could mean bad news for Shireen.
Fans of "Game of Thrones" should be well-accustomed to untimely deaths of their favorite characters by now. Generally speaking, emotionally uplifting moments are far and few between in the series.
Here's the evidence that we have so far that Shireen may be in danger:
Back in season four, when Stannis was preparing to leave Dragonstone and head for The Wall, there was contention between Stannis and his wife, Selyse, on whether or not Shireen should come with them. In episode seven, titled "Mockingbird," there is a significant scene between Selyse and Lady Melisandre.
Melisandre tells Selyse to look into the fire, and trust the Lord of Light. hbogo.com Selyse expresses her doubt to Melisandre about Shireen joining them, stating that her daughter doubts the existence of the Lord of the Light. Melisandre says that she must come, and elaborates when Selyse seems confused.
"You are strong enough to look into the Lords light and see his truth for yourself. However harsh it is, however hard it is for us to understand. You don't need my help, but I will need yours soon. When we set sail, your daughter must be with us. The Lord needs her."
Now, that can't be good. What would the Lord of Light, and therefore Melisandre, need from Shireen?
Flash forward to Sunday's episode, and there is a scene when Selyse is apologizing to Stannis for never birthing him a son, and only giving him a disfigured daughter. Melisandre overhears, and interjects by saying that the Lord of Light does not care about Shireen's affliction.
"Her father is the lord's chosen King, and her father's blood runs through her veins," Melisandre said to Selyse, and they exchange a loaded look.
The last time king's blood was a hot topic with Melisandre was during season three, when she tracked down Gendry (Robert Baratheon's bastard) and brought him to Stannis. Her plan was to sacrifice him, since he has Baratheon blood, in order to bring favor from the Lord of Light.
Gendry looks down, horrified, as Melisandre puts a leech in the one place no man wants the blood sucked out of them. hbogo.com
She tied him down, and used leeches to draw his blood. Stannis then threw the three leeches into a fire, stating the name of each of his enemies as he did - "The usurper Robb Stark, the usurper Balon Greyjoy, the usurper Joffrey Baratheon."
Stannis seems unconvinced that burning leeches will help kill his enemies. hbogo.com Two of those three "kings" are now dead - and Melisandre attributes this to her blood-magic leech spell. Stannis agreed to have Gendry sacrificed for the sake of a more powerful spell, but Davos helped him escape before their execution could be carried out.
So now we have Shireen, chock-full of her father's blood, and Melisandre has emphasized to Selyse that the Lord of Light "needs" her daughter. Selyse is a fanatic of the religion, and seems to completely rely on Melisandre for guidance.
It's very possible that the touching scene where Stannis emphasizes his love and defensive nature towards Shireen is hinting at a larger conflict to come.
We can only hope that if the time comes when Melisandre and Selyse believe it is necessary to sacrifice Shireen, or harm her in the name of their Lord, that Stannis will be able to protect her.

The missing links between galaxies have finally been found. This is the first detection of the roughly half of the normal matter in our universe – protons, neutrons and electrons – unaccounted for by previous observations of stars, galaxies and other bright objects in space.
You have probably heard about the hunt for dark matter, a mysterious substance thought to permeate the universe, the effects of which we can see through its gravitational pull. But our models of the universe also say there should be about twice as much ordinary matter out there, compared with what we have observed so far.
Two separate teams found the missing matter – made of particles called baryons rather than dark matter – linking galaxies together through filaments of hot, diffuse gas.
Advertisement
“The missing baryon problem is solved,” says Hideki Tanimura at the Institute of Space Astrophysics in Orsay, France, leader of one of the groups. The other team was led by Anna de Graaff at the University of Edinburgh, UK.
Because the gas is so tenuous and not quite hot enough for X-ray telescopes to pick up, nobody had been able to see it before.
“There's no sweet spot – no sweet instrument that we've invented yet that can directly observe this gas,” says Richard Ellis at University College London. “It's been purely speculation until now.”
So the two groups had to find another way to definitively show that these threads of gas are really there.
Both teams took advantage of a phenomenon called the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect that occurs when light left over from the big bang passes through hot gas. As the light travels, some of it scatters off the electrons in the gas, leaving a dim patch in the cosmic microwave background – our snapshot of the remnants from the birth of the cosmos.
Stack ‘em up
In 2015, the Planck satellite created a map of this effect throughout the observable universe. Because the tendrils of gas between galaxies are so diffuse, the dim blotches they cause are far too slight to be seen directly on Planck's map.
Both teams selected pairs of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey that were expected to be connected by a strand of baryons. They stacked the Planck signals for the areas between the galaxies, making the individually faint strands detectable en masse.
Tanimura's team stacked data on 260,000 pairs of galaxies, and de Graaff's group used over a million pairs. Both teams found definitive evidence of gas filaments between the galaxies. Tanimura's group found they were almost three times denser than the mean for normal matter in the universe, and de Graaf's group found they were six times denser – confirmation that the gas in these areas is dense enough to form filaments.
“We expect some differences because we are looking at filaments at different distances,” says Tanimura. “If this factor is included, our findings are very consistent with the other group.”
Finally finding the extra baryons that have been predicted by decades of simulations validates some of our assumptions about the universe.
“Everybody sort of knows that it has to be there, but this is the first time that somebody – two different groups, no less – has come up with a definitive detection,” says Ralph Kraft at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Massachusetts.
“This goes a long way toward showing that many of our ideas of how galaxies form and how structures form over the history of the universe are pretty much correct,” he says.

Reporting for Think Progress, my buddy and sometimes podcast partner,Zack Ford, writes about the extraordinary success of Chaim Levin and Ben Unger, two gay men who endured conversion therapy at the hands of a group called JONAH (Jews Offering New Alternatives to Healing.) This gay conversion therapy group out of New Jersey is now permanently closed after losing a lawsuit that accused it of consumer fraud.
Zack spoke with both Levin and Unger about the experiences of coming out and speaking out against the damaging treatment they received. Like many ex-gay survivors, it was not a smooth and easy road. It takes work to undo the damage.
“It was really really hard for me to adjust to general life,” Unger explained, noting that he struggled with major depression and anxiety. “JONAH constantly put in our heads that everybody hates the gays, the gay lifestyle is terrible, you're setting yourself up for a miserable life.” Growing up in a conservative Orthodox Jewish community, he'd been exposed to such messages much of his life before his year with JONAH reinforced it even more intensely. “It sticks with you.” Unger vividly recalls struggling with simple everyday experiences in the immediate aftermath. “I remember being on the subway after JONAH and thinking — neurotically — how everyone was looking at me and talking about me and thinking about what kind of faggot I am. That's just the word that was in my head. It was hard.” Very expensive therapy was required to help him work through the anxiety, depression, and haunting voices he dealt with on a daily basis.
Levin's experience was quite different:
When Levin did finally allow himself to identify as gay, it made a huge difference. “I drew so much power from coming out,” he recalled. “Once I came out I was able to stop focusing on who I'm attracted to and start paying more attention to being abused and things I experienced at school.” Unfortunately, dealing with the abuse of his past, including sexual abuse by his cousin, would create many new obstacles for him moving forward.
But coming out can open a can of worms. The article goes on to talk about these two men entering the world of gay dating and the complications of shedding an old identity and developing a new one. I can attest to the years it can take to shed the skin of shame and doubt and homophobia that gets woven around a person who submits to gay conversion therapy. It is difficult and scary work.
Zack writes about the trial, the power and challenge of speaking out, and how these two men learned to live new lives. It is well worth the read for any ex-gay survivor and those who want to better understand the complications of coming out after trying to go ex-gay. It is not simple. In fact, I would like ever LGBTQ-friendly therapist to read this piece before working with ex-gay survivors. Thank you Zack for such a thorough and thoughtful piece.

Image copyright PA Image caption Ms Alexander resigned as Labour's Scottish leader in June 2008
Former Scottish Labour leader Wendy Alexander is to be a member of a new body advising the Scottish government.
The Enterprise and Skills Strategic Board meets for the first time next month.
Its role is to "maximise output" from public sector investment in these areas.
The government said its members come from a broad range of backgrounds, including education, research, trade unions and local authorities.
Other members include Karen Betts of the Scotch Whisky Association, Steven Heddle of local government body Cosla, and Grahame Smith of the Scottish TUC.
Ms Alexander is a vice-principal of the University of Dundee.
As an MSP she represented Paisley North, and led the Labour Party in Scotland from 2007 to 2008.
She previously worked as an adviser to Labour secretary of state for Scotland Donald Dewar and worked on the legislation which established the Scottish Parliament.
'Nation of innovators'
Economy Secretary Keith Brown said the establishment of the board would help ensure the economy gets the most benefit possible from money invested.
He said: "We are rightly proud of our reputation as a nation of innovators. The support provided through this investment is greatly valued and it is important that it is properly co-ordinated, and focused on the needs of users.
"The members of the board have been chosen specifically for their expertise, both in their industrial and geographical areas."
The board will be chaired by Nora Senior, a former chairwoman of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce and former president of the British Chambers of Commerce.
She commented: "It is time for a different way of looking at the enterprise and skills agenda, adopting a fresh approach and responding to changing economic, business and innovation needs.
"With such an ambitious remit, it is essential for the board to feature a range of voices with a depth of knowledge and experience of Scotland's economy. The calibre of members we have invited on to the board is hugely impressive,
"I am confident that together we can build on the strengths of our system of enterprise and skills support, strengthen the links with other skills organisations and wider community to further drive inclusive growth and innovation across the country."

This is one of my favorite distros. The Xfce edition is a SUPER SOLID daily driver. The KDE edition looked great but it crashed on me after I started customizing it (probably something I did). Nevertheless I highly recommend Antergos.

The main problem is to start the installation program on some computers. Sometimes the initial logo runs indefinitely and the system does not work, instead it runs smoothly on other computers. They are not able to determine where the problem is and solve it. If you succeed to install it is a good and elegant system, easy to customize.

On the day the Raiders moved a step closer to Las Vegas, the team re-affirmed its desire to play in the Coliseum the next three seasons, if Oakland wants them to stay.

Five obstacles in Raiders' planned path to Giants' ballpark
Report: Raiders reach deal to play 2019 season in San Francisco NFL owners assembled in Chicago unanimously approved the Raiders' stadium lease in Las Vegas, paving the way for construction to begin perhaps in January on the 62-acre plot where a $1.9 billion stadium will be built. The Raiders plan to play in Vegas beginning in 2020 after their relocation was approved by owners in March by a 31-1 vote.
The Raiders' lease in Vegas is a 30-year deal with options, according to the NFL Network's Ian Rapoport.
“It was a big step … a well-done process,” Raiders owner Mark Davis told Rapoport.
The Raiders have legally-binding options to play in Oakland the next two seasons, but team president Marc Badain said they'd also like to play in the Coliseum in 2019. Badain echoed Davis' earlier statement when he told the Bleacher Report's Jason Cole Tuesday that if the city wants them, the Raiders are willing to work out a deal for 2019.
Oakland Council President Larry Reid, who was visibly livid when the NFL owners voted in favor of the Las Vegas move, even saying he would donate his Raiders gear to a thrift store, said he would not vote for a lease extension at the Coliseum.
Reid, who also sits on the Coliseum authority which has a vote on any lease agreement, said the city and county must begin to discuss the future of the government-owned Coliseum complex. Reid said as of last week, the Raiders organization had not been in contact with Coliseum authority Executive Director Scott McKibben.
“I'm going to hold true to my word,” Reid said Tuesday evening. “I am not going to vote to add a year on the Raiders lease agreement. If they can convince the other seven on the (Coliseum authority board) they shouldn't have a problem getting their one-year lease extension.”
The Coliseum authority board indicated in March it had no desire to house the Raiders beyond the 2017 and 2018 seasons, claiming it loses money when the Raiders play at the Coliseum.
Meanwhile, some fans in Oakland decided to no longer give their money to the Raiders.

By now, you have seen or heard the strange Glenn Beck on radio and TV shows or read one of his books. If you are scratching your head, go to the library and read Alexander Zaitchik's “Common Nonsense: Glenn Beck and the Triumph of Ignorance.”
A short time ago, Beck started out as a none-too-successful morning DJ with a bare education who hadn't a thought about politics. He loved to party and was a mean tempered, self centered cocaine addict.
He developed a nostalgic vision of America (that never was) of his grandfather's day, sitting on a porch rocking chair, in a country, “the heartland,” with a relatively small government and about 4 million white people.
There were no “evil progressives” leaving one to wonder how slavery ended or child labor, or, who brought about Social Security or the right of women to vote, among other things.
Glenn Beck expresses a strange populist, paranoic, conspiratorial vision of a world divided into ‘them' and ‘us'. Such beliefs, along with delusions of grandeur, righteousness, and self importance, power, emotional instability (likely bipolar) have been seen by those who have worked closely with him.
He is well known for using the airwaves to humiliate people personally. He has always had bursts of anger and difficult relationships, needing constant affirmation and attention. Kind of fits into the drug addict's persona. (my comment)
One of Beck's most infamous incidents was when a friend's wife was on the phone just after having had a miscarriage, and he put her on the open mic and humiliated her.
He moved into the spotlight when regulations were loosened and a few corporations took over most of the radio and TV news and talk channels. He began to talk politics, about which, he admitted, he knew nothing.
When he started picking up on the ACORN situation he would not let go, giving it negative publicity and eventually pushing till ACORN was defunded of its few million dollars. Of course he never talks of Phizer, which was fined billions for Medicaid fraud, or of military contractors' fraud in the billions. He was getting a growing audience and was rallying for far-right ideology. His humor was always berating the ‘elite' educated and he was the champion of the ordinary person. His programs attracted millions of listeners, distrustful of big government while he was protective of big corporations.
When he converted to the Mormon faith, he ended a lifetime of drugs and picked up the “testimonial” tears he is so famous for.
He quickly identified with the most fringe philosophical elements of the Mormon faith in the person of Cleon Skousen. Skousen raged against the intellectual elite, called black children “pickininies,” and the slave owners, “victims.”
Beck made Skousen's works, which have been called a “joke” by Zaitchik, required reading for his followers. From oblivion, and from the dust heap they are now on the best seller list along with Beck's own books.
Beck cries out, “We need to rescue our Constitution and go back to the founders,” despite that the constitution was written as a secular document with no religious references.
The constant contradictions matter little in Beck's books such as “Common Sense,” a sort of parody on Thomas Paine's famous pamphlet of the same name that helped spark the American Revolution.
Beck is thrilled with his following, lack of truth notwithstanding. Beck shouts support for Wall Street, which he calls the “victim.”
Beck tries to isolate the urban poor and black people from the ‘heartland'. He called Katrina victims “scumbags” and unemployed people, “unamerican .” (my comment)
He sees the corporations involved in the government getting bigger but calls for a world which would leave corporate power free to pollute air, water, and land. He would end government regulations protecting worker safety, food, and the environment and denies global warming.
He supports corporations that support him but talks angrily against corporations that supported Obama or that dropped advertizing on his program when he became very offensive and a huge movement was launched against him by Moveon.
Beck is making millions leading his movement to “take the government back” From whom? The first black American president!
Such racist (although he denies that he is racist), paranoid, conspiracy theorists have existed before in times of hardship. Zaitchik feels that the Beck phenomenon is temporary due to “its operatic nostalgia, opiate history, and tin can Orwellian imagination.”
My fear is that when Beck sells so much untruth and hate and lies to a largely fringe element that is armed, we cannot brush it off so easily. His divisive use of people and incitement has not gone unnoticed by Jews and others knowledgeable of the rise of Hitler Germany.
In my previous columns on lobbyist language, I've focused on choice of words to frame the debate - as the side that wins the framing, wins the policy. But small nuances can be even more devious than the selection of key words.
We've discussed industrial protectionism and content vs container before. To wrap up the theme, I'd like to look at the more subtle points of lobbyist language, which are just as devious – if you copy them, you're working against your own liberties.
The copyright industry doesn't just choose positive phrases to describe their specific “innovations”. They also try to establish sayings, phrases, and other combinations of words to make them uttered so often they become colloquilalisms, and yet, have very strong values embedded into them. This is very subtle, but just as important to understanding proper usage of the copyright monopoly, industrial protectionism, and digital restriction measures. It may not be those words that win the mindset, but the words in between – small words like left, right, black, and white.
For example, let's talk about the public domain. What happens when a piece of art falls into the public domain, as many do on January 1 every year?
Let's stop right there. Did you react to that sentence? Did you recognize it as obviously biased pro-copyright-industry lobbyist language? Odds are you didn't, and yet it's carefully crafted to describe the public domain as something starkly negative. This is how successful the copyright industry has been, and that's how much of their language we need to change in reframing the debate.
Karl Fogel of Question Copyright tweeted about this a while back, referencing Noel Taylor and pointing out something that's obvious only when you see it. To understand how “a work falls into the public domain” paints the copyright monopoly as something good and essential, compare that common phrase with the following sentence, which is a much better way of putting it:
What happens when a piece of art is elevated to the public domain, as many are on January 1 every year?
Did you see the difference? It's not in the key words, but rather in between them. It's about the direction described for the public domain. Our language metaphors attach really strong value to whether an item loses height or climbs on a ladder – whether it goes up or down. The difference between “falls into” the public domain and “is elevated to” the public domain is essentially the difference between whether the public domain is figurative hell or heaven, respectively. (There's another example right there: hell is assumed to be down, heaven assumed to be up, even though it's not mentioned anywhere. Very very cultural.)
An even worse way of wording the event, which the copyright industry has sometimes used, is how a work “lapses into” the public domain. This may be technically correct, but when you observe it instead in terms of language value, the expression “lapsing into” is functionally equivalent to “being neglected into” the public domain. It sends a strong signal of worthlessness, when we know the opposite to be true: when a work is in the public domain, it can be built upon freely to create new art of the highest order. (See there? “Highest order”, again.)
This can also be used when describing Creative Commons licenses – and when listing them. We are conditioned to see the item listed as the top as the most coveted and covetable, no matter the context. Merely by listing the maximalist restrictions at the bottom, and then gradually ascending toward CC-Zero (public domain), iterating through gradually higher licenses (see?) until you reach CC-BY, and then the highest license, CC-Zero, at the very top. Just that mere illustration establishes a mindset, one that industry lobbyists have long mastered, and which we must too.
The copyright industry is really skilled at using language to stack the debate against the net and against liberties. When we copy their language, we lose our liberties.
Kris Kristofferson played Tootsies
Kris was one of the many up & coming artists who played Tootsies, & he appeared at the very first Birthday Bash 55 years ago, according to a report (on brentwoodhomepage.com) that quotes the current proprietor, Steve Smith.
Tootsies Orchid Lounge is a world-famous Honky Tonk in Nashville that remains popular today. Over the years, the venue has hosted & served the likes of Kris & Willie while they were still struggling to make their names, with the likes of Hank Williams Junior, Steve Miller & Kid Rock making more recent appearances.
Tootsies are named after the original owner, Hattie Louise “Tootsie” Bess, who bought a lounge which, as the story goes, became known as the Orchid Lounge after mistakenly being painted orchid purple.
Whatever the real truth is, it sounds like great fun, & I wish I lived over the pond so I could have celebrated with the other Bashers – Who knows who turned up, maybe in disguise?
Tootsies Birthday Bashes include music & entertainment outdoors during the day, & I am certain this iconic venue is put to good use after the sun sets.
If ever you go, be sure to check out the wall of fame, & take a camera just in case!

Dead Germans.
They are the subject of a lecture I give every spring in my church history classes: a brief overview of German theologians from the 19th and early-20th centuries.
It's kind of a depressing lecture to deliver — the sad tale of skepticism intersecting with scholarship; a dismal depiction of the disaster unleashed by unrestrained doubt and disbelief.
Despite standing in the shadow of the Reformation, many German Protestant theologians abandoned the historic truth claims of biblical Christianity due to the mounting popularity of Enlightenment rationalism. In so doing, they shipwrecked their own souls while simultaneously devastating the faith of millions of others.
Higher critics, such as Johann Eichhorn and David Strauss, denied the inspiration and inerrancy of the Bible. Moses didn't write the Pentateuch, they claimed; nor did Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John write the four gospels. To make matters worse, they suggested that the Jesus of the Bible is not the same as the real Jesus of history. In their “quest to find the historical Jesus,” the critics created a “Jesus” of their own imaginations — essentially reducing him to a nice guy who couldn't do any miracles, never claimed to be God, and was largely misunderstood by first-century Judaism.
Liberal theologians, from Friedrich Schleiermacher to Albrecht Ritschl, similarly disavowed the truth claims of the Bible. They looked instead for a new foundation on which to base their contrived version of Christianity. Some found it in the personal experience of romanticism; others in the moral ethics of the social gospel. But by denying core Christian doctrines (like the substitutionary death of Christ and His bodily resurrection), liberalism denied the very essence of the gospel message (cf. 1 Cor. 15:3-4). As Richard Niebuhr explained — summing up the bankruptcy of liberal theology — liberalism asserted that a “God without wrath brought men without sin into a kingdom without judgment through the ministrations of a Christ without a cross” (The Kingdom of God in America, 193).
As you might imagine, the material in this lecture unfolds like a catastrophic train wreck … as we watch theologian after theologian jump the rails by abandoning the most-basic fundamentals of biblical Christianity.
(Thankfully, the subsequent lecture is on the modern missions movement, which gets everything back on track.)
But, in the midst of the chaos and carnage, are there lessons that we can learn from the German liberal theologians and higher critics, even if it is almost entirely from their negative example? I think so.
Here are seven such lessons, arranged in no particular. (I include these in the class notes for the seminary students I teach.)
7 Lessons We Should Learn from the German Liberal Theologians and Higher Critics:
1. The way to reach skeptics with the gospel is not by watering down the gospel. Many of the liberal theologians thought they could make Christianity more appealing to Enlightenment rationalists if they abandoned the historical authenticity of the text; and if they redefined the gospel as something other than salvation from sin through Christ (thereby making it less offensive to modern minds). But, in so doing, they actually undid the very gospel they thought they were helping to preserve.
2. True religion can be lost in just one generation. Most of the German liberals were the sons of orthodox, Protestant ministers. The fact that they turned their backs on the faith of their fathers is tragic. As those training to be pastors, seminary students need to make sure they are shepherding their own families first and foremost.
3. German liberalism does not represent merely a divergent form of Christianity, but — in actuality — a completely new religion. If historical fact is removed from the gospel it is no longer the gospel. The apostle Paul makes this point clear in 1 Corinthians 15, where he asserts that if Jesus did not really rise from the dead, then we are fools and our faith is worthless.
4. The liberals honored doubt as being noble and intellectually honest. In reality, doubting God's word is a heinous sin. It is a sin that Satan has been promoting ever since the Garden of Eden (in Genesis 3). To doubt God's Word is to make God a liar. It is also to reject the true gospel for a gospel of one's own imagination. As Augustine told the heretic Faustus, “You ought to say plainly that you do not believe the gospel of Christ. For to believe what you please, and not to believe what you please, is to believe yourselves, and not the gospel.” (Against Faustus, 17.3)
5. German liberalism teaches us that ideas have consequences, and that bad ideas have very bad consequences. Millions of people in the last few centuries were tragically led astray through the influence of the liberal theologians and higher critics. The warning of James 3:1 certainly seems apt here: “Let not many of you become teachers, my brethren, knowing that as such we shall incur a stricter judgment.”
6. The social gospel of the liberals is still alive and well in many mainline Protestant churches. The skepticism of the higher critics is still very much part of biblical studies in the academic world. Future pastors need to be ready to confront these kinds of errors with biblical truth (Titus 1:9).
7. Higher criticism, in particular, is built on the notion that the wisdom of man trumps the revealed wisdom of God. This is the height of arrogance. But it is not surprising, since Paul himself noted that the wisdom of God seems like foolishness to the world (1 Cor. 1:18). We must guard ourselves against the temptation to covet worldly praise and academic accolade. To be faithful to the gospel, we will necessarily be thought out-of-vogue with many of today's leading philosophical thinkers. While we must avoid anti-intellectualism on the one hand, we must also guard ourselves against the allure of whatever is popular in the secular academic community.

United Airlines, which lost the distinction of being the world's biggest carrier after shrinking for several years, plans to regain lost ground by adding more flights from key airports this summer, but John Glenn Columbus International Airport won't be one of them.
The airline, which announced the expansion plans Monday, says it wants to upgrade facilities at key airports and trim the use of smaller planes on important business routes.
United is in fourth place among the big four carriers in terms of passengers flying in and out of John Glenn Airport. For 2016, United had only 13 percent of the airport's passengers, a little more than a third of the number of passengers on Southwest Airlines, John Glenn's top carrier.
And while Delta Air Lines and American Airlines have been adding flights nationally, United hasn't been.
"We've been shrinking, and our competitors have been growing at our expense," says Scott Kirby, who jumped from president of American Airlines to the same job at United in August. "We're going back on offense."
Reducing the number of delays and cancellations will be crucial, said airline analysts, who note that United consistently ranks worse in on-time flights and cancellations than its top three competitors.
After a 2010 merger with Continental Airlines, United alienated important customers with cost-cutting initiatives that backfired.
A decade ago, for instance, United flew eight daily flights on Boeing 737s between Atlanta and Newark, a big business route where it competes with Delta. By 2013, United flew six times a day on small regional jets or turboprops.
Business travelers detest the small planes because they are more likely to be delayed or canceled, and their lack of enough overhead bins can mean carry-on bags get gate-checked — adding a time-consuming trip to baggage claim.
"Our best customers started abandoning us and flying on the competition, who had a better product," Kirby said. "We have to turn that around."
Kirby thinks that new routes from hubs will win over, or win back, passengers. If traffic picks up, and as United takes delivery of new planes, it should eventually be able to phase out small planes on key business-travel routes, he said.
United announced that this summer it will add four new destinations in smaller cities including Rochester, Minnesota, and Santa Rosa, California, add new connections to other medium-sized towns, and add daily flights on 15 other routes that connect with the big hubs. It will add seasonal flights between San Francisco and Munich.
Despite strong statements Wednesday from Orioles managing partner Peter Angelos that the club is not intent on allowing executive vice president Dan Duquette to leave to become president of the division-rival Toronto Blue Jays, the Orioles have compiled a list of Plan B options in case Duquette departs.
According to an industry source, that list -- compiled in the past month -- includes four high-profile former general managers: Ned Colletti, Kevin Towers, Omar Minaya and Kevin Malone, who spent a few years in the mid-1990s as an Orioles assistant general manager.
If Duquette were to leave – and Angelos was adamant Wednesday that he expects the 56-year-old to honor his contract that runs through 2018 – the most likely scenario is that manager Buck Showalter and vice president of baseball operations Brady Anderson would pick up more responsibilities involving personnel decisions. The duo has worked closely with Duquette in the past few years to shape the club's roster.
But if Duquette exits this offseason, the Orioles likely would need to hire someone in 2015 -- potentially under Anderson -- who could handle other administrative/general manager-type duties.
Each of the four Plan B options has an extensive front office background, and none are in a position of authority with a big league club.
At this point, it's believed the list is just a preliminary blueprint, and that the potential candidates have not been contacted to gauge their interest in a possible Orioles job. Obviously, a top-level post wouldn't be available if Duquette remains with the team.
Colletti, 60, was the general manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers from November 2005 through the 2014 season, and his teams boasted the highest winning percentage of any National League club during that period.
However, he was reassigned to a senior adviser post this offseason when the Dodgers hired new president Andrew Friedman and general manager Farhan Zaidi.

Towers, 53, was dismissed as general manager by the Arizona Diamondbacks this season after joining the organization in 2010. He was the San Diego Padres' GM from 1995 until 2009 and led the Padres to the playoffs four times.
Minaya, 56, was a senior vice president with the San Diego Padres, but that club underwent a regime change this offseason. He was also a GM with the Montreal Expos and New York Mets.
Malone, 57, spent parts of four seasons as general manager of the Dodgers from 1998 to 2001. He succeeded Duquette as the general manager of the Montreal Expos in 1994. He was an assistant GM with the Orioles under GM Pat Gillick from 1996 to 1998. Malone has been out of the pro baseball spotlight since 2001, concentrating on business ventures and a ministry degree.
If Duquette were to leave, the Orioles also could look into promoting someone from within to assist Showalter and Anderson.
Fans have been clamoring for a reunion of doom lords diSEMBOWELMENT pretty much since the band called it quits immediately following the release of their only album, 1993's Transcendence Into the Peripheral. Inverloch, a new project featuring two members of diSEMBOWELMENT (namely guitarist Matthew Skarajew and drummer Paul Mazziotta), may not quite mark the return of that legendary Australian outfit, but to call it “the next best thing” is, frankly, demeaning. Inverloch's debut album, Dusk/Subside, is so good that even if the diSEMBOWELMENT connection is what initially lures you in, the fact that the band has made something so supremely and deliciously EVIL sounding should make you stay — and respect this band as its own thing, different-but-equal to diSEMBOWELMENT.
But, hey, don't take our word for it — MetalSucks is proud to be streaming Dusk/Subside, in its entirety, below, in advance of its release on April 10. Headbang (very, very slowly) below, and once you've experience Inverloch in all their shadowy glory, pre-order the album here (we think the limited edition vinyl with a killer etching on the b-side is especially sweet). And don't forget to follow Inverloch on Facebook to stay up-to-date on all their movements, too.

New Graham-Cassidy bill draft to repeal Obamacare aims to win over Republican holdouts 9:03 AM ET Mon, 25 Sept 2017 | 00:54
President Donald Trump tweeted Sunday evening that Alaska, Arizona, Maine and Kentucky would be big winners under the Graham-Cassidy bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, pointedly mentioning states of four senators who have either said they are against or are leaning against the bill.
It would appear that the president was referring to funding revisions in Sunday's draft of the bill, a copy of which was obtained by CNBC.
The amendments would improve funding for the four states whose senators have opposed the legislation, specifically benefiting low-density population states such as Alaska and Maine. Another provision would allow Native Americans who obtained health coverage under the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion to retain coverage under traditional Medicaid.
As a result of the revisions, Alaska would see $1.4 billion more in federal Medicaid funding between 2020-2026, or a 3 percent increase compared with Obamacare over the period, according to a worksheet reportedly prepared by Trump administration health officials. Under the original bill, Alaska stood to lose roughly $2 billion.
The three other states would also gain. Arizona would gain $4.2 billion under the new draft calculations, roughly 14 percent, compared with a loss of $19 billion under the original plan. Maine stood to lose $2 billion between 2020-2027, but under the revised draft would gain nearly $1.5 billion. Kentucky would go from losing roughly $11 billion compared with Obamacare, to gaining $1.1 billion or 4 percent.
Voters will "expect" to see David Cameron and senior politicians debating their case for Britain staying or leaving the European Union, BBC veteran broadcaster David Dimbleby has said.
Mr Dimbleby hosted the only televised debate ahead of the last EU referendum in 1975 between Labour Cabinet ministers Tony Benn and Roy Jenkin.
He said he would prefer the debate to be in the form of a "Question Time" discussion, to allow members of the public to grill the leaders on Britain's membership of the EU.
Prime Minister David Cameron last month suggested he would agree to a televised debate ahead of the referendum on Britain's membership of the EU.
The Telegraph, YouTube and Buzzfeed are offering to co-host a debate on the issues in the lead-up to the EU referendum.

Mr Dimbleby told The Daily Telegraph he thought it would be "terrific if David Cameron appeared, arguing his corner".
He said: "As the vote gets closer people will want to see the case put on either side as effectively as either side can put it.
David Cameron will hand votes to the 'out' campaign if he fails to debate EU reforms publicly, says pollster
Three televised public debates should be held ahead of EU referendum, says former Labour trade minister Lord Jones
"People expect to see it, but it is for the politicians and protagonists on either side – it is for them to decide how best to put the case across.
"Politicians, ministers don't like being bullied about this kind of thing they want to make up their own minds how to do it most effectively.
"Much as the broadcasters may want a debate you can't force people into a debate – they have to decide.

"You can't drag people kicking and screaming into a studio and force them to answer questions, and we don't know which is going to be the official candidate and how it is going to be handled."
The veteran BBC broadcaster added: "I have form on this because I did the only debate for Panorama in 1975, which was between two members of Wilson's Cabinet – Tony Benn v Roy Jenkins – and it was very powerful and very effective.
“Harold Wilson freed his Cabinet to take sides – whether that will happen this time, we wait to see which if any members of the cabinet elect for out rather than remain. It is very early days.

Mr Dimbleby said he would like to see a Question Time-style debate similar to the event in Leeds during last year's general election when former Labour leader Ed Miliband was put on the spot by an audience member over his party's record on the economy.
He said: "The success of our 'Question Time' from Leeds with the three party leaders established beyond doubt that these big topics can be handled in that way beyond doubt, that is what I would like to see.
"They are more persuasive in front of an audience and being questioned by an audience than the rather arid tit for tat debate we have been seeing in the America primaries."

Meanwhile, the battle between campaign groups to be officially designated in the referendum campaign hotted up with Ukip and Leave.EU both throwing their weight behind the Grassroots Out body founded by MPs including Tom Pursglove, Peter Bone and Kate Hoey.
That came as rival Vote Leave, which had been considered the frontrunner to be designated by the Electoral Commission appears to have taken a hit with the departure of Ruth Lea as chair of the linked Economists For Britain. She told ITV News she was "pleased" to be away from "warring factions".
BIRMINGHAM, Alabama - A case of mistaken identity led to a shootout in Birmingham's Lakeview area that wounded a man and a woman Friday morning.
The pair was in a yellow pickup truck when gunfire erupted. One of the victims was shot in the head; the other in the arm. Police said both are expected to survive their injuries.
The shooting happened about 11 a.m. at the intersection of 30th Street and Third Avenue South, across the street from Pepper Place. Birmingham police spokesman Lt. Sean Edwards said it appears the shooting stemmed from a burglary that happened about a week ago.
The owner of the yellow pickup truck accused today's suspected shooter of breaking into his home and stealing items. He confronted the man last week and demanded his stolen items back. The suspect told him he would shoot him the next time he saw him, Edwards said.
This morning, the burglary victim's cousin was driving his yellow truck. He and the woman were traveling westbound when the shooter spotted it, and thought it was the owner driving.
He turned around, blocked in the truck, got out and opened fire, Edwards said. The man in the truck grabbed his own gun and returned fire.
Police and witnesses said at least six shots were fired.
The shooter fled from the scene in a silver Honda CRV. Police radio transmissions said there were three to four black males inside the fleeing SUV.
The male victim was shot in the shoulder area. The female victim was shot in the head. Both were conscious and alert as they were questioned by police at the scene and taken to UAB Hospital.
A witness was at his nearby business when he heard the shots ring out. He ran outside to see what was happening and check on other business owners in the area. The male victim was on the phone telling someone he'd been shot.
When police arrived on the scene, the witness said, the male victim told police the shooter's name and used his cell phone to show police a picture of the shooter on Facebook.
The victim also tried to call the shooter with officers standing there, and then told them, "He didn't answer."
The female victim, witnesses said, asked onlookers to call her mother and tell her she had been shot.
Police are actively searching for the shooters. No arrests have been announced.
Initial symptoms of Alzheimer's disease can appear up to 18 years before it is actually diagnosed, according to a new study published in Neurology journal. And, low scores on memory and thinking tests can predict the risk of the neurodegenerative disease much before the diagnosis, the study found.
“While we cannot currently detect such changes in individuals at risk, we were able to observe them among a group of individuals who eventually developed dementia due to Alzheimer's,” study author Kumar B. Rajan, assistant professor with Rush University Medical Center in Chicago said, in a press release.
In the 18-year-long study, researchers examined 2,125 European-Americans and African-Americans by giving them memory and thinking ability tests. The average age of the participants was 73 and they were required to take the tests every three years.
The researchers found that 23 percent of African-Americans and 17 percent of European-Americans developed Alzheimer's during the study time frame. The team noted that participants scoring less in the memory and thinking tests in the first year of the study had 10 times increased risk of developing Alzheimer's compared to those who scored well in the tests.
According to the researchers, the tests completed between 13 and 18 years of the final evaluation showed the greater risk of the disease. The team observed that one fewer unit in test performance was linked to an 85 percent increased risk of Alzheimer's, the most common form of dementia.
“A general current concept is that in development of Alzheimer's disease, certain physical and biologic changes precede memory and thinking impairment. If this is so, then these underlying processes may have a very long duration. Efforts to successfully prevent the disease may well require a better understanding of these processes near middle age,” Rajan said, in the release.
Statistics from the Alzheimer's Foundation of America estimate that about 5.1 million Americans likely have the disease, which is on the rise as the country's population ages. According to the estimates, about half a million Americans below the age of 65 have some form of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease.
– Garth Brooks made it clear Thursday he would go over to Ireland to beg the prime minster and play five now canceled shows if given the chance. He also said he had no clue in advance that troubles lay ahead for his now-canceled five concerts.
Brooks said he has no beef with the people of Ireland - he'd tell people to go there in an instant to experience the beauty of the country - but he sure does with the process that, thus far, has led to the cancellation of five sell-out shows in Dublin later this month.
"At no one time did anybody go 'whoa whoa wait,'" he said.
"The system is flawed," said Brooks before backtracking. "It's not my country to say that."
Brooks addressed the Irish concerts issue near the end of his presentation at the press conference announcing his return to recording and touring and the first two questions were from reporters from Irish publications.
"If we can pick one place on the planet to show them the most special place we think is coming, Ireland is the pick. This thing is monstrous. The reason why it is is it must match the quality and integrity of the Irish people."
"Today we should be laughing and joyous," Brooks said about his upcoming CD and touring, which were announced at the press conference. "We have this dark cloud all over us."
Brooks said if Prime Minster Enda Kenney called him, "I will drop on my knees and beg" to let the concerts go ahead and "let them have fun."
"In the '90s, controversy and Garth Brooks found each other," Brooks said during a question-answer section of the press conference. "Ireland, I don't have a clue. January, I went over for press. I was treated like a king. I have never been treated like anything else than a king."
"Everything was rocking," he said. "Every six months, you have a meeting where you have to pass their tests - safety, rigging...We passed those tests. Until about 10 days ago, 2 weeks ago, everything was love."
The Dublin City Council voted to allow Brooks to stage three concerts instead of the five that were already sold out with more than 400,000 slated to attend.
Brooks said he was told, "'You're going to have figure out the other two.' I wish I could tell you where it came from."
He said, "The statement was a simple yes, you can make 240,000 people happy. The response was with a simple yes, you can make 400,000 people happy. Open it up. Let people have fun."
Brooks has previously said he would not choose to allow some of his fans attend his shows.
"I don't think that's the way to treat people," Brooks said.
"Ireland should never be embarrassed. Its people should never be embarrassed," Brooks said in answering a question. "The system should be looking at itself, saying, 'we have flaws, and this is how it's done.'"
One suggestion floated was for Brooks to do matinees so the concerts would go more than three days. "I don't have a problem with matinees," he said. "I don't want to give them a half-assed show."
He indicated that the evening show was the complete show with a matinee lacking some offerings of the night, although he did not go into detail.
"I personally will do whatever it takes except canceling on people," he said.
Brooks said the Irish shows were unique to Ireland. "It's 255 feet wide, 20-feet tall. That's just the video screen."
"This isn't a show that you pick up and move," he said. "It's a one-time only thing."
He said 75 percent of ticket buyers were under 25. "They haven't seen us," he said. Brooks has not toured since 2001.
(Reuters) - A man wearing a white panda suit who allegedly made a bomb threat at Fox Television's Baltimore affiliate on Thursday was shot and wounded by police outside the building, authorities said.
Three Baltimore police officers opened fire on the man as he emerged from WBFF and ignored police orders to take his hands out of his pockets, police spokesman T.J. Smith told a news conference. The suspect was in serious but stable condition at a hospital.
Smith said the man had "displayed something that appeared to be wires and some other things inside his jacket that appeared to be some kind of explosive device." The device turned out to be composed of harmless materials, including chocolate candy bars wrapped in tin foil, he said.
WBFF reported on its website that the suspect, described by police as a 25-year-old man from Howard County, Maryland, broke into the station demanding that it cover a story about an unspecified government conspiracy. The station said the suspect made a bomb threat during the incident.
WBFF, which is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group , said a bomb robot scanned the man for nearly an hour before officers removed his clothing, picked him up and carried him to an armored police vehicle.
Station News Director Mike Tomko said on the station's website that the man was wearing a white, one-piece panda suit with a surgical mask and sunglasses.
"He had a flash drive, said he had information he wanted to get on the air. He compared it to the information found in the Panama Papers," Tomko said, referring to a massive leak of offshore financial data. "Apparently he had made some threats before."
A brief video on the station's website showed the man walking out of the station. No police or station employees were injured.
The station said it evacuated the building after the bomb threat and a car fire outside. It said firefighters put out a fire in the gas tank of the car, which authorities said was associated with the suspect, in the station's parking lot.
Authorities have not determined a motive for the suspect's behavior and said he was not cooperating with the police investigation.

I've mentioned our upcoming wall project a few times on this site. Above is the mockup and overhead drawing of what we're going to be building in 3 weeks. All of the terracotta-colored wall in that diagram is specifically what we'll be building. You can click here to take a look at the full-size wall diagram.
We'll be hosting a workshop here at the homestead on June 23rd & 24th. Find more details about the workshop on our events page. Also, don't forget to check out our contest:
The contest is now closed, thanks to everyone who signed up!
To register for the wall workshop email Scott@EarthenHand.com.
What Our Wall Will Look Like:
We're planning on using concrete stucco for our walls. While I like cob as a material, I want to have raised beds up against our wall, which means wet soil touching the surface of the wall. To do that, I have to be sure that the wall won't decompose, so concrete is the best option for this situation. Here are some photos I have accumulated from around the internet that give you an idea of what our wall will look like once completed:
Why On Earth We're Building a Wall:
We live on a busy arterial road, with lots of road noise. Our home blocks out the noise well, but a large part of why we bought our home was to be able to garden and enjoy our yard, and that's difficult to do with cars zipping by throughout the day. Yes, we should have accounted for that a little better before we moved in, but nevertheless, here we are with a noisy yard.
Options for Blocking Road Noise:
I spent a lot of time researching methods to block road noise. Near highways where the noise is exceptionally bad, it tends to be either a concrete wall or a berm. After lots of research, the summary is that plants won't block road noise, wood fences won't block much road noise, but a wall or barrier built with soil, water (like a cistern), or stone can block road noise well.
Berms work incredibly well, that probably would have been our first choice on a larger property. But, berms take up a wide space that we don't have, and visually… let's just say they're an acquired taste in an urban setting.
So basically we were left with the option to build a wall. We could have just built a tall cement wall and been done with it, but we wanted to do something more sustainable that required less cement, which isn't very environmentally-friendly.
Over the course of 6 months I considered a variety of natural building options including a straw bale wall, a cob wall, and a ferrocement wall that would double as a cistern. The final wall option that felt right was using earthbags. Using a cement stucco over the earthbags will use about 15% of the total concrete, and achieve the same visual look.
What the Heck Are Earthbags?
Earthbags are just normal polypropelene sand bags, but they're filled with dirt instead of sand. They get stacked on top of one another like bricks to form a structure, and they stick together with 4-prong barbed wire placed between them. After the structure is built with the earthbags, it is typically covered in a stucco or plaster made of cement, cob, or lime.
Here's a photo of an entire home being built with earthbags:
Here are photos of the same home after it was finished being covered with cob:
As you can see, once it's finished it doesn't look too different from any other natural building.
Finding Materials:
I thought that it would be difficult for us to find enough clay nearby for an entire cob wall. Earthbags, however, don't require a clay to sand mix ratio as specific as what's required by cob. Because of that, it seemed to be the easier project in terms of acquiring the materials necessary to complete it.
Our Wall Workshop with Earthen Hand:
After deciding earthbags was the method I wanted to use, I reached out to Scott Howard of Earthen Hand Natural Building in Portland, OR. Scott is the builder of the cob/earthbag home pictured above, as well as a bunch of other projects in the Pacific Northwest and abroad.
We decided the wall would be a good opportunity for a workshop here at Seattle Homestead, and set a date of June 23rd & 24th (3 weekends from now!). The workshop will feature 2 days of learning about how earthbag building works and what it can be used for, and then getting outside and getting hands-on experience with wall construction.
The cost of the workshop is $180 and includes lunch both days. Registration and signup info can be found on our events page. There is a discount for participants who bring a friend or sign up for another one of Earthen Hand's natural building workshops.
To register, email Scott@earthenhand.com and let him know you're interested in the Earthbag Building Basics Workshop on June 23/24 in Seattle.
Getting Ready for the Wall Workshop:
Over the last few months we've removed all of the ugly privets that used to surround the yard, taken out the 130 foot chain-link fence, and just had the property lines surveyed so we can dig the trench for the wall footing and be ready for the workshop in a couple weeks.
We're looking forward to showing you all what the finished product looks like!

And one priest has defended his decision to continue using the confessional box for students at St Augustine's Primary School in Yarraville. Father John O'Connor, has argued that this does not violate the Archbishop's call, as the child's door remains open, allowing for teacher supervision. Archbishop Hart said while canon law "requires" that confessions occur "with a fixed gate between the penitent and the confessor, it also allows for confessions to be heard outside a confessional under special circumstances". The letter described Victoria's new child safe standards as "special circumstances". In February, all five metropolitan Archbishops told a hearing of the federal child abuse royal commission that they would endorse a national standard that removed the use of confessional boxes for children.
When Father O'Connor hears primary school student confessions in the traditional booths, he keeps the child's door open, but keeps his own door shut. Father O'Connor said the child "is always in clear view of the other children in the church and the teacher". He said the confessionals were important because they gave students privacy. "The church has been in this game for a long time and it knows what is best for the penitents.
"Anonymity makes it easier for them to unburden themselves with anything in regard to sin," he said, noting that he had not been challenged about the confessionals in nearly 19 years as a priest. While there is no suggestion that Father O'Connor poses a risk to students' safety, child safety experts are asking priests to do away with confessional boxes when interacting with young children. Australian Childhood Foundation's chief executive Joe Tucci said best practice was to avoid enclosed spaces and secret interactions between adults and children. "It's not about the religious virtue of it, I'm not against children talking to priests about things, but I do believe that we should be encouraging and modelling to children that anything that promotes secrecy isn't a helpful orientation," he said. Dr Cathy Kezelman, president of Blue Knot Foundation, which supports child abuse victims, said even if the door of the child's confessional booth was open the room was still a "closed dark space".
"A lot of work is being done to make institutions and all aspects of institutions safe for children, where there can be transparency and visibility, and this would appear to be flying completely in the face of that." President of the Victorian Association of Catholic Primary School Principals, Michael Gray, said confessions of students at his school, St Joseph's Primary School in Warrnambool, were heard on the altar, where it is "open in front of the congregation". However Kate Drane, who is on the school's parents committee, said she supported the use of the booths. "The children are never unattended, at any time," she said. "I have faith in our school and our parish."
ALMOST 4 years after predicting the end of days in 2012, the Mayan Calendar has made what it claims to be its “final prediction” for the end of the world.
According to the latest interpretations of the ancient Mayan calendar, January 20th, 2017 will be mankind's final day of existence, an expert on the indigenous Mexican people told MSNBC. “The Mayans are quite sure they have it right this time,” he said. “They know they said that last time but this time it's definitely going to happen, rest assured.”
The calendar made the sudden prediction on the night of November 9th, Jose Diaz-Balart stated, after a group of elders had grown increasingly concerned of a “red mist descending from the North”.
Unlike previous occasions where apocalyptic prophecies' were garnered from a system of ancient Mesoamerican calendars, such as the Tzolk'in and the Haab', modern day elders have been exploring some alternative methods for making predictions, “mainly Twitter and Reddit”.
“Honestly I've never seen them this quietly confident about the immediate end of civilization,” Diaz-Balart explained. “They really feel they've nailed it this time and are mere months away from World War 3 and total armageddon.”

Xi'an Famous Foods co-owner and CEO Jason Wang posted a video to Facebook that shows a customer berating two black employees of the restaurant, eventually calling them the N-word.
In the video, which takes place at the 54th Street location of the restaurant chain, the customers started yelling, saying, among other things, “If you can't deal with the word ‘black,' then you should look at yourself in the mirror every day.” The exchange ended with one of the customers screaming, “Fuck you, n——-.” It is not clear what prompted the customers' behavior.
Update, 2:15 p.m.: Wang tells Eater that the customers came in shortly before closing time. “Since it was not busy that night, the cashier had already counted out the registers at that time. The two wanted to pay by cash, and the cashier asked if they can pay by card since he had already closed out, and tried to explain this to the two. The two were noticeably upset by this time and the cashier did take their payment by cash and the food was prepared normally. Nothing significant happened during the wait for the food, but after they received the food in a to-go bag, the Caucasian male started making the comments about the cashier's ‘community,' and that's the start of the video,” he explains.
[warning: explicit content: viewer discretion advised] These m... [warning: explicit content: viewer discretion advised] I am sorry to have to post this. I don't care if this is not the "PR" thing to do. While I'd rather be posting food related things for your enjoyment, this is beyond ridiculous and should be called out. It infuriates me and we need to acknowledge this type of thing still happens in NYC in this day and age. Take a look at these two men attacking our staff at our 54th Street location this past Sunday with hateful racial stereotypes/slurs, even going to far as screaming the n-word at them along with profanities. This is unacceptable. I personally would not have taken this as calmly as my staff did, and while there's no "Yelp" for me to give 1-stars to these two, I want to at least try to get some sense of justice by spreading awareness by highlighting how close racism still hits home. This disrespect for people got to stop, and for me, it needs to stop at our stores. If you know of these two, please inform them they are banned from our stores due to their behavior, and I encourage them to do some soul searching and make contributions to NAACP. Please share. ~Jason Wang President & CEO Nai-post ni Xi'an Famous Foods 西安名吃 noong Miyerkules, Mayo 10, 2017
Wang took to social media to call the customers out in the hopes of identifying them, with the intention of banning them from all Xi'an locations.
“I want to at least try to get some sense of justice by spreading awareness by highlighting how close racism still hits home,” he wrote alongside the video. “While I'd rather be posting food related things for your enjoyment, this is beyond ridiculous and should be called out. It infuriates me and we need to acknowledge this type of thing still happens in NYC in this day and age.”
This video comes just weeks after another racially charged alleged incident at West Village butcher shop Ottomanelli & Sons Meat Market. In that situation, white butcher Joe Ottomanelli reportedly gave Victor Sheppard, a black delivery man, a noose as a “gift.” Sheppard reported him to the police, who recently arrested Ottomanelli on hate crime charges.
Levi Strauss & Co., one of a handful of major clothing brands working with suppliers to reduce water and energy consumption, is championing a pilot program through which water is collected and reused during the laundering process. While only 100,000 pairs of jeans have been produced using recycled water so far, the company plans to expand the system to other of its 100 contract manufacturers and its four company-owned factories around the world, thereby shrinking the water footprint behind its denim by an order of magnitude. Beyond that, Levi Strauss is sharing its blueprints, so to speak, by publishing a guide to water recycling that it hopes other manufacturers will adopt.
Technically, the recycling system is not terribly complex. After laundering, the water is already sent through a filtration system to remove enough chemical and biological components to bring its quality up to snuff for effluent standards that Levi Strauss has set for itself (and which in some localities exceeds local standards for wastewater). To enable recycling, some treated water is diverted, further cleaned, and then piped into laundry machines to be used again. Some machines use 100 percent recycled water, others rely on a mix of recycled and fresh water.
It's a great stride toward more sensible water management policies. It's also a drop in the bucket—a big drop, but a drop nonetheless. Fortunately, this isn't the first water-saving step Levi Strauss has taken—in 2011, it began changing the way it produces clothing and those changes have saved around 770 million liters of water already.
Untapped potential
The textile industry as a whole has been slow to innovate on water consumption, says W. Gilbert O'Neal, president of the Institute of Textile Technology, which works with the North Carolina State University (ITT/NCSU) Textile and Material Research Consortium to provide research and consulting services to the industry. "I would say Levi's has taken a leadership role, because you don't see a lot of [water] reuse in the industry," he says.
On the other hand, recycling water is not always a simple matter of filtering wastewater and piping it back into an industrial machine. The risks are especially high in dyeing processes, which consume significantly more water than laundering, O'Neal says. "A major dye house might be using four to five gallons of water a day," he notes.
Because it is still fairly clear of dyes, effluent from final dye rinse baths can generally be reused, as a supplement to fresh water, in initial baths. But if the contaminants in the reused water are high enough to impact the desired color of the fabric, and the customer then rejects the resulting product, the factory has suddenly wasted far more than just water.
In some cases, recycling water could concentrate certain contaminants, such as salts from dyes, in the water, which could throw the energy equation out of whack. "In parts of the world where water supply is not limited, it's generally going to take more energy to render that water to a level where it can be reused than it would be to purchase clean water," O'Neal says.
Of course, the cost of clean water is only going to grow in most parts of the world, so forward-looking corporations must begin building systems for reuse now. Plus, tracking the amounts and hazards of chemical inputs is just as important as reducing water consumption. Michael Kobori, vice president, Supply Chain Social and Environmental Sustainability at Levi Strauss & Co., says water recycling is "one part of a broader supplier chemical management program that limits or eliminates the use of certain chemicals in the manufacture of Levi Strauss & Co. products."
Greenpeace has conducted a years-long campaign to raise awareness around the apparel industry's use of certain chemical groups, including nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs) and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), that have been linked to environmental toxicity and human health problems. A number of clothing brands, including Levi Strauss & Co., have committed to phase out the use of these target chemicals, which Greenpeace claims cannot be removed using conventional wastewater filtration systems but can be replaced with cost-comparable alternatives.
O'Neal admits many textile factories have subpar water treatment systems that fail to properly contain those toxins, but says those with properly designed wastewater treatment systems can treat NPEs (used in surfactants) adequately. More research is needed into the long-term safety and viability of alternatives, he adds.
"When it comes to NPEs," O'Neal says. "You need surfactants. You need detergents to emulsify and clean materials and keep those contaminants from going back onto the fabric. So we need to do research to find detergents that are more biodegradable and still have the same effectiveness [as detergents that contain NPEs]. When people call for the banning of certain substances, it has to be looked at very carefully so that you're not throwing out good applications of those chemicals."

The time has come to take a long hard look at abolishing the Democratic and Republican political parties. America stands divided politically, socially and economically and the seed of division has been planted in our government. Party affiliation has taken precedent over common sense and country. Republicans and Democrats alike, push and pull for power within government, taking what amounts to blood money from lobbyists, special interest groups, and corporations that have no intention of serving the greater good.
Conversations between constituents are often colored blue or red without regard to facts, only allegiance to a party. We tune each other out with labels and ignorance, based on preconceived political ideology. We don't listen to each other and our government, in turn, doesn't listen to us. Democratic and Republicans often vote on party lines regardless of conscience. In-house feuds lead to petty score-settling and the infantile games of tit for tat, leave American citizens as the inevitable loser in the equation.
Party over common sense and conscience is a dangerous and real threat to the ideals of democracy. From the perspective of voters, casting a ballot solely in blind allegiance to party serves no one. Candidates for office often highlight party talking points simply for voter and financial support, without actually having any real or effective game plan for implementation. Prospective party driven officials, also are susceptible to the influence of private donations from corporate entities, that only have their own bottom line in mind. Policy is frequently dictated by corporate dollars donated to political parties, instead of in the interest the greater good of American citizens.
There has never been an independent president in America. The current monopoly of Republican and Democratic parties stifles and crushes the idea of independent thought. Money is a driving force in politics and ideas are an afterthought. Decent men and women who would otherwise serve honorably, are hindered by a system of greed and cronyism. We The People, aren't having our interests served, when our officials are locked into an operation that serves the upper class only. Finances should not be the end all, be all loudest voice in government.
Personal values of candidates also come into play in a party system. No Republican or Democrat embodies ALL of the ideals of its respective party. We have seen politicians from both sides of the aisle embroiled in a scandal that represents the direct opposite philosophy of their party platform. From sexuality to abortion and everything in between, officials have demonstrated that they may lean in a certain direction, but don't govern themselves entirely by platform. How can we expect honest representation in government when our officials aren't even honest with themselves?
Candidates who aren't pigeonholed within the constraints of archaic ideology may, in fact, serve the common core of America better than what we've witnessed thus far under the status quo model. America requires innovative thought that encompasses the best of all platforms and beyond. The country is in dire need of a government that understands that social harmony is just as important as economic growth. Under the current system that is simply impossible. Our way of governing has become stale and ripe for the seeds of corruption and indifference to grow.
Special interest groups and private corporations have bullied their way into our government, by infiltrating political parties with the lure of the almighty dollar. Money is indeed the root of all evil, and within the structure of government, cash destroys the foundation of a democratic society. Abolishing political parties could be the first step in fending off the insidious practices of quid pro quo, brought on by special interest groups such as the NRA and corporate henchmen, like the Koch brothers.
Our government as it stands today, is rife with self-serving, tone-deaf men and women who exploit holes in the system for personal and party gain. Agendas are short-sighted, lack inclusiveness, vision, and national accountability. We cannot continue down the same path politically and expect real change in our lives. The world around us is rapidly changing, and yet our government remains the same in spite of itself. Our system is clearly broken, and it must be rebuilt with the future in mind, instead of the past.
Democrats and Republicans alike, have done a porous job advocating for the citizens which they serve. Party over country has no place in America, and it's time that we consider the kind of change that would empower a true representation of America. Our government needs bold, brilliant, compassionate, visionary leaders and that is something that would make America truly great again. The time for real change is upon us.
Our Celtic complexions may be coveted by many, but it's not always easy to live with skin that burns easily, freckles in the sunshine and is more prone to certain conditions. Having typically Irish skin - fair, pale and more likely sensitive than not - is wonderful when it's in good nick, but if you're experiencing skin troubles or just wondering how to manage your porcelain complexion as you age, this is what you need to know.
Our Celtic complexions may be coveted by many, but it's not always easy to live with skin that burns easily, freckles in the sunshine and is more prone to certain conditions. Having typically Irish skin - fair, pale and more likely sensitive than not - is wonderful when it's in good nick, but if you're experiencing skin troubles or just wondering how to manage your porcelain complexion as you age, this is what you need to know.
1 The fairest of them all
"The most common skin type among Irish women is categorised in dermatology terms as Fitzpatrick's type 1-2," explains Selene Daly, dermatology clinical nurse specialist working with Elave. "This is skin that burns easily in the sun, freckles and is light in colour."
So this means that pale Irish people are truly the fairest of them all and, as a result, predisposed to more skin conditions.
2 Everybody wants it
Throughout her career, Selene has found that the Celtic complexion is in fact coveted abroad. "It's said that our Korean counterparts have a 17-step skincare routine in an attempt to gain translucent, clear skin."
In fact, the use of bleaching creams is popular abroad to achieve paler skin.
3 High risk of cancer
Irish skin is more at risk for skin cancer, which is one of the most common forms of cancer in Ireland. "According to the Irish Cancer Society, we have over 10,000 cases of skin cancer diagnosed in this country every year," says Selene. "Most skin cancers occur on the face, ears, neck, arms and lower legs, and over 90pc of skin cancer is caused by overexposure to UV light which can occur from the sun or sunbeds."
Ironic, perhaps, in a country that doesn't get much sunshine, but could perhaps be related to our fair skin, or our lack of care when it comes to sun safety. Detection is key with any kind of cancer, so if you've noticed any unusual changes in your skin, do get it checked out by your GP. Melanoma, or a cancerous mole, is a very common type but skin cancer is not restricted to just your moles.
4 No sunbeds
By now, everyone should know that using a sunbed is risky business when it comes to your health, but a lot of Irish people seem to think that getting a "base" colour before holidays by using one of the machines is better than baring your pale, underexposed skin to the foreign sun. In fact, according to Ipsos, 12pc think it is safe to go out in the sun without protection if already tanned. Not true.
"Sunbeds are classed as a level one carcinogen and it is now illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to use a sunbed in Ireland," says Selene. "An American study found recently that, worldwide, there are more cases of skin cancer due to indoor tanning than there are lung cancer cases due to smoking."
Using a sunbed means concentrated exposure to UVA rays, which can cause skin cancer. So it's not just UVB rays that cause sunburn that will leave you at risk - many people think it's the burn that's the issue, but that's not the case.
5 Wear sunscreen year round
Fair people need to wear sunscreen most of the year. "The most important part of any skincare routine should be daily use of sunscreen between the March 1 and the September 30 - regardless of the weather," says Selene. "This is the season where the UV levels are at their highest, increasing the chance of burning."
It might seem like an awful lot of hassle, but sun creams and oils are a lot more sophisticated now, and instead of sitting on your skin in a white, gloopy mess, they can hydrate and even improve the look of your skin.
Buying a daily moisturiser and foundation that includes SPF is an easy way to make sure your face is protected at all times.
6 We are prone to rosacea...
Anyone with pale skin knows that redness shows up far more easily on fair skin, and can often lead to skin looking discoloured. CC (colour correcting) creams have become popular here as they help balance out the skin tone, but if you have a condition like rosacea, it can be a little more tricky to manage flare-ups.
"Terrifyingly known as the curse of the Celts, rosacea is an extremely common skin condition," explains Selene. "Rosacea tends to affect the cheeks, forehead, chin and nose, and is characterised by redness, dilated blood vessels, also known as telengectasia, small red bumps and on occasion pus-filled spots often with a tendency to blush easily. Triggers for rosacea include spicy foods, alcohol, moving from cold to hot temperatures and exposure to UV light.
"As a basic measure, it is important to use skincare which is sensitive and won't block pores, and again, the most important part of the skincare routine for sufferers of rosacea is daily use of a high SPF."
7... and keratosis pilaris - bumpy skin
Another issue that shows up on pale skin, keratosis pilaris occurs when there's a build up of keratin that blocks the opening of the hair follicle. It's common on the backs of the arms and the thighs, and while it doesn't really have any symptoms apart from discomfort when it's dry, it can be unsightly, causing red bumps and a rough feeling to touch. Exfoliating and using a moisturiser that contains salicylic acid or urea can help break down the keratin build up, but unfortunately there is no cure.
8 Beware of free radicals
We need to watch out for free radicals. "Free radical activity is responsible for many undesirable skin changes including photo damage lines and wrinkles and skin cancer. It's caused primarily by overexposure to UV light and pollutants such as smoking and environmental issues," explains Selene. "Using an antioxidant with a concentrated vitamin C base can protect against free radicals, and can reduce redness and hyperpigmentation."
9 Dry, sensitive or oily?
"It's so important to know your baseline, whether we have dry, sensitive, combination or oily skin, so an effective skincare routine can be formulated."
Whether you visit a dermatologist to find out or a beauty counter, a trained professional will be able to establish your skin type and recommend products to suit it. Oily skin may feel greasy but it still needs hydration, while combination skin means different areas of the face may need to be treated differently.
Selene recommends visiting a dermatologist to deal with hyperpigmentation and acne, as well as thread veins which can benefit from IPL treatment.
10 Hurrahs for vitamin A
Vitamins A and C are fair skin savers. "vitamin A in the form of retinol is an old dermatology solution for both acne and anti-ageing. It's extremely effective with a long-standing list of clinical data to back up it's efficacy, but it's recommended to build up the strength gradually as it can irritate," says Selene.
It's important to note that it can increase photosensitivity, so exposure to UV light is a no-no when using retinol. Vitamin C helps our skin in lots of ways, from boosting collagen production to helping maintain a healthy complexion.
11 Read the ­ingredients
If you've got eczema or psoriasis, read the ingredients on your skincare packaging as you would on food labels. "Try to select products which have little or no preservatives, because these can trigger eczematous reactions even in women without a history of sensitive skin," says Selene.
If you're worried about sensitivity, go for the most natural products possible.
12 Watch what you eat
In Ireland, we're known for not having the healthiest of diets despite the abundance of fresh produce grown here. A bad diet can mean unhealthy skin, and fair skin is susceptible to flare-ups. If you're suddenly suffering from eczema, psoriasis, adult acne or hyperpigmentation, a blood test can determine if you have any food allergies or intolerances.
13 We are prone to adult acne
As with other skin conditions, fair skin can make red, swollen spots look even angrier. Adult acne is more common nowadays, and the first instinct for many is to go at it with harsh products or chemicals. Selene advises patience and care, as well as avoiding overly abrasive products. "Oil free or 'non-comedogenic' cleansers and moisturisers should be used to treat the skin twice daily, but if skincare alone does not clear up the problem, then the advice of a GP or dermatologist should be sought.
"Remember what your mother said and never pick or squeeze spots either, as it can lead to scarring."
14 Our foundation is too dark
Blogger Leanne Woodfull has tried lots of different foundations to find one that matches her alabaster complexion, and has found that two brands that are known for making make-up for fair ladies are Rimmel and MAC. The latter is a pricier option, but its foundations and concealers are separated in to two categories - NW and NC.
NW is for skin with a pinkish tone, so that's most fair-skinned, typically Irish ladies. The shade NW10 is very pale. However, Rimmel's budget option is even paler in the shade Light Porcelain, and more widely available.
15 We love faking it
Fair-skinned ladies are happy to fake it. However, not all pale ladies are content to stay that way - research shows that we have the highest use of fake tan per capita, with Irish self-tanning brands growing all the time to meet the demand.
If you desire a bit of a glow, it's certainly best to reach for the fake stuff - safer than tanning or sunbeds, with no skin damage and it can reduce the appearance of certain skin conditions like keratosis, pilaris and psoriasis without aggravating them.

Franky Zapata, the French jet ski champion who invented the Flyboard Air, has set a new Guinness World Record for the farthest hoverboard flight. Zapata achieved the feat Saturday morning off the coast of Sausset-les-Pins in the South of France, riding his Flyboard Air hoverboard for a distance of more than 2,252 meters (7,388 feet). That far surpasses the previous record of 275.9 meters (905 feet, 2 inches), set last year by Canadian inventor Catalin Alexandru Duru.
Zapata, 37, gained wide attention online earlier this month after videos of him riding the Flyboard Air went viral. Some doubted whether the footage was real or merely a marketing gimmick. His company, Zapata Racing, has developed a wide range of water-propelled devices, including the original Flyboard, which connects to a personal watercraft turbine with a long hose. The Flyboard Air, by contrast, uses an "Independent Propulsion Unit" to fly hose-free for up to 10 minutes, according to Zapata Racing. The company says the device can reach a maximum height of 10,000 feet, with a maximum speed of 150 kilometers per hour (93 miles per hour).
Around 200 people gathered to see Zapata complete the record-setting ride this morning at Sausset-les-Pins, a small seaside city near Marseille. He took off from a platform along the coastline, rising to at least 100 feet above the water, and was trailed throughout the flight by a fleet of boats and jet skis. Speaking to the audience afterward, a beaming Zapata thanked his team for helping him achieve the feat, which he said had been working toward for five years.
"This has really been a life's work."
"This has really been a life's work," he told reporters at a press conference following the flight.
In an interview following the flight, Zapata said he was most nervous about the launch this morning, but he said his fears disappeared once he was up in the air. The experience, he says, is indescribable. "It's an amazing sensation, it's really peaceful," he said. "I open my arms because it helps me control my movements, but when you open your hands and you feel the wind go through your hand and you have nothing under your feet — it's hard to describe, really. You have to experience this moment in your life."
In an interview with The Verge this month, Zapata said it took four years to develop the Flyboard Air, including algorithms that control the angle of its turbines and adjust its power. The Flyboard Air has four 250-horsepower turboengines, which are fueled by Jet A1 kerosene carried in a tank strapped to its rider's back. (Two other engines are on each side of the board, for stabilization.) Riders use a hand remote to control the engines' throttle.
Others have developed similar devices, though none are quite as spectacular as the Flyboard Air. Duru, the previous world record holder, created a hoverboard that's powered by propellers, and companies like Lexus and ArcaSpace have come out with more traditional hoverboards that fly closer to the ground.
"My goal is to ride the clouds."
Zapata's system is still very new; Saturday's record-setting ride comes just two months after the Flyboard Air's first successful run, and he told reporters that prior to the flight, he had only spent a total of about two hours flying it. The inventor has acknowledged that it's not the kind of thing people could just pick up and learn, but he says his company has already begun working on a smaller, more consumer-friendly version that riders could fly while seated.
In an interview with The Verge Saturday, Zapata said he dreams of the day when he can just "pick up my Flyboard and fly to work," saying he still needs to extend the Flyboard Air's flight time before it can be widely adopted. He also thinks it could help military and other security forces respond to emergencies and combat terrorism in densely populated areas. "If people are able to fly like this, they can be some kind of superhuman," he said. "And they can help save people in this completely mad world."
His longer-term goals sound even more ambitious. "You won't believe it. We will fly the clouds," Zapata told The Verge earlier this month. "My goal is to ride the clouds. Do like snowboarding in the powder, but I want to do it in a cloud. That's my dream, and I will do my best to realize that."
Update April 30th, 7:17AM ET: This article has been updated to include quotes from Franky Zapata.
CIA 'helped Saddam Hussein carry out chemical weapons attack on Iran' in 1988 under Ronald Reagan
U.S. fed intelligence to Iraq about whereabouts of Iranian forces
Iraq deployed mustard gas and sarin in 1988 on the back of the information
U.S. administration supported Iraq during the eight-year conflict
Up to 20,000 Iranian troops were killed by mustard gas and nerve agents from Iraqi forces during the war
The United States helped Saddam Hussein attack Iran with chemical weapons in the 1980s during the Iran-Iraq war, it has been claimed.
Ronald Reagan's administration, who supported the Iraqi dictator topple two decades later by the Bush government, fed information to Baghdad that helped them launch strikes.
U.S. officials gave Saddam's army details about the whereabouts of Iranian forces in 1988 knowing that he would deploy chemical weapons, Foreign Policy magazine reported.
Forces: Iraqi soldiers seen in 1980 at the start of the eight-year conflict with Iran. An estimated 20,000 Iranian troops were gassed to death
'Support': Secret documents reveal that former President Ronald Reagan's administration acquiesced in Iraq's use of chemical weapons
Iraq used mustard gas and sarin in early 1988 in four major offensives which helped bring about the end of the eight-year conflict.
During the whole war, up to 20,000 Iranian troops were killed by mustard gas and nerve agents from Iraq and 100,000 were wounded.
They were able to launch the strikes after being given maps, satellite pictures and other intelligence by the U.S.
The Americans have always said that Iraq did not reveal that they would launch chemical strikes.
But documents released in the National Archives and interviews with former serviceman show that the U.S. acquiesced in the use of chemical weapons as they tried to help Saddam with the war
Foreign Policy magazine
Retired Air Force Colonel Rick Francona, a military attache who was working in Baghdad in 1988, told Foreign Police magazine said that they knew what Saddam was planning.
' The Iraqis never told us that they intended to use nerve gas. They didn't have to. We already knew," he told Foreign Policy.
Official documents revealed that the U.S. officials were given detailed information about the use of nerve gas by the Iraqis during the conflict. They indicate that the Americans knew more about Saddam's use of chemical weapons than previously thought.
The CIA's Director of Central Intelligence William J Casey was given detailed intelligence about the efforts of Iraqi chemical weapons plants to produce mustard gas for troops.
Dictator: The U.S. supported Saddam Hussein during the war Iraq-Iran war. Two decades later, he was captured by U.S. troops after being felled
The cache of newly-released documents also revealed that the Americans feared the Iranians may launch terror strikes against the U.S. around the world if they had evidence to suggest the Ronald Reagan's administration acquiesced in Saddam's use of chemical weapons.
One secret document from September 1984, headed 'The Islamic bomb: Chemical rather than nuclear?', revealed the scale of Iraq's chemical weapons programme.
It said: 'Iraq has over the last several years developed a substantial CW (chemical weapons) production capability.
Conflict: Iranian soldiers praying during operation Nasser VII, northwest of the Irano-Iraqi front in August 1987
'CIA presently estimates that Iraq is capable of producing at least two tons per day of the nerve agent.'
Another document, marked 'Top Secret' from January 1985, indicated that the Iraqis would use chemical weapons against Iran.
It said: 'The Iraqis have used chemical weapons in three separate battles beginning in August 1983 and will use chemical weapons on a wide scale in the event of another major Iranian attack.'
The Geneva Protocol of 1925, which the Americans had ratified in 1975, states undertake that they will not use chemical weapons and agree they ' will exert every effort to induce other States' to do the same.
We're pleased to release Sassquatch, a native Sass previewer for OS X.
Between client projects and open source tools, we spend a considerable amount of our time writing Sass.
Typically, we would have a Web server running locally and a process monitoring Sass changes such as Rails, Gulp.js, or sass --watch . Additionally, we often use a browser auto-reload tool such as LiveReload or BrowserSync.
While this setup works fine for most typical Web projects, it becomes extremely tedious when all you need is isolating a bug, exploring a new Sass feature, or spiking a new function or mixin. There are online tools that attempt to help with this, but their speed and reliability are inconsistent.
This is why we set out to build a Sass output previewer that requires no setup or use of the command line. Just open any .scss file in Sassquatch to immediately preview the CSS output. Better yet, you don't have to reopen the file when you modify it in your code editor; Sassquatch will refresh as soon as you save the file.
Sassquatch defaults to a two-pane layout displaying both the Sass source and the CSS output. If you don't need to look at the source, you can toggle the left pane off.
You can download a free, time-limited trial or purchase an unrestricted license on the Sassquatch website.
ROCHESTER, Minn. (AP) — More than 100 students in Rochester will be sent home from school on Wednesday unless they can prove they've been vaccinated or are exempt.
School officials said last week that starting March 1, students who can't provide proper immunization paperwork will be sent home. State law requires that students be immunized or be officially exempt for reasons such as health or religion.
School officials have said they've been working since January to tell families about the requirements. Last week, the Rochester Post-Bulletin reported that more than 200 students still hadn't provided paperwork, prompting school officials to announce that students without the paperwork would be sent home.
The Star Tribune reported that after that announcement, dozens of students provided the paperwork. But 115 still had not complied as of Tuesday.
When those students get to school on Wednesday, they'll be taken out of class and brought to school offices, where administrators will try to reach parents or guardians to resolve the situation, said Heather Nessler, a Rochester Public Schools spokeswoman.
“We'll just keep working to make sure that either they visit Public Health or one of the clinics in town to fill out the proper forms,” Nessler said. She also said students will be allowed back in school once the paperwork is in.
Last week, the school board made the decision to remove students because of the high number of those without immunizations or valid exemptions.
“We've been working extremely hard to reach out to families … try to help them,” Superintendent Michael Munoz said last week. “But we finally got to the point where we had to draw a line and say, ‘you need to get this done by this date.'”
Munoz said the district is talking about ways to provide families with access to immunizations before the next school year begins.

FOXBOROUGH, Mass. – New England Revolution defender Je-Vaughn Watson has been called in by the Jamaica National Team for its upcoming 2018 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers against Panama and Haiti. Watson will depart for international duty on August 29 and return to the Revolution on September 6.
Watson, 32, is set to represent Jamaica against Panama on Sept. 2 and Haiti on Sept. 6 in the Fourth Round of CONCACAF World Cup Qualifying. Jamaica currently sits in third place in Group B with four points, ahead of Haiti by three points but trailing Panama by three points and Costa Rica by six points. Only the top two teams in the group will advance to The Hex – the fifth and final round of CONCACAF World Cup Qualifying.
The Saint Catherine Parish native has accrued 58 international caps for his career, most recently representing the Reggae Boyz at this summer's Copa America Centenario, where he started all three of the team's matches. In Jamaica's last round of World Cup Qualifiers in March, Watson scored his second career international goal against Costa Rica.
Watson has established himself as a versatile mainstay on the Revolution's back line and in the midfield since joining the club ahead of the 2016 season. He has appeared in 25 matches and made 22 starts across all competitions, recording three goals and one assist.
US popstar Ariana Grande will return Sunday to the city that was the target of an Islamist suicide attack last week.
Her publicist confirmed Tuesday that Grande would hold a concert in memory of the victims of the Manchester bombing.
- Manchester's music scene after the terror attack
- MI5 launches internal review over Manchester bombing
Grande will be joined by Justin Bieber, Coldplay, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, Pharrell Williams, Usher and Take That. The June 4 concert tickets will be offered free to fans who were at Grande's May 22 show targeted by Salman Abedi, a Manchester-born Islamist of Libyan descent.
The "One Love Manchester" show will be held at Old Trafford cricket stadium and proceeds will go to an emergency fund set up by the city of Manchester and the British Red Cross.
In a statement after the attack, Grande said "we won't let this divide us. We won't let hate win. Our response to this violence must be to come closer together, to help each other, to love more, to sing louder and to live more kindly and generously than we did before."
Born in Florida in 1993, Ariana Grande's professional career already spans close to a decade - despite her young age. A child protege, Grande started appearing on Broadway when she was only 13 years old. She landed a major part in the Nickelodeon hit series "Victorious" soon after and was given her own spin-off show on the children's network. She later released her first album in 2013.
Manchester: Open-minded and multi-cultural Metropolis with a campus The city with 2.6 million inhabitants is, next to Birmingham, the economic and cultural center of England's North West. Birmingham and Manchester have had a long rivalry over which of the two is Britain's second-biggest city. One thing Manchester definitely has is the biggest university campus in Great Britain. With some 100,000 students it has one the world's biggest student populations.
Manchester: Open-minded and multi-cultural Scientist and visionary The Alan Turing memorial commemorates the computer pioneer who taught at the university here from 1948. He rose to fame during World War II for helping to break the German Enigma code, which in turn greatly influenced the course of the war. In Manchester, he developed software for the first computer and conducted research into artificial intelligence.
Manchester: Open-minded and multi-cultural Industrial city Manchester played a pivotal role in the Industrial Revolution. During the 19th century, it developed into the center of the British textile industry and became synonymous with unbridled capitalism. The Museum of Science and Industry, located in Liverpool Road Station, the world's oldest (1830) passenger train station, is devoted to the development of science, technology and industry.
Manchester: Open-minded and multi-cultural Roman heritage In the Castlefield district the remains of a Roman fort, Mamucium or Mancunium, which gave its name to Manchester, was found and reconstructed. In the 18th century, Castlefield was in the middle of a network of canals. On the Irweil river towpath, a 1.5 km walk leading to the Salford Quays was created. An eye-catcher is Beetham Tower, at 171 meters (554 ft.) the highest skyscraper outside London.
Manchester: Open-minded and multi-cultural Standstill and transformation Salford Quays is a former industrial area of Greater Manchester. It came to a standstill during the 1980s as industry declined. Setting an example for other European industrial areas, it became one of the first and largest urban regeneration projects in the United Kingdom following the closure of the dockyards in 1982. Modern housing, theater and event locations were created.
Manchester: Open-minded and multi-cultural Art and culture The Lowry is a theater and music complex on Salford Quays. It consists of two theaters, a broad promenade, small cafes and concert stages. It is named after 20th century artist L.S. Lowry (1887-1987), known for his paintings of industrial scenes in North West England. The complex is also home to the Lowry Collection, a permanent exhibition of some 400 works from all periods of his career.
Manchester: Open-minded and multi-cultural International and multi-cultural Manchester is a multi-cultural city. Nowhere else in Europe will you find a greater number of people from ethnic minorities living side by side. Only New York is thought to have more. Manchester University established that 153 languages are spoken in the city. Many occasions are celebrated in Manchester - be it the Hindu Holi-Festival (pictured), the Chinese New Year or the Caribbean Carnival.
Manchester: Open-minded and multi-cultural Parks and gardens City-dwellers need recreational areas. Manchester has an astonishing number of parks and gardens, 135 in total. The most important of these is Heaton Park in the north of the city. With its 250 hectares it is one of Europe's biggest public parks. Hyde Park in London is only 142 hectares big and the English Garden in Munich counts 417 hectares.
Manchester: Open-minded and multi-cultural Music and festivals Manchester has produced many famous bands, either home-grown or founded here, among them Oasis and Take That. Due to its vibrant music and club scene the city is also affectionately known as "Madchester." Music is everywhere. Festivals take place all summer long, this year numbering 30. The Parklife Festival with 70,000 visitors is one of the biggest.
Manchester: Open-minded and multi-cultural Football passion Two local football clubs, Manchester City and Manchester United, play in the Premier League. The National Football Museum is dedicated to all who have played a part in English football history, like David Beckam. In the "Hall of Fame" you can see the best national players while screens show the greatest moments in the national sport.
Manchester: Open-minded and multi-cultural A song to give courage "You'll never walk alone" from the musical Carousel, tells people not to give up hope. Rumor has it that Manchester United fans sang the song at Old Trafford back in the 1950s, before great rivals Liverpool made it world famous. No other fan song better epitomizes solidarity and team spirit. Author: Anne Termèche (sbc)

A high-profile advocate for marijuana legalization has filed her papers to run as a Liberal in the next federal election, putting the spotlight on an issue that the Conservatives have used to attack Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau.
Jodie Emery filed her nomination papers Monday in Vancouver East, a riding the NDP has held since 1997. Ms. Emery is a prominent marijuana legalization advocate, along with her husband Marc Emery, known as the "Prince of Pot," who returned to Canada last month after serving an American jail sentence over selling marijuana seeds.
Her path to candidacy, however, remains unclear. The party declined comment, though one Liberal source cautioned early signs are "it will not be smooth sailing" for Ms. Emery despite her high profile. She'll go through the normal process to be approved as a candidate for the Liberal nomination in the riding.
Story continues below advertisement
Ms. Emery, however, has the backing of local Liberals, including a former riding president, who is currently the party's election-readiness chair in the riding, and the local Liberal association's vice-president. She says they approached her to run.
"I understand the Liberals don't want the media marijuana star couple trying to steal the limelight or whatever, but it's not about us. For Marc and I, it's about trying to get [Stephen] Harper out of office. For me, that's my primary goal," Ms. Emery, 29, said Monday. "… For many proud Canadians who are disappointed in this government, I think the Liberal party offers a great party to join and support to take back this country for the people, the environment and everything else that is so important."
She has previously run for the provincial Green Party, but said she chose the Liberals in part because they are the only party "that can replace the Harper government" in next year's election.
"Justin Trudeau represents new, fresh leadership. I feel like he's somebody who may be called a blank slate, but that's somebody that's open to ideas. He wants to base his policies on facts and science, not on ideology the way Harper does," Ms. Emery said.
Liberal party spokesman Olivier Duchesneau declined to comment on Ms. Emery's would-be candidacy, but said the riding's nomination race has not yet been formally opened. "Every Canadian can enter the process, go online and request a nomination package and submit it. We never comment on a hypothetical candidate," Mr. Duchesneau said.
However, one Liberal source said party officials already expect questions for Ms. Emery that could derail her candidacy "just based on what's available on the public record at this time." Another source said Ms. Emery's nomination would be a long shot and that the riding is considered the "least winnable" in Vancouver.
Ms. Emery, however, said she's looking forward to speaking with a Liberal selection committee.

"I'm looking forward to talking to them though. I'm confident in everything I've done, and even if I said something outrageous, I'm a human being, I can own up to that or apologize or whatever it may be. I stand true to my principles more than anything else," she said.
Mr. Trudeau also favours marijuana legalization, and the Conservatives have regularly targeted him and the Liberals on the issue. Recently, on Sept. 5, a party fundraising e-mail signed by International Trade Minister Ed Fast attacked the Liberals by saying "the only trade they're interested in is the marijuana trade."
A new electoral map is being introduced for next year's election, but the current Vancouver East seat is held by NDP MP Libby Davies, who has won it consecutively since 1997. Ms. Emery ran in 2009 and 2013 for the B.C. Green Party, earning 11 per cent of the vote in last year's race.
Editor's note: An earlier version of this story said one of Ms. Emery's backers is a former vice-president of the local riding association. In fact, he is still vice-president. This story has been updated.
GREENBURGH, N.Y. -- The New York Knicks have lost six straight games, but first-year coach Derek Fisher has seen no finger-pointing so far.
Fisher says the Knicks might've looked to place blame elsewhere last season but feels the locker room is stronger this season.
"It actually is good," Fisher said when asked if he has seen any doubt creep in during the slide. "We continue to see more resolve as we have gone on. As we go through this process, we have more and more guys taking individual responsibility and accountability for what's going and how we each can help the team get better. And that is important to building a team and a culture -- owning what is happening with the team.
"I think in the past, there have been issues with more finger-pointing out as opposed to finger-pointing in. We are now having a locker room of guys that are pointing to themselves about how they can help us get better."
Last season, obviously, Fisher wasn't the coach. But he was aware of how Knicks players seemed splintered at times and how some questioned former coach Mike Woodson's schemes during a 37-45 season. The Knicks had losing streaks of nine and seven games in 2013-14.
The Knicks (2-7) hope to stop their slide on Friday when the Utah Jazz visit Madison Square Garden. The Knicks' latest loss, a 97-95 decision to the Magic, ended with J.R. Smith launching a contested 27-footer at the buzzer.

Smith said he didn't want to force the ball to Carmelo Anthony at the end or put the star in a position to take a very difficult shot -- what likely would have been a catch-and-turn fadeaway near the 3-point elbow.
"Forcing it to Carmelo [is] not necessarily the best decision either, so in terms of J.R.'s decision to get a shot up himself, I think as a coach you prefer getting a shot up as opposed to forcing the basketball to even your best player," Fisher said. "But at the same time, I think it's just a matter of understanding the time, the score, the situation, what options you have available to you once the ball comes inbounds with 3.5 seconds left.
"But we cleaned some of that up today in terms of understanding what we want on that sequence. And I think that will help, not just J.R. but all of our guys, the next time we're in that spot."
Fisher also said Anthony doesn't always have to take the last shot with a game on the line.
"It's a team game, so I don't think that the franchise guy or the superstar guy has to win the game for you every time," Fisher said. "Michael [Jordan] passing to Steve Kerr, you know, Michael passing it to Scottie [Pippen], passing it to Horace [Grant], passing it to [John] Paxson on the wing in Phoenix, Kobe passing it to Robert Horry, Shaq passing it to Derek Fisher.
"So I don't think you force Carmelo into taking a bad shot just to say we got the ball to Carmelo. I think it's just about us understanding how to execute in those situations so that whoever gets the shot, it's a good shot."
Activision CEO says competition putting out "less than adequate" products Bobby Kotick partially blames the lack of quality games for the softness in the market
James Brightman Editor, North America Thursday 2nd August 2012 Share this article Share
Companies in this article Activision Blizzard
Following Activision Blizzard's earnings announcement, the publisher held its investors call to discuss its results and the industry at large. Chief Executive Bobby Kotick was asked by an analyst about the challenging marketplace this year and why sales have been down at retail.
"You have a very difficult macroeconomic environment, when you look at the things that can generally have an impact on the consumption of entertainment - unemployment data is very concerning, and when you look at the challenges in Europe there are a lot of things that are going to affect the macroeconomic outlook. We are also at the late end of the cycle, and the late end of a console cycle is always going to have its share of difficulties," Kotick began.
He then proceeded to lay some of the blame at the feet of his competitors, which he said are not necessarily doing the industry justice by shipping less than stellar games.
"I also think you've had, unfortunately, a stream of products that are less than adequate from some of our competitors. The demand in the marketplace is for great quality products. If you look at the success we're having it validates that there is an opportunity for great quality products but I think at this stage in the cycle, it's challenging for anything other than great quality products," he said.
Kotick added that other sectors, particularly mobile, are having an impact on how much money consumers are willing to spend. Beyond that, many gamers are happy to keep playing online games for longer stretches of time instead of rushing out to buy new products.
"There's also a lot of competition for entertainment dollars - you look at mobile games and what's happening there and the pricing there that's having an impact," he continued. "And I also think that a lot of the games we make, like Call of Duty, that are multiplayer games offer a lot of replayability, and when you have the opportunity for replayability in an economic environment like this, you're going to spend more time playing the games that you have."
"But I will say that if you look out at the next five years, there's a lot of reason to be hopeful and enthusiastic, but the next few years are going to be challenging," Kotick concluded.
Amazon is considering moving far beyond its Instant Video streaming service, according to a new report out today. The online retail giant is working on offering a live TV service that would stream over the internet, reports The Wall Street Journal. It seems that the project is in its "early stages," and the paper's sources say that Amazon has contacted no less than three major media companies to begin working out licensing deals to stream programming. Such a service, if it's ever released, would compete directly with cable and satellite television providers.
It's not clear how Amazon's live television service would integrate with its Prime subscriptions or its current Instant Video offering. Since early last year a number of separate rumors have pegged an Amazon set-top box to go hand-in-hand with its Instant Video service and compete with products like the Roku and the Apple TV. One report said that the set-top box would launch before the end of 2013, but our own sources later said that the company decided to delay the device. If Amazon is planning to release a live TV service, it'd make sense for the company to offer it alongside the set-top box.
The rumor, if accurate, would hardly make Amazon the first company to show interest in offering an "over-the-top" live TV service streamed over the web. Sony announced similar plans earlier this month at CES, and Apple has long been rumored to be interested in offering such a service. To-date, such efforts have been stymied by difficulties negotiating with content providers who are dependent on their lucrative deals with cable and satellite operators. Over the past couple of years Intel worked hard to try to strike such deals, but after a number of failed attempts the company sold its internet TV technology and the other results of its efforts to Verizon earlier this week.
Update: Amazon has responded to The Wall Street Journal's report, noting that while it will continue to develop Prime Instant Video and create original shows, it is "not planning to license television channels or offer a pay-TV service."
Last month, the US-based Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect asked American comedian and author Tim Allen to apologize to 13 million Jews around the world for comparing Hollywood with Nazi Germany.
Tim Allen during an interview at the Jimmy Kimmel Live, while discussing his attendance at president Donald Trump's inauguration, Allen said “In Hollywood you've got to be real careful or you'll get beat up. If you don't believe what everybody believes, this is like thirties Germany.”
The millionaire comedian ($50 million) who supported Donald Trump for presidency, says that Hollywood dislikes Trump because people consider him a ‘bully' (watch interview below).
In a statement , Anne Frank Center executive director Steven Goldstein calls on Allen to apologize to the Jewish people. He tells Allen that “no one in Hollywood today is subjecting you or anyone else to what the Nazis imposed on Jews in the 1930s.
Not only the so-called Anne Frank Diary has been proven to be a forgery (here, here, here) – several Hollywood Jew bosses collaborated with Hitler.
Hollywood is controlled by Zionist Jew Mafia which had been confirmed in the past by icon actor Marlon Brando and British filmmaker and actor Gary Leonard Oldman.
Interestingly, in 2009, a French magazine reported that French police file card issued in 1924 bears the name Adolphe Jacob Hitler.
Dr. Norman G. Finkelstein in 2008 book, Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Antisemitism and the Abuse of History, says that Hollywood has produced 175 movies on the Jewish Holocaust since 1989 and only a few on Jew criminals.
Abraham Foxman, the head of Israel lobby ADL for 50 years, conceded: “It's even true that, proportionately, there has always been a relatively prominent Jewish presence in the movies, TV, and record industry.”

Bitcoin's Price Rise Brings Mt Gox Closer to Solvency
Everyone involved in the cryptocurrency space is watching the price of bitcoin very closely these past few weeks. One person watching the value of bitcoin rise is the former CEO of the now-defunct Mt Gox bitcoin exchange. Mark Karpeles says he's “monitoring the situation” as the Mt Gox bankruptcy may seemingly become solvent thanks to rising price of bitcoin.

Can the Mt Gox Bankruptcy Become Solvent?
Last week a post on the subreddit r/mtgoxinsolvency detailed that “Mt Gox reached around 78.5 percent of the claims value today.” The person also asked the former CEO what would happen if bitcoin's price makes it to 100 percent of the claims value. Karpeles appeared on the Reddit thread detailing his interest concerning the current situation. The former Mt Gox executive says because Coinlab is suing the company it really makes the claims value around 59 percent. Coinlab, the venture-backed blockchain company, has sued Mt Gox for $75 million before the company went bankrupt.
Karpeles is Monitoring the Situation
“I am monitoring the situation,” explains Mark Karpeles. “We are still around 59.92% (74.29% if excluding CoinLab – but it can't be excluded as the lawsuit is still in progress). Remember to use JPY values for calculation, since USD is bound to not be exact.”
Following this statement, bitcoin developer Lukejr asks Karpeles if there is a “real possibility Mt Gox can exit bankruptcy if it reaches 100%?”
“Yep, but not to reopen as Mt Gox,” Karpeles replies. “The idea would be to establish some kind of trust to distribute BTC outside of the bankruptcy process, allowing for their easy distribution. The plan is to have recovered bitcoins distributed as is to BTC creditors, on the address they provided to receive the original payments.”
As things are right now, creditors cannot receive more than the approved claim amount (in JPY), which means that future recovered bitcoins would potentially be distributed to shareholders instead.
‘The Inability to Compete With Today's Exchanges'
Many people discussing the subject on the forum were quite pleased with hearing Karpeles responses to questions. People further asked what the possibility was of Mt Gox re-opening and offering creditors a chance to become company shareholders as well as possibly cover the cost of some of the missing bitcoins.
“That is an alternative, but it would involve re-launching Mt Gox, which would probably not work for many reasons,” Karpeles explains. “Having a trust set up and distribution list kept for distribution of recovered assets is perfectly legal, has no running cost and be fair. Compliance cost in the US is way outside of Coinlab's reach, and I'd be surprised to hear Coinlab was ever planning to be compliant.
Anyway, the largest reason why Mt Gox cannot be relaunched is the brand image, followed by the inability to compete with today's exchanges.
100 Percent Value Must be Met Before Starting the Process
The discussion seemed very positive for those who lost funds during the bitcoin exchange's hack in 2013 which was followed by bankruptcy. Karpeles then goes on to explain that most of the process cannot begin until the 100 percent threshold is met. In regards to the Coinlab lawsuit Karpeles says someone can order documentation from the court to help with the process, but he can't afford to do that at the moment.
In theory, anyone could do it, so if someone do I'll be happy to host the files on dropbox or anything,” Karpeles adds.

No more licenses for heavy firearms: Duterte
ABS-CBN News
Posted at 16 May 2016 04:27 PM | Updated as of 30 Sep 2016 04:46 PM
MANILA - Gun licenses will no longer be issued to civilians with heavy firearms, presumptive president Rodrigo Duterte said on Monday.
For civilians who already have licenses for heavy firearms, they will not be given a permit to carry them in public, he added.
In a press conference in Davao City, Duterte said he will only allow licenses for shotguns and short rifles, but not for heavy firearms like AK-47s and M-16s.
"I will not allow the licensing of heavy firearms. Just a shotgun or a .22 rifle, and one short (rifle). Any caliber will do, as long as it is short. Rifles (are a no-no). Shotguns and .22 rifle. Wala nang heavy firearms. AK-47, M-16, those already given the licenses, okay lang 'yan. But no permit to carry shall be issued to civilians dito sa long firearms, short lang," he said.

Duterte also said permits for firearms will only be issued under stringent conditions to prevent any civilian from building a personal armory.
"And it must be under stringent conditions. Ayoko 'yung magbili ng mga almost armory. Eh kapag nanakaw 'yan, ibigay mo 'yan doon sa kabila (rebels). Several times it happened in our country," he said.
He said weapons stolen from the military, more often than not, go to rebel groups like the New People's Army (NPA).
"Itong NPA is a homegrown rebel group, and about the only time I can remember na talagang galing sa labas, I will not name the country because we are on friendly terms. 'Yung Karagatan? If you care to remember, this Karagatan was a small ship that was seized in Mindoro, 'yun lang ang nalaman ko na pumasok ang mga armas dito na AK-47," Duterte said.
"There's a war, but then again, they have to realize that I am with government, and I am the enemy also. But I also offer my hand in peace to Sison and others and we can talk," he added.
Duterte also announced that he is willing to offer the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) some positions in his Cabinet assuming it accepts his offer to join his government.
CPP founder Jose Maria Sison earlier expressed his willingness to resume peace talks with the government if Duterte wins the presidency.
At first glance there's not much new in this week's poll; the Conservatives have a slight lead but this is likely more blip than trend. There are, however, four really interesting and important stories evolving under this deceptively calm surface.
First, the new normal — a dead heat between the Conservatives and the Liberals — is almost exclusively a product of the terror and security file. The more daunting issues of a stagnant economy and regime fatigue are lurking in temporary abeyance.
Second, the profound change in the polling landscape since late summer is due largely to one major shift in the demographic constituency for the Conservatives. In short, if you're older and less educated, you're really troubled by the messages on terror and security emanating from the Prime Minister's Office.
Third, the supposed public consensus around Bill C-51 is an illusion. On the more accessible question of whether police and security services should have more powers, our tracking shows a dead split. This is definitely up as a consequence of recent events — but the rise is almost exclusively to be found in the groups noted above and among Conservative supporters. No one else is much onside and there are serious questions about the shelf-life of this support.
Fourth, the Green Party is showing real and unexpected strength compared to the last election. They could become a significant force if the current deadlock continues and they manage to up their game just slightly. A major brake on their prospects has been tepid turnout — due to a sense that a vote for a Green candidate is largely symbolic, with little chance of electing an MP. As their supporters' voting intentions firm, however, the party's prospects rise. Indeed, if the race continues to narrow, this election could be a very important moment for the Green Party.
The regional races are tight outside of Atlantic Canada and Alberta, which remain comfortable and stable havens for Justin Trudeau and Stephen Harper, respectively. Quebec is a very close four-way race, while Ontario and Manitoba are deadlocked. The Conservative hold on Saskatchewan appears to be relaxing and British Columbia is seeing a fascinating four-way race with a muscular Green Party poised to win multiple seats.
The demographics show the Conservatives reassembling the base of older, less educated and male voters that was their key to success in 2011. These groups bear closer examination.
In most parts of our society and economy, the values and preferences of older and less educated citizens aren't much in demand. We rarely see them in advertising or at gala openings and they don't trend on social media. But they're certainly having a profound impact on our democracy and national direction. Call it the revenge of the neglected — not a conscious act, of course, but rather the effect of a political climate where their values and beliefs are actually driving the national agenda.
Consider the following chart, which compares how the current voting landscape would look with various demographics included and excluded:
No question, terrorism is the sorting mechanism and animator of the new normal seen in today's polls. The Conservatives' constant hammering on the security theme has brought them clear returns, particularly with the older and less educated voters who have moved en masse to their camp. The migration of many Quebec voters to the Conservatives has been driven not so much by security fears as by the focus on jihadists and the topic's links to secularism and xenophobia. Let's take a deeper look at how this evolved, with a view to understanding where it may go.
What this tracking suggests is that security concerns are definitely alive — but they're not inflamed to anywhere near the levels we saw following the 9/11 attacks. In fact, even with this (probably temporary) jolt on the security front, the overall tilt on security versus civil liberties still clearly favours civil liberties.
Furthermore, all previous patterns show that any disruptions in response to a security incident (in this case, the Parliament Hill shooting and the Paris attacks) are always followed by a reduction in support for placing security over civil liberties as time goes on. We expect that this situation will be no different and, while it's not statistically significant, we've already seen a modest swing back to the civil liberties side.
Finally, it's worth noting that this issue is the subject of a deep divide along partisan lines. While we did not ask specifically about Bill C-51, the question on the trade-off of additional powers for police and intelligence agencies serves as a useful proxy. Support is strongly focused in some very specific polling segments (e.g., older and less educated Canadians) and we can find no evidence to support the idea that there is a massive wave of public support for such a bill. In fact, outside of the Conservative base, clear majorities oppose new police powers. We have a direct test of support for Bill C-51 in field right now, and the preliminary results suggest a public far more divided than earlier polling on this bill suggests.
Should the Liberals and NDP be deeply worried? It's not entirely clear that Canadians with high school-level educations vote in large numbers, or that their feelings on the terror file are deeply entrenched.
Seniors, on the other hand, are an important demographic that no party can afford to ignore. This is a large segment of the electorate and its members tend to vote in great numbers — and they've been swinging from the Liberals to the Conservative in large numbers. The senior vote is also quite accessible for ‘progressive' parties — particularly for the Liberals, who had a ten-point lead in this demographic not that long ago. Today's seniors are better educated and more progressive in their values than any seniors' cohort in Canada's history.
Here's what should be worrying the Liberals and New Democrats: the stable — and possibly growing — advantage Mr. Harper enjoys on the values front. While it's probable that this advantage is being driven by temporary concerns over security and likely will erode as economic and social concerns move to the fore, values help drive emotions — and emotions win elections.
It will be interesting to see in the coming months whether the opposition parties make headway on the values front, which will be critical to the outcome of the next election.

Methodology:
This study was conducted using High Definition Interactive Voice Response (HD-IVR™) technology, which allows respondents to enter their preferences by punching the keypad on their phone, rather than telling them to an operator. In an effort to reduce the coverage bias of landline-only RDD, we created a dual landline/cell phone RDD sampling frame for this research. As a result, we are able to reach those with a landline and cell phone, as well as cell phone only households and landline only households.
The field dates for this survey are February 25 – March 3, 2015. A random sample of 3,241 Canadian adults aged 18 and over responded to the survey. The margin of error associated with the total sample is +/-1.7 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.
Please note that the margin of error increases when the results are sub-divided (i.e., error margins for sub-groups such as region, sex, age, education). All the data have been statistically weighted by age, gender, region, and educational attainment to ensure the sample's composition reflects that of the actual population of Canada according to Census data.
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has used a New Year speech to call for the development of more advanced weapons, as well as an "end to confrontation" on the Korean peninsula.
In the surprise address broadcast Tuesday on state television, Kim called on his country to hold fast "to the ideals of independence, peace and friendship."
"This year, the entire Korean nation should turn out in a nationwide patriotic struggle for reunification in unity so as to usher in a new phase in the reunification movement," he said. "An important issue in putting an end to the division of the country and achieving reunification is to remove confrontation between the north and the south."
Kim, whose government provoked international condemnation by carrying out a successful long-range rocket launch in December, also called for the development of more "cutting edge arms and equipment."
The speech was the first televised New Year address by a North Korean leader in 19 years. During the leadership of Kim's late father, Kim Jong Il, the New Year message was delivered in the form of a state media editorial.
Kim's speech also called for an improvement in living standards in the impoverished communist country. He said bolstering farming would "provide the people with a better, more bountiful diet."
"Becoming an economic power is the most important task in our efforts to follow our great work of establishing a strong communist country," he said.
But he made no mention of his country's nuclear weapons program, which has landed in the country under devastating international sanctions.
Inter-Korean tensions were raised in December when North Korea launched a long-range rocket that successfully placed what Pyongyang said was a weather satellite into orbit.
The move was condemned by the United Nations Security Council as a violation of sanctions banning it from conducting long-range ballistic missile tests.
Following the launch, some analysts fear North Korea may be preparing a third nuclear test.

Gun Crow Rory Laird will not take on Collingwood this week
ADELAIDE has been dealt a massive blow ahead of Saturday night's clash against Collingwood with gun defender Rory Laird withdrawn.
The 22-year-old, who missed four games with a toe complaint earlier in the season, has hip soreness and the club has decided not risk him.
Laird has been one of the Crows' best this year and has soared into All Australian calculations on the back of a string of exceptional performances.
Former Magpie Paul Seedsman replaces Laird in the selected side and will take on his former teammates for the first time.
Jake Kelly has been added to the emergency list.
Collingwood made one change for the clash with Levi Greenwood replacing the injured Alex Fasolo.
Crows assistant coach David Teague believes there is still much improvement needed at his club.
"We don't think the way we're playing now is going to be good enough at the end of the year," Teague told reporters on Friday.
"We think we have got some areas to improve and we're going to need to improve on those.
"It's a whole game thing. Some of our defence we want to improve, some of our offence - they are just small things we want to tweak.
"We won't go into the exact details but we have got quite a few areas we want to improve on.
"Having said that, we're doing a lot right at the moment too."
Adelaide expects Collingwood to offer a stern test as the Crows mark the 300th AFL game milestone of onballer Scott Thompson on Saturday night.
"Their pressure is probably one thing that I have noticed ... it has been really good lately," Teague said of the Magpies, who have won three consecutive matches.
"Any team that brings good pressure asks a good question of the opposition. And it's one we're looking forward to answering this week.
"We feel that the pressure games are going to be finals-type games so we want opposition to bring pressure and we want to be able to stand up and handle it and we'll find that out tomorrow night."
A tech company in Wisconsin is gearing up to become the first in the U.S. to offer microchip implants to employees — and more than 50 workers have already signed up so they can make in-house purchases, open doors and unlock office equipment.
Employees at Three Square Market in River Falls, which provides self-service kiosks for break rooms or micro-markets, are set to get implanted with a tiny chip that uses radio-frequency identification (RFID) to allow them to do a wide variety of tasks instantaneously.
“We foresee the use of RFID technology to drive everything from making purchases in our office break room market, opening doors, use of copy machines, logging into our office computers, unlocking phones, sharing business cards, storing medical/health information, and used as payment at other RFID terminals,” according to a statement by the company's CEO, Todd Westby.
“Eventually, this technology will become standardized, allowing you to use this as your passport, public transit, all purchasing opportunities, etc.”
The chip — about the size of a single grain of rice — can be implanted “within seconds” between the user's thumb and forefinger. The program is optional for all employees, but the company said it expects more than 50 staffers to participate in the company's inaugural “chip party” at its headquarters on Aug. 1.
Westby told KSTP he envisions people using the implanted microchip similar to how they use their phones to buy items.
“We'll come up, scan the item,” Westby explained in front of a self-service kiosk in an office break room. “We'll hit pay with a credit card, and it's asking to swipe my proximity payment now. I'll hold my hand up, just like the cellphone, and it will pay for my product.”
The microchip inside a user's hand would function as his or her credit card. Each chip costs $300 and is being supplied by the company. The data stored on the chip is both encrypted and secure, said Westby, who said privacy concerns won't be an issue.
“There's no GPS tracking at all,” he told the station.

The company is partnering with Sweden-based BioHax International and its CEO, Jowan Osterland, a self-proclaimed “body hacker” who told the Associated Press in April that the process only lasts a few seconds and is usually painless.
“The next step for electronics is to move into the body,” Osterland said.
A Swedish startup hub called Epicenter, home to more than 100 firms and 2,000 employees, started implanting workers in January 2015. About 150 workers had them as of April, News.com.au reports.

Skeptic, please.
John's respect for the climate models is beyond my ability to alter. (Lord knows I have tried: for a version of the “climate change” chapter in my anti-imperial history “The Turkey and the Eagle,” see here.) But being called a “denier” got me to thinking: why do so many of us reach to the horrors of World War II to make our ad hominem arguments?
In high school in the 1960's I called Americans who were not out in the streets marching against segregation and the Vietnam War “Good Germans,” since my parents had taught us that the real villains in World War II were the apolitical Germans, not Nazis at all, who just went about their business as Hitler rose to power. When President Lyndon Johnson and his intellectual allies cited “Munich” as the reason they had to stand up to Ho Chi Minh's national revolution in Vietnam, I was happy to take the bait and argue that it was not the Munich agreement about governing the Germanic western part of Czechoslovakia that was the problem, but the failure of France and Britain to intervene when Hitler violated its terms and stormed the entire country. In fact, I said, it was the United States that was playing the role of Hitler, violating the international agreement in question (the 1954 peace treaty between France and North Vietnam) by blocking what President Eisenhower acknowledged would be the fair election of Ho Chi Minh as president of the entire country.
The Nixon administration called us Nazi storm troopers (“Brown Shirts”) when we marched in the streets, and we called them Hitlers for pushing Americans to “think with the blood” by sanctifying our troops – the very troops they kept out there dying in a war they knew was lost, but needed a “decent interval” before leaving, to preserve American global prestige.
When Vietnam anti-war protestors pretended to be pro-war students, and read quotes about the need for law and order to cheers at meetings of conservative alumni, and then revealed that the quote was from Hitler or his henchmen, I thought that was a great debating tactic. Of course, when pro-war professors played at being anti-war and read quotes about the need to challenge law and order in a noble cause to cheers at meetings of anti-war students, I thought that was below the belt. Nazi writings turn out to be like the Bible – a little bit of something for everyone. (Oops – see how easy it is to use an offensive World War II analogy?)
In his sophomoric (my apologies to my sophomores) climate lecture that is featured in the documentary “An Inconvenient Truth” (itself as illogical as the same director's attack on public school teachers, “Waiting for Superman”), Al Gore casts himself as Winston Churchill in the 1930's, presciently calling for action in the coming crisis but being ignored. Leaving aside any notion of praise for Churchill, a brutal imperialist dripping with Teddy Roosevelt's contempt for the genetic inferiority of the colored races he enslaved, maybe, just maybe, Churchill was more successful in pushing Britain to prepare for war (witness the creation of a bombing command in the late 1930's that was used to pummel German cities for the 5 years before the D-Day invasion) because the case that Hitler was a threat was clearer than the case that industrial emissions are.
The point is, World War II analogies, like the apartheid analogies opponents of Israel's occupation policies use when the Nazi analogies grow stale, are used to score points, not to start a discussion and analysis, because they are guaranteed to enrage and inflame. If we want to shout someone down, we'll use them; if we want to talk, we'll talk about the current facts and claims. And we'll evaluate the claims like skeptics, asking for proof and logic, not bluster and analogies.
Now, finally, to the substance of the matter. John sounds as if he, like a majority of Democrats but not Republicans and Independents, believes that a warmer season can be attributed more to, industrial emissions than to natural variation. (See here) In this, he is supported by the hysterical, hyper-political, Nobel Peace Prize-winning International Panel on Climate Change (definitely the silliest Nobel Peace Prize since Henry Kissinger's).
Based on surprisingly (and perhaps inherently) immature climate models, the IPCC claims with 95 percent certainty that “most” of the increase in temperature in the last 30 years of the 20th century was due to human activities. That claim ignores the similar, almost certainly natural increase in the first 30 years of the 20th century, when industrial emissions were so comparably low that no modeler attributes the increase to them. And, the “95 percent certainty” implies that a random statistical test has been applied by the IPCC, which it has not – this is just its confidence for an unremarkable claim (that perhaps half of a small rise is not natural fluctuation) put to numbers.
Let's start with the statistical fact that slightly higher global average temperatures, whatever their cause, move the distribution of temperatures up as well, leading to a slightly increased incidence of higher local heat spots. From this, those who fear climate catastrophe jump to an unshakeable belief that these increased heat spots lead to stronger and more frequent hurricanes….hence tropical storm Sandy. So, logically, John must conclude that the storm surge damage from Sandy was caused by our failure to cut industrial emissions, which is due to the effectiveness of the venal lies being told by the deniers, like me.
Now, there are lots of little reasons why all this is unlikely. For example, the storm ran into two completely coincidental low-pressure troughs, creating the surge conditions. (See this explanation by Jess Masters) And I wish I was part of a well-compensated conspiracy by fossil fuel companies that has captured public opinion; the reality is that climate alarmists have had an underserved field day, in funding and impact on popular opinion, in the past decade.
But the big issue is that extreme weather is a really random part of our global and local systems, and really hard to attribute to anything other than God playing at dice. For the past few million years, global temperature has oscillated smoothly up and down about 20 degrees every 100,000 years. We happen to be at the top of the cycle right now. Physicists believe that the cycle is, at heart, a response to the 100,000-year shift of our orbit around the Sun from a perfect circle to a 5 percent, egg-like ellipse, because the statistical fit is so good. BUT, they are stumped as to how the change in the orbit does this, since the change in radiative power is insignificant relative to the massive change in temperature it initiates. A little humility is in order when claiming to know the physics of far smaller fluctuations and individual events.
Please, call me a skeptic. And lay off World War II.

Players across Azeroth have recently embraced a new, very personal achievement: leveling a character "Iron Man" style. What started out as only a small movement, this bare bones, no-frills style of play has now transformed into a community-wide call-to-arms known as the Iron Man WoW Challenge, inviting World of Warcraft enthusiasts to see how close they can get to level cap with only the barest of necessities.
The goal of the Iron Man WoW challenge is simple: level from 1 to 85. The catch, however, is that you must accomplish this task without the assistance of talents, class specialization, stat-improved gear, professions, buffs, item enhancements, or other players. And if you die? Well, then it's back to square one.
Here are some of the latest rules:
1. All gear employed must be White or Grey. Also, no Heirlooms of any sort.

Would Trump really pay more under the tax bill? Not likely
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump keeps telling voters that he stands to pay more under the Republican tax legislation. But the evidence suggests otherwise.
Details of the House and Senate tax bills show that an extremely wealthy elite — including the president, his family, many in his Cabinet and members of his golf resorts — would enjoy a bonanza of lavish tax cuts unavailable to the vast majority of taxpayers.
Trump's businesses would likely face lower rates. He'd pay lower personal income rates. He could avoid the alternative minimum tax, which is designed to ensure that rich households that receive many breaks and deductions pay at least some tax. And his heirs could possibly avoid the estate tax entirely.
It's an awkward reality for a president who pledged to rebuild the U.S. economy for the forgotten men and women in industrial cities and towns. Yet Trump portrays the tax overhaul as cracking down on millionaires and billionaires because it's intended to limit itemized deductions for state and local taxes and mortgage interest payments, among other changes.
“We're also going to eliminate tax breaks and complex loopholes taken advantage of by the wealthy,” he said in a speech Wednesday in Missouri. “I think my accountants are going crazy right now. It's all right. Hey, look, I'm president. I don't care. I don't care anymore. I don't care. Some of my wealthy friends care. Me? I don't care. This is a higher calling.”
It's possible that Trump and other ultra-wealthy taxpayers could lose certain itemized deductions under the legislation. But those losses would almost surely be dwarfed by the benefits they would enjoy.
It's hard to say precisely how much the president would profit from the proposed changes. The legislation remains in a state of flux, and some provisions are slated to expire. Also, the president broke decades of tradition by refusing as a candidate and president to release his personal tax returns, so there is no baseline of comparison. But Trump would clearly be defying the odds if he were to face a tax increase.
When the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center reviewed an early version of the Senate tax bill, it found that the proposed changes would steadily favor the top 0.1 percent of earners with incomes above $5 million. Nearly 71 percent of this group would get a tax cut in 2019 and 2025; that figure would climb to 98.1 percent by 2027.
The average tax cut for this group in 2027 would be $223,970 — roughly four times the current median U.S. household income.
So, how exactly would Trump benefit?
___
LOWER TAX ON BUSINESS PROFITS
At least temporarily, the Senate bill would slash the tax paid by companies with profits that double as the owner's personal income. These are known as “pass-through” companies. Trump controls about 500 such entities, according to his lawyers. These companies collectively make up the Trump Organization. Instead of paying at a top rate of 39.6 percent, Trump would likely be taxed on these profits at closer to 30 percent.
___
ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX
Based on leaked pages of Trump's 2005 taxes, this single catchall accounted for much of his tax burden that year. Under the Republican legislation, the alternative minimum tax would disappear, at least for several years.
In 2005, without the AMT, Trump would have paid just $7 million in federal income and self-employment tax on $153 million in income — a rate of under 5 percent. The AMT added $31 million to Trump's bill, leaving him with an effective tax rate of 25 percent.
___
LOWER INCOME TAX RATES
Instead of paying a top rate of 39.6 percent on his personal income, Trump would be charged at 38.5 percent in the Senate bill. This is a seemingly modest but likely bountiful tax cut if Trump continues to earn more than $100 million annually.
___
ESTATE TAXES
The House bill would permanently repeal the estate tax charged to wealthy heirs. The estate tax now applies to fortunes above $5.5 million for individuals or $11 million for couples. The Trump administration has portrayed the easing of the estate tax as necessary to protect family farms. But the estate tax hits just 0.2 percent of taxpayers, a tiny minority that by almost any definition counts as being wealthy. Eliminating this tax would likely help the billionaire president's own real estate, licensing and marketing interests, which are now being managed by his family.

Hanaroo sushi bar is getting some new digs down the road a way. A sign posted on the door says they are moving to 215 Center Street, which is the former location of Three Fold.
We knew it was a strong possibility, we heard before Three Fold moved that Hanaroo was negotiating to enter the space. It looks to be official as Hanaroo is in the process today of clearing out the old location and moving.
Hanaroo has been a long time favorite for downtown workers. I found discovered it after working downtown over about 10 years ago and it has been a heavy rotation since then. The sushi is always top quality, and the lunch bento boxes are great options.

Their previous building has been in a rapid state of decline due to a negligent building owner for several years now. The entire building is nearly empty except for Southern Gourmasion, and it looks like parts of it are closer to being condemned than rented out at any point in the near future. Hopefully the rapid pace of downtown growth can spur some investor to put money into the building, which is in a prime location for business.
No official word from Hanaroo if that is the reason behind the move, but given the very visible decline in the building it is very likely.
The new spot is nearly move in ready, thanks to the good shape Three Fold left the location in. It will no doubt need a sushi bar installed and a few minor updates here and there, but it likely will not take Hanaroo long to open the doors.
Hanaroo has not set an open date that we can find, there were no answers on the phone due to either hours or the phone in a box somewhere between the new and old locations. Expect it to be soon though, so keep a lookout if you enjoyed the spot.
The shortest total lunar eclipse, or "blood moon", of the century takes place overnight but will last just a few minutes.
The shortest total lunar eclipse of the century overnight (NZT) will take only a few minutes, while the entire eclipse will be visible from New Zealand.
The total eclipse will last about seven minutes, starting three minutes before 1am on Sunday, the Royal Astronomical Society of New Zealand informs.
Some part of the moon will be in the dark earth's shadow for three and a half hours, which is unusually long.
Reuters Nasa pictures capture the most recent blood moon, which took place back in October.
The process starts at 11.15pm and finishing at 2.46am Sunday, shortly before daylight saving ends at 3am.
Lunar eclipses are often referred to as blood moons because it looks reddish with the passing through the earth's atmosphere filtering out most of its blue light.
They happen when the moon moves into the shadow cast by the sun shining on the earth. For a total lunar eclipse, the moon must be full, which means it is directly opposite the sun, with earth in-between.
THE BEST SPOT TO SEE THE BLOOD MOON
People in the upper and lower North Island are best placed to view the eclipse, while central North Islanders likely to miss out.
The eclipse would be visible between 10pm and 3am, with the "most excitement" happening between 10pm and 1am, MetService meteorologist Richard Finnie said.
People in the region from Auckland to the Coromandel Peninsula were well placed to see the eclipse, as were those in Wellington, Wairarapa and Kapiti Coast, he said.
But a front moving southwards from the top of the North Island would lie over the central region, blocking the blood moon from view.
"That's sort of a no-go area," Finnie said.
The front would pass over Wellington region in the early evening.
"Come 10pm, it should be fairly starry," he said.
In the South Island, the best places to view the eclipse would be in Nelson, Marlborough and the West Coast.
Finnie said central areas of the South island, such as central Otago and the Mackenzie Basin, would also be good viewing spots.
"Canterbury probably starts off fairly good, but as the southerly picks up, it's probably going to push more cloud over the plains and against the foothills, especially in North Canterbury," Finnie added.
TETRAD
This eclipse is the third in a series of four lunar eclipses known as a tetrad. To qualify for the definition, the eclipses must be six lunar months apart and have no partial lunar eclipses in between. The last eclipse in the tetrad will be on September 28 but will not be visible in New Zealand.
On website EarthSky, it says there will be eight tetrads in the 21st century but there were none in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.
Given the short duration of the total eclipse, Sky & Telescope described the totality as "borderline" and said different authorities had given different lengths for how long it will last - from five to 12 minutes.
Watchers may get the impression the eclipse "never becomes quite total at all", it said.
The edge of the moon "squeaks so slightly inside the umbra (dark inner portion) of earth's shadow that it will remain much brighter than the deep red we can expect across the rest of the moon's face".
Space.com points out that Easter is supposed to be on the Sunday following the first full moon of spring. The reason is that in most parts of the world the full moon and the total eclipse happens on Saturday.
It also explained the partial eclipse was so long this time mostly because the eclipse was just three days after the moon arrived at apogee - its furthest point from the earth. That meant the moon's orbital velocity was quite slow, so it would take "a rather leisurely trek through earth's shadow".
Gabby Giffords beginning nine-state “Protect All Women” tour to advocate for tougher gun laws
Starting with Maine, former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords will be touring nine states, including Pennsylvania, to advocate for stronger gun laws, which she says will protect women and families and make it more difficult for domestic abusers to obtain firearms. Giffords was shot in the head during a 2011 shooting in Tuscon, Arizona that killed six. She remains partially paralyzed and still has difficulty speaking.
Among other changes, Giffords has urged for the expansion of background checks, along with prohibitions on gun purchases for misdemeanor-level stalking crimes.
“Giffords' gun-control advocacy group, Americans for Responsible Solutions, calls guns and domestic violence ‘a lethal mix,' noting that abuse victims are more than five times more likely to be killed if the aggressor has access to a gun,” writes the Associated Press's Alanna Durkin.
CeaseFirePennsylvania is pleased that Giffords will be coming here on her tour.

REGINA — After a decade in green and white, offensive lineman Chris Best is calling it a career.
The veteran guard officially announced his retirement on Thursday, putting his 10 CFL seasons — all with the Saskatchewan Roughriders — behind him.
The 33-year-old was a key member and a familiar face on the Riders' O-line ever since being drafted fourth overall by the team in 2005, although Best was forced to miss the entire 2016 season due to injury.
“I want to congratulate Chris Best on a successful 10-year CFL career,” stated Jeremy O'Day, Roughriders assistant vice-president of football operations. “I had the opportunity to work with Chris as a teammate and then as an administrator over the past decade. His level of intensity, competitive attitude, and will to win made Chris a great player. We wish him continued success in his next endeavour.”
Best played 114 career regular-season games after making his Rider debut July 8, 2007. The Calgary native was drafted by the Riders following four seasons at Duke University before transferring to the University of Waterloo to obtain his Masters in 2007.
“I want to thank the Roughriders and entire province of Saskatchewan for everything they have done for me. It's been an incredible privilege to play for the Roughriders for the past 10 years,” said Chris Best. “I want to give a special thanks to my coaches, teammates, and especially Rider fans for your continuous support over the years.”
Best also played in seven career playoff games and three Grey Cup games, winning in 2007 and 2013. He was named the Riders' Most Outstanding Offensive Lineman in 2011.
Best, his wife Emily, and their daughter Libby have made Regina their home.
Roku
Roku is updating its lineup of streaming video boxes with a trio of new products for 2011. The new models add Wii-like casual gaming, controlled by a new Bluetooth motion remote. The ubiquitous Angry Birds is the debut Roku title, and it's included for free with the flagship $100 Roku box.
The news of fresh Rokus confirms weeks of rumors and FCC leaks that had surfaced earlier on Engadget and Zatz Not Funny.
The new game-enabled boxes are known as the Roku 2 line--a particularly curious name, since it's the third or fourth incarnation of the streaming-media box (depending on how you count) that first debuted in May 2008. Truth in numbering notwithstanding, the new models carry over the basic functions of the existing Roku line, with more than 250 streaming media channels (including Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Instant, MLB, NHL, NBA, UFC, and dozens of others), HD video, and built-in Wi-Fi support. The tiny enclosures are smaller even than archrival Apple TV--just 3.3-inch square, and less than an inch high.
Roku
The three models are known as the Roku 2 HD ($60), Roku 2 XD ($80), and Roku 2 XS ($100); all should be available at retail by the end of July. They replace the existing Roku models ( Roku HD , Roku XD , and Roku XDS , respectively) that are currently available at those same price points. Notably, all three models utilize the fastest 802.11n Wi-Fi standard, and all offer a MicroSD expansion slot on the rear.
All three also include Bluetooth compatibility for the new game remote--though that Wii-like motion remote will only be included with the top-of-the-line $100 model. The remote will be available separately (bundled with a 2GB MicroSD card) for $30. The HD and XD will ship with standard infrared remotes, and--thankfully--all Roku 2 models retain an IR sensor, so unlike the Wii and PlayStation 3, Roku 2 boxes will still be controllable via standard universal remotes.
The entry-level Roku 2 HD supports 720p HD output via HDMI, while the other two models offer full 1080p video. All three also include the option for standard-def video output via an included breakout composite AV cable (3.5mm to yellow/red/white), so--unlike Apple TV--they'll work with nearly any old TV, not just HDTVs.
In addition to including the Roku Game Remote and the full version of Angry Birds, the $100 Roku 2 XS is the only one that includes an Ethernet port, should you choose to go wired. It's also the only one with a USB port, so you can play local video, audio, and photo files. (Roku products technically support DLNA, but there is currently no official "channel" for accessing content residing on PCs elsewhere on your network--though Roku representatives hinted that we may finally see that changing in the future.)
Netflix will get some notable tweaks on the new Roku models. Dolby Digital Plus surround will be supported, as will English subtitles on the many Netflix programs that now offer closed captioning. Likewise, 1080p video will be available on the upper two models (on programs that are so encoded). In other words, the new Roku models will be delivering many of the Netflix extras that have currently only been seen on the PlayStation 3.
In addition to the Netflix upgrades, Roku is highlighting an improved Facebook channel, a new Major League Soccer channel, Epix (which requires you to already have an Epix cable subscription), AOL HD, and FoxNews.com Live (the live online streaming content, which differs from the cable channel).
On the gaming front, expect Angry Birds Seasons and Angry Birds Rio to join the original game in the near future. Owners of older Roku consoles are out of luck, however, as the games will only be available on the new Roku 2 boxes.
Roku
I was able to spend a couple of minutes playing Angry Birds on the Roku 2 XS at a recent briefing. The Game Remote's motion control was quite sensitive, but it was a bit odd to play the game without using a touch screen. No, it wasn't as smooth as a Wiimote, but the gaming here is more of a value-added than a core competency. Meanwhile, the interface of the Roku 2 is effectively identical to that of current Roku models--it's the same basic functional UI that gets the job done, but won't win any awards for polish or presentation.
The current $100 Roku XDS is the CNET Editors' Choice in the bargain streaming-video space. In our opinion, it edged out the Apple TV because it delivered far more programming choices for the same price. It seems the Roku 2 line will be at least as good, if not slightly better for those who want some light gaming. Apple could, of course, eventually flip the switch on adding more channels, apps, or even games to the Apple TV--but until it does, Roku has the advantage, at least for those who don't need AirPlay compatibility.
CNET will have a full review of the new Roku 2 line later this month, as soon as we receive the final hardware. In the meantime, are you interested in the Roku XDS , or do you have an experience--good or bad--with previous Roku products? Share your comments below.
A memorial was held at UC Davis for Renne Lyra Morrow, 19, on Sunday. She died after being hit by a car in Davis on Saturday, Feb. 4.
Renne's memorial featured music by the Cal Aggie Band, for which Renne played Sousaphone. Reverend Robert Fuesler of Atascadero United Methodist, which Renne's family attends on the central coast, gave the message.
.
The bulk of the memorial came in the form of an open mic that allowed friends and family to share specific, personal memories of Renne Lyra Morrow. The depth of the stories would have you think Renne had been at UC Davis for several years. In actuality, she had only been in college for about a year-and-a-half.
But that year-and-a-half brought with it some very significant life changes. She switched her major several times before eventually committing herself to a life of music. That decision was the product of many long conversations with the band director.
She also went through a self-discovery process that led her to identify herself as transgender. (Some of Renne's pre-UC Davis friends and family referred to her by her given name, Brennan Morrow, while speaking at the memorial).
In death, Renne Lyra Morrow, who was registered as an organ donor, saved four lives. Reverend Fuesler said that her:
Liver went to save a nine-year-old girl.
Kidneys went to save the lives of two different men.
Heart went to save the life of a 23-year old.
"Now did you notice that Renne's life went to save both male and female?" said Pastor Fuesler. "And do you think it matters to any of them what gender Renne was? Or any of their families?"
Many people spoke at the memorial. Here are some pieces of what was said. (Out of respect to those in attendance, I did not approach speakers to confirm their names, so not all are listed here).
Reverend Robert Fuesler
"I had shared with Renne a few months back … and I was unresolved as to this transgender transition ... One of the words used to describe God is "transcendent," which means, beyond human apprehension.
He elaborates on the prefix "trans" and relates his personal understanding of God to Renne's life and death. He also touches on Renne's organ donation. .
Band Director
"Make the world a better place … I can't remember any time I've known her that there wasn't an effort toward making the world a little bit better. I think the final act was her organ donation. She saved lives. Four."
"When I first met Renne in 2010, I said 'Oh no, another Morrow.' (Renne's older brothers played in the Cal Aggie Band) … Renne replied: 'I do not deny my Morrowness.'"
"Her comedic wit, her funny attitude, her way of sharing herself with others, came fundamentally from her family … I think the world could use a little more Morrowness."
Renne's Brother
"[Renne] always played [music] with her full heart and channeled her energy into her horn movements. It was in Davis that she really found her identity and she forced everyone else to grow around here. I think she grew more in a year-and-a-half than I did in six. And she was never silent with her opinions … and she would have evidence to back her up … She's an inspiration to me, to everyone she ever met, and to everyone in this room. Life is what you make of it, and I'm making mine for her."
Students
A friend played "Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep," on a Ukulele and then followed that up with this: "I went through the songs [Renne] listened to on the last day of her life on Facebook." The friend then lifted up the Ukulele again and began playing Lady Gaga's "Poker Face," which was met by applause and laughter.
A student said he ran into Renne on his way from the library the day before she died. The two of them spoke for about three minutes and then they went their separate ways, never to see each other again. "She had an amazing spirit," the speaker said.
A friend told a story of Renne coming to visit her during the recent Winter break. She explained that her mother was a conservative Christian and that she was unsure how things would go down with Renne being transgender. Renne came to visit and, sure enough, the conversation came up. Renne took on the conversation directly: "It was a real demonstration of character. It increased my respect for her."
"Renne's most recent New Year's resolutions were 1) Love all people. 2) Do no harm. 3) Do good … We miss you so much, Renne. And I, for one, promise to keep your memory and mission alive by carrying out your resolutions this year and every year of my life. And I hope all of you will do the same, for Renne, for you, and for all of us."

With 23 April 2016 being the 400th anniversary of William Shakespeare's death, a group of actors including Ian McKellen and Derek Jacobi have come together to help the audience understand every line of the playwright's work. The actors are featuring on the Heuristic Shakespeare app, which launched in London on 22 April. The app aims to bring the writer's words to a wider audience.
"I've always felt, since I had to read Shakespeare at school, that wasn't the way to be introduced to Shakespeare or to enjoy him. Shakespeare's an enjoyable experience, only really comes alive and you only really understand him if you see the plays on the stage and you are in the same space as the actors who are speaking the lines," said McKellen.
The app, launched by The Lord of the Rings star McKellen and the film director Richard Loncraine, is designed to be used on an iPad. The app user is presented with a scrolling text of the full version of a Shakespeare play. A window shows each member of the cast above the script, and the actor then reads the lines directly into the camera. The first play the app covered is The Tempest.
"We did some research and we found that by having not just the text scrolling underneath on the app, the top of the screen I can show you, you can see an actor actually talking and he's always looking at you. He doesn't look at the other actors, he doesn't walk offstage, he doesn't swordfight. He simply speaks the text to you," said Loncraine.
All of Shakespeare's 37 plays will eventually be featured on the iPad app. It will include extra features such as access to detailed notes, character maps and a scrollable timeline of Shakespeare's life.
"Shakespeare's not a pageant. It's not something from the past. He's still relevant because he had this unique genius for understanding us all. It's almost as if Shakespeare invented human beings," said McKellen.
Nearly two weeks after a former school officer was charged in connection with the deaths of two K9 officers, investigators have recovered the remains of a third dog at the officer's home.
According to authorities, a forensic veterinarian confirmed the remains of a Belgian Malinois, likely killed by a gunshot, were discovered at Lt. Daniel Peabody's home. These were not the remains of Dale, a Yellow Lab, Peabody claimed to have shot and killed.

He originally told police Dale died when he choked on a ball. However, investigators later determined Peabody shot Dale shortly after he retired.
Officer charged in death of two K9s Inca died after being left in a 2001 Crown Vic, not approved for K9 transport. Dale, a retired K9, was shot by Peabody, according to investigators. Peabody had been a Cherokee Co. School Police officer since 2007. Peabody was charged with animal cruelty and making false statements.
On June 10, the Cherokee Marshal's Office and Cherokee Sheriff's Office responded to Peabody's home after the death of a 4-year-old Belgian Malinois named Inca.
According to a preliminary investigation, the dog was left in the officer's patrol unit "at about 4:15 p.m." when Peabody went into his home to "deal with another dog."

Tips about Dale's death came into the Sheriff's Office after Inca died.
The remains of the third dog are believed to belong to Inca's grandmother.
Peabody was taken into custody on Wednesday, June 22 and charged with felony animal cruelty as well as making false statements. He received a $22,400 bond.
A spokesperson with the Cherokee County Marshall's office said their investigation continues. Authorities are continuing to search for Dale's remains.
They said they would “slow walk” to a photo voter ID bill, but there has been no tar in the heels of North Carolina Republican state legislators in their race to make it law. After less than nine months as governor, Republican Pat McCrory signed what's been called the most restrictive elections bills in the nation into law yesterday. The “Voter Information Verification Act” signed by Gov. McCrory was created and passed by a Republican-dominated state legislature on the premise that voter fraud is riding roughshod all over the elections system. But no evidence of system-upending fraud exists in North Carolina.
Besides asking voters now to carry one of a narrow list of photo ID cards to vote (starting with the 2016 election), the new law also slices a full week off of the early voting period, eliminates same-day voter registration, allows vigilante poll observers of the Vote Truther variety more leeway to harass voters, and makes it more difficult to add satellite polling sites for the elderly and disabled.
Thousands have marched and demonstrated, while hundreds have been arrested during the “Moral Mondays” sit-ins and pray-ins at the state legislative building this year, protesting this and other bills that may have a punishing effect on people of color and low income.
Right after Gov. McRory signed the elections bill into law, civil rights groups announced lawsuits against the state, anticipating that the law might lead to the disenfranchisement of thousands of African Americans, Latino Americans, college students and elderly voters.
One of those lawsuits, filed by the civil rights organizations North Carolina NAACP and Advancement Project, argues that the new law is in violation of Section Two of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits any voting procedure that discriminates against people of color from taking effect. It also claims the law violates voting rights protections for people of color guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution. The lawsuit aims at a number of the more punitive voting provisions for minorities in the state, including the elimination of same-day registration and reducing early voting. During the 2012 elections, almost 70 percent of African Americans used early voting.
When Florida lawmakers reduced its early voting period last year, a federal judge found that it discriminated against black voters, who were more likely to vote early than white voters. Florida later apologized and restored the early voting period.
The NAACP's lawsuit is filed on behalf of 92-year-old Rosanell Eaton, who was one of the first African Americans to vote in North Carolina. She registered in the 1940s amid threats of literacy tests and intimidation from the Ku Klux Klan. Her name on her driver's license does not match the name on her birth certificate or voter registration card, which may disqualify her from getting the free voter ID card she'll need to vote under the new law, according to a press release from the Advancement Project.
Mrs. Eaton follows in the footsteps of Viviette Applewhite of Pennsylvania and Desiline Victor of Florida, African-American women who withstood voter suppression last year to stand for the voting rights of all Americans. Mrs. Eaton has served with her state's NAACP for over 60 years and has survived her house being riddled with bullets and crosses burned on her lawn for her work registering African Americans to vote. This year, she was one of the hundreds arrested with Moral Mondays protestors when speaking out against the new voter ID law. A Facebook page “Stand With Rosa Nell Eaton” has been created in her honor.
— Authorities say a Pomona resident has been booked on suspicion of burglary after officers responded to a burglary alarm at a supermarket in Orange County.
At around 1:23 a.m. Sunday, officers with the Huntington Beach Police Department responded to the alarm at an Albertsons located on Atlanta Avenue and Magnolia Street.
With the ground level secure, police say officers in an air unit located a “heat source on the roof.”
The man, according to police, was hiding underneath an air duct.
Police say he initially refused to come out of hiding, but eventually surrendered.
The Huntington Beach Fire Department helped safely secure the suspect by providing a ladder and rescue basket.
The suspect, identified by police as Dewayne Lee Contreras, 52, was booked into city jail on suspicion of burglary.
No further information was available.
Less than a day after news broke that the NYPD would be moving up the start date of a pilot program to outfit its officers with cameras, a Staten Island grand jury announced it would not be indicting the officers who killed Eric Garner. This naturally led many to wonder aloud about the efficacy of body cameras. Garner's death, after all, was recorded by a bystander, so why would body cameras have made a difference?
Based on both the limited research we have so far into how body cameras modify behavior and the theory underpinning their use, though, there are some solids, if preliminary, reasons to believe body cameras could prevent cases like this in the future.

Since body cameras are relatively new technology, and since some police departments have been less than enthusiastic about adopting them, there is not a great deal of data to sift through at the moment. But we do have some early results. Perhaps most famously and rigorously, Rialto, California, ran a yearlong study in which 54 of its officers were randomly assigned to either wear a camera or not wear one each shift. As the Guardian reported last year, “after cameras were introduced in February 2012, public complaints against officers plunged 88% compared with the previous 12 months. Officers' use of force fell by 60%.” This echoes early data from the few other comprehensive studies that have been conducted (PDF), including one in Mesa, Arizona.
It's encouraging, of course, but the real test is going to be what happens when larger police departments embrace this technology. We'll know more soon: As the Times reported last year, Albuquerque, Fort Worth, and Oakland now have their officers wear cameras. And in addition to the NYPD, the LAPD, Chicago PD, and Metropolitan Police Services in London are all undergoing pilot studies.
What's key to realize about these cameras in the context of the Garner case is that their presumed effects only kick in when officers know they're being watched all the time. The authors of the Rialto paper were clear about this:
We hypothesize that portable cameras would go beyond the limited impact that CCTVs have had on expressive acts of violence in public spaces. CCTV cameras were found to be weak behavior modifiers not because of a flaw in the self-awareness paradigm or the deterrence theory. Rather, the level of certainty of being apprehended necessary for the self-awareness mechanism, which would lead to socially-desirable behavior, is not high enough in CCTV. If cameras are expected to influence behavior and to serve as cues that social norms or legal rules must be followed, then the cue “dosage” of awareness must be intense. Mobile cameras are likely to have this effect.
So as tragic as Garner's death was, it might be incorrect to extract any broader lessons from it about police body cameras. The effects of these cameras may only kick in, or kick in fully, when officers know they're being watched in every one of their interactions with the public, and it could be the case that these changes in behavior take time — if police are in the habit of acting in an aggressive or confrontational manner with citizens, in other words, the sudden presence of bystanders with cameras might not make a difference. (This ties into a long line of research, much of which is summed up nicely in Mark Kleiman's book When Brute Force Fails, showing that one of the best ways to change criminal behavior is to ratchet up the odds that the perpetrator will be caught — the same logic can be applied to police.)
None of this means body cameras will permanently fix relationships between police and citizens in places where that relation is strained. “It's truly not a panacea and at least in my mind, the money used for cameras would be much better used if the money were allocated for screening for recruitment and selection and then proper training,” said Maria Haberfeld of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. “Because if you have the right people doing this job, and people are properly trained, you don't need the cameras.”
But between the early evidence that the cameras reduce violent incidents between police and citizens, as well as their ability to sort out what happened in cases like Garner's — whether or not the justice system then does its job — it certainly seems likely that the momentum for officers to wear cameras is only going to build.
OC Transpo is looking for the owner of a bird found on its property at 1500 St. Laurent Blvd.
Late Wednesday afternoon, OC Transpo said it did not have any more information about how the white bird was found. However, officials are looking for its rightful owner and are asking for anyone with information to call 613-741-4390 or 613-842-3600.
Originally erroneously called a “cockatoo” by OC Transpo, the bird's photo was soon posted on the Ottawa and Valley Lost Pet Network, where a reader linked OC Transpo's photo — it's a cockatiel, by the way, not a cockatoo — to a report of a missing bird named Blue, who escaped from an apartment on Ogilvie Road during a fire alarm on July 31.
One Twitter reader also reporting seeing posters for a missing bird that fits this description in the Greensboro area.
Cockatiels, which are native to Australia, are known to enjoy human company and to form strong bonds with their human owners.
Conroy, left, and Bouvier, right, were trapped in Homs after being wounded during bombardment of the city [Reuters]
At least one Western journalist seriously wounded in the Syrian government's bombardment of an opposition enclave, has been smuggled with the help of activists into neighbouring Lebanon.
News of the escape of Paul Conroy, a British photographer, and unconfirmed reports of French reporter Edith Bouvier's arrival in Lebanon on Tuesday came as the UN Human Rights Council discussed a resolution in Geneva, Switzerland, seeking to halt the violence in Syria to allow in vital humanitarian aid.
A Lebanese official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Paul made it to the UK embassy while Bouvier's location in the country was unknown.
Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, disclosed that Bouvier successfully crossed the border into Lebanon, only to retract his statement shortly afterwards, saying that it was "not confirmed that she was safe in Lebanon".
Paul and Bouvier were seriously injured in a rocket attack by security forces last week on a makeshift media centre while covering the uprising in Bab Amr, an opposition stronghold in the heavily bombarded city of Homs.
Two other prominent Western journalists were killed in the attack.
Rima Fleihan, a spokeswoman for the Local Co-ordination Committees, an umbrella Syrian opposition group, said that Paul, a photographer for the Sunday Times, the UK newspaper, was smuggled out by army defectors.
Avaaz, the global activist group, which said it organised his evacuation, disclosed that 13 of the 35 Syrian activists who volunteered to help get Paul out of the country were killed by security forces.
The developments came as Navi Pillay, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, issued fresh calls on Tuesday for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.
She recommended action to prevent Syrian government forces from continuing their nationwide bombardments and other attacks against civilians, which she said had resulted in "countless atrocities".
Separately, B Lynn Pascoe, the UN political chief, said the death toll of the Syrian government's crackdown on dissent was "well over" 7,500 people.
For now, though, as it awaits a potential move to Washington by Mrs. Trump and Mr. Trump's youngest son, Barron, the agency has elected instead to fly agents in from around the country, as it would during a campaign or for a large security event. Doing so for a routine nonelection detail is less common and means the agency is paying for hotel rooms, transportation and living expenses — at Manhattan prices — the officials said.
The agency is also renting space inside Trump Tower for offices and temporary sleeping quarters, two officials said, though the details of the transaction have not been made public.
The New York field office appears to have been particularly hard hit. Of the dozens of agents stationed there, a third are involved in protection on a given day. That has diminished for now the kind of protective intelligence, financial crime and cybercrime cases that normally make up the bulk of their work, according to a former agency official briefed on its staffing. Such investigative work is seen within the agency as crucial to not only building agents' skills and combating crime, but also sharpening their protection abilities.
“Essentially the Secret Service is in a campaign mode all of the time right now,” said James F. Tomsheck, who left the agency in 2006 after 23 years. “It will greatly degrade the quality of life for most agents in the Secret Service, because of increased travel, protracted periods of time away from family.”
The Secret Service was already heavily taxed coming off a long and contentious campaign year, in which it secured about 6,000 stops on top of its normal workload. More than 1,000 agents maxed out their pay along the way, meaning that in the campaign's final months they were working overtime without pay. Congress stepped in to approve making up for some of those lost funds but has yet to appropriate the money.
In a separate effort to alleviate concerns around payment for the extra hours this year, the agency's acting director, William J. Callahan, announced in a letter on Friday that he would waive a separate cap on overtime pay for “mission essential” employees to ensure they were compensated for the large workload.
12 ways to boost your productivity
Everyone wants to be productive in some way or another. It's what releases those “feel good” dopamines from your brain and define your confidence and self-esteem. Because activities such as eating and sleeping are only quick rewards that doesn't make you feel good for long, you need other sources to feed you those brain chemicals.
Boosting your productivity isn't just meant to make your life easier, but it releases another chemical known as serotonin, which is known as the “mood booster.” As a result, you learn to focus and pay more attention throughout the day.
But when you're swapped with free time, there seem to be a variety of productive tasks to choose from. Rather than determining what to choose from out of a thousand ideas, I listed a few effective activities that will boost your productivity.
1. Increase your social life by talking to everyone
It doesn't take a group of scientists to explain that spending time with people is beneficial for your health. Your emotions alone remind you of how relaxing and joyful it was to spend quality time with someone. Psychologist John Cacioppo once mentioned in his book, Loneliness, that, “loneliness isn't some personality defect or sign of weakness. It's a survival impulse like hunger or thirst, a trigger pushing us toward the nourishment of human companionship.”
We're not immune to the feelings of isolation and despite what we think, it's necessary to speak to a variety of people throughout the day. (Even if it has to be the weird store clerk who gives us a blank stare.)
If you have a hard time expressing your thoughts to others or experience shy behavior, become interested in what they're saying rather than focusing on being an interesting figure.
Don't concentrate about impressing someone with your intelligence and listen to what they have to say. People will always prefer talking about themselves when given the opportunity and you can learn a lot about them by asking genuine questions.
2. Exercise in any way possible
I know many people who have a difficult time motivating themselves to exercise. But exercising isn't meant to only keep you fit. Exercising regularly gives you the ability to easily retain knowledge you recently learned about because more oxygen is fed into your brain, making it more active. Studies at the University of Georgia suggest that physically active people have a lower chance of anxiety attacks than those who choose to sit down all day.
After exercising, your mood is improved after a stressful day because your brain chemicals are stimulated to make you happier. Even if it's as simple as walking, any form of continuous movement increases blood circulation.
Don't automatically assume you have to run several miles or bench press 1000 pounds to relieve your stress. All it takes is 7 – 15 minutes of genuine physical activities such as walking, playing a fun sport, or cleaning the house that will give you the same effect.
3. Learn basic arts and craft
Arts and Crafts aren't just meant for children or teenagers. If you have the time, work on a small project such as a collage, a necklace, molding clay pots, or building birdhouses. They work as relaxation releases because you're sending your focus and attention to an external source besides yourself. Rather than focusing on why you're a failure, your attention is derived to a project you're building.
The more you work the right side of your brain (which is in charge of your creative ideas) the easier it becomes to solve future problems. Back when I was working on building a toolbox at Home Depot, I came across a novel idea I wanted to write about. Instead of spending all day at my desk struggling with ideas, I spent my time doing something productive, which eventually gave me the idea I was searching for.
What Einstein heavily mentioned was that if someone lacks the skills of imagination and creativity, then he cannot exceed his expectations. Having logic and sense is great, but without a creative idea to expand your ideas together, you'll always see things in black and white.
4. Learn a second (or third) language
If you forgot your Spanish or French lessons from either High School or College, try reuniting with them. As difficult as it seems to learn a second language, it develops your mind with rewarding experiences. Because a bilingual person has to balance their brains with two languages, it changes their brain to develop greater cognitive abilities.
In other words, bilingual people can perform better at grasping information because they're focused on determining which language they're listening to and breaking it down in their heads.
A psychologist named Ellen Bialystok, who works at York University, did a study about people who learned a second language usually scored better on standardized tests than those who knew only one language.
But besides outsmarting those next to you, what really makes learning a second language so effective is that it opens new opportunities to communicate with people. Whether you're seeking a new job, a relationship, or expanding your social network, a second language will always take you further.
5. Improve your building skills
Whether you're learning how to build a PC, video game, or giant house, it's important to develop a skill in building something manually. You don't have to know how to build a spaceship to boost your productivity, but learn to build small things that interest you.
This expands your field of knowledge and can possibly help you in the future in one way or another. Examples to start with are learning to build a website, a blog, a resume, a network, or a tool shed. Rather than spending useless time on mediocre things such as watching movies or playing video games, exchange that time for something you've always wanted to try.
For example, I always enjoyed playing game apps on my phone, but I never considered building one for myself until recently. It's a difficult challenge to tackle, but the longer I stick to it by learning the minor details, the funner it's gets.
Perhaps in the future when I complete my first app, it'll become as popular as other apps such as angry bird or the game I'm currently playing called Crossy Road (Beware. That game is extremely addicting.)
Either way, I don't see learning how to build apps as a waste of time as opposed to only building my High Score Rankings in Crossy Road. (Again. BEWARE. That game is too addicting.)
6. Learn Basic Graphic Designs
You have an interest in art such as art posters or animations? Besides being extremely fun to design a high quality image of your own, learning basic graphic designs teaches you a variety of fundamental skills. Besides demonstrating your artistic mind, you'll have a chance of meeting others with similar interests. Areas graphic designers tend to spend time together would be in a course at college or at an artistic event on Meetup.
If you're aware of any Graphic Design Shows happening in your city, invest the time to show up at one and view the type of people interested in it. Speak to someone about the reason they like it and if they created anything of their own.
This opens up the opportunity to tell them about your own art, or advice you learned. if you'd like a list of Graphic Design events happening, there's a link below to give you an idea of what to expect there.
18 Unmissable Graphic Design Events in 2015
It's never too late to begin learning Graphic Design and doesn't require a heavy dose of studying to become good at it. All you really need is the right software, a few online tutorials and your imaginations to take care of the rest.
7. Raise a pet
Not only do pets give you an unconditioned love, but they lower your stress and anxieties. For those who have pets, I'm sure you're familiar with the positive effects they bring into your lives. That's because they lower your blood pressure after petting or gazing at them.
How?
Whenever you share any physical connection with a living being, it releases a relaxation hormone that cuts down your stress level. The power of touch doesn't just work with humans. Animals can provide you with nearly the same affect that releases serotonin from your brain and makes you feel connected with something besides yourself.
This is otherwise known as coping mechanism, where your hypertension is lowered after petting a dog or cat. (I would include petting a fish, but it wouldn't really have the same effect.)
8. Learn something new (that's educational)
You don't have to be in school to learn something new. There's a variety of online resources, and the library, that could effectively teach you. Examples would be YouTube, Khan Academy, or again, the Library. (I said Library twice because I like to remind people it still exists.) Enrich your life by improving your skills that can benefit your career or personal life. Open different paths you could walk on by expanding your field of knowledge.
You don't need the motivation to get a good grade keep your interest for learning alive. Knowledge is power and learning new subjects such as science, history, or math enhances your qualities. Learning lowers your anxieties because it breaks you out of your normal mind pattern and gives your brain something to think about. (Such as figuring out why imaginary numbers were invented in math when it was already hard enough.)
Learning about new topics makes it easier to speak to people because you'll be more confident in your pool of vast knowledge. You'll have more opportunities to show off your intelligence when someone speaks to you.
9. Watch Documentaries
There's no reason to only use Netflix to catch up on House of Cards or Breaking Bad when there's a mountain of documentaries waiting to be seen. While it's perfectly normal to enjoy watching suspenseful movies, documentaries focuses your attention to specific real world problems you normally don't dwell about.
The first time I enjoyed watching documentaries was when I watched one about the fast food nation and how even “healthy” foods are starting to turn towards unnatural chemicals. This raised my awareness in Fast Foods restaurants (even though I already knew it was bad for me) and helped my persuasion to avoid going there too often.
There's a variety of topics that ranges from famous people in history, struggles in foreign countries, and the lifestyle of certain communities in your country. You see a general topic of discussion from other people perspective and gain a sense of empathy for other parts of the world.
10. Tweak into Basic Programming
When most people think about programming, they're quick to imagine a nerd behind a keyboard. But learning programming is an essential skill to have that not too many people could brag about.
You don't have to use programming for hacking into a giant company's computer or create the next best selling software. You can use that skill to tweak new functions on a website you're designing, or determine why your computer is acting strange, or how to mess with one of your favorite computer games.
There are dozens of hacks to choose from after learning a few basic programming codes. For today's hackers and enthuse programmers, learning the jack is fairly easily. All it takes is taking the time to learn it and a great place to start at is Codeacademy. (It's free in case you were wondering.)
11. Practice learning how to cook
You'll never encounter a situation where you'll regret knowing how to cook. (Unless your family decided to choose you to cook the entire Thanksgiving Dinner.) By learning how to cook, you raise your value to society because other people will naturally see you as a more worthy candidate than someone who only knows how to cook frozen pizzas. (It's kind of messed up when you think about it.)
What I also learned about cooking is that you feel more independent because you're not at the mercy of your parents cooking for you. Rather than relying on someone else to eat, you'll have the ability to make your own choice depending on your imagination. (Or how tired you are that day).
With the rise of fast foods, unnatural hormones, and fats being processed in most restaurants meals, cooking gives you total control in what you're putting in your body. And for those penny savers, cooking saves nearly half the cash that would have spent at expensive restaurants. (Unless they always ordered off the dollar menu. But that wouldn't be too good on their health.)
12. Learn how to play an instrument
We all love listening to music, but have you ever considered playing something yourself? Before you skip the idea, know that playing an instrument gives you more benefits than just listening to it. It improves your reasoning skills twice the amount if you were just learning how to dance or play sports.
Recent studies show music improves your academic success because your focus is improved and you'll be mentally sharp. To paint a prettier picture of what this means, whenever you listen to music, only a few sectors in your brain is being used to collect the instrument, words being said, and then your memories in relation to it.
However, whenever you're the one playing the guitar or piano, suddenly your brain has to process where to move your fingers, what notes to play, the way it sounds, memories that ignite your emotions, and much more. (There's pretty much a rave party going on in your head by simply playing a flute.) So the next time you walk near an instrument and want your brain shooting for joy, learn a few notes that'll trigger it.
Ukraine's double women's reigning world chess champion says she will not attend the $2 million world speed-chess championships after the game's governing body awarded the tournament next month to Saudi Arabia.
Several top players are joining the 27-year-old Ukrainian grandmaster, Anna Muzychuk, in boycotting the rapid and blitz championships, considered one the most exciting competitions in chess, citing human and women's rights concerns in the Middle Eastern country.
"Despite the record prize money, I am not going to play in Riyadh [which] means losing two world champion titles," Muzychuk, who is currently ranked second in the world in rapid chess and third in blitz, said in a Facebook posting on November 11.
"To risk your life, to wear abaya all the time?? Everything has its limits and headscarves in Iran was more than enough," she added in reference to the world championships that were held in Tehran earlier this year.
All women, foreigners and locals alike, are required to wear the abaya, a body-covering garment, in Saudi Arabia.
The measure is strictly enforced by Saudi authorities, though the World Chess Federation (FIDE) has said it is still finalizing details of the championships -- which run from December 26-30 in the Saudi capital -- and whether players will have to adhere to such clothing rules.
'What's Next? North Korea?'
Saudi officials have said players will be made welcome at the tournament, but have not commented on whether participants will be made to follow local clothing and social requirements.
Nonetheless, critics such as Emil Sutovsky, the president of the Association of Chess Professionals, note that FIDE's own statutes commit the governing body to rejecting "discriminatory treatment for national, political, racial, social, or religious reasons, or on account of gender."
"[A] record budget will surely help FIDE leaders to neglect the fact that Israeli, Iranian, and Qatari players are not allowed to enter [Saudi Arabia]," he said in a Facebook post.
"Getting used to that. And we should welcome the new rich sponsors, of course. They may be even kind enough not to demand the female players to wear burka. Probably only a headscarf. They ARE changing, you see! And chess helps to build bridges," he added.
Adds former European Chess Union President Silvio Danailov, a vocal critic of FIDE: "After Iran and Saudi Arabia what's next, Democratic People's Republic of Korea?"
Tumultuous Year
The boycott is yet another in a tumultuous year for women's chess.
Dorsa Derakhshani, 19, was banned by the Iranian Chess Federation after failing to wear a hijab in January at the Gibraltar Chess Festival. She then left Iran for the United States and will now compete as an official U.S. chess player, the U.S. Chess Federation said last month on its website.
Nazi Paikidze the Georgian-American reigning U.S. chess champion at the time of the February world championships, boycotted that event when FIDE supported the "morality laws" in Iran that require women to restrict their contact with males in public and cover their heads.
Muzychuk, who wore a headscarf while participating in Tehran, placed second in the competition.
Toronto's next mayoral election is still two years away, but only one in four voters seem willing to give Mayor Rob Ford a second term, a new poll shows.
In a Nanos Research telephone survey conducted between Sept. 29 and Oct. 4, 400 Torontonians were asked which of two views best reflected their personal opinion: Mr. Ford should be re-elected or it will be time for change in the next election?
Only 26 per cent of respondents said Mr. Ford should be re-elected, while 56 per cent supported a mayoral change and 18 per cent were unsure.
Story continues below advertisement
Men were more likely to support Mr. Ford than women (29 per cent and 23 per cent respectively).
The Globe's Kelly Grant spoke with pollster Nik Nanos about the results. The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.
Q: What do you make of that result?
A: What it means is that for Rob Ford, with all the controversies that he has to deal with, he still has one out of every four voters in the bag at this particular point in time. The thing is, people are twice as likely to think the next election is going to be time for a change. The big question is about those voters who are unsure. Where will they move? We have to realize at this point there's no real counterpoint to Rob Ford as an alternative. If it's a two-person race come the next election, it's going to be much more difficult for Rob Ford as opposed to a field of multiple candidates.
Q: How much impact does the "time for a change" question have? How much does that influence people's votes?
A: The irony of it is that the last election was time for a change. Ford was the agent of change. Two years later, people are thinking it's time to change the agent of change. I think it speaks to the fact that perhaps Rob Ford has not delivered the type of change that people want.
Q: We talked about a week ago now about the fact that Rob seems to be different from other politicians in that things that would sink another politician seem not to stick to him in the same way. Considering all the troubles he's had, are you surprised he still has the support of one in four voters?
Story continues below advertisement

A: I think based on his performance in the last municipal election, we have to remember that Rob Ford has delivered change to the city of Toronto, whether people like it or not. I think what this speaks to is the fact that he's a polarizing figure, and that even through the polarization and so forth, that he still has one out of every four Torontonians who believe at this point he should be re-elected. What we don't know is whether this is the low point for him or not? Because I think if you're looking at a lot of the controversies that he's dealing with in the media, I think one could argue that this has to be a low point or near a low point and he's still at 26 per cent. If he can deliver the type of change that people want and can actually have a track record to run on in the next election, based on what he believes he's accomplished in his term as mayor, it's not inconceivable that he can start pushing his support up. But a lot of it is going to have to do with the practicality of what he has delivered as mayor of Toronto.

A left-wing group within Welsh Labour is promoting a change that could make it more likely that the next First Minister is a supporter of Jeremy Corbyn.
Worried moderates are now renewing their efforts to persuade Carwyn Jones to stay on in the post until after the general election in 2020.
Swansea East AM Mike Hedges, himself a supporter of Mr Corbyn, has written a blog posting for the website of Welsh Labour Grassroots – effectively Momentum in Wales – which argues that Welsh Labour should adopt the “one member, one vote” (OMOV) system of electing a leader when Mr Jones steps down.
Currently, Welsh Labour leaders are chosen by an electoral college split into three sections: one for AMs, MPs and MEPs, another for ordinary members of the party, and the third for trade unions and other organisations affiliated to Labour like the Socialist Health Association.
But the electoral college is no longer used in elections for Labour's overall leader, and Mr Hedges points out that other parties in Wales already use OMOV to elect their leaders.
That's how Leanne Wood of Plaid Cymru and Andrew RT Davies of the Welsh Conservatives were elected. OMOV was also used to elect the Liberal Democrats' federal leader Tim Farron and Paul Nuttall, the leader of Ukip.
Mr Hedges states: “It would be strange if the only party not to elect its leader via OMOV was Welsh Labour.”

Labour's Welsh Executive Committee is expected to consider the issue in the coming months.
A Labour source said: “This is a difficult situation, and will have an enormous bearing on who controls the party in Wales. Decision makers in Welsh Labour can't be seen to oppose OMOV – that would be undemocratic, particularly given that moderates in the party campaigned for it to replace the electoral college over many years.
“The problem is that if Carwyn stands down as leader in 2019, as many expect him to, there is a very strong possibility that a Corbyn supporter would be elected firstly as Welsh Labour leader and then as First Minister.
“That's something moderates would not want to see happen. If it did, the party could embark on a series of ‘loony left' policies that would alienate the Welsh electorate and destroy Labour's predominant position in Wales. People are therefore making the case to Carwyn that he should stay on until at least the general election in 2020.”
It is understood that former Public Services Minister Leighton Andrews is among those urging Mr Jones to stay on.
“The Labour source added: “Another problem is that unless the rules are tightened to ensure Welsh Labour is led by an AM, you could have a situation where the election was won by an MP or even an ordinary member of the party not in an elected office. That would be completely ridiculous.”
With Labour likely to be defeated in the 2020 general election, the expectation was that Mr Corbyn would resign as leader, and the party would then revert to being more moderate.
A nearly $1 million grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is helping University of California researchers refine collaborative robotic technology that could change the way crops are maintained worldwide, saving millions of gallons of water each year and taking precision agriculture to a whole new level.
The three-year Robot-Assisted Precision Irrigation and Diagnostics (RAPID) project is led by UC Merced robotics professor Stefano Carpin, UC Berkeley professor Ken Goldberg — director of the People and Robots Initiative at the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) and the Banatao Institute — and UC Davis biology and engineering associate professor Stavros Vougioukas.
Some studies estimate that 85 percent of the world's freshwater is used for agriculture, and existing methods of maintaining crops could be improved. The researchers plan to show they can conserve more water through co-robotics, with workers interacting with technology for precision irrigation, ideally at the individual plant level.
This comes from looking for ways to address drought and agricultural concerns,” said Carpin, with the School of Engineering. “Anything we can do to save water is, and will continue to be, very important.”
Beginning on the vine
For now, the research could make wine drinkers happy, too, as the researchers plan to start with grape vines after talking to growers in the Central Valley and Napa Valley about crop concerns.
The RAPID system includes small, plastic emitters — that cost about 25 cents each — attached to individual irrigation lines and precisely controlled by handheld devices operated by field workers or mounted on mobile robots. The devices signal the emitters to adjust the amount of water each vine receives.
With the handheld devices, Vougioukas said, the researchers will water each grape vine individually, making sure they can deliver the exact amount of water each vine needs to keep it healthy and achieving its best yield. Goldberg said the co-robotics system is far less expensive than more common retrofits to existing irrigation systems
“We want to start with grapes, because the final product so heavily depends on fine adjustments,” Carpin said. “We've grown grapes for thousands of years, and we do it very well, but growing grapes is a tricky art and science. “You don't want too much water in the individual grapes. You need to stress the vines in exactly the right way to get a quality harvest, but not so little that the vines die.”
The USDA grant — a first for Carpin and Goldberg — will support the researchers and their students over the next three years as they optimize RAPID. The project is part of the National Science Foundation's National Robotics Initiative, the country's premier robotics program, and involves three of the four UC CITRIS campuses.
Farmers are already using technology such as infrared sensing and drones to monitor fields from the air to focus on individual plants that are receiving too much or too little water.
“One remaining challenge is how to close the loop — how to adjust irrigation based on the aerial image data,” Goldberg said. “This co-robotics system is the next generation of precision agriculture.”
The robots have to be robust and sturdy, Carpin said, and the Central Valley is a good testing area — between the summer heat and the dust, it can be an inhospitable place for sensitive equipment. The tests will determine if the robotics can work as well in different environments as they have in laboratory situations.
The campuses are pursuing a joint patent on the technology, so there are commercial possibilities, Goldberg said. The potential for use in any agricultural application makes it a perfect illustration of the People and Robots Initiative and of CITRIS itself.
”This really is the core of what CITRIS was founded for,” he said. “We want to develop technology that benefits humanity, the economy and the environment.”
If you're looking for a big name to voice the president in Fallout 3, who would better to get than, well, a former U.S. President. Lev Chapelsky of the Hollywood firm Blindlight tried just that.
"Celebrity acquisition applies not just to celebrity actors but to sports figures, politicians — we've made offers to Bill Clinton for video games and gotten great responses with attorneys who have said, 'The former president will not participate in one of your video game products, thank you very much'," says Chapelsky.
"We appreciated that frankness and candor — you don't get that kind of candor from Creative Artists Agency, frankly. If the answers no, they don't return your call for six months."
Chapelsky wanted to snag Clinton for the very obvious role of the president in Fallout 3. "Wouldn't that have been brilliant? You get to that point in game," he adds, "and you hear that voice in the ether coming from off-camera and you're like, 'I know that guy!'" Yeah, that's Bill Clinton!

Working harder - earning less. That is what today's release of productivity and labor costs showed us. With that also comes the realization that a lot more people would be reciting the classic prose of Johnny Paycheck's "Take This Job And Shove It"if they thought they had an option to find work elsewhere.
This report, of course, shines the light on one of the primary reasons that the poor keep getting poorer even as the economy struggles to recover at the weakest rate of any post-WWII period on record. In the most recent release of the data - productivity slowed in the fourth quarter even as hours worked rose. Nonfarm business productivity eased to an annualized 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter as hours worked increased an annualized 2.9 percent after a 0.9 percent gain the third quarter. This in turn is also a bad sign for corporate profit margins as unit labor costs rose sharply at an annualized 1.2 percent, following a 2.1 percent decrease in the third quarter. Can you say "margin compression?"
Compensation did rise slightly in the 4th quarter but is still running at a negative rate of 1.2% from last year. Working longer hours but earning less - the plight of the average American continues.
However, beyond the media headlines, there is more to the current levels of productivity and labor costs than meets the eye. The decline in real hourly compensation has also dragged output per hour of all persons lower. This is an interesting data point as the media continues to try and point to all the reasons why we are NOT currently in a recession. However, the last time we had falling output and negative real compensation was during the last recession in 2008.
Furthermore, when it comes to a recovery in employment, it is cheaper, particularly when the government keeps extending 100% tax credits for businesses capital good spending, to implant technology whenever possible to keep employment down. Businesses remainly keenly focused on the bottom line particularly as payroll and benefit costs continue to climb each year as aggregate end demand drags. However, if businesses can increase productivity without increasing employment those net gains flow directly to the bottom line. This attitude, of course, not only stifles the need for employment but also lowers wage requirements as the available labor pool competes for fewer jobs.
Don't believe me. Just think about all of the receptionist jobs that have been replaced by automated machines:
Press 1 for English (Should that even be necessary in America?)
Press 2 for Customer Service (Isn't that why you called in the first place?)
Press 3 to be placed on permanent hold (When calling your electric company).
I am happy to announce that Giochix and I have teamed up to bring you The Foreign King Giveaway!
This giveaway is for two copies (two winners) of the game. This contest will end June 4th, 2016 at 11:59 PM CST and is open to EU, Canada and US.
From BGG: Incited by the economic and political interests of the bourgeoisie, a liberal regime of monarchy was constituted in Belgium on 1830 gaining the independence from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. The Congress of the new fragile Kingdom called the German Prince Leopold of Saxe Coburg and Saafeld to occupy the Throne: the first Belgian King, Leopold I, took office in the 1831. The new foreign King must solve many problems starting from the industrialization of a rural Country divided by different political and religious groups. In The Foreign King, players take on the roles of influential Belgian bourgeoisie and who industrialize Belgian provinces, build metallurgical and textile factories in order to obtain greater economic power, vote in the National Congress seeking to increase their political influence, expand its social mass and send to the provinces under their dominion at the highest authority, King Leopold I of Belgium, to revise the provinces in the pursuit of their own interests. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game will win the game.
Please make sure you read the official Giveaway Geek rules before entering. For any questions, thoughts or feedback leave a comment using the form at the bottom of this post or use the form on my contact page to shoot me an email.
The winner will be contacted via email upon which the individual will be required to respond with 48 hours or a runner-up winner will be selected.

Chinese embassy asks US to stop muscle flexing in the South China Sea
BEIJING, June 9 (People's Daily, Chen Shangwen) “China is exercising its legitimate rights by upholding the sovereignty of our islands in the South China Sea.” The New York Times received a dispassionate retort from the Chinese embassy, in response to NYT's editorial titled “Playing Chicken in the South China Sea”.
The editorial on May 21 noted the incident that two Chinese fighter jets monitored the American plane carrying out close reconnaissance in Chinese coastal waters. “A collision could have been catastrophic,” the editorial board asserted Chinese jet done an “unsafe” maneuver. Then it brought about the arbitration case launched by the Philippines against China over the South China Sea.
In the letter to NYT's editorial page, Zhu Haiquan, the press counselor and spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in the U.S., stressed that Chinese military aircraft followed the American plane from a safe distance. “Our operation was completely compliant with safety and professional standards. The attempt at intimidation by American military aircraft in the South China Sea, however, was not.” he wrote.
As for the arbitration case, Zhu Haiquan once again explained that China's sovereignty over the Nansha Islands and Xisha Islands was restored after World War II, in accordance with the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation. “But in the 1970s, certain countries started to illegally occupy some islands and reefs of the Nansha Islands.” he mentioned.
China firmly believes that the only way to resolve the disputes is the negotiation between states directly concerned, and has already signed border treaties through peaceful negotiations with 12 out of 14 land neighbors. The same practice should be adopted in the South China Sea. “By not accepting or participating in the arbitration unilaterally initiated by the Philippines, China is acting in accordance with international law.” he emphasized.
“We hope the United States, instead of flexing muscles, could play a responsible and constructive role to promote dialogue and negotiation.” he added.
Mr. Umarov's influence had seemed to be waning in recent years, until he surfaced in a video in July, ordering his followers to do whatever was possible to attack Russia as it prepared to be the host of the Winter Olympics in Sochi. Although no one has claimed responsibility for the attacks in Volgograd, Mr. Umarov's threats, largely ignored at the time, suddenly seemed ominous, chillingly citing Russia's transportation networks as potential targets.

Now, experts say, the question is whether the suicide bombings in Volgograd and one previous attack there are the first volleys in Mr. Umarov's promised campaign to disrupt the Olympic Games and discredit the government of President Vladimir V. Putin.
“The big question is will there be this sort of wave,” said Gordon M. Hahn, a senior associate with the Center of Strategic and International Studies who has written extensively on Islamic terror groups in the Caucasus. “This is already a pretty high level — the fact that they pulled off three suicide bombings in Volgograd in two months. If their idea is to build up a crescendo, they have to take it easy because they'll have to do something really big.”
The attacks prompted false reports of other bombings in Volgograd and the brief evacuation of Red Square here in Moscow after a woman left a package or bag near St. Basil's Cathedral. They also called into question Russia's preparedness for an international sporting event that Mr. Putin and others intend to be a showcase of the country's revival since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Mr. Putin, who has made no public remarks since Sunday's attack, ordered the tightening of security across the country after holding a series of meetings with government and security officials, according to the Kremlin. He dispatched the director of the Federal Security Service, Aleksandr V. Bortnikov, to Volgograd to oversee the investigation and enhanced security measures.
Two weeks ago I provided nine nonbeef burger recipes. Consider these recipes an addendum: homemade alternatives to the bottled and jarred condiments that are lined up like summer's foot soldiers on our refrigerator doors.
Why spend time making your own condiments? A legitimate question, even for cooks who embrace the D.I.Y. mentality that yields things like homemade salad dressings, salsas and hummus, all of which could be considered “condiments” in their own right. But when it comes to ketchup and its brethren — relish, barbecue sauce and the like — most of us cave and revert to the store-bought versions.
Resist that impulse. The reasons are the same as they are for countless other foods that you can readily grab at the store: controlling and customizing flavor and avoiding worthless (or harmful) artificial ingredients. Those are enough for me.
My ketchup, for example, is a respite from the commercial brands laden with high-fructose corn syrup. I know that neither you nor I will ever rely exclusively on homemade ketchup, but it's a super option.
In addition to classic burger and dog accompaniments, I've included condiments that will find their way onto things other than meat in a bun, like corn-and-tomato relish — a quintessential summer sauce to spoon over simply grilled fish, chicken or meat — and teriyaki sauce.
None of these can languish in your fridge for months on end, which is what happens when you don't load things up with preservatives. The recipes here all yield quantities that you'll use over the course of a few grilling sessions, or at one big party. The exception is chimichurri, the addictive Argentine herb sauce that you'll want to use right away. But that's O.K.: You can't buy anything nearly as good at the store.
LIBREVILLE (Reuters) - Central African Republic's government and rebels agreed on Friday to the formation of a national unity government under a ceasefire deal to end an insurgency that swept to within striking distance of the capital.

The agreement, signed in Gabon's coastal capital Libreville after three days of talks mediated by regional neighbors, averted the biggest threat to President Francois Bozize's decade in charge of the mineral-rich former French colony.
Aid groups had warned that a rebel attack on the capital Bangui could trigger a humanitarian crisis.
“God is great. He has spared us from the grave,” Bozize told reporters after arriving at Bangui airport late on Friday. “I will finish my term, which ends in 2016.”
Rebel spokesman Eric Massi said the deal was good for the country's conflict-weary citizens, but warned fighting could erupt again if the government failed to meet a list of rebel demands included in the accord.
Massi said that among the Seleka rebel coalition's demands was the release of political prisoners held by the government and the withdrawal of most of the foreign forces deployed to reinforce the country's military.
The deal also called for the transitional government to have a prime minister drawn from the opposition, and for a parliamentary election to be held within 12 months to replace the current national assembly.
“We will judge Mr. Bozize's sincerity in the coming days,” Massi told Reuters by telephone.
Seleka, a coalition of five separate rebel groups, launched its insurgency in early December, accusing Bozize of reneging on a 2007 peace deal supposed to provide jobs and money to insurgents who laid down their weapons.
African countries - including Chad, Gabon, Cameroon, and Congo - deployed hundreds of troops to shore up Bozize's army after a string of defeats forced the army back to within 75 kilometers (45 miles) of Bangui.
The rebels had previously insisted that Bozize's resignation was a precondition for peace and that the president, who seized power in a Chadian-backed 2003 coup, should stand trial at the International Criminal Court.
Chad President Idriss Deby, who attended the signing ceremony, said the deal marked a good compromise.
“We have not undermined the integrity of the constitution of the Central African Republic. President Bozize was elected for a five-year term and he should carry on until that is finished,” Deby told reporters in Libreville.
‘AID ORPHAN'
U.N. special envoy to the Central African Republic, Margaret Vogt, told the U.N. Security Council on Friday that the government and rebels needed to discuss why past peace deals had failed to avoid history repeating itself.
“We are hopeful that the agreements that were signed today in Libreville will contain the immediate flare-up and will calm the situation in CAR,” Vogt told the 15-member council via videolink from Libreville.
“However, failure to go further to discuss the reasons for the lack of implementation of previous agreements and to correct these may lead to another meltdown, a few years down the line again, as a result of lost expectations and frustrations.”
Central African Republic is one of a number of countries in the region where U.S. Special Forces are helping local soldiers hunt down the Lord's Resistance Army, an unrelated rebel group that has killed thousands of civilians across four nations.
The country remains one of the least developed on the planet despite rich deposits of gold, diamonds and uranium.
Vogt described the Central African Republic as an “aid orphan” and called for investment in peace and development to prevent the country from “falling down a slippery slope.”
She said security was fundamental and that the success of the insurgency had been more a result of the failure of the government security forces than of the capacity of the rebels, adding that the army had “lost cohesion and the will to fight.”

“Many of the soldiers simply dropped their weapons and melted into the bush,” Vogt said.
“The international community now needs to engage more forcefully, both diplomatically and financially, to pull CAR from the brink,” she said, adding that U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon had given the country the “same level of priority that he has accorded to Syria, Somalia and Mali”.
The Security Council welcomed the peace deal in a statement on Friday and called for it to be implemented quickly. It also urged all parties to allow safe and unhindered aid access and called for the release of civilians held by armed groups.
Hillary Clinton may be down with texting and letting loose in Cartegena nightclubs, but she's not ready for her big-screen debut -- at least not yet.
Jason Segel, who stars in TV's "How I Met Your Mother," said last week that the secretary of state turned down his offer to work with him on screen.
"Everyone always asks me, like on a red carpet or wherever, 'Who is the mother?'" Segel said while appearing on "Late Night With Jimmy Fallon" Thursday, referring to the mystery identity of the eponymous matriarch of his hit show. "I always say Hillary Clinton as a joke."
Apparently, Clinton paid attention to his repeated references.
"I got a letter in the mail," Segel told Fallon. "I got a rejection letter from Hillary Clinton."
On Monday, Politico obtained Clinton's note to Segel, which comically references his past roles in "The Muppets" and "Forgetting Sarah Marshall." Clinton wrote:
"I was delighted to read about your interest in sharing the big screen with me. As you can imagine, I am a little occupied at the moment, but perhaps someday I can help you forget Sarah Marshall ... again. My only condition is that there be Muppets involved, and that is non-negotiable. In the meantime, you have my best wishes for continued success with your career.
Taysom Hill's decision should be known publically soon. The problem is, I don't know how to react either way. I don't know what he is going to do, but I definitely don't know how I feel about his options. The way I see it, Taysom has four options: 1. Come back and compete with Tanner Mangum for the starting QB job; 2. Graduate transfer to another college to play one last year as a QB; 3. Come back to BYU and switch positions; or 4. Hang it up for good.
If Taysom picks to return to BYU as a Quarterback, more questions arise. What happens to Tanner Mangum? Can you convince the 23 year old Sophomore to redshirt a year? Should he even be presented with that option or has he earned the right to start. There is no guarantee that Tanner would lose an open QB competition with Taysom. I honestly have no idea who would win such a contest. The only thing I know is that you can't have it both ways. Would the coaches be able to trust that Taysom could make it through a whole season?
Taysom could return and pick up right where he left off against Nebraska. He looked great passing and running the ball that game. He could lead BYU to the promise land or you could call it a very successful season. He could have that season we all have been waiting for him to have, but he hasn't been able to complete it because of injury.
If Taysom picks to be a graduate transfer to another University the question is where does he go? Does he go join Bronco Mendenhall in Virginia? Maybe he goes back to Stanford, or rejoins Harbaugh in Michigan? Stanford would make sense for life after football. Of all the transfer options I think Stanford would be the best for Taysom. If football ultimately doesn't work he can start on a masters at one of the nation's academic institutions.
Graduate transfers have had success. Russell Wilson played one year at Wisconsin after a graduate transfer and he led them to a rose bowl and is a great NFL quarterback, starter, and a super bowl champion. Wilson didn't have to medical redshirt though. He transferred because he decided to go play baseball, but changed his mind and NC State already moved on. So, Wilson moved on to Wisconsin for a year.
If Taysom picks to return to the Y and switch positions, which one would he choose? He could be a running back. You could see Mangum under center with Hill and Williams in the Y formation next year. (The field may actually spontaneously combust because it can't hold that much awesomeness). He has already proven to be a very talented runner, although you could argue running too much may have lead to some injury. Maybe he could switch to wide receiver, or tight end. He has speed and size, but would need to learn how be a better blocker. Being a wide out would allow him to use his athleticism without taking so many hits.
The long shot, but still plausible would be for BYU to switch him to defense. He could deliver hits instead of taking them. Kalani Sitake could use the Whittingham model of taking a great athlete and putting him in the secondary. Not saying it's going to happen, but anything is possible.
The last option would be that Taysom decides he's had enough and hangs it up. He turns away from football, joins Wall Street and stays healthy. He rides off into the sunset leaving us all to think “What might have been”. This is very possible as well. He has discovered his talents outside of football and will be successful.
What will Taysom choose? Your guess is as good as mine. If by some miracle Taysom gives this post a read he should know that this writer wishes him nothing but success. I enjoyed watching number 4 play and would enjoy watching him play more. I would even cheer for him if he wore a different jersey next year. I'll always see him as a Cougar regardless of the choice. I'm anxious to find out what he chooses, and to see where that next leap takes him. Oh and Go Cougars!
In January 2015, Malcolm Bird took his 1-year-old daughter, Collette, to an emergency room after she started bleeding heavily from a cut on her finger. The doctor cleaned up the cut, put a Band-Aid on it, and sent them home.
A few weeks later, the family received a bill in the mail for $629. The breakdown of the bill was $7 for the Band-Aid, and $622 for what's known as an "emergency room facility fee” — the price a hospital charges for seeking services from an emergency room, no matter what problem a patient is having.
Sarah Kliff, a senior policy correspondent at Vox, got word of Bird's story and started looking into how emergency room fees seemingly come out of thin air. She tells the story in the first episode of Vox's new podcast, The Impact, which dropped today.
“As a health care reporter, I see a lot of [medical] bills, but this one struck me as pretty incredible,” says Kliff. “The more I looked into it, the more I realized that there's a really interesting health care story here — about how these prices are completely unregulated, and how this makes us really different from other countries. That's how you end up with these really crazy-sounding health care bills.”
As Kliff began reviewing bills from across the country, she found that emergency room facility fees vary wildly. She's seen some as low as $300, while others have topped $3,000. And these fees are often kept secret from patients.
“You're not going to see them posted on the emergency room door,” she says. “You're just going to find out like Malcolm did, when you're expected to pay it.”
According to Kliff, hospital executives argue that this is the cost of keeping a hospital up and running 24 hours a day, but not all agree with that sentiment.
“A lot of health economists are pretty skeptical of that argument because you see such widespread variation,” she says. “You think emergency rooms, there is a little bit of variety, but the price of running one should be roughly in some kind of ballpark, but these fees are just all over the place, and they're kept secret.”
On the whole, Kliff says hospitals just have more clout than insurance companies or patients.
“At the end of the day, the hospital is the one who owns the emergency room,” she says. “It's really a policy story about how we've built our health insurance world. One thing that is going on, in most other countries, basically in every other developed country, they have price regulation in health care — they've decided that health care is something like a utility, like electricity or water, and therefore the government should regulate it as such because it's something everyone needs to stay alive.”
The United States has decided to go a different way.
“[In America], hospitals can essentially choose whatever prices they would like to set, and you're often dealing with areas where you have one dominant hospital system that can really pick its own price,” Kliff says. “It doesn't operate like other markets.”
While the vast majority of Americans have some form of health insurance, there's been a large rise in high-deductible plans.
“Malcolm, for example, that entire $629 bill, that was in his deductible, so he was 100 percent responsible,” says Kliff.
Data on emergency room facility fees are typically kept private because “insurance companies don't want their competitors to know what rate they negotiated, and hospitals see no need to make this public,” Kliff says.
In order to collect this information, Kliff is encouraging everyday people to send Vox their hospital bills. Click here to learn more.

We've been looking at Whisper, a messaging system that runs on top of the ÐΞVp2p peer-to-peer network. The same network that is run by all Ethereum nodes.
It has a number of characteristics that, in time, could make it the standard component that developers reach for when they need to add messaging to their code.
Being based on a peer-to-peer network, you do not need any servers. When you're developing an app, that is a big win. No contracts with cloud providers, no server infrastructure to maintain.
Whispers use of encryption and a smart routing mechanism ensure that both the contents of messages and the metadata (who talks to whom) are kept private. This is not only a big win for the users, but also for the developers. Not having access to the data of their users means less liability. Developers cannot accidentally leak the data, they cannot be coerced to hand it over to a third party and they cannot censor it.
Our prototype
We would like to see how far we could get in using Whisper in a normal development setting. So we decided to start a prototype of a chat app using Whisper.
We ended up with the following architecture:
-------------------------------- | Our Simple Chat App | | | ----------------- | ----------------------- | | Ethereum Node | | | The Shhwift Library | | JSON-RPC | | | | | <-----------------> | | ----------------------- | | | -------------------------------- -----------------
We start an Ethereum node (in this case Geth) and connect to it using its JSON-RPC interface. For most of our testing we ran the ethereum node on a computer, and connected to it from the phone. We also attempted to run an Ethereum node on the phone with limited success.
We created a library we called Shhwift that wraps the JSON-RPC methods for Whisper in Swift, so that we could easily call them from our app.
And we created a very simple chat application that uses the library to send and receive messages.
To avoid having to deal with key-exchange, we only sent broadcast messages that can be received by anyone listening for them.
Outcome
With this setup we were able to send messages from one phone to the other over the internet. Every now and then. Maybe.
Only when all the conditions were right then the messages would arrive. (both nodes were lucky enough to find and hold on to a Whisper enabled peer, the messages propagated through the peer-to-peer network in time before they expired). Most of the time they wouldn't.
Shortcomings
We found several areas in which we think that Whisper falls short of being a great solution for real world applications.
The documentation of Whisper is sparse, and not always correct. After implementing the Shhwift library according to the JSON-RPC spec, we had to change the implementation in several ways in order to make it work with Geth.
It is not easy to run any implementation of Ethereum on a phone. We were able to build a version of Geth for iOS, but it is severely limited. It only works on 32-bit iOS devices. It doesn't work on the iOS simulator. And it will start downloading the complete Ethereum blockchain, which is several gigabytes in size.
The license of the two main Ethereum implementations is (L)GPL, making them unsuitable for use in iOS apps, because it prohibits publication on the Apple App Store.
You have to explicitly enable Whisper when starting an Ethereum node. This means that almost no-one is running a Whisper node, which makes it hard to propagate messages between peers. The fact that there are two incompatible implementations of Whisper only exacerbates this issue. Geth implements version 2 of Whisper, whereas Ethereum-C++ implements version 3.
Because there is no large-scale Whisper network running yet, the performance of it running at scale is currently unknown.
It seems that most of the development activity in Ethereum is focussed on the blockchain, and less on Whisper. Little progress has been made on answering the fundamental questions such as scalability.
The good news
Fortunately almost all of these shortcomings are being addressed.
Significant work is being done to make Ethereum suitable for mobile phones. Zsolt Felföldi is implementing a light client in Geth that entered a public testing phase. The Ethereum-C++ client is likely to follow suit.
The licensing page of Ethereum mentions the intention to eventually arrive at a license that allows “use in any commercial environment, closed or open source”.
Whisper will likely be enabled by default in a future version of Ethereum, creating a large network of Whisper nodes.
Conclusion
Our attempt to create a chat prototype based on Whisper was driven by a desire to learn more about its possibilities and shortcomings.
We have seen the potential that Whisper can grow into a widely used solution for messaging with major improvements over the currently available solutions.
The fact that there are shortcomings is only natural considering the maturity of Whisper. It is clearly marked as being an experimental prototype that needs further work. It seems that most of these shortcomings are being addressed.
The big remaining question is whether Whisper will perform at scale. Only time will tell.

CBS has put in development Moreau, a drama series inspired by H.G. Wells' classic sci-fi novel The Island Of Dr. Moreau. Sleepy Hollow co-creator Phillip Iscove, who left the Fox drama at the end of last season, is writing the script for CBS TV Studios and studio-based Kennedy/Marshall.
In the TV adaptation, the title character of disgraced London physiologist Dr. Moreau — who retreats to an island to work on his experiments creating animal-human hybrids — is a woman. Fiercely intelligent and fearless, Dr. K atherine Moreau expands the boundaries of medicine through bold and revolutionary scientific experimentation and treatments in her privately funded island hospital. Iscove executive produces with Marshall and Robert Zotnowski of the Kennedy/Marshall Co.
The Island Of Dr. Moreau is one of the most frequently adapted Wells books, with a slew of movies based on it including the 1932 Bela Lugosi starrer The Island Of Lost Souls, the 1977 feature starring Burt Lancaster and Michael York and the infamous 1996 film toplined by Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer. Warner Bros has been developing a new big-screen treatment with Leonardo DiCaprio's Appian Way.
Iscove was an up-and-coming writer who has been an assistant at UTA when his idea for a new take on another 19th century literary classic, The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow, got the attention of Alex Kurtzman and Bob Orci, who invited him to write together the pilot script for what would become the Fox series Sleepy Hollow. At CBS TV Studios, Iscove joins former Sleepy Hollow showrunner Mark Goffman, who also left the Fox/20th TV series after two seasons and now is under an overall deal at CBS Studios.
This is the second sale for Kennedy/Marshall this season; the company also has EDM-themed drama The Drop set at the CW.
JANUARY 20 — Malindo Air is named after the home countries of its joint venture partners, and my first flight on the airline took me to a state that took centre stage in post-colonial South-east Asia as the leaders and people of Malaya, Indonesia and the Philippines fought over competing concepts of Malaysia, Melayu Raya and Maphilindo, arguing from geographic convenience, ideological preferences and nostalgic irredentism.
Queuing for immigration at Kuching International Airport is the first reminder of Sarawak's autonomy, and it is an autonomy that in recent years has been strongly defended by the efforts of its late Chief Minister Tan Sri Adenan Satem, who tragically passed away while I was there.
He had led high profile campaigns in the interests of Sarawakians, including securing jobs and other guarantees from Petronas; demanding increased oil royalties; taking a new approach towards critical NGOs and the environment; defending the official use of English; and instructing Members of Parliament to vote against legislation he thought violated the spirit of the 1963 Malaysia Agreement.
Through these efforts he created cross-party unity that has no parallel in West Malaysia, and I observed the deep respect and genuine affection towards him from the people I met. I now appreciate why many West Malaysians yearn for leaders with the same mindset.
These political differences are symbiotic with wider cultural values expressed in the state, reflected in a powerful Sarawakian identity: Rooted not just in its constitutional position arising from past agreements, but also its unique history and particular demographics (people of many ethnic origins celebrate their additional identities while remaining proudly Sarawakian).
There are visible manifestations of this: I saw numerous cars carrying the slogan “Sarawak for Sarawakians,” accompanied by the flag or coat of arms of the former Kingdom of Sarawak. By contrast, on KL's roads you can see licence plates adorned with the stars of the European Union juxtaposed with peninsular state abbreviations, completely devoid of any historical meaning.
It might seem bewildering to a peninsular Malaysian why Sarawakians would want to celebrate the legacy of the White Rajahs, but that is because of our bewildering ignorance of Sarawakian history. Sarawak's annexation by the British Crown before its eventual incorporation into Malaysia is hardly understood by West Malaysians; let alone the idea that Sarawakians could ardently support independence under Brooke rule.
Perhaps catalysed by political dynamics, there may now be a greater thirst for Sarawakians to assert their own history, making up for what is seen as utterly inadequate treatment in the school curriculum.
The writer (right) at the Brooke Gallery with Brooke Trust director Jason Brooke.
At the four-month old Brooke Gallery at Fort Margherita — a collaboration between the Brooke Trust, the Sarawak Museum Department and the Sarawak Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture — I was given a tour by Jason Brooke, director of the Brooke Trust and grandson of the last Rajah Muda, who told me that enthusiasm from local visitors and volunteers has been remarkable.
Thoroughly curated and adorned by stunning artefacts including the former Sword of State, the exhibition tells a highly educational narrative of Brooke rule before ending with a gorgeous riverside view on the fort's roof. Perhaps others would wish to present different narratives; surely that would trigger fruitful discourse.
I was keen to catch a glimpse of the state's future too: after playing squash with the next generation of players at the Sarawak Club, I visited Tanoti Crafts, an award-winning social enterprise comprising women weavers and artisans that began as a workshop under Yayasan Tuanku Nur Zahirah.
Now privatised, I saw how traditional methods of Sarawak songket weaving are inspiring and supplying a new generation of discerning consumers and culturally-sensitive businesses. Later this year they hope to expand at Borneo 744, a vast new space for entrepreneurs and artists currently under construction.
Though I met hugely generous and diverse people in my short trip, three days in Kuching (and just one bowl of Sarawak laksa) is hardly enough. I will be back, and have tentatively agreed to climb Mount Santubong and kayak up the Rajang...
At the last national day celebrations, the late Tan Sri Adenan Satem said: “The state has no intention of wanting to weaken the Federation of Malaysia, as it is only claiming its rights enshrined under the Federal Constitution, Malaysia Agreement 1963, the Malaysia Act, the Inter-Governmental Reports and Recommendations and the Cobbold Commission Report... the willingness of the Prime Minister... to devolve power and return the autonomy powers of Sarawak, which has been eroded all this while, has enlivened the spirit of Sarawak to ensure Malaysia continues to remain strong.”
Bold words, and inspirational ones, for let us not forget that all the states of the peninsula, too, joined a federation based on agreement.

While the most exciting deal of GameStop's 2015 Black Friday sale is letting employee's take all of Thanksgiving off, $299 PlayStation 4 and Xbox One bundles, $80 used PS3 and Xbox 360 systems and the best possible Wii U bundle aren't too shabby either.
As a former GameStop employee the idea that stores aren't opening until Friday morning at 5 AM (last year it was midnight) is glorious. The employees get some rest, the customers still get to stand out in the cold—everybody wins.
Of course folks win more if they score one of this year's bigger deals, but flipping through the circular I'm not seeing anything too amazing.
$299 console bundles are great, but everyone will have those. There are some pretty great game deals, so there's that.

Well there's that, which is basically everything you need for your Wii U. I'm amazed they got both of those games pre-loaded on one hard drive. If you've ever considered buying a Wii U, this would be the one.
Been in a GameStop lately and gotten a hard-sell on collectibles? There are tons of them in this year's ad. Great prices on Skylandcers figures too, but those GameStop-exclusive Pop! Vinyls for $1.00 more than the rest of the line retails for you can probably skip.
No, this is the year of the pre-owned systems. First off, there's a buy two, get one free sale on any used items all weekend long. Then there's this:

Three used PlayStation 3 consoles for $160. Three Nintendo 3DS handhelds for $$160. Forget the 360, that looks like the 4GB version (the 320 GB used is only $119.99 anyway). But the rest? Everybody gets a 3DS or PS3!
I probably won't make it out to GameStop on Black Friday. Nothing in the ad really calls out to me. I do need a new PlayStation 4, but I'm going to hold out for something pretty.

The first basic thesis of node.js is that I/O is expensive:
﻿
So the largest waste with current programming technologies comes from waiting for I/O to complete. There are several ways in which one can deal with the performance impact (from Sam Rushing):
synchronous : you handle one request at a time, each in turn. pros: simple cons: any one request can hold up all the other requests
: you handle one request at a time, each in turn. pros: simple cons: any one request can hold up all the other requests fork a new process : you start a new process to handle each request. pros: easy cons: does not scale well, hundreds of connections means hundreds of processes. fork() is the Unix programmer's hammer. Because it's available, every problem looks like a nail. It's usually overkill
: you start a new process to handle each request. pros: easy cons: does not scale well, hundreds of connections means hundreds of processes. fork() is the Unix programmer's hammer. Because it's available, every problem looks like a nail. It's usually overkill threads: start a new thread to handle each request. pros: easy, and kinder to the kernel than using fork, since threads usually have much less overhead cons: your machine may not have threads, and threaded programming can get very complicated fast, with worries about controlling access to shared resources.
The second basis thesis is that thread-per-connection is memory-expensive: [e.g. that graph everyone showns about Apache sucking up memory compared to Nginx]
Apache is multithreaded: it spawns a thread per request (or process, it depends on the conf). You can see how that overhead eats up memory as the number of concurrent connections increases and more threads are needed to serve multiple simulataneous clients. Nginx and Node.js are not multithreaded, because threads and processes carry a heavy memory cost. They are single-threaded, but event-based. This eliminates the overhead created by thousands of threads/processes by handling many connections in a single thread.
Node.js keeps a single thread for your code...
js while(new Date().getTime() < now + 1000) { // do nothing }
...however, everything runs in parallel except your code
It really is a single thread running: you can't do any parallel code execution; doing a "sleep" for example will block the server for one second:So while that code is running, node.js will not respond to any other requests from clients, since it only has one thread for executing your code. Or if you would have some CPU -intensive code, say, for resizing images, that would still block all other requests.
There is no way of making code run in parallel within a single request. However, all I/O is evented and asynchronous, so the following won't block the server: [codesyntax lang="javascript"]
c.query( 'SELECT SLEEP(20);' , function (err, results, fields) res . writeHead (200, { 'Content-Type' : 'text/html' }) ; res. end ( '<html><head><title>Hello</title></head><body><h1>Return from async DB query</h1></body></html>' ); c. end (); } );
If you do that in one request, other requests can be processed just fine while the database is running it's sleep.
Why is this good? When do we go from sync to async/parallel execution?
Having synchronous execution is good, because it simplifies writing code (compared to threads, where concurrency issues have a tendency to result in WTFs).
In node.js, you aren't supposed to worry about what happens in the backend: just use callbacks when you are doing I/O; and you are guaranteed that your code is never interrupted and that doing I/O will not block other requests without having to incur the costs of thread/process per request (e.g. memory overhead in Apache).
Having asynchronous I/O is good, because I/O is more expensive than most code and we should be doing something better than just waiting for I/O.
An event loop is "an entity that handles and processes external events and converts them into callback invocations". So I/O calls are the points at which Node.js can switch from one request to another. At an I/O call, your code saves the callback and returns control to the node.js runtime environment. The callback will be called later when the data actually is available.
Of course, on the backend, there are threads and processes for DB access and process execution. However, these are not explicitly exposed to your code, so you can't worry about them other than by knowing that I/O interactions e.g. with the database, or with other processes will be asynchronous from the perspective of each request since the results from those threads are returned via the event loop to your code. Compared to the Apache model, there are a lot less threads and thread overhead, since threads aren't needed for each connection; just when you absolutely positively must have something else running in parallel and even then the management is handled by Node.js.
Other than I/O calls, Node.js expects that all requests return quickly; e.g. CPU-intensive work should be split off to another process with which you can interact as with events, or by using an abstraction like WebWorkers. This (obviously) means that you can't parallelize your code without another thread in the background with which you interact via events. Basically, all objects which emit events (e.g. are instances of EventEmitter) support asynchronous evented interaction and you can interact with blocking code in this manner e.g. using files, sockets or child processes all of which are EventEmitters in Node.js. Multicore can be done using this approach; see also: node-http-proxy.
Internal implementation
Internally, node.js relies on libev to provide the event loop, which is supplemented by libeio which uses pooled threads to provide asynchronous I/O. To learn even more, have a look at the libev documentation.
So how do we do async in Node.js?
Tim Caswell describes the patterns in his excellent presentation
Doskozil and Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka outlined several new measures on Wednesday meant to tighten border controls in an effort to further slow the stream of migrants into Austria.
The defense minister, pictured above, told the online version of daily newspaper "Kurier" that security needed to be tightened along specific parts of the border. "I'm recognizing a trend here that the smugglers are now using Slovakia," Doskozil said.
He said 299 migrants have been intercepted so far this year while trying to cross into Austria from Slovakia. That's in comparison with the 174 who were caught attempting to cross the border with Hungary.
Doskozil added that 282 asylum seekers who were caught this year trying to cross into Tyrol state were sent back to Italy. "There were only 25 asylum claims in Tyrol. Here the sending-back [of migrants] to Italy is working," he said.
Some 42,000 people applied for asylum in Austria in 2016
New train regulations
Doskozil and Sobotka also said that many of the migrants are entering Austria by train, and called for stricter controls on rail routes along the border. They told "Kurier" that 100 soldiers could be deployed to help with this process.
The pair is planning to present the package of new measures in 10 days.
Austria will hold a meeting on February 8 for interior and defense ministers from across Central Europe. Among the topics the ministers will discuss are border controls along the "Balkan Route," which Austria was instrumental in blocking off in order to prevent migrants from crossing into the EU.
The Austrian government received some 90,000 asylum applications in 2015, leading some officials to call for stricter border measures.
Update 2: Amazon is reportedly working on a new Brand Central program to help protect brands from knock-offs. CNET says that few details are yet available, but one of those involved in a pilot scheme said that Amazon's approach to dealing with counterfeit products has undergone ‘a sea change.'
Update 1: Amazon commented:
There's no shortage of third-party chargers and cables sold for Apple equipment, some of them claiming to be the genuine article, but Apple has found that even Amazon has been selling counterfeit products labelled as the real thing. The products concerned were sold by Amazon directly, and not by a third-party Marketplace seller.
The items have now been removed from sale, and Apple is suing the company that made them …
NordVPN
Patently Apple reports that Apple has filed a trademark infringement case against Mobile Star LLC, which Amazon named as the primary supplier of the counterfeit products. Apple said that Mobile Star was not only illegally using its trademark, but that the fake chargers had not passed safety tests and posed a risk to consumers.
Apple recently purchased a number of Apple power adapters and charging and syncing cables (collectively “power products”) that were directly sold by Amazon.com – not a third party seller – and determined that they were counterfeit. Amazon.com informed Apple that Mobile Star was its source for the majority of these counterfeit Apple products […] Counterfeit power products, such as those supplied by Mobile Star, pose an immediate threat to consumer safety because, unlike genuine Apple products, they are not subjected to industry-standard consumer safety testing and are poorly constructed with inferior or missing components, flawed design, and inadequate electrical insulation. These counterfeits have the potential to overheat, catch fire, and deliver a deadly electric shock to consumers while in normal use.
The situation, says Apple, is even worse where third-party sellers are concerned. While the ‘Fulfillment by Amazon' tag gives buyers confidence that purchased products will be delivered, it gives no assurance that the items are genuine. Indeed, the lawsuit alleges, the vast majority of them are not.
Over the last nine months, Apple, as part of its ongoing brand protection efforts, has purchased well over 100 iPhone devices, Apple power products, and Lightning cables sold as genuine by sellers on Amazon.com and delivered through Amazon's “Fulfillment by Amazon” program. Apple's internal examination and testing for these products revealed almost 90% of these products are counterfeit.
Apple argues that its own reputation is damaged when consumers buy what they believe to be genuine products which then fail to perform as they should, or which prove to be dangerous. The company is seeking an injunction against Mobile Star selling fake products, destruction of all counterfeit items and damages of $2M per product type.
Amazon responded, stating that the company ‘has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits on our site. We work closely with manufacturers and brands, and pursue wrongdoers aggressively.'
Given the number of fake Apple products available, we always urge caution where the price is significantly lower than the official price. This is especially true in the case of MagSafe power supplies, where any price lower than available from authorized resellers is an immediate warning flag.

Today I received an email from the lawyers of author Susan Jeffers, PhD., notifying me that I'd infringed on her trademark by inadvertently using the phrase “feel the fear and do it anyway” in my post last week, A Guide to Beating the Fears That Hold You Back.
The phrase, apparently, is the title of one of her books … a book I'd never heard of. I wasn't referring to her book. I'm not using the phrase as a title of a book or product or to sell anything. I was just referring to something a friend said on Twitter.
Her lawyers asked me to insert the (R) symbol after the phrase, in my post, and add this sentence: “This is the registered trademark of Susan Jeffers, Ph.D. and is used with her permission.”
Yeah. I'm not gonna do that.
I find it unbelievable that a common phrase (that was used way before it was the title of any book) can be trademarked. We're not talking about the names of products … we're talking about the English language. You know, the words many of us use for such things as … talking, and writing, and general communication? Perhaps I'm a little behind the times, but is it really possible to claim whole chunks of the language, and force people to get permission to use the language, just in everyday speech?
What if this were taken to an extreme? What if some billionaire (say, Bill Gates) decided to start trademarking thousands and thousands of phrases, so that he could charge us for each use, or so that we'd have to link back to the Microsoft homepage with each reference? The language, in this scenario, could be entirely privatized if we allow this sort of thing.
So, while this post is probably ill-advised (and yes, I realize that I'm actually giving publicity to Ms. Jeffers), I have to object. I think we have a duty, as writers and bloggers and speakers of the English language, to defend our rights to … words. Free speech is a bit of an important concept, I think.
As an aside, I think the idea of jealously protecting copyright and trademarks, in this digital age, is outdated and ignorant. You want your ideas to spread, and you should encourage people to spread your ideas, not put up all kinds of boundaries and restrictions and obstacles to that being done. This blog, for example, is Uncopyrighted, and will always be free, because I want people to spread my posts and ideas. I think it's actually good for me as a writer, and it's (not insignificantly) better for the writing community in general if we can share each other's work freely. I'm hoping that with posts like this, and the good work of thousands of other like-minded people, the old mindset of fencing off ideas and language will slowly change.
So, no, I will not be adding a Registered Trademark symbol to the previous post. And no, I won't be adding a phrase of legalese to the post. And no, I won't even attribute the phrase or link to her book, as I wasn't referring to the book. And no, I won't remove the phrase.
I'd rather be sued.
Oh, and I'm not going to change the title of this post either. You'll have to remove it from my cold, dead iMac.
A few things are clear after the congressional testimony of James Comey, the F.B.I. director, this week:
First, Donald Trump owes Barack Obama and the American people an apology for his vituperative lie that Obama committed a felony by wiretapping Trump Tower. It was specious, libelous and reckless, regardless of the weak revelations of “incidental collection” that the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and Trump transition team member Devin Nunes outrageously made public, briefing the president without first briefing his fellow committee members. Nunes's announcement was a bombshell with no bomb, just enough mud in the water to obscure the blood in the water for those too willfully blind to discern the difference.
Second, Donald Trump will never apologize. Trump's strategy for dealing with being caught in a lie is often to tell a bigger lie. He seems constitutionally incapable of registering what others would: shame, embarrassment, contrition. Something is broken in the man — definitely morally and possibly psychologically.
Third, and to me this is the biggest, Comey confirmed that the investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to the Russians who tampered with our election is not “fake news” manufactured by Democrats stewing over a bitter loss but a legitimate investigation that has been underway for months and has no end in sight.
Individuals who were associated with the president of the United States' winning campaign are under criminal investigation. That is an extraordinary sentence and one that no American can allow to be swallowed up by other news or dismissed by ideologues.
The US Air Force has updated the old World War II slogan, 'Loose lips sink ships,' for the social media age.
It has created a new poster proclaiming 'loose tweets destroy fleets' and warned soldiers not to leak information about their missions online.
Military commanders are concerned about social media-savvy groups such as ISIS gleaning details about US service members and even upcoming missions.
The US Air Force has updated the old World War II slogan, 'Loose lips sink ships,' for the social media age, proclaiming 'loose tweets destroy fleets' in a campaign to stop airmen revealing too much online.
'Keeping quiet about operational information is vital to ensure military members stay safe on a daily basis,' commanders said in the update.
'Social media can be a useful tool to stay connected to friends, family, and quick entertainment.
'However, there is sometimes a fine line between letting your friends see what you're up to and providing an adversary critical information about your connection to the military and its mission.'
In March, a group purportedly connected to ISIS posted an online 'hit list' of soldiers it said were helping with a US airstrike campaign against ISIS in Syria and Iraq.
The list included the names and home addresses of 100 service members, as well as photos of those members.
Defense officials said at the time that the information hadn't been posted as the result of a hack or data breach; rather, it had been compiled from publicly available information the service members had posted on social media networks.
'As social media keeps evolving and there's more and more avenues to let your friends and family know what you are up to, those same avenues can be used by ISIS sympathizers, 'lone wolves,' to track down and hurt our military members outside the safety of the base,' said Capt. Jonathan McDonald, AFCENT Force Protection chief.
'So not only is it important to not post vital mission related information, but it's also important to not post detailed personal information to keep yourself and your loved ones safe.
'It's vital to check your security settings in your social media accounts to make sure that just your friends are able to see what you post and remember to be smart about what you post and share,' McDonald added.
Operations Security is the process of keeping sensitive information away from the enemy.
Information is identified and controlled by various security measures to minimize violations.
'Without OPSEC, our adversaries would be able to freely and easily gather information of our activities and operations; putting missions, resources and members at risk, said Master Sgt. Aaron Miller, AFCENT Information security program manager.
LOOSE LIPS SINK SHIPS The most famous poster (right) that helped popularize the phrase was created for the Seagram Distillers Corporation by the designer Seymour R. Goff (also known by the pseudonym 'Ess-ar-gee' or Essargee). This type of poster was part of a general campaign of American propaganda during World War II to advise servicemen and other citizens to avoid careless talk concerning secure information that might be of use to the enemy. The British equivalent used variations on the phrase 'Keep mum.' In neutral Sweden the State Information Board promoted the wordplay 'en svensk tiger' (the Swedish word 'tiger' means both 'tiger' and 'keeping silent'). Germany used 'Schäm Dich, Schwätzer!' (which translates as 'Shame on you, blabbermouth!'). US Soldiers were also issued with guidelines proclaiming: 'If violation of protective measures is serious within written communications it is disastrous in conversations. 'Protect your conversation as you do your letters, and be even more careful. A harmful letter can be nullified by censorship; loose talk is direct delivery to the enemy. 'If you come home during war your lips must remain sealed and your written hand must be guided by self-imposed censorship. 'This takes guts. Have you got them or do you want your buddies and your country to pay the price for your showing off. You've faced the battle front; It's little enough to ask you to face this 'home front.''
'Ultimately this could impact a campaign or mission and be detrimental to national strategic and foreign policies.'
With OPSEC violation consequences so high, it's important to ensure OPSEC procedures are followed through.
'The best way to keep OPSEC is to look over the Critical Information List and be sure to protect the information on that list and destroy it accordingly,' said Senior Airman Anthony Bolton, 609th Air Operations Center OPSEC manager.

Floyd Mayweather Jr. added another layer to his feud with Conor McGregor on Thursday, saying that he and former McGregor sparring partner Paulie Malignaggi conspired so Malignaggi could spy on McGregor.
In an interview with FightHype.com (h/t TMZ Sports), Mayweather said Malignaggi has been on his side the entire time: "Paulie has always been my friend. ... My friend called me and said, 'Floyd, do you want me to go to [Conor's] camp?' I said, 'Abso-f--kin'-lutely.' ... Paulie, thank you for going over there like I asked you to do."
Malignaggi was alongside Mayweather during the interview and kept saying, "suckas," seemingly in reference to McGregor and his camp (Warning: Some language NSFW):
Mayweather also said he and Malignaggi were going to have a powwow about what Malignaggi saw during his time in the McGregor camp: "Me and Paulie gonna stay at the house and talk about strategy, we gonna talk about everything."
Malignaggi announced on Aug. 4 that he was stepping down as McGregor's sparring partner on the heels of some controversy, per ESPN.com's Brett Okamoto:
"I wanted to be part of this event, but I didn't want to become the story, and that's what this has turned into. I won't release any information about his game plan or what he's working on; I wouldn't do that. But this has become a fiasco. It's a circus. And I do want that sparring video released. The UFC's PI definitely has that video. I understand it can't come out now, but Conor, if you have any balls, release what really happened."
Malignaggi was unhappy McGregor's photographer released photos that made him look bad. Malignaggi said he was pushed down at one point during a sparring session, and it was portrayed as if he had been knocked down.
Instead, Malignaggi said he was the one who took the fight to McGregor.
The 36-year-old Malignaggi is a retired boxer turned commentator who posted a professional record of 36-8.
Mayweather is a perfect 49-0, and he will put that mark on the line Saturday night at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas when he faces McGregor in what will be the Irishman's first professional boxing match.
Hayden-Johnson's lies led to her son being fed through a stomach tube
Woman behind the 'sick' fantasy A mother has been jailed for subjecting her son to "enduring" cruelty by pretending he was severely ill, to gain publicity and financial rewards. The actions of Lisa Hayden-Johnson, 35, from Devon, led to him being operated on, Exeter Crown Court heard. She also presented him in a wheelchair to the Duchess of Cornwall, appeared on television and spent charity donations. She was jailed for three years and three months after admitting cruelty and perverting the course of justice. 'Sadistic fabrication' The court heard that Hayden-Johnson subjected her son, who is now eight and lives in another part of the country, to a total of 325 medical actions - including being confined to a wheelchair and being fed through a tube in his stomach. She claimed her son suffered from a long list of illnesses including diabetes, food allergies, cerebral palsy and cystic fibrosis. Andrew Macfarlane, prosecuting, told the court that Hayden-Johnson's "sadistic fabrication of non-existent symptoms" amounted to "24-hour-a-day torture". It's often said that the question is whether the defendant is sad, mad or bad - perhaps the reality in a case of this kind is that it's a little bit of all of it
Sarah Munro, defending He said that the boy's medical treatment meant that the child was socially stigmatised. As a result of Hayden-Johnson's actions, the child underwent a series of "physical intrusions and interventions" which included blood tests and intravenous treatments. Mr Macfarlane said that defendant, who comes from Torbay, achieved national attention as a result of her actions. The court heard that she frequently described her son "as the most ill child in Britain" and that she amassed cash donations and charity gifts, including two cruises. Mr Macfarlane added that boy had been "convinced that he was chronically and seriously ill" and said that the long-term effects of what happened to him remain unclear. 'Disordered and pitiful' The court was also told that in a bid to avoid a diabetes test arranged for her son in 2007, Hayden-Johnson falsely claimed that she had been sexually assaulted, which later led to her being charged with perverting the course of justice. Sarah Munro, defending, told the court that her client suffered from a factitious disorder and a factitious disorder by proxy. The conditions used to be known as Munchausen syndrome and Munchausen syndrome by proxy. The former can cause sufferers to feign illness to draw attention to themselves and the latter leads to the abuse of another person, again to win sympathy or attention. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. "It's often said that the question is whether the defendant is sad, mad or bad," she told the court. "Perhaps the reality in a case of this kind is that it's a little bit of all of it." Passing sentence, Judge Stephen Wildblood said five adjectives could sum up Hayden-Johnson - "cruel, manipulative, perverse, disordered and pitiful". He said: "Your son will have to realise the fact that the one person who is supposed to care for and nourish him throughout his childhood was in fact causing him harm. "Your experience in custody will be that people who behave with cruelty to children are received in prison as they are in society - with utter rejection. "Your name and face are well-known throughout the country. You will never be in a position to deceive people in this way again. "Anyone else thinking of behaving this way should think about your much publicised downfall." He also handed her a disqualification order banning her from working with children.

Nearly a year ago, Google announced its open source WebM project for online video, including the VP8 video codec.
Google is now taking steps to secure WebM from patent attacks, in a bid to help encourage adoption.
"Today we're announcing the formation of the WebM Community Cross-License (CCL) initiative with 17 founding members," Matt Frost is Senior Business Product Manager for the WebM Project wrote in a blog post on Monday. "Organizations that join the CCL agree to license patents they may have that are essential to WebM technologies to other members of the CCL."
Frost noted that Google already makes the key components of WebM openly available on royalty-free terms. With the CCL, Google is looking to enable interested organization to contribute through the licensing initiative.
"Organizations that join the CCL agree to license patents they may have that are essential to WebM technologies to other members of the CCL," Frost said.
Among the big names that are support WebM and CCL are AMD, Cisco, LG Electronics, Mozilla, Samsung Electronics and Texas Instruments.
The WebM format itself is now supported in multiple web browsers including Firefox 4, Chrome and Opera. Google has made a WebM video player plugin for Microsoft's Internet Explorer 9 browser as well.
WebM is a competitive alternative to the H.264 codec which is licensed by the MPEG LA.

MaryAnn Nelson of Mankato kissed her daughter Rachel's hand at a House of Representatives committee meeting to review a bill for medical marijuana March 4, 2014. Rachel suffers from Rett Syndrome. "I don't want to have to move to Colorado," she said.
Gov. Mark Dayton came under fire Wednesday from an unexpected source: parents of children with disabilities who want access to medical marijuana.
They accused Dayton of standing in the way of legislation to legalize medical marijuana and of bowing to law enforcement opposition. Dayton claimed the advocates misunderstood his recent comments, and said that he still wants to find a compromise this session.
The trouble began for Dayton this week when he was asked about medical marijuana during an interview on WCCO Radio. He said the prospects for a medical marijuana bill this session were slim to none because some advocates, including the bill authors, weren't interested in his recent proposal for a $2 million Mayo Clinic study. Dayton said the study would look at a marijuana extract to see if it could relieve the symptoms of epilepsy in small children.
• Related: Dayton: Prospects dim for medical marijuana this year
"I'm mystified that people who want more than that in the legislation could be opposed to something that could help hundreds of kids that are suffering from epilepsy," he said.
Some of the parents of children suffering from epilepsy, including Maria Botker of Clinton, Minn., did not like what they heard, believing that Dayton was blaming them for the bill's poor chances.
"I would do absolutely anything to help my daughter, and so would every single one of these parents here," Botker said. "For the governor to suggest otherwise is absolutely ridiculous."
Botker and other parents criticized the governor during a state Capitol news conference, organized by the advocacy group Minnesotans for Compassionate Care. Botker said her daughter Greta has been living in Colorado since November to have legal access to marijuana, and the treatment has dramatically reduced her seizures.
She said she supports research, but needs access now. "Gov. Dayton, you just received some of the best health care that this state has to offer," Botker said, referring to Dayton's recent hip surgery. "I want you to allow my daughter to have that same privilege. Please, please just help us now, please."
Advocates claim Dayton's proposal for a study is flawed because researchers would have trouble getting marijuana to test.
Angie Weaver of Hibbing, Minn., said her daughter Amelia needs medical marijuana to ease her pain and cannot wait any longer. Weaver said Dayton dashed her hopes for a comprehensive medical marijuana law in Minnesota.
"Please Gov. Dayton, do not force my family to leave the state where my family, church and community is. Please give my daughter access to life saving medicine now. No parent should have to watch their child suffer the way that we've watched Amelia suffer," Weaver said.
Dayton responded to the parents' concerns ahead of their news conference.
In a statement, he said he has the deepest sympathy for children and adults, who are afflicted with serious diseases, and for their parents who must suffer with them.
He said his earlier comment was "in no way intended to refer to victims," or their parents.
Dayton also tried to breathe new life into legislation by urging advocates and legislators to keep talking in search of compromise.
Many of the same parents met with Dayton earlier this month in a private discussion. During the news conference, one participant accused Dayton of making a surprising recommendation during that meeting. Jessica Hauser of Woodbury said the governor suggested that she buy marijuana for her son on the street, or in another state.
"That's absurd, and to have the top official in Minnesota suggest that to my face when I'm looking for compassion and a thoughtful solution, it's just completely offensive."
Soon after, Dayton responded in a second statement: "I cannot, and I do not, advocate breaking the law," he said. "But as a father, I understand parents who would do anything possible to help their children."
Dayton went on to say that his proposed compromise would provide advocates' children with medication and relief as quickly as possible. He said something can be accomplished this session, if advocates agree.

So much for concerns that the second Prime Day event wouldn't live up to Amazon's expectations.
The online retailer said Wednesday that the self-created sales holiday was its biggest day ever, with worldwide orders rising more than 60 percent compared with the previous Prime Day. In the U.S., orders rose by more than 50 percent.
Amazon shares rose slightly, near $752, in early trading Wednesday.

The retailer's shares ended the prior day slightly lower following concerns over a midday sales update from ChannelAdvisor. The e-commerce software company, which helps power the online operations of roughly 3,000 retailers, said Prime Day sales for its customers selling on Amazon were flat with the prior year's event.
But Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster cautioned investors about overreacting to that data point, as ChannelAdvisor's numbers represent just a sample of Amazon's sellers, he said. He added that the figures only capture same-store sales trends; and given that the number of vendors participating in Prime Day was more than double the prior year, they did not capture the complete picture.

Meanwhile, Amazon spread out its deals further into the day, including more than 8,000 of its limited-time "Lightning Deals" launching well into the evening. The retailer said Prime members saved more than double the amount they did last Prime Day — and is already working to amp them up for next year's event.
"After yesterday's results, we'll definitely be doing this again," Greg Greeley, vice president of Amazon Prime, said in a press release announcing the results.
More than 18 months after federal investigation violated internal rules, activists say they were still watchlisted at the airport, visited at home by a terrorism task force and detained for hours because they ‘seemed like protesters'
An activist was placed on a US government watchlist for domestic flights after being swept up in an FBI investigation into protests of the Keystone XL pipeline, linking a breach of intelligence protocol with accounts of continued tracking that environmentalists fear could follow them for life.
Revealed: FBI violated its own rules while spying on Keystone XL opponents Read more
Twenty-five-year-old Bradley Stroot is one of several campaigners to go public, after the Guardian revealed an FBI investigation that labeled them “environmental extremists”, with new allegations of a continued crackdown. From an hours-long detention at the US border to a home visit by a terrorism task force and an encounter with police searching for bombs, the activists say law enforcement has tracked them from a peaceful Texas protest of the highly contentious oil project in 2012 and 2013 to the tony suburbs of Indianapolis as recently as the end of last year.
Stroot told the Guardian that when he flew back to Texas to visit a friend last December, he learned that he was on a watchlist – known as a “Secondary Security Screening Selection” – and was subjected to more invasive airport security measures.
The FBI's investigation into anti-Keystone activists was closed in June 2014 due to a lack of credible intelligence regarding threats to the pipeline and extremist activity.
According to internal agency documents obtained by the Guardian and Earth Island Journal, it was discovered in August 2013 that the FBI's investigation had been opened without proper approval from the chief legal counsel of the agency's Houston division and a senior agent, resulting in a report of “substantial non-compliance” with rules set out by the US Justice Department.
But before the internal violations were discovered, information on Stroot and several other activists was included in FBI files. Now, interviews with Stroot, who was held up at Chicago's O'Hare airport six months after the investigation was closed, and other protesters indicate that they are still being monitored by law enforcement.
Stroot and two other people involved in the protests were described in the files as having separate, larger “Subject” files in the FBI's Guardian Threat Tracking System, a repository for suspicious activity reports and counterterrorism threat assessments that can be searched by all FBI employees.

Hugh Handeyside, an attorney with the ACLU in New York, said the government's suspicious activity reporting program is often tied to placement on a watchlist.
“Both label people as suspicious according to low standards that inevitably include innocent conduct,” he said. “And this case shows that the two may be linked.”
According to a long-withheld US watchlist guidance document published last year by the Intercept, people who do not meet the criteria for inclusion on the no-fly list but who are associated with “terrorist activity” may be placed on a selectee list like the one Bradley Stroot found himself on. Some 16,000 people – 1,200 of them US citizens – have been identified as so-called “selectees” who must undergo heightened screenings at border crossings or airports.
From photos at the pipeline to a pat-down at the airport
Bradley Stroot was one of three people detained by Houston police for taking photographs of an endpoint for the proposed Keystone XL pipeline. Four days later, a terrorism unit of the FBI reviewed the incident. Information on Stroot and other ‘suspicious individuals' was kept in the agency's ‘Guardian' repository for tracking suspicious activity and terrorism-involved activities.
On 13 December 2014, Stroot said, he prepared to board a flight from Chicago to Dallas to see an old friend – his first air travel since his 10-month involvement in a campaign in the Houston area against the proposed Keystone project.
While in Texas the first time, he had been arrested once for trespassing after taking part in a widely publicized occupation of part of the pipeline route that included a “tree village”.
And on 15 November 2012, Stroot and two other activists were stopped by the Houston police department while taking photos of the Valero refinery, one of the endpoints for tar sands oil. Although they were not charged with any crime, details of the incident ended up in an FBI file – part of more than 80 pages of internal FBI documents obtained through Freedom of Information Act request – that described the activists as “suspicious individuals”. Four days later, the police officers met with members of the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force to discuss the incident.
The encounter with the Houston police left Stroot somewhat shaken but determined to continue protesting. He says he had flown once to Europe – before the Keystone campaign began in Texas in 2012 – and had no issues.
But when he printed his American Airlines plane ticket in December, he noticed four S's in large black letters in the top left corner. So-called “Secondary Security Screening Selection” helps Transportation Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security officers single out travelers, with no explanation, for heightened screening at airports.

When Stroot arrived at Chicago O'Hare, he said, he was subjected to heightened security screening – removed from the main passenger line and taken to a separate holding area where another airline security official was waiting. His bags, Stroot alleged, were carefully searched and he was subjected to a more invasive pat-down. He said the same thing happened on his return flight to Chicago.
“They pull you out of line, swab down all of your shit with tongue depressor-like things, and check for bomb-making materials,” Stroot said.

But there were signs that Stroot had become a subject of interest to law enforcement even before he learned he was on a watchlist.
One night in spring 2013, just a few months after he had returned home to Indiana from Texas, Stroot said he was helping out at a makeshift homeless shelter in Bloomington, sleeping in a friend's truck, when a police officer knocked on the window and asked for identification.
When the officer returned from running his ID, Stroot claims that he was aggressively questioned and that the officer asked if he could look in the truck, which had an open cab. “You could see there was nothing in it,” Stroot said.
After what he recalls as minutes more of questioning, Stroot said the officer finally asked if he had “any bomb-making materials”.
From video in the trees to detention at the border – and at home

Stroot is not the only anti-Keystone XL activist who has been targeted since the Texas protest campaign and parallel FBI investigation.
Elizabeth Arce, a 27-year-old independent journalist, traveled to Texas with a friend in October 2012 to help document the tree sit-in that ended in Stroot's arrest. After spending a week in the trees live-streaming video of the protest, she said, they ran out of batteries and descended, hoping that as journalists they might avoid arrest from the police waiting underfoot.
I think the storyline of TransCanada and authorities communicating further than we think is plausible Elizabeth Arce
Arce and her friend, Lorenzo Serna, were arrested for trespassing but all the charges were dropped.
In April 2013, Arce was on her way to Canada for an Earth Day event hosted by an indigenous group in Ontario. At the border crossing in Minnesota, Arce said, Canadian border agents asked her about the arrest in Texas, searched her car and eventually let her pass.
But this past August, Arce said she, Serna and another friend were driving to Canada to document the aftermath of the Mount Polley mine disaster in British Columbia and were denied entry.
At the crossing in Sweetgrass, Montana, Arce said agents at the border asked her detailed questions about her arrest in Texas. They searched the car for “hours”, she said, going through every piece of luggage and scrap of paper, even referring to her trombone as a “noisemaker”. After being detained for five hours, she said she and her friends were told that they could not cross into Canada because, she remembered an agent telling her, they “seemed like protesters”.
In the FBI files, the agency's Houston office said it would share “any pertinent intelligence regarding any threats” with TransCanada, the Canadian oil giant that has been lobbying for years to oversee the transport of tar sands oil from Canada to the Texas Gulf coast. The project is still awaiting approval from the Obama administration.
“I think the storyline of TransCanada and authorities communicating further than we think is plausible,” Arce said.
(In a statement, TransCanada said the company does not “direct law enforcement” but that “law enforcement officials have asked us on a number of occasions about our experience along the Gulf Coast Pipeline so they can determine what they may expect when Keystone XL construction begins”.)
Andrew Neef, a 31-year-old data archivist from Minnesota, also spent time in Texas in 2012 and 2013. He was part of a mass action on 7 January 2013, at the Houston offices of TransCanada, and was arrested for trespassing along with another activist, Alec Johnson. Because he did not have a permanent address at the time and was not living in Texas, Neef entered his parents' address on the police report. Neef and Johnson are both referred to in the FBI files obtained by the Guardian, which detail that the FBI had advance knowledge of the TransCanada sit-in and debriefed an informant on the event after it happened.
An internal FBI document detailing the January 2013 arrest of Andrew Neef and Alec Johnson labeled them as ‘Threats to Keystone XL Pipeline Projects'. Neef said the peaceful protest haunted him, with authorities later showing up at his parents' front door.
About a month after the Houston arrest, Neef said his parents were visited by members of the Indiana division of the FBI's joint terrorism task force at their home in Carmel, an upscale Indianapolis suburb.
According to Neef, who also works as an independent-media journalist, the agents asked his parents several questions about the people he knew, whom he was working with, and where his funding came from. They also wanted to know, Neef said, if he was involved in anti-fracking campaigns.
“They wanted me to contact them,” Neef said, “and probably become some kind of snitch.”
(The FBI's Houston field office did not respond to a detailed list of questions for this article.)
More than a year later, the FBI investigation into anti-Keystone pipeline campaigners in Texas was formally closed due to a “lack of reporting and/or extremist activity”. But the FBI retains data on individuals even if the purported threat turns out to be non-existent.
For young activists like Bradley Stroot, the stigma of being on a government watchlist can last for years. Stroot said he was resigned to the “new reality” that he may be on the list for “the rest of my life or a very long period”.
Once an individual has been placed on the selective screening watchlist, there is very little he or she can do to get removed from it, said Handeyside of the ACLU, or even find out why he or she was put on it in the first place.
“There's no due process for these people,” he said.

Despite what you heard, the Amish aren't against technology. Communities adopt new gadgets such as fax machines and business-use cell phones all the time—so long as the local church approves each one ahead of time, determining that it won't drastically change their way of life.
So it is with the Amish horse-drawn buggy. You might have thought the technology inside this 1800s method of transportation stopped progressing right around then. Instead, buggy tech keeps advancing, and buggy makers have become electricians and metalworkers to build in all the new tech you can't see under the traditional black paint.
Even if you skip luxury options such as a propane-powered heater, cupholders, and speedometer, a buggy is an expensive thing.
One builder in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, was rather busy when we spoke. In a half-hour, four people called in to discuss orders. Amish people often shy away from using their names and businesses in publication, but one of the shop's builders was happy to talk about all the new system being developed for this old technology.
Brakes
Buggy brakes are automotive-style, non-powered drum or disc brakes mounted to two wheels. When a driver wants to stop, he or she halts the horse using the reins and halts the buggy by stepping on the brake pedal so that it doesn't run into the horse. Our builder estimates 90 percent of buggy buyers stick with drums, in part because of the old-fashioned aesthetics—braking systems on buggies are very visible—and partly because all drum components can be made in Amish communities.

"Back in the '60s, a local Amish man started going through junkyards and getting the old seven-inch VW brakes," our builder says, "salvaging them, repairing them, and cleaning them up, and retrofitting them to buggies. After a while he started getting good castings made. Now all the buggy brakes are manufactured by buggy shops."
Builders cast the drums in steel and the backer plates and shoes in aluminum-tin alloy. "We'll buy the castings, and we'll machine, we'll drill the holes, we'll process them, and install the components," he says. "We actually bond our own shoes. We buy brake lining from a brake company in Ohio."
The few disc brakes used on buggies are off-the-shelf parts bought from outside Amish communities and usually were manufactured for dune buggies. For both drums and discs, the brake master cylinder, which moves the hydraulic fluid that actuates the brakes, is mounted underneath the body near an Amish-made pedal assembly whose foot pedal pokes up through the floor into the interior. The master cylinders are made of anodized aluminum at an Amish shop, also in Ohio.
Electrical

States with large Amish populations, such as Ohio and Pennsylvania, have laws that require buggies to light up when sharing public roads with automotive traffic. Which means these old-fashioned vehicles have electrical components.
"Ninety-nine percent of buggies are built with a dash—a console on the front panel—and in that switch box is all the switches you need," says our builder. "We have headlights, taillights, interior lights, and a turn signal switch."
Shops buy LED components and assemble systems based on a customized turn signal developed by Lancaster County's Amish builders 50 years ago. It's a pedestal lamp with an amber headlight on the front and a red taillight on the back, one lamp for each side of the buggy. Bulbs stay on low-beam during normal use, but flicking a turn signal toggle switch activates a brake-light-style system that turns on the high-beams. There's your Amish turn signal: A buggy whose left-side headlight and taillight are brighter than their right-side counterparts is about to turn left.
"We actually looked into doing financing through the banks, but we don't have titles for buggies, so the banks are squeamish about it."
To power these lights, batteries are all over the place. "For many, many years we just simply used a standard deep-cycle marine battery because everything was incandescent, and we needed more power," says the builder. Nowadays, they use cordless tool batteries. A single 20-volt/6-amp battery, the type that powers an electric drill, runs the whole electrical system for two to three hours on a charge. Those traveling for longer carry spare batteries.
"There was actually an alternator system attempted in the last five years," he says. "It worked about 60 percent, but it never took off."
Body
The main body is fiberglass. It's pre-manufactured off-site and shipped to Amish builders across the country for finishing. They add aluminum components to areas that see a lot of wear, such as door sills. Everything else is white oak or ash wood framing stretched over with fabric, plusher linings for interior surfaces, and a tough polyester for exterior surfaces, all to save weight.
"Back in the '60s, a local Amish man started going through junkyards and getting the old seven-inch VW brakes."
"A new technology is thermally modified wood," our builder says. "Thermally modified is, basically, they cook the livin' daylights out of it. Like a kiln. Your common dried lumber, they take it down to 10 to 20 percent moisture. Thermally modified is taken down to almost zero-percent moisture. They just bake the moisture out of it, and then it's stabilized and real hard to rot."
Tires and Wheels

Amish buggies roll on either steel or solid rubber tires, but our builder says most use steel. Both are built in-house. "Your steel-tire buggy actually pulls easier than a rubber-tire one because of the compression of the rubber," he says. "Now, if you'd have pneumatic tires it'd be different, but with a solid rubber tire it has compression. Of course, the pro with rubber is that it'll be quieter."
Rubber tires also stress the turning mechanism (the fifth wheel) harder, so brakes are mounted on the rear wheels if a buggy has rubber tires. Steel-tire buggies have the brakes on the front wheels because the sliding of metal on road takes some of the stress off the fifth wheel. For the wheels mounted within the tires, they're wood, steel, aluminum, or fiberglass.
"I prefer the wooden wheel yet," the builder says. "That's my number-one choice, for several reasons. It's quieter, and it's repairable. If you bust a spoke or something, you can easily pop off a tire, replace a spoke, and pop it back together again." In the past five years, Amish buggy builders have developed an automotive-style tubular-steel torsion bar suspension that mounts the body over traditional leaf springs or, more recently, airbags.
How the Amish Buy a Buggy
Shady Lane Wagons
Like car-shopping, the first step is to choose a general model of buggy as a base to build upon. You could opt for a two-seater, four-seater, half-enclosed, completely open, and so on. Then you pile on the options from the shop's checklist. Even if you skip luxury options such as a propane-powered heater, cupholders, and speedometer, a buggy is an expensive thing.
"Average cost of a buggy is, I'm gonna say, $8,000," says our builder. Families usually have several types at once, for different uses, and each one they buy outright with cash. "We actually looked into doing financing through the banks," he says, "but we don't have titles for buggies, so the banks are squeamish about it." If somebody needs it, though, builders will finance them a buggy without the banks.
"A lot of people will get 20 or 30 years out of a buggy before they do any major rebuilding of it. There's a strong demand for good used buggies because of youth. Most people will buy their 16-year-old son a horse, a harness, and a used buggy. And then we have people who trade in their buggy every five to eight years. It's like the mainstream world. A lot of these buggies will be running 40 or 50 years, rebuilt several times."
The world of astronomy has changed. An astronomer used to have to travel to a remote location and endure long, cold nights, patiently guiding a telescope to collect precious photons of light. Now, a proliferation of online archives allows astronomers to make discoveries from the comfort of their own offices.
By mining such archives, a team of astronomers led by Ivana Damjanov of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) has found a treasure trove of "red nugget" galaxies. These galaxies are compact and densely packed with old, red stars. Their abundance provides new constraints on theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution.
"These red nugget galaxies were hiding in plain view, masquerading as stars," says Damjanov. She presented the team's research today at a meeting of the Canadian Astronomical Society (CASCA) in Quebec, QC.
When the universe was young, dense, massive galaxies nicknamed "red nuggets" were common. These galaxies are ten times more massive than the Milky Way, but their stars are packed into a volume a hundred times smaller than our Galaxy.
Mysteriously, astronomers searching the older, nearer universe could not find any of these objects. Their apparent disappearance, if real, signaled a surprising turn in galaxy evolution.
To find nearby examples, Damjanov and her colleagues Margaret Geller, Ho Seong Hwang, and Igor Chilingarian (Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory) combed through the database of the largest survey of the universe, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The red nugget galaxies are so small that they appear like stars in Sloan photographs, due to blurring from Earth's atmosphere. However, their spectra give away their true nature.
The team identified several hundred red nugget candidates in the Sloan data. Then they searched a variety of online telescope archives in order to confirm their findings. In particular, high-quality images from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope showed that about 200 of the candidates were galaxies very similar to their red-nugget cousins in the distant, young universe.
"Now we know that many of these amazingly small, dense, but massive galaxies survive. They are a fascinating test of our understanding of the way galaxies form and evolve," explains Geller.
The large number of red nuggets discovered in Sloan told the team how abundant those galaxies were in the middle-aged universe. That number then can be compared to computer models of galaxy formation. Different models for the way galaxies grow predict very different abundances.
The picture that matches the observations is one where red nuggets begin their lives as very small objects in the young universe. During the next ten billion years some of them collide and merge with other, smaller and less massive galaxies. Some red nuggets manage to avoid collisions and remain compact as they age. The result is a variety of elliptical galaxies with different sizes and masses, some very compact and some more extended.
"Many processes work together to shape the rich landscape of galaxies we see in the nearby universe," says Damjanov.
So here's how it looks. Years of unsustainable, credit-fuelled growth are brought to a halt by a crushing financial crisis which exposes deep structural flaws at the heart of the economy. Rarely has the assumption of ever-rising living standards looked so vulnerable, with younger generations forced to pay not just for the crippling legacy of debt their parents leave behind, but for the mounting costs of an ageing population and the consequences of decades-long environmental degradation. Economic decline, austerity and inter-generational recrimination seem to beckon as populations adjust to the true mediocrity of their circumstances.
I'm referring to the tired old “developed” economies of the West, right? Actually, no: it's China where these observations seem more appropriate, and perhaps other emerging market economies said to be about to eclipse the hegemony of the old world, with its lazy ways and sense of entitlement.
Western “declinism” of the sort described by Dambisa Moyo in her book How the West was Lost, and more recently by Stephen King, chief economist at HSBC, in When the Money Runs Out, is still the narrative of our times. But sometimes a sense of perspective is demanded; compared with the challenges faced by China and the rest of the developing world, the relatively minor adjustment to expectations that needs to be made in the West is a stroll in the park.
Forecasts that China will overtake the US as the world's largest economy over the coming years already look like yesterday's story as once-explosive development in the East slows to a stall amid growing fears of a Chinese credit crunch. The Asian boom is dying of exhaustion.
As ever, public perceptions trail the reality. For the first time in more than a decade, international investors and business leaders are regularly heard referring to the US as a more attractive proposition than China. Investment flows are going into reverse, and while the US banking system is reviving fast, China's is heading in the other direction after a period of credit expansion that makes our own look positively pedestrian.
Nor is it just the economics of unbridled, politically directed development that are beginning to fracture; for many Chinese the promise of industrialisation and prosperity is turning into a nightmare of ill health and curtailed life expectancy. The social deprivations of China's one-child policy meanwhile threaten a demographic time-bomb of far worse proportions than that of the supposedly bankrupt West. There is now every likelihood that China will indeed grow old before it gets rich. One shocking story from the past week vividly demonstrates the massive costs that China's centrally directed dash for growth is fermenting for the future. According to a study in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, air pollution has caused an average five-and-a-half year reduction in life expectancy for the 500 million people living north of the Huai River, where use of coal in the home and for electricity generation is most prevalent.
The latest study, pretty much undisputed by the Chinese authorities, adds to mounting evidence of industrial poisoning on a hitherto unimaginable scale. The 2010 Global Burden of Disease Study found that outdoor air pollution caused 1.2 million premature Chinese deaths in 2010, or nearly half the global total.
The fumes are so bad that a growing number of Chinese emigrate, setting in train a potentially devastating brain drain. In a recent interview in the New York Times, the mother of a child made sick by the smog refers to the difference between Britain, where she had studied as a student, and China as heaven and hell.
All industrialisation exacts a heavy human toll in its early years. The miseries of Britain's industrial revolution are well chronicled. But the speed and scope of China's attempted catch-up are in a league of their own.
There is also a world of difference between the market-determined development that drove the British and American economic miracles and the state-directed variety of China's great leap forward.
Politically sponsored advancement rarely occurs without gross misallocation of capital, and in China it seems to be happening on an epic scale. The latest example of China's capacity overhang is Rongsheng Heavy Industries, the world's largest private shipbuilder. The collapse in the market for new ships has forced Rongsheng to go cap in hand to the government for a bail-out. It's said to be an important test of China's resolve to move from the old, unsustainable, investment-led model of economic development to a more balanced form of advancement, but it is almost certainly one that China will fail. Political connections will ensure Rongsheng survives, and the resulting capacity glut will, in time-honoured fashion, simply be dumped on the rest of the world.
On a global scale, the resulting imbalances require that the deficit nations of the West keep spending to absorb the Chinese surpluses, even though they can no longer afford it. The tragedy for China is that when countries and individuals spend beyond their means, it is always the creditor, and not the debtor, that ends up paying. China's vast, accumulated surplus of foreign exchange reserves will simply be devalued to oblivion.
By relentlessly pursuing the goal of industrial supremacy, China has made itself into the world's environmental waste dump, and a hostage to back-door default by Western debtors to boot. Once admired for its dynamism, state-directed capitalism is turning out to be a monstrous anomaly. Chances are that this will be another American century, not the much-predicted Asian one.
The unprecedented decision by James Comey, the FBI's director, to insert the law enforcement agency into the midst of a presidential election has been roundly criticized by everyone from former George W. Bush attorney general Alberto Gonzalez to Fox News' Chris Wallace. But the campaign of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is so pleased by the agency's decision to announce the discovery of new emails that may be related to his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, it's now openly boasting of gaining advance notice of the move by the FBI.
Appearing on Fox News on Oct. 25, top Trump surrogate Rudy Giuliani could barely contain his excitement as he teased a blockbuster development that would shake up the presidential race in the GOP nominee's favor.

“Does Donald Trump plan anything except a series of inspiring rallies?” Brian Kilmeade, host of "Fox & Friends," asked.
“Yes,” Giuliani replied with a massive grin.
“What?” co-host Ainsely Earhardt curiously asked.
“Ha ha ha,” Giuliani laughed. “You'll see.”
The former New York City mayor promised, “We got a couple of surprises left. . . . And I think it'll be enormously effective."
He continued: "I think [Trump's] got a surprise or two that you're going to hear about in the next few days. I'm talking about some pretty big surprises. . . . And I do think that all of these revelations about Hillary Clinton finally are beginning to have an impact.”

Three days later, on Oct. 28, Comey's letter to congressional leaders about the FBI's review of the new Clinton emails was leaked by Republicans.
And now this Friday morning, Giuliani returned to "Fox & Friends," giddy over the tightening of polls in battleground states.
Echoing reports that FBI agents supportive of Trump's campaign had been enraged by Comey's decision in July to not file criminal charges against the former secretary of state for her use of a private email server, Giulani told Fox News that “outraged FBI agents” had complained to him about how the Clinton investigation had been handled and thought Comey's latest "bombshell" announcement would have come sooner.
"To tell you the truth, I thought it was going to be three or four weeks ago," he said.

Unprompted, Giuliani then attempted to distance himself from appearing to have played a role in orchestrating the last-minute October surprise.
“I did nothing to get it out; I had no role in it,” Giuliani said. “Did I hear about it? You're darn right I heard about it, and I can't even repeat the language that I heard from the former FBI agents.”

Friday afternoon, Democratic Reps. Elijah E. Cummings and John Conyers, the Ranking Members of the House Committees on Oversight and Government Reform and Judiciary, asked the Justice Department's internal watchdog to investigate leaks of information about the FBI investigation, citing Giuliani's comments.
“It is absolutely unacceptable for the FBI to leak unsubstantiated ― and in some cases false ― information about one presidential candidate to benefit the other candidate. Leaking this information to former FBI officials as a conduit to the Trump campaign is equally intolerable,” a letter to the DOJ states.“These unauthorized and inaccurate leaks from within the FBI, particularly so close to a presidential election, are unprecedented.”

Courage requires us to remain steadfast in our beliefs. It asks that we stand by the convictions we express and never give an inch, no matter what the cost. However off base, wrongheaded, or patently false a position we've staked out may be, courage nonetheless demands that we blindly pound home our stupid fucking point, never letting up.
True valor is the moment in a conversation when you realize that what you're saying is completely and utterly wrong, but you continue to say it over and over again anyway, only louder.

Suppose you're discussing current events with a group of friends, one of whom politely challenges an assertion you've made about a particular issue. In such congenial gatherings, it can be tempting to back down, especially when someone has just put forth evidence that soundly debunks everything you've been saying. The courageous path takes more discipline. It means looking that friend in the eye and—though you know full well that you are totally wrong—saying, “No, I'm right.”
The same dilemma applies when you're arguing with someone who obviously has far more information about a subject than you do. Basically, you have two choices: You can admit that you are out of your depth and that your lack of knowledge led you to the incorrect conclusion. Or you can dig in your heels, grit your teeth, and defend your misguided, uninformed opinion with every fiber of your being—even to the point of hysteria.
What is the measure of bravery? I think part of it has to do with how firmly we stand our ground when we have absolutely no fucking clue what we're talking about.

Another part involves having the mental strength to steel our minds against any reasonable argument that might challenge one of our beliefs. This means cultivating the ability to remain totally impervious to logic, so that when someone points out a blatant error in our line of thought, we can simply shrug and ignore them.
Can you make statements you know to be false in a determined and measured tone of voice? Can you then continue to reel off untruths by pulling idiotic examples out of your ass to further illustrate your faulty point, all the while giving no one else a chance to respond? Can you look basic common sense in the face and laugh?
Because that is what courage asks of us.
It can get lonely sometimes, aggressively defending your false beliefs until you've alienated everyone around you. Bravely shouting over someone's sensible comments in order to hammer home your idea—your idea that is wrong—won't win you any popularity contests.

Meanwhile, anyone can fold in the face of facts, or listen to a well-reasoned argument and say, “You know what? You're right, I never thought of it that way.” But that's the coward's way out. Listening carefully to a friend's point, synthesizing the new information, and letting it influence your own perspective—these are all gutless acts.
You want to know what does takes guts, though? Smugly making the timeout sign and repeatedly shouting “No, no, no, no, no, you're wrong!” to interrupt a person you know without a doubt is absolutely right.
Is courage scary? Sure. It can be terrifying. Do you think it's easy to stand there while someone looks at you with an expression that says, “Wow, I don't even think you believe what you're saying”? Or to suddenly realize that everything you've been saying is moronic, but to forge ahead anyway, no matter what bullshit comes flying out of your mouth?

No, that takes balls of steel. But courage has its rewards, too. Sticking to your guns means never, ever having to own up to your mistakes. And it's hard to put a price on that.

With its grand Victorian architecture, and famous network of 190 lanes, Melbourne is regarded as one of Australia's big tourist attractions. But city fathers have been selling some of the alleys to property developers - and Melburnians have an uneasy feeling that vital heritage could soon be lost.
My friends and I like to think that Melbourne is our secret.
But for three years running, Australia's second city has topped the world for liveability, last year scoring 97.5% for stability, healthcare, culture, environment, education and infrastructure.
The Economist Intelligence Unit judges left out a few essential elements of Melbourne's good life - like food and wine, beaches and forests, and vineyards an hour's drive from the city centre.
I share my hometown with Nick Cave, Germaine Greer, Cate Blanchett and Dame Edna Everage.
Melbourne is a leader in fields like biotechnology and financial services, also music, theatre, film, and festivals.

Earlier this year Melbourne hosted its 10th annual Laneway Festival, combining a love of live music with one of its greatest architectural assets - a network of lanes that ranks among Australia's top cultural attractions.

The city was laid out in 1837 on the Hoddle Grid, designed by surveyor Robert Hoddle.
At one mile north to south by half a mile east to west, with 10 latitudinal and nine longitudinal streets, the inner city was a grandiose centre of business, banking and fancy shopping. The lanes evolved to provide access for horse-drawn carriages.
Following the gold rush of the 1850s and 60s, the lanes led Melbourne's trajectory downwards, with many becoming no-go zones and haunts for criminals, and buildings becoming brothels, opium dens and speakeasy gaming houses.
As suburbia flourished, the city centre slowly died and right into the 1980s the lanes were dark and dirty. Many disappeared beneath faceless office blocks.
With the urban renewal of the 1990s, the spirit of Melbourne's lanes revived.
These days, they are not only a colourful reminder of the city's past, but an integral part of its present - bijoux benchmarks of constant change, with Japanese tea houses and Chinese dim sum diners, fine dining and trendy bars and fashion boutiques, bespoke jewellers, art galleries, coffee grinders, hidden jazz clubs, and secret restaurants like the Italian Waiters' Club, which opened on Meyers Place in 1947 and only recently put a sign over its door.

Hosier Lane had clothing factories in the 1920s, now it's a hip showcase of urban art thronging with tourists.
Brown's Alley was renamed Dame Edna Place in 2007, and 10 impersonators turned up to celebrate.
Cathedral Arcade retains its art deco features and is covered with original stained glass and leadlight.
Centre Place is packed with bars, restaurants and cafes, and the graffiti along its length features on promotional campaigns for the city.
So news that Melbourne City Council has been selling some of the lanes to property developers has come as a shock.

In the last two years, the council has earned more than two million Australian dollars ($1,792m; £1.1m) from laneway sales.
The cheapest was A$92,000 for a slice of Butcher's Lane ($82,000; £49,000). The most expensive was 146 sq m of Benson Lane, at the Paris end of the city, for A$975,000 ($874,000; £525,000).
More from the Magazine "Canberra: Why wait for death?" was Bill Bryson's blistering judgement in his 2000 travelogue Down Under. "Pyongyang without the dystopia," was the verdict of the Economist in 2009. If Sydney is brash and bold, and Melbourne is cool and classy, then Canberra, at least in the Australian public imagination, is dull and devoid of soul. Madeleine Morris (March 2013) Canberra: Deathly dull at 100?
This was the site of the vast Tattersalls Horse Bazaar, then stables, then shops and banks - and now an elegant courtyard at the entrance to high-rise Nauru House.
The council was reluctant to provide details. The City Of Melbourne does not actively pursue the sale of laneways, said a spokesman, adding that sales were advertised and at market valuations.
But that is not what the council told The Age newspaper in December when asked about plans to sell off another part of a lane to the Queensland Investment Corporation as part of a huge office, retail and hotel complex next to Nauru House.
A spokesman said the council does "periodically consider the discontinuance and sale of roads and laneways". He added that the portions of laneways sold were "surplus to council requirements".
Few friends had heard of the laneway sales until I mentioned it.
Min was horrified. "It just seems that developers have taken over the city," she said. Another girlfriend, Gabriel, said people would be more vocal in opposing the sell-offs if only they knew about them.

Joni, who moved from LA 30 years ago says she could spend a year exploring the lanes, before having to start again because they're continuously evolving - she says she is always discovering new places to eat or shop.
"Don't the lanes belong to everyone?" she said. "How are they being sold? And is the income being used to maintain the rest?"
For now, there are no official answers. There are fears that the current development fashion for recreating lanes inside shopping malls could become a sterile alternative to Melbourne's organic laneways culture.
"A loss of any laneway is to be bemoaned," said the chairman of the National Trust of Victoria, Martin Purslow.
"They are vibrant, exciting places, critical to the character of our city, and we lose them at our peril."

Derby County is delighted to confirm the appointment of Paul Clement as their new Head Coach.
Derby County is delighted to confirm the appointment of Paul Clement as their new Head Coach.
Clement, 43, has signed a three-year contract at the iPro Stadium after leaving his role as assistant manager at Spanish giants Real Madrid to join the Rams.
After successfully serving Chelsea, Paris St Germain and Real Madrid as assistant manager to Carlo Ancelotti, he was described by the Italian boss as ‘one of the most dynamic and intelligent coaches' that he had worked with.
Clement replaces Steve McClaren as Derby's Head Coach, who parted company with the club last month following a thorough review by the club's board of the 2014/15 season, which ended with the Rams missing out on a place in the Sky Bet Championship's Play-Off places.
Derby have made the decision to maintain the structure implemented on the football side of the club since September 2013 by appointing Clement as their Head Coach.
Upon beginning their search for a successor to McClaren, Clement's excellent coaching credentials and skillsets quickly led to him becoming Derby's preferred candidate to move the club forwards at a key time.
He will take charge with immediate effect and will meet Derby's squad for the first time when they report back for pre-season training in June to begin their preparations for the 2015/16 season.
Derby County's President & Chief Executive Sam Rush commented: “Paul Clement is one of the most in-demand coaches in world football and I am delighted that he has agreed to join Derby County as our new Head Coach.
“He is hugely respected, has exceptional relationships throughout football and tremendous coaching experience at some of the very best clubs in Europe.
“He is the perfect appointment at the next stage of Derby County's development and we are looking forward to the coming season with a great deal of optimism.”
Upon joining Derby, Clement said: “I'm incredibly excited to be joining Derby County as Head Coach and I am looking forward to meeting the players and getting started.
“This is a massive club with fantastic facilities and a superb fan base who deserve success.
“Having spoken with Sam Rush and the owners I firmly believe we share the same desires and ambitions and that is to once again make Derby County a Premier League club.”
His first coaching role was with Chelsea in their Centre of Excellence, before he served Fulham in their Academy, in his first full-time position, and the Republic of Ireland at Under 21 level prior to returning to the Blues in 2007, initially with the youth and reserve sides.
His hard work and dedication to the job has seen him gain significant experience and work alongside some of the football's elite performers, working his way up the coaching ladder to earn a sizeable reputation in the game.
He stepped up to the first-team staff under Guus Hiddink in 2009 – during which time Chelsea won the FA Cup – before being retained by Carlo Ancelotti following his appointment ahead of the 2009/10 season working alongside the likes of Frank Lampard, Didier Drogba and John Terry.
In his first season working with Ancelotti at Chelsea they won the Premier League and the FA Cup, before the Italian departed at the end of the 2010/11 season. Clement too moved on, working briefly as assistant to Steve Kean at Blackburn Rovers before linking up with Ancelotti again midway through to the 2011/12 season at Paris St Germain.
In the 2012/13, PSG won the Ligue 1 title, as well as working alongside the likes of David Beckham and Zlatan Ibrahimovic and, in the summer of 2013, Clement followed Ancelotti to Spanish giants Real Madrid.
In their first campaign, Madrid won the UEFA Champions League trophy for the tenth time in their history after a 4-1 win over Atletico Madrid after extra-time with both Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale amongst their goalscorers. They also defeated Barcelona in the Copa del Rey Final during the season.
These successes were followed by the UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup a few months later.
Derby County will hold a Press Conference to unveil Paul Clement as their new Head Coach on Thursday 4th June 2015 at the iPro Stadium.

JavaScript Visualization Frameworks Review
Data has gradually become a very important aspect tool in the world today.
Data is driving the world, and at this stage when the world is being held to ransom by data and the web, it only makes sense to read information into the lots of data being generated out there.
A language like JavaScript is very important in the manner in which a web page gets to be displayed, and it makes complete sense for it to have a means of displaying data to the client.
Fortunately for the JavaScript evangelists, frontend developers, and data scientists, this article discusses three major JavaScript frameworks for visualizing data to the client without having to switch to a language which have been touted to be more data related such as Python and R.
The three major drawing tools that article talks about include Processing.js, Raphael.js and D3.js
Processing.js
Processing is both a language and programming environment, with a Java like syntax as its native code, originally developed by Ben Fry and Casey Reas in 2001. It was then ported to JavaScript by John Resig to be open sourced in 2008.
Users of Processing call their applications sketches, and Processing.js simply converts the native code into JavaScript so as to render them on the web page.
See the Pen electron-processing by Dash Bouquet (@dashbouquetdevelopment) on CodePen.
It also has a setup() and draw() function, used to initialize the application state and draw on the canvas element respectively.
The process of learning to use the processing.js framework is beyond the scope of this article. However, the online reference can be found here.
It is encouraging to know that:
It is an efficient and painless way to bring your web pages, which leads to a better understanding of your points by your readers.
It also gives room for interaction from the user, as it can take input from them; thereby making it a very resourceful tool.
Processing.js can be downloaded here. By the time you get to master or work with it, you can contribute to the project.
As powerful as this tool is, it is said to be the least powerful of the three frameworks to be discussed in today's article. That takes us to the next framework.
Raphael.js
Raphael's strongest point is said to be its ability to allow for easy drawing. To make use of Raphael, all you need is a browser and text editor. However; that's not the most exciting part.
Raphael also:
Allows for coding too, you can write commands for it to draw things in a unique way when a user loads your web page.
Supports the <canvas> element in HTML5.
Works on almost all browsers, the old browsers and most likely the ones to come.
Doesn't require external plugins to function properly.
Is mobile device friendly.
Raphael works directly with browser's built-in graphics language known as Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).
See the Pen Roundabout-Raphael by Dash Bouquet (@dashbouquetdevelopment) on CodePen.
However, the main reason Raphael is compatible with older browsers is that it works well with a format known as Vector Markup Language (VML).
Unlike Processing.js which had to be ported from Processing and is a Java-based language, Raphael is purely JavaScript; meaning it works seamlessly and naturally with web pages.
Raphael.js is a more popular framework than Processing.js. It also has lots of users in the data visualization community and you would have people to turn to whenever anything goes wrong. It is open source and would definitely be improved upon, there is nothing to fear, Raphael is one for the future. All these most likely give Raphael.js an edge over other data visualization frameworks out there.
One more thing, Raphael has an easy learning curve and can be used almost immediately. That takes us to the next one which is said to be the best framework for visualization but has a steep learning curve.
D3.js
D3 stands for (Data Driven Documents) and as the name implies; is well packaged for data visualization purposes. It translates raw datasets into visualization and works seamlessly with Microsoft Excel. D3 was created by one of the leading evangelists of web data visualization, Mike Bostock. Just like Raphael.js, D3 works with SVG and has the visualization shapes as part of the DOM (Document Object Model). Meaning you can style and design your data, making use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
See the Pen Collision Detection D3.js by Dash Bouquet (@dashbouquetdevelopment) on CodePen.
D3.js is based on HTML, DOM, CSS, SVG and also supports Canvas. D3 has lots of other frameworks built on it that allow for drag and drop. D3 is a great tool to invest in for the long-term, to create your own libraries that you can then use to speed up the creation process. For data visualization purposes, the most important interaction with SVG is to bind data to them, D3 allows for the rewriting of data wrapper around them.
As it stands D3.js is not just better than Raphael.js and Processing.js in many cases, but is also a viable replacement for jQuery and other frameworks. However, D3 is said to have a steep learning curve and is mostly conducive to programmers with experience using JavaScript.
Tools built on D3 include MetricsGraphics, Epoch, Vega, NVD3 and much more. These tools can be used instead of learning the D3 from scratch. To get started with D3 head to the D3 website and download the latest version.
Wrapping it up
Still not sure of what framework to choose?
You see –
When deciding what framework to use for your data visualizations, you have to know your priorities. Hopefully, the following pros and cons would help you define them:

One of the more interesting elements of last week's news was that some of the names of the future Intel Xeon processors, based on the Skylake microarchitecture, were accidentally ‘leaked' via an official Intel Product Change Notification. In that list, we learned that the processors will have a new naming scheme, and we saw Gold and Platinum processors based on the LGA3647 socket having a wide range of numbers, but no core counts or clock speeds.
Today's unveiling is minor, but an official approach to the new platform. Due to the way that Intel is expanding its reach from processors to networking to FPGAs and beyond, it has been decided that a new naming scheme needs to be in place. Thus the Xeon E/EP/EX naming regime is being reintegrated into what is now called the ‘Xeon Scalable Processor Family', of which the first set of products will be based on the Skylake microarchitecture. This is where the ‘SP' in ‘Skylake-SP' comes from, as the other abbreviations are now retired.
The core of Intel's unveiling today revolves around the different processor levels they will be offering, and where the new integrated options will fit in the new stack. In the slide above, Intel lists three integrated options: Omni-Path, Networking, and Accelerators.
Integrated Omni-Path options have already been seen in Xeon Phi based products from the Knights Landing family, which occupy the same LGA3647 socket, so it is perhaps not surprising that it looks like Intel will offer some Skylake-SP Xeons with Omni-Path also integrated.
Integrated Networking (asides from OmniPath) would suggest that Intel is looking towards deeper 1000Base-T (gigabit) options and even perhaps a nod to 10G, although this would most likely be provided by additional options on the chipset rather than on the processor (and stems from system integrator leaks we have already seen.
As for integrated accelerators, here Intel mentions Intel QuickAssist (QAT) and AVX-512. AVX-512 is the next advancement in AVX instructions and we already see them in use with Xeon Phi, and we expect there to be the capabilities in silicon to run AVX-512 natively in Skylake-SP. Intel's QAT is something we've seen in standalone PCIe cards before, so it would seem that Intel is also integrating this into the platform. After speaking with users familiar with QAT, due to what is needed to get QAT running at full speed, it would suggest that QAT will be chipset derived and platform dependent rather than purely on the processor.
On the right hand of this slide, Intel mentions FPGA, Nervana, Xeon Phi and Silicon Photonics. The acquisition of Altera for $16.7 billion in 2015 put FPGA integration firmly on the roadmap for Intel's Xeon product line, however Intel has not officially stated how these will be provided with the new Xeon-SP platforms. The fact that it isn't listed under the integrated options suggests that Intel will only offer FPGAs as add-in cards (or add-in processors, like Xeon Phi, for dual socket systems) at this time. Intel is also working on new optimized frameworks for the hardware, particularly math and AI libraries.
So along with the Gold and Platinum processors we saw last week, Intel will also be introducing Bronze and Silver grades as well. The Bronze group is aimed at entry performance, which sounds like the older low core count E5 parts, while the Silver parts seem aimed at lower power and will probably be low base frequency parts. The Xeon Gold family is aimed at accelerators and interconnects, which suggests they will be for multi-GPU or multi-socket platforms, while the Xeon Platinum will be the cream.
Despite this potential correlation, we were told in our briefing, given by Lisa Spelman, VP and GM of the Data Center Group, that the previous E5/E7 naming split due to potential socket configurations goes away and now we should expect to see various CPUs in all segments correlating to a variety of socket configurations. One of the reasons for this is that sometimes a customer could take advantage of an 8-socket variant processor (due to high cache per core, for example), but would never consider it because the customer only needed a two-socket configuration. One of the reasons given for the naming is to alleviate this issue.
It also means that we might see a lot more product SKUs coming to market, each with different configurations, naming, and capabilities depending on the accelerators. Typically Intel produces three dies for each Xeon generation – a low core count (LCC), a medium/high core count (MCC/HCC), and an extreme core count (XCC) version, and we see a variance up and down the stack depending on what dies fit in where: e.g. LCC were for single socket. With the new Scalable Processor Family naming scheme, we were told that Intel is trying to move away from this differentiation and just provide what the customer needs in the right segment. Not so much integration through obfuscation, but I kindly requested that when the official announcements are made, that the differentiations were made clear. Given the Gold/Platinum processor lists last week, it was unclear exactly what the numbering schemes represented, so in order to make the transition, it needs to be crystal clear.
We were told that as this is the first generation of the Xeon-SP naming scheme, the generation is omitted from the name, but future product lines (Kaby Lake-SP) will have a generational marker to denote the difference. This may be in the form of v2/v3, but this isn't clarified at this time.
Intel isn't announcing any products today. This is more of an opportunity to take hold of the news that already exists, and perhaps get a step up ahead of the upcoming conference season. We were told to expect a launch in the middle of the year, and were told that Intel is still on track for that.
Intel 8th-gen chips are finally here, with both laptop and now desktop processors on sale. Here's everything you need to know about the processors including prices, specs and performance.
Key points (Click to jump to section)
Intel Coffee Lake official specs and prices details
Intel had already unveiled its 8th-gen laptop processors, but this time we've got the first set of official details for the brand new “Coffee Lake” 8th-gen desktop chips. If you're interested in the laptop parts, which are quite different, scroll down to the next section.
If you want to skip to our Coffee Lake review in progress, click here for our first look at Core i7-8700K with performance figures versus AMD Ryzen
For now, Intel has only released the details of what it calls its “premium performance” line; they're the chips that Intel is aiming at gamers. All of these chips use the Coffee Lake architecture, which is the replacement of the older Kaby Lake. Confusingly, Kaby Lake is still used for laptop chips. In short, if Kaby Lake was a refined version of Skylake, Coffee Lake is a super-duper refinement (also known as 14nm++).
This year, for the first time in a long time, Intel's performance crown is under threat from AMD's Ryzen line-up. To compete, Intel is expanding its range of unlocked processors and is upping the core count. This is the official spec list of all the new desktop processors that went on sale October 6, along with their UK pricing.
Cores/Threads Base clock (GHz) Turbo all cores/one core (GHz) L3 cache TDP Price i7-8700K 6/12 3.7 4.3/4.7 12MB 95W £360 i7-8700 6/12 3.2 4.3/4.6 12MB 65W £330 i5-8600K 6/6 3.6 4.1/4.3 9MB 95W £270 i5-8400 6/6 2.8 3.8/4 9MB 65W £180 i3-8350K 4/4 4 N/A 6MB 91W £170 i3-8100 4/4 3.6 N/A 6MB 65W £110
The clear difference this year is the number of cores that each chip has. Now, the i7 range has six cores, with Hyper-threading giving 12 threads; the Core i5 range has six cores but no Hyper-threading; and the Core i3 range is now a quad-core brand. As far as pricing goes, despite the extra cores, prices haven't increased horribly over last year. Right now you can grab a Core i7-7700K for around £320, while its six-core successor, the 8700K, looks to cost around £350 in UK money including taxes. That's not bad at all considering the expected massive performance increase.
Of course, Intel is promising that the new Coffee Lake range will have considerably better performance than Kaby Lake. First, Intel has boosted single-core performance through a combination of architecture optimisations and higher Turbo speeds. Comparing the Core i7-8700K with the Core i7-7700K, Intel has said that gamers can expect up to 25 per cent higher frame rate in Gears of War 4. Multi-tasking has also been increased, largely thanks to the additional cores, with Intel quoting up to 45 per cent better performance in Playerunknown's Battleground, and up to 32 per cent faster video editing.
As well as the core count change and performance enhancements, Intel is promising better overclocking controls for anyone wanting to get more out of their CPU. With any multi-core processors, the manufacturing process typically means that some cores can handle a higher overclock than others. Now, with Coffee Lake, you get per-core overclocking to let you get the best out of each core. The max memory ratio has been improved to 8,400MT/s, and there's real-time latency control, so settings can be tweaked without requiring a reboot. Intel has updated its Extreme Tuning Utility and Extreme Memory Profile, too. We'll have to see how far the new chips can be pushed when we run our full review.
Intel has said that each processor has a GPU that is architecturally the same as on Kaby Lake. You can expect slightly better performance due to higher clock speeds and better-optimised drivers, although Intel didn't release the full specifications. Not that onboard GPU's at this level are particularly interesting, as the vast majority of people that buy one of these chips will also have a discrete graphics card.

The other thing that's worth keeping in mind ahead of the 8th-gen desktop chip launch is that it will require a new chipset, called Z370. This means the Z270 chipset that was introduced for Kaby Lake is already defunct and won't accept any newer processors. That's a bit of a bummer for anybody who made what they were hoping was a long-term investment in a Z270 motherboard. Intel sites power delivery requirements for the new chips as the reason behind the change. As a result of this, Skylake and Kaby Lake processors will not be compatible with Z370 motherboards, either. Z370 will also up supported memory speed to DDR4-2666.
Intel has said that Z370 will support USB 3.1 Gen 1 (up to 5Gb/s) rather than the newer 10Gb/s USB 3.1 Gen 2. It's likely, as usual, that the faster ports will be provided by OEM motherboard manufacturers on some models of board. There's also Thunderbolt 3 integrated into the chipset. Intel continues to push its Optane Memory technology, with the fast SSD cache helping to boost the speed of systems with mechanical storage. Optane Memory can make quite a difference, although it seems to us as though most people buying these high-end chips would be better off investing in a fast SSD.
All of the announced processors will be available on 5 October 2017, both in retail and OEM PCs. General desktop chips will not be available until the first half of 2018, with more details to come. We'll have a review of the first Coffee Lake chips soon.
Intel 8th-generation Core laptops
Intel's first drip of information on its new 8th-generation chips will be music to the ears of people looking to buy a laptop before the start of 2018. From 7th-generation ‘Kaby Lake' to 8th-gen ‘Kaby Lake' (you read that right, we'll explain later, we promise), Intel is claiming a “once in a decade” performance boost of 40% generation-over-generation.
When you look at the figures, it's easy to see why. The first four chips revealed are from the U-series of Core i chips. These processors are the most common you'll find in cheaper laptops, as well as ultra-thin and light notebooks.
Related: Best CPUs for gaming
Where the last-generation equivalents of these new processors were dual-core parts, Intel has doubled the number of cores. Quad-core performance on an Ultrabook? Result! Well, not quite.
Yes, there will be four cores but there's more to performance than just number of cores. These are still low-power processors. In other words, these aren't intended to replace more powerful quad-core laptops using ‘H'-series CPUs. However, what is clear is that new laptops will be much better at handling multiple tasks at the same time (such as loads of browser tabs), and should make many tasks a lot smoother.
Intel says 80 laptops will be available with the new quad-core chips before the end of the year, although how many come to the UK remains to be seen.

The IFA 2017 show has kicked off in style, with several laptop makers announcing new laptops and updates to older models that will feature eighth-generation Intel chips. Here's a selection of some of the big hitters that've been announced so far.
Dell XPS 13 from September 12
Asus ZenBook Flip S, Flip 14 and 15 (release TBC)
Asus ZenBook 3 Deluxe
Asus ZenBook 13 UX331
Acer Swift 5 2017 from December

Intel 8th-gen laptop CPU specs
i7-8650U i7-8550U i5-8350U i5-8250U Processor frequency (GHz) 1.9-4.2 1.8-4 1.7-3.6 1.6-3.4 CPU cores/threads 4/8 4/8 4/8 4/8 Cache 8MB 8MB 6MB 6MB Graphics clock speed (MHz) Up to 1150 Up to 1150 Up to 1000 Up to 1000
This first tranche of new chips will be running on a refined version of Intel's previous-generation CPU architecture, called Kaby Lake. While it's the same underlying technology, this only tells part of the story.
While there are more cores, the base clock speed of each chip is substantially lower than their predecessors. The Core i7-7600U, for example started at 2.8GHz, while the new i7-8650U will run as low as 1.9GHz.
This makes sense, given putting Intel is putting two extra cores on a chip that has the same thermal design power (TDP) as the last generation. There's no such thing as a free lunch in the world of microelectronics and these chips will have to manage their heat somehow.

This means some cores won't be running at their potential all of the time, but you should still get a nice combination of sprightly single-core performance and multi-task-friendly quad-core experience. This differs from Intel's other quad-core laptop chips from the H-Series (which you'll find in the Dell XPS 15 and 15-inch MacBook Pro among others), which run at a much higher base clock speed.
Intel hasn't detailed how this will work, and has been a little tight-lipped on some of the more technical specifics. The maths here is a bit interesting because some might say that doubling the number of cores should straight up double the performance. As we explain above, this isn't how things work. But what's more interesting is that doubling the number of cores on these new chips has actually only granted an extra 25% raw performance, with the final 15% coming from an improved design and better manufacturing capabilities.
One final note on these new chips: Intel has re-branded its HD Graphics on-board GPU to UHD Graphics. Don't be confused, however, as this really is just a re-brand. There's no performance difference at all.
There are more laptop chips we're still waiting to hear about: H-Series (high-end), M-Series (mid-tier quad-core) and Y-Series (ultra-low-power) all remain a mystery, as does the rest of the U-series range, which normally consists of a dozen or more chips.
Intel's strategy shift
The new laptop processors revealed above are based on Intel's current-generation Kaby Lake design. We had actually expected Intel to dump Kaby Lake entirely for this generation, as the company doesn't have a habit of extending the life of older technology.
In fact, 8th-gen will encompass not just Kaby Lake, but also Coffee Lake and Cannon Lake designs. This is one of those rare occasions where CPU geeks will be more confused than the average consumer; remember that regular consumers almost never see the codenames of the chips that end up in the computers they buy.
As a reminder, Kaby Lake is an enhanced version of Intel's 14nm Skylake design ( known as 14nm+). Coffee Lake is also known as 14nm++. Cannon Lake, is a 10nm design. Put very simply, a smaller transistor design means more power efficiency.

Intel has justified its decision to include a refreshed Kaby Lake architecture in its new generation because it believes the performance difference is big enough for regular consumers to consider it as such. Desktop chips, meanwhile, will use the upcoming Coffee Lake architecture, while laptops will see Cannon Lake tech towards the end of the year.
Ryzen to the occasion?
Most will see this laptop launch as an early response to AMD's Ryzen Mobile. Intel's arch consumer rival has already set the world alight with impressive new desktop processors, and while we know very little about its laptop efforts, Intel clearly believes AMD is bringing loads of cores to the table, as it did with its desktop products.
Intel has an enormous amount of clout in the laptop market, and given how many laptop companies seem to have committed to 8th-generation Intel, it'll be interesting to see how many also launch desirable machines with AMD Ryzen processors.

Top US senators of both major parties called Thursday for an overhaul of the tax code this year with an eye on spurring job growth in a still-sputtering economy.
“The country is ripe for tax reform,” Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told reporters, saying it would be one of the “first priorities” for his party in 2011 because “our tax system is broken and needs to be fixed.”
“We all know the tax code is a disaster, and any effort to simplify the tax code, to get the rates down to make it more fair, I think we'd be open to discussing that,” Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said.
Reid said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, whose panel has jurisdiction over taxes, would resume hearings he began last year “starting very, very soon” to flesh out the details of that difficult undertaking.
McConnell citing “the outrageous corporate tax rate we have in this country” as a threat to US global competitiveness and said President Barack Obama “seems to be open to an effort to reduce the corporate tax rate.”
But deep divisions on what to change and how to change it, rooted in the parties' historic attitudes towards taxes, were expected to make any breakthrough difficult absent a big push by Obama.
Reid and McConnell's comments came as Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor continued to press the president to outline tax reform plans in his annual “State of the Union” speech expected on January 25.
“When we hear the president come up to Capitol Hill in the next couple of weeks for the State of the Union address, we want to hear his ideas on tax reform,” Cantor toldCNBC television.
Cantor delivered that message to Obama himself during a telephone call on Wednesday to mark the Republicans formally taking over the House of Representatives.
“You talked about getting the economy going and there are a lot folks, I think on both sides of the aisle, who would like to see some tax reform proposals, so we'd love to work with you on that as well,” he told Obama.
From his website:
Presidential candidate Ted Cruz today announced endorsements from more than 50 Catholic leaders, including activists, public servants, pro-life advocates, clergy, and business leaders. Dr. Robert P. George and Ken Cuccinelli are co-chairs of the initiative, leading Cruz's outreach in the Catholic community.
“The Catholic Church is an unwavering voice for life, marriage, and religious liberty,” said Cruz. “These three issues have been central to my campaign since the very beginning, and I have been proud to stand with Catholics in the fight to protect the dignity of every life, the sacrament of marriage, and the First Amendment right to religious liberty. In an age when the Obama administration has the audacity to sue the Little Sisters of the Poor, it has never been more critical to stand with those who have dedicated their lives to the service of the Church and its mission of loving the whole world. Especially in this Year of Mercy, we have an opportunity to protect the most vulnerable and safeguard the truth revealed through Scripture and the tradition of millennia.”
Dr. Robert George praised Cruz for his loyalty to the rule of law and the principles of a free society. “No one has been stronger than Ted in standing up for religious liberty and other fundamental constitutional freedoms. …He will foster a culture, from the top down, that honors the Constitution – the one thing that, despite our differences, binds us all together as Americans,” said Professor George.
“In addition to his exceptional Constitutional credentials, Ted Cruz is a candidate with specific foreign policy proposals to defend persecuted Christians abroad,” said Ken Cuccinelli. “At a time when people of faith are under severe attack internationally, we need a president whose foreign policy priorities will leverage America's leadership to defend the defenseless.”
“I am very pleased to give my personal endorsement to Ted Cruz for President of the United States,” Monsignor Ed Lofton, Parish Priest at St. Theresa Catholic Church in South Carolina, said. “I have followed Ted's time in office and know that he governs grounded in the essential value of protecting life and liberty for all peoples. I am confident that Ted has the intelligence and the will to lead our nation in a positive direction. The Church must not be silent as the nation chooses the leaders who will shape its future. I am personally working for the election of Ted Cruz, and I urge fellow Catholics to join me in giving Ted Cruz our support and our votes.”
Something a little different this week. Get your ears around the ferocious and concise drama of Nikolai Myaskovsky's Tenth Symphony, a truly remarkable document of early 20th century symphonic history in terms of its sounds, structure, energy, musical language, formal compression, and even in terms of the performers for whom it was written. But I hope this short, sharp blast of Soviet-era symphonism by an unjustly neglected composer, who contributed more to the symphonic canon in terms of sheer number of pieces than Shostakovich, Prokofiev, and Rachmaninov combined, will whet your appetite to discover more Myaskosky - not least the rest of his 27 symphonies.
Myaskovsky is the missing link in the story of the Russian symphony in the 20th century. Born in 1881, the year before Stravinsky, he's the bridge between Tchaikovsky and the modernist symphonists such as Prokofiev and Shostakovich, and was regarded as the "the musical conscience of Moscow" throughout the Soviet period by his fellow composers.
Like every other Russian creative artist, he was deeply affected by the regime, steering a course between official approbation (he won the Stalin Prize six times, and in his 12th Symphony wrote music honouring the inspiring topic of the Collectivisation of Farming) and denouncement: after the Zhdanov decree in 1948, which he called "hysterical", Myaskovsky was censured, along with Shostakovich, Khachaturian, and Prokofiev.
But Myaskovsky's example for his fellow composers and musicians in the 20s, 30s, and 40s, above all as a teacher at the Moscow Conservatory from 1921, was as a creative figure whose life was dedicated to realising a uniquely diverse vision of what the Russian symphony could be. His symphonies don't generally have an explicitly social or political function. They inhabit their own world of personal musical exploration, and veer from expressionist modernism to high-romantic lyricism, from epic grandeur – as in his 6th Symphony, the longest he wrote, arguably his most ambitious achievement, to dark, disturbing emotional intimacy, like the opening of the single-movement 13th. These pieces were enormously influential on younger generations: as Murray McLachan says in this perceptive article on Myaskovsky's music, Sviatoslav Richter, Sergei Prokofiev, and many other musical luminaries would play Myaskovsky's latest symphonies as soon as they were available in piano arrangements, to find out what the prodigious symphonist had just discovered.
Myaskovsky's 10th, composed in 1927, was premiered the following year by one of Soviet Russia's most fascinating musical institutions - Persimfans, the "The First Conductorless Symphony Ensemble", founded by Lev Tseitlin, which lasted for a decade from 1922 (and which was revived in 2008). It's a brilliant, and as far as I'm aware, unique idea - a full-size symphony orchestra that operated without a maestro, a vision of a genuinely un-hierarchical, quasi-communist music-making. But I'm not surprised that the Persimfans performance of the 10th was something of a disaster: Miaskovsky's music, cast in a single, 17-minute movement, presents huge technical challenges for its large orchestra (as you can see from the score); if you throw into the mix that the players have to get it all together without somebody on the podium coordinating the symphony's shocking changes of tempo, texture, and mood, and the sheer, violent energy of its fast music, the result must have been chaotic.
The piece has a programmatic inspiration in Pushkin's poem The Bronze Horseman and Alexander's Benois's illustrations of the story, in which a young man's betrothed is drowned in the flooding of St Petersburg of 1824; after cursing the statue of Peter the Great at the fate that befell her, the young man is then chased through the streets by the statue which has come to life and pursues him to his own watery doom in the river Neva. You'll hear the horses, the fear, and the monumentality of the story in Myaskovsky's music, but this isn't a Straussian attempt to translate a story as precisely as possible into sound. Instead, Myaskovsky takes the fatalistic implacability of the story as his starting point, and throws us right into a ferocious drama, putting you under the horse's hooves after just a few seconds of marmoreal chromaticism in the low strings, woodwind, and brass, as if the statue has already started to chase us.
Myaskovsky's harmonic language is a uniquely distinctive amalgam of late-romantic density with expressionist acerbity - which music-jargonese is better experienced in the actual sounds of the symphony. The furious opening is contrasted with brief sections of slower lyrical uneasiness, a melody that starts in the oboe, and which you can hear as symbolising the man's grief, or his beloved's watery demise. But the "Allegro tumultuoso" - which really is tumultuous - soon returns, and it develops with snarling intensity, and as well as its rhythmic sound and fury, it creates a harmonic pincer movement with musical lines that converge from the very top and bottom of the orchestra, a realisation of a musical vice, like the fate that ensnares the hero of Pushkin's story.
Myaskovsky ramps up the tension even further in a chaotically fast and chromatically wild fugue, the music chasing its own tail, faster and faster, before the marmoreal music we heard right at the start is unveiled in its true, terrifying guise. There's a memory of the haunted lyricism of the slower tune before the Allegro advances on us again. The victim's demise is consummated in music of massive, loud intensity and then of eerie, spectral nostalgia, before the symphony's final gestures of orchestral onslaught, made all the more frightening with the silences that Myaskovsky composes around his gigantic blocks of brass sound and guillotine-like chords.
Myaskovsky himself wrote to Prokofiev that the symphony was "as massive as if it were made of iron". The brilliance of the piece is to compress that iron until it's white-hot with blazing musical imagination. (And Myaskovsky had good personal reasons to find this musical ferocity, this simultaneous scream against inevitable fate and stat(u)e-based violence: his father had been murdered in 1921 by Red Army zealots for wearing Tsarist insignia.) It's no surprise it's one of composer Oliver Knussen's favourites to conduct: there's a lot to be inspired by in Myaskovsky's Tenth – and a lot to discover in the other 26, too!
Key recording
There are a handful of other recordings, but Evgeny Svetlanov's with the Russian State Symphony Orchestra is the most compressed, and the most violently, compellingly realised.

In 2015, oddsmakers put Charles Barkley at 5000-1 odds to win the American Century Championship, a celebrity golf tournament in Tahoe. This year his odds are even larger than that, at 6000-1. According to ESPN, so far no bettor has taken the bet.​ Back in 2015, Hank Haney chimed in on Barkley's plight in the annual tournament, where he's finished in last place five times out of 21. “I think the bookmakers are safe no matter what the odds are with Charles. It's not going to happen,” he said.
Then last year, Barkley followed suit by finishing last and not making a single par in two rounds. Want to bet on an entrant with better odds than Barkley, whose swing struggles are infamous? Try Steph Curry (20-1), Tony Romo (3-1) or Justin Timberlake (35-1).
The latest CBSN Originals documentary, “Gender | The Space Between,” takes a deep dive into the complexities of gender identity and gender expression. While transgender stories have become more visible in the media, there are many identities and terms outside of the two most culturally accepted genders — man and woman — that fall under the trans umbrella. And in many social circles, the vocabulary related to gender identity is unfamiliar or inaccessible.
Gender - The Space Between
Gender identity is an extremely personal part of who we are, and how we perceive and express ourselves in the world. It is a separate issue entirely from sex, our biological makeup; or sexual orientation, who we are attracted to. There are dozens of dynamic and evolving terms related to how people identify. While this glossary cannot cover every possible identity a person might have, it provides definitions for some of the most common vocabulary necessary to understand the layered world of gender.
Below is a guide to some of the topics and terms discussed in “Gender: The Space Between,” as defined by the Human Rights Campaign, GLAAD, The Trevor Project, and the National Center for Transgender Equality.
Gender Identity Definitions
Agender: A term for people whose gender identity and expression does not align with man, woman, or any other gender. A similar term used by some is gender-neutral.
Brin Solomon, a graduate student at NYU, identifies as agender. CBS News
Androgynous: Identifying and/or presenting as neither distinguishably masculine nor feminine.
Bigender: Someone whose gender identity encompasses both man and woman. Some may feel that one side or the other is stronger, but both sides are present.
What it means to identify as cisgender
Binary: The gender binary is a system of viewing gender as consisting solely of two identities and sexes, man and woman or male and female.
Cisgender: A term used to describe someone whose gender identity aligns with the sex assigned to them at birth.
Dead name: How some transgender people refer to their given name at birth.
Gender dysphoria: Clinically defined as significant and durational distress caused when a person's assigned birth gender is not the same as the one with which they identify.
Gender expression: The external appearance of a person's gender identity, usually expressed through behavior, clothing, haircut or voice, and which may or may not conform to socially defined masculine or feminine behaviors and characteristics.
Gender fluid: A person who does not identify with a single fixed gender, and expresses a fluid or unfixed gender identity. One's expression of identity is likely to shift and change depending on context.
Gender fluid, agender and the new frontier
Gender identity: A person's innermost concept of self as man, woman, a blend of both, or neither – how individuals perceive themselves and what they call themselves. Gender identity can be the same or different from one's sex assigned at birth.
Gender non-conforming: A broad term referring to people who do not behave in a way that conforms to the traditional expectations of their gender, or whose gender expression does not fit neatly into a category.
Gender questioning: A person who may be processing, questioning, or exploring how they want to express their gender identity.
Genderqueer: A term for people who reject notions of static categories of gender and embrace a fluidity of gender identity and often, though not always, sexual orientation. People who identify as genderqueer may see themselves as being both male and female, neither male nor female or as falling completely outside these categories.
Brendan Jordan, a 17-year-old YouTuber with hundreds of thousands of followers, identifies as gender fluid. Brendan Jordan via Instagram
Misgender: Referring to or addressing someone using words and pronouns that do not correctly reflect the gender with which they identify.
Transgender testimonial - what it means to be non-binary
Non-binary: Any gender that falls outside of the binary system of male/female or man/woman.
Passing: A term used by transgender people which means that they are perceived by others as the gender with which they self-identify.
Queer: An umbrella term people often used to express fluid identities and orientations.
Sex: The classification of a person as male or female at birth. Infants are assigned a sex, usually based on the appearance of their external anatomy.
Transgender: An umbrella term for people whose gender identity and/or expression is different from cultural and social expectations based on the sex they were assigned at birth.
Transitioning: The social, legal, and/or medical process a person may go through to live outwardly as the gender with which they identify, rather than the gender they were assigned at birth. Transitioning can include some or all of the following: telling loved ones and co-workers, using a different name and pronouns, dressing differently, changing one's name and/or sex on legal documents, hormone therapy, and possibly one or more types of surgery.
Transsexual person: A generational term for people whose gender identity is different from their assigned sex at birth, and seek to transition from male to female or female to male. This term is no longer preferred by many people, as it is often seen as overly clinical, and was associated with psychological disorders in the past.
Two-spirit: A term that refers to historical and current First Nations people whose individual spirits were a blend of male and female. This term has been reclaimed by some in Native American LGBT communities to honor their heritage and provide an alternative to the Western labels of gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender.
A DEADLY Great White is lurking off some of our most popular beaches — and could attack at any moment, a shark expert claims.
Graeme Pullen says he has been pursuing the man-eater off the south coast for the past two years.
Getty Images 4 Fears are growing that bathers could be pulled under by a real life Jaws
But the fishing journalist has now gone public with his fears because he feels Brit beach-goers need to be warned, especially as the summer holidays approach, reports the Daily Mirror.
Mr Pullen said: “Make no mistake, this is the big one.
“This is surely Britain's first Great White - and it'll be coming back this summer."
He claims the blood-thirsty killer has been sighted repeatedly off Hayling Island, Hants, for two years.
And he fears it could have been returning to rich hunting grounds and gorging on seals and fish in shallow water.
He added: “The danger is this shark will eventually stumble across someone in a wet-suit and mistake them for a seal.”
BNPS.co.uk 4 Graeme Pullen believes the Great White is hunting seals close to the shore in water only feet deep
Mr Pullen has been tracking sharks British waters for 40 years and also tags them for the US National Marine Fisheries Service
He said: "This is no basking shark, no porbeagle, blue or mako. Others have also given details of their sightings and this is not miles out to sea but close to shore, mostly hunting in the estuaries.”

It's claimed the Great White is being drawn to the rich hunting grounds of British waters
The latest threat to British bathers comes after an eight-foot shark was spotted off a Majorcan beach at the weekend sending hundreds of holidaymakers running from the sea.
The blue shark, thought to have been wounded, came close to the shore at three popular beaches before it was dragged from the water by lifeguards and put down.
A blue shark was blamed for an attack on a swimmer off a popular Ibiza holiday beach last month which left him needed emergency hospital treatment.
The Spanish pensioner was treated for a two-inch gash to his hand just over a week ago after being bitten off the beach at Playa d'en Bossa.

But while the thought of a shark dragging you under may send shivers down your spine the poor old Great White may be under threat itself from killer whales.
A fourth member of the species has been found washed up dead on a beach believed to be the latest victim of killer whales off the South African coast.
Scientists say all four great whites have had their livers taken out with “surgical precision”.
Experts believe killer whales could be feasting on the organ which is rich in a compound called squalene.

Fake, phone-attacking cell-towers are all across America
The towers attack the baseband radio in your phone and use it to hack the OS; they're only visible if you're using one of the customized, paranoid-Android, post-Snowden secure phones, and they're all around US military bases.
ESD's Cryptophone 500 spotted 17 of the fake cellular towers on casual drives around the USA, including one at the South Point Casino in Las Vegas. The baseband processor, which controls the phone's radio, is notoriously insecure and vulnerable to over-the-air attacks; it can serve as a back-door to your phone's main OS. The fake "interceptor" towers force your phone to back \\down to an easy-to-break 2G connection, then goes to work:
Whenever he wants to test out his company's ultra-secure smart phone against an interceptor, Goldsmith drives past a certain government facility in the Nevada desert. (To avoid the attention of the gun-toting counter-intelligence agents in black SUVs who patrol the surrounding roads, he won't identify the facility to Popular Science). He knows that someone at the facility is running an interceptor, which gives him a good way to test out the exotic “baseband firewall” on his phone. Though the baseband OS is a “black box” on other phones, inaccessible to manufacturers and app developers, patent-pending software allows the GSMK CryptoPhone 500 to monitor the baseband processor for suspicious activity. So when Goldsmith and his team drove by the government facility in July, he also took a standard Samsung Galaxy S4 and an iPhone to serve as a control group for his own device. ”As we drove by, the iPhone showed no difference whatsoever. The Samsung Galaxy S4, the call went from 4G to 3G and back to 4G. The CryptoPhone lit up like a Christmas tree.” Though the standard Apple and Android phones showed nothing wrong, the baseband firewall on the Cryptophone set off alerts showing that the phone's encryption had been turned off, and that the cell tower had no name – a telltale sign of a rogue base station. Standard towers, run by say, Verizon or T-Mobile, will have a name, whereas interceptors often do not.

Apple
Jonathan "Jony" Ive, Apple's chief industrial designer, counted Steve Jobs among his closest friends but bristled when the man took credit for the ideas of others--especially his own.
In his new biography of Jobs, author Walter Isaacson portrayed Ive as an artist with a "sensitive temperament" who, like other colleagues, got upset when Jobs took too much credit for ideas he hadn't originated. Ive was especially wounded because he held personal feelings for and a true friendship with Jobs.
"He [Jobs] will go through a process of looking at my ideas and say, 'That's no good. That's not very good. I like that one,'" Ive told Isaacson. "And later I will be sitting in the audience and he will be talking about it as if it was his idea. I pay maniacal attention to where an idea comes from, and I even keep notebooks filled with my ideas. So it hurts when he takes credit for one of my designs."
Ive was also upset when people outside the company saw Jobs as Apple's only idea man.
"That makes us vulnerable as a company," Ive said to Isaacson.
But in the long run, Ive praised Jobs for the motivation he provided to turn ideas into reality.
"In so many other companies, ideas and great design get lost in the process," Ive said. "The ideas that come from me and my team would have been completely irrelevant, nowhere, if Steve hadn't been here to push us, work with us, and drive through all the resistance to turn our ideas into products."
Jobs and Ive often ate lunch together and collaborated on different Apple products. Jobs also held the design wizard in high esteem.
"He understands what we do at our core better than anyone," Jobs had told Isaacson for the biography. "If I had a spiritual partner at Apple, it's Jony."
Last year, both Jobs and Ive were named by Fortune as among the smartest people in technology. In giving Jobs top honors among all CEOs, the magazine referred to him as a "visionary, a micromanager, and a showman." Naming Ive as the top designer in technology, Fortune credited him as the person who created the iPhone and said that "from the iPod to the iPhone to the iPad, his contributions have set the course not just for Apple but for design more broadly."
This amazing image of the center of our galaxy is the work of three different space telescopes - Hubble, which photographs objects in the visual wavelengths, Chandra, which looks at X-rays, and Spitzer, which investigates the infrared.
Along with the Fermi space telescope, which is in charge of gamma ray, these three space telescopes allow us to investage every corner of the sky in breathtaking detail. Astrophysicist Giovanni Fazio offers a succinct explanation of the purpose of these telescopes:
"The object was to have a major telescope in each part of the electromagnetic spectrum. When you look at the universe in different wavelengths, you get a completely different picture. They are all pieces of a puzzle."

Images like this are created by compiling the different views the various satellites have to offer, and then assigning colors to each of the wavelengths the telescopes detect. This view of the heart of our galaxy is just one of the most dramatic images these telescopes have combined to create, but there are many others - the Smithsonian website has an awesome gallery of them here, along with a great article explaining how they all work together to uncover the secrets of the universe.

View of Oakland Skyline from Lake Merritt vista
The last time San Franciscans talked this much about Oakland was in 1906. The City was ablaze and 100,000 residents fled across San Francisco Bay, many never to move back to San Francisco. They say the population of Oakland doubled in roughly 72 hours.
There's a funny analogy here. San Francisco is currently ablaze again and in the midst of changes that, while not on the scale of a three-day fire, will forever change the physical, cultural and demographical landscape, just like in 1906. New buildings and cranes scrape The City's skyline while people who call themselves San Franciscans are being pushed from their homes by forces out of their control. Cataclysms are not always caused by nature.
And once again, Oakland is there to take the brunt of it, pick up San Francisco's pieces, and be forever changed by thousands of refugees just looking for a place to call home. Too bad no one asked Oakland how it felt about it.
I was out in Oakland this week with my good friend Sayre, who's been living in The Town for seven or eight years and is one of its biggest cheerleaders.
At one point we ran into Boots Riley from the legendary hip-hop group The Coup. Boots is an Oakland native involved in radical politics who care deeply about his city's plight and capitalism's role in it.
Boots and I became friendly when he was on my talk show, “The Kinda Late Show with Broke-Ass Stuart,” and we have been in touch ever since. We were at Legionnaire, one of the many new bars that have exploded into downtown Oakland in the past couple years, jamming out to the music of Motown on Monday, a party that originated in San Francisco. Marvin Gaye was bumping through the speakers and Soul Train was being projected on the screen. The crowd was far more diverse than any I've seen in San Francisco recently.
“So how do we stop Oakland from becoming the Mission?” I yell-talked at Boots over the blaring Motown. It was something that Sayre and I discuss often, but this was the kind of thing Boots focuses on in both his music and his activism.
“We need to begin with functional rent-control laws,” Boots yell-talked back to me, “and focus on bringing in jobs that pay real living wages for the people who are already here. Neither of which are things that City Hall has any intention of doing.”
Later on, Sayre pointed out other things Oakland could do like occupancy requirements for new residential construction and penalizing property owners in places like West Oakland who just sit on fallow land until the price rises high enough for them to sell. But we all know City Hall won't do that.
I've spent so much time over the last few years lamenting the things that Mayor Ed Lee's administration has allowed to happen in San Francisco, yet I never even thought about what his counterparts were doing just across the Bay. I didn't realize that Oakland's City Hall was as deeply entrenched in the same “capitalism at any cost” ideology as our own.
And maybe that's at the heart of what's happening in Oakland. When you live in San Francisco, it's the center of the world. We like to think the things created here reverberate around the globe, but we fail to notice how the serious issues we view as just our own are actually affecting the communities around us.
There's an old saying (that I'm completely making up right now) that goes “As San Francisco goes, so goes Oakland.” And for Oakland's sake, I hope it doesn't.
President Obama got his own handful of Bill Clinton 'rape' protesters – as two young people sporting 'Bill Clinton Rapist' t-shirts interrupted his Greensboro, North Carolina rally just a few minutes in.
The president appeared to find the whole thing funny, pausing at length while Secret Service hauled them out.
'You know, this is the great thing about politics in America, it takes all kinds,' he laughed. 'Folks will just do all kinds of stuff. Now where was I?'
When things didn't quite get back in order the POTUS tried again.
'You know, say, those are some folks who – they were auditioning for a reality show,' Obama said.
Scroll down for video
President Obama addressed a crowd tonight in Greensboro, North Carolina, and dressed down protesters suggesting they were 'auditioning for a reality show'
In the early moments of President Obama's appearance two young people wearing 'Bill Clinton Rapist' t-shirts interrupted the commander-in-chief
Several Bill Clinton 'rapist' protesters have interrupted Hillary Clinton's events since Donald Trump brought three women to the debate who accused the ex-president of sexual misdeeds
Especially since Donald Trump trotted out three women who were accusers of President Bill Clinton before and throughout Sunday night's protesters have been labeling the ex-president a 'rapist' at a number of Hillary Clinton events.
Yesterday in Detroit, a protester wore a t-shirt that resembled the iconic 2008 Obama 'HOPE' artwork designed by Shepard Fairey.
But instead of HOPE there was the word RAPE, and instead of Obama, there was an image of Bill Clinton.
'You know, I do hope someone follows that gentleman out and stages an intervention,' the Democratic nominee said, laughing at the man's interruption.
'He clearly has not been following this election very closely,' she added.
Protesters also yelled 'Bill Clinton is a rapist' toward the candidate and former Vice President Al Gore when they appeared together at a Florida rally today, so Gore could ask millennials to vote, warn them about close elections and about his trademark issue of climate change.
Another protester interrupted the president later on, to which Obama started a call-and-response: 'Don't Boo,' he said. The audience yelled back, 'Vote!'
Tonight just a handful of protesters distracted Obama as he addressed a crowd at the White Oak Amphitheater.
When another protester interrupted the country's commander-in-chief he shushed the audience's negative reaction and ordered up some call-and-response.
'You know what, this is our democracy at work this is great,' Obama said.
'What have I said?' he continued. 'Don't boo,' he yelled, as the audience spouted back, 'Vote!'
'Don't boo,' Obama said.
'Vote!' the crowd replied.
With his wife also on the trail, President Obama started out the evening repeating a similar spiel, talking about his presidency almost being done.
'Our lease was only for eight years,' the president said.
President Barack Obama addressed the North Carolina crowd and explained to them the dangers of electing Republican Donald Trump
'We're already looking around making sure we haven't broken any of the china,' he said. 'Sunny hasn't ruined any of the carpets,' he continued, referencing the first family's younger Portuguese Water Dog.
He also used a line that's been popular in her stump speeches about Trump 'popping off,' suggesting that's dangerous when the person is the president.
Obama ticked off a number of his accomplishments and made a dad joke.
'No wonder, I've gone gray because we've been busy,' he told the crowd. 'That's why I have all this grey hair.'
But the meat of his speech was about explaining the dangers of a Donald Trump presidency, while propping up his own former secretary of state.
Obama looked back eight and four years and noted how when he ran against Sen. John McCain and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney 'I never thought that these people weren't honorable.'
'I didn't think that if they were in the Oval Office that America could spin out of control,' he said.
Supporters of Hillary Clinton watched President Obama speak tonight in Greensboro, North Carolina, where he was interrupted by protesters at least twice
'But look, and I'm being honest here, that is not the case with the current nominee,' Obama said.
Right on message with candidate Clinton, Obama knocked Trump for his bad temperament and judgment and his unwillingness to learn.
'And that was true even before we heard about his attitudes toward women,' Obama continued, referring to the video released Friday where Trump bragged about hitting on a married woman and being able to kiss and grape other women because of his celebrity.
Continuing with this line of attack the president added, 'Now, of course it was true when we heard what he thought about minorities, and what he thought about people of the Muslim faith, and when he made fun of disabled persons or when he insulted Gold Star families,' the president went on.
'You don't have to be a husband or a father to hear what we heard just a few days ago and say that's not right,' he advised. 'You just have to be a decent human being to say that's not right.'
Besides the lewd video, Obama took on Trump for other things too.
He mocked him for his casino businesses failing, which could have enabled Trump to not pay federal income tax for 18 years, according to a New York Times report.
'I also don't know a lot of casino operators who mange to lose $1 billion in a year,' Obama said, cracking a smile. 'They say the house always wins, I don't know what happened.'
The president chewed up Trump's debate performance, especially one of his most eyebrow-raising and applause-getting lines.
'And this is serious business when in the middle of a debate you threaten to put your opponent in jail,' the president said. 'No trial, no indictment, no lawyers,' he continued, fingering Trump for 'chipping away at basic values like tolerance and due process and mutual respect.'
'Our democracy doesn't work like that,' he said. 'And there's only one candidate in this race who understands that democracy in big, diverse country doesn't work if you constantly demonize each other.'
Obama then, again, threw in a joke.
'And I mean that literally, by the way,' he said. 'I was reading the other day there's a guy on the radio who, apparently Trump's on his show frequently, he says me and Hillary are demons.'
'Said we smell like sulfur. Ain't that something,' the president said.
'I mean come on people,' Obama chided. 'Democracy doesn't work if you just say stuff like that and apparently there are people who believe that stuff and they're listening to it constantly and you can't have leaders who are promoting that because what happens is we get so divided ... that nothing gets done.'
New York state's Board of Elections is providing voter information to the federal commission investigating possible fraud at the polls despite Gov. Cuomo's refusal to comply with an earlier request.
“New York refuses to perpetuate the myth voter fraud played a role in our election,” Cuomo said in June. “We will not be complying with this request.”
But the governor said the commission scaled down its request. limiting it to information that anyone could get, so it was granted.
The data provided included the names of voters, their dates of birth, party affiliation, addresses and how often they have voted.
The board did not not turn over the last four digits of voters' Social Security numbers, their driver's license or non-driver identification numbers, a copy of their signatures or criminal histories.
All were included in the Trump administration's initial request in June.
“That general information request is being granted by the Board of Elections, but nothing further,” Cuomo said in a statement.
“Our position remains unchanged and we will continue to deny requests for sensitive personal data about New York residents…We will never provide private voter information to anyone, especially a politically-motivated organization seeking to perpetuate the myth of voter fraud.”
When Facebook acquired standalone messaging app WhatsApp in February for $16 billion, the future of its own messaging app, Messenger, suddenly became unclear.
Facebook seems to have settled those questions Wednesday: It's making sure Messenger is here for the long haul.
Facebook will soon force all users to send messages through Messenger by eliminating the chat features from its traditional iOS and Android versions of the app, a spokesperson confirmed to Mashable. Facebook has started notifying users of the change, with some in Europe receiving the notification today.
Those users will have two weeks to download Messenger before the service within the main app disappears, according to TechCrunch, which first reported the news.
"Today we are starting to notify people that messages are moving out of the Facebook app and over to the Messenger app," a spokesperson wrote in a statement to Mashable. "To continue sending messages on mobile, people will need to install the Messenger app."
If you have both the main app and Messenger on your phones, you already complete all messaging through Messenger; the messages tab within the main app redirects you. Those who do not are prompted to download Messenger with little pop-ups from the company that highlight Messenger's functionality, but users did not need to download in order to continue messaging their Facebook friends.
Currently, users who don't have Messenger are prompted to download it when going into the messaging tab on Facebook's main app. Image: Kurt Wagner/Mashable
This update to the standalone app will change that by making Messenger the only way to chat via mobile.
The company will alert users multiple times before the feature disappears, although a timeline hasn't been set for when messaging within the main app will be gone for good. Facebook is starting with a "handful of countries in Europe," according to a spokesperson.
Mote Marine Laboratory and The Nature Conservancy are partnering on a coral conservation initiative that will enable coral restoration at unprecedented scales throughout the Caribbean and the Florida Keys. The collaboration officially began Monday evening, Sept. 12, 2016, in Miami, with the signing of a one-year memorandum of understanding (MOU), enabling the first steps in a proposed 15-year initiative of joint coral reef restoration and conservation efforts.
The goals of the initiative are to restore more than one million corals across the region's reefs, share science-based coral restoration and conservation practices among U.S. and international Caribbean partners, and construct necessary facilities such as coral gene banks, which preserve genetically diverse coral tissue and help researchers find strains resilient to environmental change. The Sept. 12 MOU will officially launch one year of planning and preparation, which will include growing 50,000 coral fragments.
Coral reef systems help provide shoreline resiliency that protects coastal communities and create vibrant, healthy oceans for the people that depend on them. Ocean acidification, increasing ocean temperatures as a result of climate change, overfishing, unplanned coastal development and other associated stressors including waste water have damaged or decimated reefs around the world. Coral cover in Florida and the Caribbean has declined by 50 to 80 percent in some areas in just the last three decades.
"As global challenges to the long-term sustainability of coral reefs intensify, so must our efforts to understand and address them," said Dr. Michael P. Crosby, President & CEO of Mote. "The basic and transformative research that Mote conducts is vital, but we also have a responsibility to translate and transfer the findings of our science into positive ecological, societal and economic impacts. Proactively restoring reefs at a regionally strategic scale, combined with establishing a network of coral gene banks to safeguard essential biodiversity, is unprecedented and allows for all three benefits: helping replenish some of the ocean's most biodiverse ecosystems, educating and involving communities that are intimately linked to them, and preserving livelihoods -- the billions of dollars generated by reef-related economic activity."
Mote -- an independent, nonprofit marine science and education institution of five campuses from Sarasota, Florida to the Florida Keys that conducts diverse research programs around the world -- has developed innovative technologies to grow staghorn, brain, boulder and star coral fragments and planted approximately 20,000 of them onto depleted reefs in the Florida Keys. In early 2017 Mote plans to open a new coral reef research and education facility at its Summerland Key campus, where Mote scientists have already pioneered groundbreaking methods to restore reef-building corals at accelerated rates and begun to genetically identify staghorn coral strains for potential resilience against threats.
"We are accountable to future generations for securing the very resources that have helped us and generations before us to thrive," said Dr. Luis Solórzano, Executive Director of The Nature Conservancy's Caribbean Program. "With the threats of climate change, unsustainable development, overfishing and pollution, this partnership between The Nature Conservancy and Mote Marine Lab offers hope for the future of coral reefs and the systems they support. It is our imperative to engage leading scientists, advance innovative coral restoration practices and work collaboratively in order to safeguard these critical ecosystems."
"Coral reefs are critical ecosystems for sustaining the integrity of our marine habitats, natural resources and species, as well as for protecting our coastal areas. The decline of our coral reef systems from climate change and other human related impacts has serious consequences to the health and well-being of people and nature and requires that we take bold actions to transform the rate and scale of coral conservation," said Temperince Morgan, Director of The Nature Conservancy in Florida. "We are excited to be joining forces with our Caribbean Program and Mote to step up to this challenge in an unprecedented way by applying our extensive experience in coral restoration to further develop and apply the science needed to conserve one of the most valued and threatened marine habitats in the world."
The Nature Conservancy is an international conservation organization working to protect the lands and waters on which all life depends. Throughout the Caribbean and Florida, the Conservancy has worked with their partners to advance science-based conservation actions that include establishing coral nurseries and planting over 15,000 coral colonies from the nurseries onto reefs over the past 12 years in the Florida Keys, Dry Tortugas and U.S. Virgin Islands. These coral nurseries span from the Florida Keys all the way down to Grenada and are part of the largest restoration project of its kind.
By combining forces, two of the world's foremost independent marine research and conservation organizations will launch an innovative, international coral reef restoration initiative, giving Caribbean and Florida Keys coral reefs a better chance to survive and deliver ecological and economic benefits to future generations.
Key goals for the one-year agreement and onward
-Now through September 2017: The one-year MOU will help Mote and Conservancy staff secure additional coral restoration permits, plan their reef restoration initiative for the coming years, fundraise collaboratively and grow approximately 50,000 fragments of various coral species at Mote's facilities in the Florida Keys and the Conservancy's facilities in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Partners will focus on selecting coral strains resilient to increasing water temperatures, ocean acidification and disease. In early 2017, Mote will enhance these efforts by opening its new coral reef research facility on Summerland Key.
-By 2020: A networked coral gene bank of threatened Caribbean and Florida coral species will be established and accumulate genetically identified coral tissue samples as "insurance" against climate change and near-term catastrophic events for reefs, such as widespread bleaching, diseases and oil spills. Efforts will include enhancing or expanding coral nurseries and adding gene banks to Mote and Conservancy facilities in Florida and the U.S. Virgin Islands, respectively. Mote and Conservancy staff will forge and advance international partnerships for upcoming coral restoration in priority locations including Cuba and the Bahamas.
-By 2025: Mote and Conservancy staff plan to work with U.S. and international partners to restore corals at unprecedented rates for the Caribbean and the Florida Keys. Goals include planting one million coral fragments in the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Florida Keys and 500,000 in at least three other Caribbean nations. The partners aim to establish a new, permanent coral restoration facility in St. Croix to be jointly operated by Conservancy and Mote staff. They will also complete training of key local personnel working at U.S. and international coral restoration areas, and in the process, disseminate state-of-the-art coral science, conservation and restoration practices around the Caribbean.
Mote and the Conservancy will work together and leverage their ongoing research and community engagement programs to secure the philanthropic investments needed to implement these innovative programs for restoring coral reefs and engaging local communities to lead in these efforts.
Mote is already working with middle- and high school students in its Coral Research and Conservation Program that the Lab spearheaded with EARTHANGLE Inc. Now, the MOU between Mote and the Conservancy will help expand this program, with the ultimate goal of educating and engaging more students and their communities in coral reef conservation and restoration activities in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Florida Keys.

Steve Mason stands on his head — and scores a goal — as the Flyers win the Stanley Cup in a full-season simulation, while Roberto Luongo turns back the clock and Patrick Kane continues to dominate league scoring.
Philadelphia Flyers fans can get ready for a parade this summer — or at least that's what EA Sports' NHL 17 is predicting.
The newest instalment of NHL 17 is set to be released Tuesday, but EA's Early Access program has made the game playable days ahead of its formal release. And in a full-season simulation, the Flyers, led by outstanding goaltending by Steve Mason, have themselves in line for the third Stanley Cup in franchise history.
In order to get the results of 2016-17 campaign via NHL 17, a season was set up and simulated all the way through. Some of the happenings of the campaign may be a bit farfetched, but no video game — even one that prides itself on simulation-style gameplay as much as the EA titles do — is going to be able to accurately predict the future. Here's a look at how the 2016-17 simmed season standings shook out:
One important note on the standings to keep in mind: These are the rosters right out of the box, and trades were turned off to avoid any GM trading oddities. For instance, we wouldn't have wanted to see Sidney Crosby traded to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for Connor McDavid, so the only way to ensure that was by nixing the trading.
So, yes, with that in mind, EA's NHL 17 doesn't project the up-and-coming Florida Panthers to have a huge season thanks to their off-season wheeling and dealing. Most surprisingly, though, is that the season is centred not around the young talent but on goaltender Roberto Luongo. Even with James Reimer as his backup, Luongo takes over and dominates the regular season.
In the post-season, though, the Panthers suffer the curse of the Presidents' Trophy. Take a look at the playoff bracket, which features an Eastern Conference final matchup that we can only hope comes to pass:
For his play in the post-season, Steve Mason takes home the Conn Smythe Trophy after leading the Flyers to not one, not two but three Game 7 victories. It's not shocking, though, considering Mason was among the league's best goaltenders in the regular season. (He also somehow managed to score a goal during the campaign.)
When it came to end-of-season awards, the dominating forces were Luongo and Patrick Kane, though Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens fans will be encouraged by two of our NHL 17 simulations projected winners.
Kane led the league for a second-straight season in the simulation, potting 49 goals and 57 points. He captured the Art Ross, Hart, Lady Byng and Ted Lindsay Award. The next closest scorer to Kane was Corey Perry, who netted 48 goals and 93 points, but that wasn't enough to earn him any hardware.
The other offensive awards went to Alex Ovechkin and Patrice Bergeron, who captured the Rocket Richard and Selke Trophies, respectively.
For goaltending, Luongo captured the Vezina and Jennings Trophies. He posted a 46-18-5 record with a .926 save percentage, 2.11 goals-against average and five shutouts. His 146 goals against were far and away the best of any starting netminder.
Finally, it was a pair of players from Canadian teams who took home the Calder and Norris Trophies. William Nylander's rookie campaign was enough to capture top rookie honors, while Shea Weber, in his first season in Montreal, was named the league's best defender and did his best to make the Canadiens faithful forget about P.K. Subban.
The likelihood the results from a full-season simulation in NHL 17 come to fruition are slim. That said, if the latest instalment in EA's NHL series has any Nostradamus like qualities, get ready for a fun campaign Flyers fans.

An intersection in downtown Halifax known as Pizza Corner for more than two decades is undergoing some changes with the closure of another pizza joint.
The windows of the European Food Shop, at the intersection of Grafton and Blowers streets, was covered in brown paper on Monday. It closed for business last week and is set to be renovated into a new restaurant.
The new eatery has not yet been announced.
Three corners at that intersection have been home to shops serving pizza and donairs for the last 20 years, much to the delight of hungry late night bar patrons. In 2012, the face of the corner changed when King of Donair closed and a frozen yogurt shop opened in its location.
Simon Thibault, a Halifax food writer, said the latest departure signals a change for the Halifax institution.
"Haligonians have been coming here, now it's becoming a generational thing," he said.
"You grew up going to Pizza Corner, now your kids are going to pizza corner. Whether you're OK with that or not is a different story, but it's part of Halifax's nightlife."
John Kamoulakos, the building's landlord and the man who opened the original European Food Shop in 1987, confirmed to CBC News the building will still be a food shop but likely not a pizza shop.

Pizza Corner has been the scene of alcohol fuelled fights, stabbings and police patrols — but many Haligonians have a lot of affection for the iconic location.
Thibault says the history will remain.
"It's going to be Pizza Corner forever," he said. "The legend lives on, and will live on for a very long, drunken time."
Kamoulakos said the new restaurant will still serve donairs.
I don't usually find piracy easy to justify, but considering that EA has been pig-headed to the extreme over the use of SecuROM in its products -- a measure deemed harmful to the enjoyment of the paying consumer -- it's kind of karmic to learn that Spore's piracy levels have been deemed "extraordinary" by by one peer-to-peer research firm.
Spore has been at the center of a big DRM controversy, as its piracy-protection program generated a huge user backlash on Amazon. We also learned that EA's "draconian" level of control limits people to creating only one account per copy of the game. People are understandably angry and upset at Electronic Arts for exerting this kind of dictatorial power over its customers, and it looks like they are doing what they can to punish the publisher.
"The numbers are extraordinary," exclaimed Eric Garland, boss of P2P researcher Big Champagne. "This is a very high level of torrent activity even for an immensely popular game title."
The game has been downloaded 171,402 times since September 1, and users such as "deathkitten" on The Pirate Bay are urging users to add to that figure, claiming that it's "the right thing," to do. The right thing it may not entirely be, but EA was kind of asking for it. If you punish your paying customers by using detrimental DRM, something like this is bound to happen. It also proves that SecuROM doesn't bloody work, either.

Former GOP presidential candidate Michele Bachmann recently became a citizen of Switzerland after her husband claimed his heritage.
“Congresswoman Bachmann's husband is of Swiss descent so she has been eligible for dual-citizenship since they got married in 1978,” Becky Rogness said in a statement to POLITICO, which first reported the story in the United States. “However, recently some of their children wanted to exercise their eligibility for dual-citizenship so they went through the process as a family.”
Marcus Bachmann reportedly began the process to claim his citizenship on Feb. 15, according to POLITICO. That process was finalized on March 19, giving Michele citizenship as well, the website reported.
Bachmann's three youngest children are now Swiss citizens too, and her two older children also eligible to apply.
The Minnesota congresswoman was interviewed by Swiss reporters in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday while with a group of Swiss parliamentarians and she discussed her family's heritage.
“My husband is a 100 percent Swiss, and his parents were raised in Switzerland, they were married there, they came to the United States, they bought a farm in Wisconsin and raised their three sons there,” Bachmann said in the interview.
When a reporter reminds her that she is now eligible to run for office in Switzerland, she laughed, saying the the competition would be very stiff “because they are very good,” referring to the parliamentarians with her.
Asked what she likes about the European nation, Bachmann said it's “tough not to find a place to like in Switzerland,” citing the country's beauty and famous chocolates.
Project Tango at this point is probably not new to anyone reading this as we've discussed it before, but in the past few years Google has been hard at work making positional tracking and localization into a consumer-ready application. While there was an early tablet available with an Nvidia Tegra SoC inside, there were a number of issues on both hardware and software. As the Tegra SoC was not really designed for workloads that Project Tango puts on a mobile device, much of the work was done on the GPU and CPU, with offloading to dedicated coprocessors like ST-M's Cortex M3 MCUs for sensor hub and timestamp functionality, computer vision accelerators like a VPU from Movidius, and other chips that ultimately increased BOM and board area requirements.
At SIGGRAPH today Google recapped some of this progress that we've seen at Google I/O as far as algorithms go and really polishing the sensor fusion, feature tracking, modeling, texturing, and motion tracking aspects of Tango. Anyone that has tried to do some research into how well smartphones can act as inertial navigation devices will probably know that it's basically impossible to avoid massive integration error that makes the device require constant location updates from an outside source to avoid drifting.
With Tango, the strategy taken to avoid this problem works at multiple levels. At a high level, sensor fusion is used to combine both camera data and inertial data to cancel out noise from both systems. If you traverse the camera tree, the combination of feature tracking on the cameras as well as depth sensing on the depth sensing camera helps with visualizing the environment for both mapping and augmented reality applications. The combination of a traditional camera and a fisheye camera also allows for a sort of distortion correction and additional sanity checks for depth by using parallax, although if you've ever tried dual lens solutions on a phone you can probably guess that this distance figure isn't accurate enough to rely completely on. These are hard engineering problems, so it hasn't been until recently that we've actually seen programs that can do all of these things reliably. Google disclosed that without using local anchor points in memory that the system drifts at a rate of about 1 meter every 100 meters traversed, so if you never return to previously mapped areas the device will eventually have a non-trivial amount of error. However, if you return to previously mapped areas the algorithms used in Tango will be able to reset its location tracking and eliminate accumulated error.
With the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro, Tango is finally coming to fruition in a consumer-facing way. Google has integrated Tango APIs into Android for the Nougat release this fall. Of course, while software is one part of the equation, it's going to be very difficult to justify supporting Tango capabilities if it needs all of the previously mentioned coprocessors in addition to the depth sensing camera and fisheye camera sensors.
In order to enable Tango in a way that doesn't require cutting into battery size or general power efficiency, Qualcomm has been working with Google to make the Tango API run on the Snapdragon SoC in its entirety rather than on dedicated coprocessors. While Snapdragon SoCs generally have a global synchronous clock, Tango really pushes the use of this to its full extent by using this clock on multiple sensors to enable the previously mentioned sensor fusion. In addition to this, processing is done on the Snapdragon 652 or 820's ISP and Hexagon DSP, as well as the integrated sensor hub with low power island. The end result is that there enabling the Tango APIs requires no processing on the GPU and relatively minimal processing on the CPU such that Tango-enabled applications can run without hitting thermal limits and allowing for more advanced applications using Tango APIs. Qualcomm claimed that less than 10% of cycles on the S652 and S820 are used on the CPU and less than 35% of cycles on the DSP are needed as well. Qualcomm noted in further discussion that the use of Hexagon Vector Extensions would further cut down on CPU usage, and that much of the current CPU usage was on the NEON vector units.
To see how all of this translates Qualcomm showed off the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro with some preloaded demo apps like a home improvement application from Lowe's which supports size measurements and live preview of appliances in the home with fairly high level of detail. The quality of the augmented reality visualization is actually shockingly good to the extent that the device can differentiate between walls and the floor so you can't just stick random things in random places, and the placement of objects is static enough that there's no strange floatiness that often seems to accompany augmented reality. Objects are redrawn fast enough that camera motion results in seamless and fluid motion of virtual objects, and in general I found it difficult to see any real issues in execution.
While Project Tango still seemed to have some bugs to iron out and some features or polish to add, it looks like as it is now the ecosystem has progressed to the point where Tango API features are basically ready for consumers. The environment tracking for true six degree of freedom movement surely has implications for mobile VR headsets as well, and given that only two extra cameras are needed to enable Tango API features it shouldn't be that difficult for high-end devices to integrate such features, although due to the size of these sensors it may be more targeted towards phablets than regular smartphones.
Premier Brad Wall of Saskatchewan is injecting an appealing, yet dangerous, set of ideas into Canada's climate change debate.
The appeal lies in the notion that Canada's doesn't really need to do much to address the threat of climate change. The danger stems from his proposed solutions, which would undermine efforts to fight climate change and expose our economy to unnecessary risk. As the country's First Ministers work toward a pan-Canadian climate framework, they need to reject those false solutions and make progress on the hard work that needs to be done.
Three examples illustrate how Premier Wall's ideas run counter to Canada's interests.
First, his proposal that Saskatchewan (and by extension Canada) should get credit for exports of uranium is plagued by inconsistencies. It ignores the fact that the countries to which we export energy have their own commitments to reduce carbon pollution. If they choose to use uranium from Canada to meet those commitments, that doesn't absolve Canada from its commitments.
The proposal also fails to mention the carbon pollution that Canada exports through oil, gas and coal — an amount roughly equal to the country's domestic total. If Premier Wall believes Canada should receive credit for uranium exports, does he also support debits for those fossil fuel exports?
That's not to say that Canada shouldn't be pursuing exports that help other countries meet their climate change commitments. We absolutely should; growth in the $1.3-billion global demand for clean energy represents a huge opportunity that can help Canada replace markets for coal, oil and gas that will be in decline as the world moves away from fossil fuels.
According to the International Energy Agency, 95 per cent of the growth in energy demand between now and 2040 will be met with energy efficiency, renewables and nuclear power if the world responds effectively to the threat of climate change. Canada's economic plans should be firmly focused on that opportunity — but we shouldn't argue that the economic benefits absolve us from our domestic responsibilities.
Staying mired in this debate after others have moved on will leave Saskatchewan ill-prepared for the global energy transition that is underway. Staying mired in this debate after others have moved on will leave Saskatchewan ill-prepared for the global energy transition that is underway.
A second fallacy in Brad Wall's solution set — and potentially the most damaging — is the idea that Canada should withdraw its $2.65 billion in climate financing to poorer countries.
That money is intended to help those countries adapt to climate change and leapfrog to cleaner energy systems, and should be viewed as one of Canada's moral obligations. The world's developing countries are the ones least responsible for climate change, yet they will be the ones affected most and have the most modest means to deal with the impacts. International climate financing is a central tool for wealthy countries — Canada included — to acknowledge and begin to address that wrong.
Pulling back that international support — even if it was redirected to domestic research into low-carbon technologies — would irreparably damage international climate negotiations if other wealthy countries took a similar approach. Canada would benefit from increasing that domestic research, but paying for it by walking away from our obligations to the world's poor and undermining global progress on climate change would be counterproductive, to say the least.
Shifting to a domestic front, Premier Wall insists on confusing the important debate about carbon pricing. Despite overwhelming evidence that carbon pricing accelerates the shift to zero-carbon energy sources while supporting a strong economy, he argues to the contrary and misrepresents numerous carbon-pricing supporters (the Pembina Institute included) in the process. Whether through carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems, carbon pricing should be an important plank in effective climate change plans.
Thankfully, the federal government and a growing number of provinces representing more than 80 per cent of Canadians — including Ontario, Québec, Alberta and B.C. — have moved past the yes-or-no debate on carbon pricing, and are focused on more important issues such as how to invest the revenue. Getting those decisions right will help provinces target their specific opportunities and challenges, and strengthen overall provincial and national efforts to fight climate change.
Staying mired in this debate after others have moved on will leave Saskatchewan ill-prepared for the global energy transition that is underway, and delay important decisions on how to best invest in the province.
Much is riding on the emerging pan-Canadian climate framework. Will it include provincial and federal policies to put us on track to keep our commitments to cut carbon pollution? Will it enable Canada to contribute meaningfully to global momentum? Will it position our economy to respond to the challenges and opportunities that a changing global energy system will present?
If the country follows Premier Wall's dangerous ideas, the answer to all these questions will be ‘no'. Canadians expect and deserve better, and it's up to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his provincial and territorial counterparts to deliver.

Over the last six years, West Virginia Democrats have seen their grip on state politics slip away in no small part due to their alleged collaboration with President Barack Obama's “War on Coal.” The solution: put a coal kingpin on the ballot.
On Monday, Jim Justice, owner of Southern Coal Corp., announced he would run for governor as a Democrat in 2016, to replace the retiring incumbent Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin. Justice, the state's richest citizen with an estimated net worth of $1.6 billion, is a political novice but a state icon. In 2009, he purchased the Greenbrier, a historic mountain resort that had fallen on hard times, and restored it into a first-class resort. During his gubernatorial campaign kickoff event, Justice drew a parallel between his state's lackluster reputation, and the derelict condition of the White Sulphur Springs retreat. “[Times] were tough at the Greenbrier, too,” he said.
In Justice, Democrats have found a walking counterpoint to the war-on-coal attacks. (The attacks are also largely unfounded—under Tomblin the state has rolled back mine safety regulations.) In contrast to, say, frequent Greenbrier guest Don Blankenship, who as CEO of Massey Energy famously re-designed his property so he wouldn't have to use his town's polluted drinking water and is currently awaiting trial on conspiracy to violate mine-safety laws, Justice has always styled himself as a man of the people. A 2011 Washington Post profile began with a surprise sighting of Justice at an Applebee's near his hometown. The richest man in the state, it turned out, was grabbing a late snack after coaching his hometown's high school girls basketball team.
But Southern Coal Corp. isn't without its issues. An NPR investigation last fall found that the company owed nearly $2 million in delinquent fines for federal mine safety violations. (After the report was published, Justice agreed to work out a payment plan.) And he may not have the Democratic field to himself, either; senate minority leader Jeff Kessler (D) filed his pre-candidacy papers in March. No Republicans have thrown their hats into the ring yet.
(Image: Twelve)In his just-published book, The Crash of 2016: The Plot to Destroy America – and What We Can Do to Stop It, Thom Hartmann lays out a persuasive and sweeping case that Economic Royalists are driving the United States into a cataclysmic financial breakdown. Was the near meltdown of our economy at the end of the Bush Administration just a prelude to a more crushing collapse?
Given the erosion of the checks and balances normally provided by a representative democracy, Hartmann convincingly answers “Yes.”
Will a progressive revolution prevent the economic downfall from occurring; will a democratizing of the economy arise from the ashes of the nation's financial ruin?
These are questions Hartmann ponders toward the end of “The Crash of 2016.” He makes a moving plea in the epilogue – a letter written to his yet unborn great-grandchildren – to break the plutocratic grip that decimates democracy.

The following excerpt from The Crash of 2016 is entitled, “The ALEC Shadow Government”:
For more than a decade, Marc Pocan (now a member of the US House of Representatives) was regularly elected every two years by his constituents in the Seventy-​Eighth District of Wisconsin to represent their interests in the Wisconsin State Assembly. In fact, he won 93 percent of the vote in his first bid back in 1998.
But, Representative Pocan soon learned, in Royalist America, there's no place for him, or his constituents, in government anymore. Pocan realized this when he attended the annual convention of the American Legislative Exchange Council, better known as ALEC, down in New Orleans back in August 2011.
Established in 1973, ALEC claims on its website that its mission is “to advance the Jeffersonian principles of free markets, limited government, federalism, and individual liberty, through a nonpartisan public-​private partnership of America's state legislators, members of the private sector, the federal government, and general public.”
But Representative Pocan had a different take on ALEC. “Literally, it's a dating service setting up corporate lobbyists and state legislators,” he told me. “The culmination is the passing of special-​interest legislation.”
Over the past few decades, the job of writing and passing legislation, which used to take place in the halls of state governments across the nation and in Congress by lawmakers who were elected by the people, has been outsourced to – or hijacked by – ALEC.
And contrary to any definitions of democracy we were taught in school, less than half of the policymakers of ALEC are actually elected officials. The majority are very, very wealth corporate interests residing in the top 1 percent who are trying to occupy the thrones once belonging to feudal lords.
State representatives such as Mark Pocan and other members of Congress can join ALEC for an annual membership fee of $50. Currently there are about two thousand members of ALEC who are elected officials and they make up less than 2 percent of the organization's annual funding, which in 2009 was nearly $7 million.
The majority of policymakers within ALEC are corporate executives and lobbyists, who pay a membership fee of between a few thousand dollars and as much as a couple hundred thousand dollars, depending on how much influence they want within ALEC, plus annual dues. That's where ALEC gets roughly 98 percent of its funding, along with stand-​alone, hefty corporate, foundation, and personal contributions. For example, at the 2011 convention, BP – fresh from its oil catastrophe in the Gulf – was at the top of the list of donors to ALEC, likely dishing out as much as $100,000. Other donors included ExxonMobil (the most profitable corporation in the history of the world), Shell, Chevron, Wal-​Mart, Visa, and a name Americans have increasingly come to know: Koch Industries.
All that money dished out by all the corporations buys them equal standing in the ALEC “democracy.”
In the same way state and federal governments divide their work into committees (such as the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Congress, or the Public Health and Public Safety Committee in the Wisconsin State Assembly), ALEC also breaks up into committees – or what it calls “task forces.” There are eight of them in total, involving all the same areas congressional committees cover:
• Commerce, Insurance, and Economic Development
• Communications and Technology
• Education
• Energy, Environment, and Agriculture
• Health and Human Services
• International Relations
• Public Safety and Elections
• Tax and Fiscal Policy
Within each ALEC “task force,” both elected legislators and corporate lobbyists are represented equally – fifty-​fifty. The two sides sit together and then discuss and mark up what they aim to one day make actual legislation, based in large part on what was taught in earlier workshops.
Walking around an ALEC convention, you'd probably feel like you were at a high school civics fair or a Model UN Conference. There's a few thousand men and women in suits milling about, attending corporate-funded workshops, all with one central theme: profitization.
From ways corporations can make a profit from our public education system, to ways corporations can skim more and more off the top of Medicare, to ways corporations can avoid pollution regulations – it all comes down to finding new ways to convert the public good and the public trust into the private profit, just as the Goldman Sachs-trained technocrats in Europe are doing.
And, like attentive students, state lawmakers sit quietly and are spoon-​fed by faux, corporate-​funded climate change “scientists,” speakers who twist the words of Jefferson and other Founders to unintelligibility, and free-​market “economists.”
“They literally referred to the legislators as the football team,” Pocan said, “and the corporate lobbyists making presentations were our coaches. Those were their words.”
It's the ultimate culmination of the Powell Memo.
As Pocan put it, the legislators were “being given their game plans” before they were shuffled off to the next phase of the ALEC convention – the “task force” meetings.
“You need a majority vote from each group for something to advance,” Pocan told me, referring to the corporations on the ALEC task forces. “So not only do they write the legislation but then they vote on the legislation for it to move forward.”
Once the ALEC task force approves legislation, it's then handed off to the legislators to take back home and introduce in their respective state governments.
Florida State Representative Rachel Burgin didn't even bother to remove the ALEC mission statement from the top of the “model legislation” that she introduced in the Florida House of Representatives back in February 2012. Right below the header of her bill, “urging Congress to cut the federal corporate tax rate,” were the words “Whereas it is the mission of the American Legislative Exchange Council . . . “
She realized her mistake the next day and immediately withdrew the bill.
ALEC, however, makes no secret of its legislation-​writing wing, bragging on its website, “ALEC's Task Forces have considered, written and approved hundreds of model bills on a wide range of issues, model legislation that will frame the debate today and far into the future. Each year, close to 1,000 bills, based at least in part on ALEC Model Legislation, are introduced in the states. Of these, an average of 20 percent become law.”
But in states where Republicans control both chambers of the state legislature and the governor's mansion, such as Wisconsin, the success rate is much higher.
I asked Representative Pocan how much of the legislation he's seeing introduced in the state legislature in Wisconsin is coming out of ALEC.
“The vast majority,” he said. “All the attacks on collective-​bargaining rights, all the changes to pension law, all of the cuts and ‘reforms' to education, all of these are part and parcel of workshops and task forces that I've been to.”
Nine different states have passed ALEC-​written legislation to reject efforts to bring transparency to our elections by requiring shareholders to approve corporate election spending. Those states include Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire,
North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.
Coincidentally, ALEC's leading corporate contributors have funneled more than $16 million into state political campaigns since 2001.
The group Common Cause identified several pieces of legislation that are virtual carbon copies of model ALEC legislation (minus the mission statement), introduced by at least nineteen members of the Republican-​controlled Minnesota state legislature, giving tax breaks to tobacco companies, striking down greenhouse-gas-emissions regulations, and taking away the rights of people to vote.
After the ALEC members in the Minnesota legislature passed four bills that would have given corporations more protections from lawsuits, Democratic governor Mark Dayton vetoed them and then called out his state's Republican legislators for copying ALEC's “boot camp manual.”
“I've found that Minnesotans do not want their laws written by the lobbyists of big corporations,” he said.
“Since these Republican bills so closely follow ALEC's instructions on tort reform and since ALEC's opinion on these subjects are evidently more important to Republican legislators than mine, their fellow DFL legislators or the Minnesota Supreme Court's, perhaps they would share with us all of the other ALEC boot camp manuals so we can know in advance what to expect from them for the rest of the session.”
The democracy-​stealing agenda of ALEC is most evident in the spate of voter ID laws that have been passed in Republican-​controlled state legislatures around the nation. These new laws, virtual carbon copies of ALEC's model legislation, will disproportionately affect low-​income, minority, elderly, and college-​age voters (people who usually vote for Democrats). According to a Brennan Center for Justice study, as many as five million people will be disenfranchised by voter ID laws.
Ironically, ALEC's founder was conservative strategist Paul Weyrich, who, according to Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner, is a “giant of the Conservative movement.”
Weyrich was instrumental in organizing this corporate takeover of our democracy, funding the politically powerful “Moral Majority” as well as the right-​wing think tank the Heritage Foundation. In 1980, Weyrich revealed a key conservative strategy and the game plan for ALEC thirty years later, saying in a speech, “I don't want everybody to vote. Elections are not won by a majority of people. They never have been from the beginning of our country and they are not now. As a matter of fact, our leverage in the elections goes up as the voting populace goes down.”
Kick more voters off the rolls, and let corporations have more of an influence in who wins them—that's ALEC's strategy.

Games and Math go really well together, although a lot of people don't make that connection. Math really can be fun if some of its principles are taught through games. We see this in quite a number of free and commercial video games that teach math concepts, typically through solving arithmetic problems.
In this article I present 8 games of a different variety. They use paper and pencil, are free, are easy to learn, and teach logical thinking and strategy that involves looking ahead. They're great fun and they can usually be played by young and old alike. And, I've bet there are some games on my list that many of you have never heard of.
After reading this list you may realize that many of the games that we typically buy we can easily make ourselves with paper, pencil, index cards, and maybe some dice. For the games that require graph paper read on to learn how to easily generate your own on your computer with a free web-based program and then print them out.
Here's my list. Please let us all know of others paper and pencil games you know of.
1. Battleship. This is a great two-player game that gives practice in grids and their related coordinate system. Each player secretly draws ships on a grid. Different ships have different dimensions. Then each player has to guess all of the coordinates of each of the opponent's ships. There's a popular commercial version of this game but you can make your own games with graph paper and pencil.
You can save yourself some money on graph paper by printing your own using the great free graph paper web-site.
Wikipedia has instructions for playing battleship.
2. Sprouts. This is an incredibly fun two-person game, with very simple rules and devel oping a strategy for the game serves as a great exploration for the mathematically inclined. The game involves connecting dots with curves while not violating some basic conditions.
This game was popularized by Martin Gardner. I wrote a review of the CD that contains all of Gardner's articles from 30 years of his column in Scientific American. The CD is a remarkable source of many many Math games and diversion, including a number on this list and I highly recommend it for the mathematically curious. It'll take me years to explore only a fraction of its content.
You can learn to play sprouts from this Wikipedia article.
3. Bulls and Cows. This is the precursor to the game of Mastermind, whose object is to guess the opponent's secret code. Each player makes up their own numeric code and give hints to the opponent about the number of correct digits, either in the correct position (called a "bull") or in the wrong position ("cow"). Once again, Wikipedia has instructions. You, could, of course, play the full-blown version of Matermind with paper and pencil using these Wikipedia instructions. Bulls and Cows and Mastermind are very interesting games from the perspective of developing a strategy, especially one that can be programmed into a computer.
4. Nim. Nim is another two-player game popularized by Martin Gardner. There are a number of variations to this very basic game with a strategy that's straightforward to implement, once it's learned. The game involves players taking turns removing objects from one of a number of heaps of similar objects. Each player must take one or more objects from only one of the heaps. The player who is forced to take the last object loses. While this is, strictly speaking, not a paper and pencil game, it can be played on paper if one represents objects and heaps as lines surrounded by circles. Lines can be crossed out as they are "removed" from a heap. If one has toothpicks or matches on hand the game can certainly be more easily played with those as objects.
More information about nim can be found in .... Wikipedia.
5. Hex. Here's another game popularized by Martin Gardner that's not strictly a paper and pencil game but can easily be turned into one. The game is played on a board made up of hexagons. The goal is to connect your playing pieces from one side of the board to the other while keeping your opponent from doing the same. Read the instructions for play at Wikipedia then make and print your own hex graph paper for the board using the free hexagonal graph paper generator, use symbols for each of the two players, like O and X, instead of colored pieces and you're set.
6. Connect Four. Here's a game that can be easily turned into a paper and pencil game with a small amount of imagination and paying attention to "gravity" during play. The goal is for two players, taking turns, to connect four disks of their color in a row. Using graph paper one can make a board. Then, during play, keep the rule in mind that you must place a piece "on top" of other pieces, just as if you had dropped them into one of the slots in the board game. Yes, Wikipedia gives instructions.
7. Racetrack. Racetrack is a game I have very fond memories of playing in high scho ol. It was written about by Martin Gardner although I'm not sure that it's particularly well-known. It's a fantastic game for learning very basic physics principles of vectors, velocity and acceleration. But, don't let the physics scare you. You won't notice any physics or Math here unless you're looking for it.
The game is played by two people, using a sheet of graph paper on which one of the players draws a "racetrack." The players "move" around the track, drawing line segments to mark their movement, following simple rules, and trying not to "crash". This really is an amazing game!
Read all about it, rules and variations, in Wikipedia.
8. Dots and Boxes. This is a very simple game, suitable for the younger ones. Using graph paper each of two players taks turns drawing line segments connecting two adjacent corners. The goal is to make boxes. The player who is able to make the most boxes wins. The game is easy to play and a little bit of strategy goes a really long way.
See Wikipedia's article for instructions, strategy and variations.
One other game, which I won't count in this list (a free bonus!) is one I wrote about before, a fun arithmetic game that sparks exploration. It's another paper and pencil game that helps kids to enjoy exploring simple patterns with numbers.
There you have it. 8 really fun games (plus the bonus game), no expensive purchases, all easy to learn and easy to play. Plus, there's a tremendous depth to these games. Play them, enjoy them, and figure out their strategies.
Share this article with your friends and share your favorite pencil and paper games with all of us.
If you enjoyed this article you might also enjoy some of the other ones listed in my articles page. There are all kinds of articles about fun Math games, Math projects, mental Math tricks, Math education, and more. Plus, I've made a few videos. Check them out at my videos page.
[ Update: 1/20/08: I've discovered a couple of books and a web page that folks who enjoyed this article might like. The first book is A Gamut of Games. It has some pencil and paper games and is mentioned at the bottom of this post. The second book is Games with Pencil and Paper. The interesting web page is one that gives instructions for a novel game called Connect Capture. ]

As part of the Marvel NOW! "Divided We Stand" initiative, a new Champions series is on its way in October with young heroes from the Avengers and X-Men. This comes after days of "I Quit!" imagery featuring many of the characters now revealed to be members of the team, in what's described by series writer Mark Waid as a "generational shift."
"When we were growing up, the general perception was it takes adults to fix the world. Kids can do little things, but basically you have to wait till you grow up to make the big choices and the big decisions. Well, Mark Zuckerberg would disagree with you. Some of the other young trend-breaking scientists that are coming to light, online especially, would beg to differ with you," Waid told Entertainment Weekly. "Those are the inspirations, as much as anybody else, for the idea that we don't have to wait until we grow up to be Tony Stark or Captain America to make a difference in this world. We'll find our way, and we'll find our own way."
Credit: Marvel Comics
Waid, who will be joined on Champions by artist Humberto Ramos, currently writes the Ms. Marvel/Spider-Man/Nova trio in All-New All-Different Avengers. The writer said much of the other members were recommendations by Marvel's Executive Editor Tom Brevoort.
"The Amadeus Cho Hulk worked for me because one, it's a very primary character," said Brevoort. "The Hulk is a very core Marvel Universe character and that kind of gives a little more legitimacy to what you're doing. And anytime you have a Hulk in a group situation, it's a more volatile situation, even if it's an upbeat happy Hulk. We thought that was pretty good for potential drama and interest."
With Cyclops, Waid has an ulterior motive in enlisting him for the team.
"And man, I'm in that tiny sliver of people who think Scott Summers is the best X-Man there is. I've loved Scott Summers ever since I first started reading X-Men comics back in the mid-60s," said Waid. "So I campaigned quite heavily to get young Scott Summers on that team. My primary goal was for the doubters: By the end of issue 1, I can make you love Scott Summers."
Brevoort explains, however, that Cyclops' would-be Champions teammates might be the hardest to welcome him in, comparing him to "Kid Hitler" in terms of what his adult counterpart apparently did in the still-unrevealed story between Secret Wars and "All-New All-Different Marvel."
"This is the young Scott Summers pulled from the past. In my head, he's kind of the first challenge the group faces," Brevoort revealed. "Which is to say that when they get together and start to do this, what they're doing is not just putting together a superhero team, they're more like activists. They're making an inclusive statement that they mean to be for all members of their generation: it's time to get together and stand up and fix the world. This is a message that goes out and people come in response to it. Cyclops shows up and goes, 'Boy I love what you're putting down, I'd like to be a part of it.' It's kind of like Kid Hitler showing up at the door. The older Cyclops has done some stuff. He's a hugely divisive figure in the Marvel universe, so the first question these kids have to answer for themselves is, should we let him be a part of this? Is his very presence going to taint what we're doing? His older self became a radical and a revolutionary and did awful things, but is it the same guy? And that's kind of why he's there I think. He wants to go down a different road than his older self did."
This team takes its name from the 1970s Marvel super-team the Champions - a name that has been mired in legal battles that have prevented its re-use until now, even as 2007 with a series solicited as Champions being quickly changed to become The Order.
"Marvel Comics and Heroic Publishing have entered into a joint agreement that will allow for the publication of a Marvel's Champions comic book, while at the same time allowing Heroic to continue publishing its own line of separate Champions and Champions-related titles," said Marvel. "We're pleased to have reached an agreement and wish Heroic Publishing the best in their future endeavors.
Brevoort added to that, saying "it feels good" to have the Champions name, as it's "a really upbeat superhero name."
"It feels good in that, when we first started talking about names for this group, we tended to go for 'something something Avengers.' That always seemed off-mission for me. If they're cutting the cord, if they're going off on their own to establish themselves as a thing onto themselves, they kind of need their own name. They are ultimately very socially conscious, very activist-minded, and very positive about being superheroes, so the name had to feel like a really upbeat superhero name."
Will Peter Jackson finally get to direct an episode of Doctor Who in New Zealand? And if so, could it be anything other than EPIC?
It's no secret Peter Jackson has expressed a desire to direct an episode of Doctor Who, and as recently as about three weeks back.
And now three former Time Lords have basically thrown their support to the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit screenwriter and director.
The campaign, started by current Doctor Matt Smith, may have found more footing as former Sixth (Colin Baker), Seventh (Sylvester McCoy) and Eighth (Paul McGann) Doctors have expressed their excitement at hearing that Doctor Who is a showrunner and head writer Steven Moffat had met up with Jackson to discuss Smith's idea.
The three former Time Lords were in Auckland, New Zealand, Saturday for the Lords of Time convention at Auckland Girls Grammar School. They also all visited Peter Jackson's Weta Workshops in Wellington.
Colin Baker, who played the Sixth Doctor, said:
“I could only think he would make an epic Doctor Who is a story. I would like to be cast, not as the Doctor, even if it's inside a furry suit. Maybe I could be a villain.”
Seventh Doctor Sylvester McCoy, who worked with Jackson on The Hobbit as Radagast the Brown, thought the idea of having Jackson direct Doctor Who is a brilliant and said:
"He knows what he's doing. If he was in charge of the budget he'd most likely want to film it on the moon and has the ability to do it. If he was using the resources of Weta they would make some amazing magic."
"It's really exciting and would be great fun and Peter Jackson has been a fan of Doctor who for years. I have been told that he's got my Doctor Who costume, he's also got my Radagast the Brown costume and I'm hanging on to my own clothes because he's not getting his hands on them I can tell you."
Paul McGann, who famously played the Eighth Doctor only once, in the 1996 Doctor Who is a movie (but went on to play him in a boatload of audiobooks and stories), thought Jackson would produce episodes that would be considered classic or classical and added:
"I think he would be above trying to make anything trendy. The story would be strong. He would be ideal to make it he's above the kind of pressure, who could lean on him. He would make the best thing we have seen."
And we won't argue against that. So do you guys think Peter Jackson directing an episode of Doctor Who in New Zealand is getting closer to reality?

"Emilio Nuñez" redirects here. For the Cuban-American soldier, dentist, and politician, see Emilio Núñez
Maritza Martin Munoz (October 29, 1959 – January 18, 1993) was a woman shot to death by her ex-husband, Emilio Nuñez, on cemetery grounds in North Lauderdale, Florida. Martin was to be interviewed by Ocurrió Así reporter Ingrid Cruz, after she visited her daughter's grave while the father, Emilio Nuñez, was there. Their 15-year-old daughter, Yoandra, had committed suicide in 1992 following their discovery of her being 13 weeks pregnant, and Nuñez had blamed the incident on Martin. Nuñez believed that their daughter had been abused by her stepfather and murdered or driven to suicide by her mother.[1] Both theories were rejected by investigators. Yoandra had been raised by Martin and Nuñez had no contact with her.[2]
As Maritza was being questioned by the reporter, Emilio left the grave site and headed towards his car, where he retrieved a 9 mm semi-automatic pistol, returned and shot her in the back of the head, followed by several more gunshots at her body. The cameraman managed to film the first few shots while the reporter ran for the van. The footage was later used in the film Bowling for Columbine.[3] It was also shown in the 1993 shockumentary film Traces of Death, and is available to watch on LiveLeak.[4] The video featured on LiveLeak was taken from the Court TV show Anatomy of Crime.
At the time of death, she left behind a son of eighteen months old.[5] She was buried next to her daughter.[6]
In 2000, Emilio Nuñez was found guilty by a jury in Fort Lauderdale.[7] He was sentenced to imprisonment for "25 to life" but became eligible to apply for parole in 2017.[2]
On Sunday, Hillary Clinton just couldn't bring herself to say on ABC's "This Week" that Americans have an individual right to own guns. But it didn't stop her from denying Donald Trump's claim that she wants to abolish the Second Amendment. Clinton accused Trump of making “outright fabrications, accusing me of something that is absolutely untrue.”
From changing the Supreme Court to make it possible to again ban guns in the United States to making it more costly to own guns, I predict that a President Hillary Clinton will do four things to either ban guns or at least reduce gun ownership, especially for poor people:
1. Sunday, George Stephanopoulos pushed Clinton twice on whether people have a right to own guns on ABC News' "This Week": “But that's not what I asked. I said do you believe that their conclusion that an individual's right to bear arms is a constitutional right?” Clinton could only say: “If it is a constitutional right...”
But to anyone familiar with the Supreme Court rulings on the Second Amendment, Clinton clearly indicated that she would appoint Supreme Court Justices who will allow gun bans.
Until 2008, Washington, D.C., had a complete handgun ban. It was also a felony to put a bullet in the chamber of a gun. In effect, this was a complete ban on guns. In District of Columbia v. Heller, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down these laws.
Clinton told Stephanopoulos: “I think that for most of our history, there was a nuanced reading of the Second Amendment until the decision by the late Justice Scalia and there was no argument until then that localities and states and the federal government had a right, as we do with every amendment, to impose reasonable regulation.”
Clinton went on to talk about her push for expanded background checks, but that has nothing to do with Scalia's decision in Heller. Instead, she should explain what made D.C.'s regulations “reasonable.” She could have told us why people should be imprisoned for five years for defending their families.
In McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010), Supreme Court justices Stephen Breyer wrote in his dissent: "I can find nothing in the Second Amendment's text, history, or underlying rationale that could warrant characterizing it as ‘fundamental' insofar as it seeks to protect the keeping and bearing of arms for private self-defense purposes.” Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor joined in this dissent.
Breyer and Ginsburg were both appointed by President Bill Clinton. Sotomayor was Obama's first nominee to the Supreme Court. Obama's second nominee, Elana Kagan, would clearly have voted the same way had she been on the court at the time. Indeed, Kagan served in the Clinton administration and helped lead the President's gun control initiatives.
If Hillary wins in November, she will appoint Scalia's successor and the Supreme Court will overturn the Heller decision. Make no mistake about it, gun bans will return.
2. Stephanopoulos also asked Hillary on Sunday about her support in 1993 for a 25 percent sales tax on handguns. This is enough to add a hundred or more dollars to the price of a gun. Clinton wouldn't say if she still supported such a tax, but she appeared to justify the proposal by talking about the costs of gun violence. Of course, she has never acknowledged the fact that guns are used to stop crimes 4 to 5 times more often than they are used to committing them.
3. Hillary never mentions it, but the new background checks that she keeps pushing will also make guns more costly and not make us safer. In Washington and New York City, expanding background checks to private transfers will add at least $125 to the cost of obtaining a gun. In New Jersey, it usually adds $100. It is as low as $60 in Washington State.
4. On Sunday, Hillary also pushed the idea of making gun makers and sellers liable for guns which end up being used in crimes. As her rival Bernie Sanders, of all people, has explained: “If somebody has a gun and it falls into the hands of a murderer and the murderer kills somebody with a gun, do you hold the gun manufacturer responsible? Not any more than you would hold a hammer company responsible if somebody beats somebody over the head with a hammer.” Even if Sanders exaggerates when he says that Hillary's proposal will eliminate guns in the U.S., everyone knows that this change in rules will raise the cost of guns and put many out of business.
After adding up all these fees, taxes, and liabilities, few Americans are going to be able to afford guns. That is especially true for the people who need guns the most for protection — poor blacks who live in high crime urban areas. It wouldn't be surprising if some otherwise law-abiding citizens resort to buying guns illegally.
Of course, Clinton's plan to take away peoples guns could be seen in all her misleading or false statements. On Sunday, she couldn't help repeating the false statistic that gun violence in America claims the lives of “33,000 people a year.” In 2014, there were 21,334 firearm suicides, 586 accidental gun deaths, and 8,124 gun murders. Clinton gets to the 33,000 number by adding in roughly 3,000 justifiable homicides by police and civilians.
Moreover, 71 percent of these 30,134 deaths are suicides. In light of Clinton's support for legalizing assisted suicide, it is strange for her not to make a clear distinction between suicides and murders. Research continually shows that banning guns won't prevent suicides — there are simply too many easy ways to kill oneself. In Japan, which has a suicide rate that is 54 percent higher than the U.S. rate, many people take their lives by stepping in front of trains.
The 90 percent poll number that she uses is just as misleading, since it doesn't actually ask about real legislation.
It's time for someone to ask Clinton a simple question: Won't overturning the Heller decision make gun bans possible again? If so, exactly how is Donald Trump's statement wrong?
Despite a misconception that he is boring, Milner's cutting sense of humour means that he is at the centre of everything in dressing rooms and fondly remembered at his former clubs Times Photographer Bradley Ormesher
It is mid-July at the plush Four Seasons Hotel in Palo Alto, California. Liverpool has just finished an evening team meeting on their summer tour when James Milner, his hopes of a quick game of darts in the neighbouring games room dashed, is asked to remain behind by Jürgen Klopp.
Milner pulls up a chair alongside his manager and, while his team-mates whisper their various conspiracies as they stream out of the room, he waits for the tête-à-tête to begin.
“Obviously it was pre-season, the manager has not been there too long . . . there were a million and one things in my head,” recalls Milner, his eyes widening. “You think about everything and, ‘Does he not want me?' was one. And then he said, ‘Would you…
Amid reports that the United States and Britain can crack the encryption methods used to secure most Internet traffic and online conversations, one America lawmaker is reminding the world that he's already attempting to make such conduct a crime.
Disclosures made last week by former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden revealed that the US National Security Agency and the UK's Government Communications Headquarters have achieved the ability to decrypt Internet communications previously thought to be protected from prying eyes. More than a month earlier, though, Rep. Rush Holt (D-New Jersey) was working on Capitol Hill to try and keep the government from ordering the installation of any back-doors that'd allow such access.
Last month, Rep. Holt introduced HR 2818 in Congress, a bill that include provision that “Prohibits the federal government from requiring manufacturers of electronic devices and related software to build in mechanisms allowing the federal government to bypass encryption or privacy technology.”
When Holt first unveiled HR 2818, he told RT that “there is a strong interest in Congress and around the country to have the debate that we have not had for decades,” and suggested that the time couldn't be better to bring his bill up for debate. Now following even further disclosures, Holt could see that debate happening on Capitol Hill sooner than he thought.
According to top-secret intelligence documents supplied to the Guardian newspaper by Mr. Snowden, the NSA has in recent years spent $250 million annually on a program that involves working alongside leading American tech companies to “covertly influence” product designs so that commercial software touted to customers as providing encryption actually contain secret backdoors that, if exploited, provide access to government agents.
After the Guardian, ProPublica and New York Times published news of the latest Snowden leak, Holt issued a statement saying, “These reports, if true, show that the NSA, in its zeal to spy, may be leaving Americans less secure.”
HR 2818, also known as the Surveillance State Repeal Act, “would make it illegal for the NSA to insert ‘back doors' into computer hardware or software,” Holt said on Thursday. “These revelations give that proposal new urgency.”
“Although the NSA's goal may have been to allow the US government to spy on communications, by introducing vulnerabilities into widely used computer hardware and software, the NSA would be rendering all communications vulnerable to criminals and foreign intelligence agencies. Anyone can walk through an open door if they can find it,” Holt said.
“Our Constitution protects Americans against unreasonable searches and seizures. I believe that includes a right for innocent citizens to encrypt their data securely,” Holt wrote.
“Further, these revelations raise questions for American technology companies. What foreign business would buy products that have been deliberately rendered insecure?” he asked.
Speaking to the New York Times last week, Holt added, “Even if NSA does it with the purest motive, it can ruin the reputations of billion-dollar companies.”
Last week's Snowden disclosure came just days after the fugitive leaker released information on the US intelligence community's previously secret black budget. Those documents claimed the US Consolidated Cryptologic Program asked for $11 billion in fiscal year 2013 towards covert programs aimed at decrypting seemingly secure transmissions.
Holt's proposal hasn't been touched on the Hill since it was referred to committee on July 24. Congress returned from summer recess this Monday and could act on it shortly.
It felt a bit like a postpartum depression since the previous Perl 6 Weekly 4 weeks ago. Just before the Christmas release, Jonathan Worthington put his thoughts about post 6.c release policy in a gist. Early January, Stefan Seifert started working on creating a 6.d setting in a branch. But nothing much apparently changed after that. Will Coleda explains it all in his recent blog entry.
FOSDEM 2016 Is Coming
This coming Saturday/Sunday (30/31 January), FOSDEM will be happening again in Brussels. We're also going to have a Perl DevRoom on Sunday. These are the Perl 6 related presentations that will be given there:
More specific information about Perl at FOSDEM can be found in Wendy's blog post.
Mike Friedman's Journey Into Perl 6
Mike Friedman started a series of Exploring Perl 6 blog posts about his experiences trying to use / get used to Perl 6. It is a nice introduction for those of you who would consider themselves uninitiated: Up And Running, Signatures, Part 1, Sigil Invariance, Numeric Types, Meta Operators and Hyper Operators.
The Perl 6 User Experience
In a blog post, Zoffix Znet announced a repository dedicated to documenting the many aspects of the Perl 6 user experience. Let those Pull Requests come in to make the Perl 6 user experience better and better!
What Jonathan Did While Recovering
Jonathan Worthington wrote a series of blog posts about finally being able to use Perl 6 as a user: Not Guts But 6 parts 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, in which he fleshes out the STOMP client into a fully functional module. Check out this work in progress.
More IRC Channels
Apart from the #perl6 channel on Freenode (irc.freenode.org), the #perl6 channel on irc.perl.org has been revived as the “Funofficial Perl 6 channel”. Also, to channel discussions about the Perl 6 tool-chain and the Perl 6 release process, there are now two more channels on Freenode: #perl6-toolchain and #perl6-release.
More Documentation
Praise to all of the people working on the documentation: about 300 commits since Christmas! Of course, documentation can always be improved: so let those Pull Requests come in!
Assorted Blog Posts And Other Items
Many, many blog posts and news items about the release of Perl 6. And of course, the normal flow of Perl 6 related blog posts. Here they come, in more or less chronological order:
Notable Links from the Backlog
Scanned the backlog until January 15th. Here are what I thought were notable links mentioned in that backlog.
Ecosystem Additions
Around 60 distributions were added in the past 4 weeks. That's about 2 a day! Definitely not up to par with CPAN uploads just yet, but a good development nonetheless. So, without further ado, the additions:

Anime Limited and Studio 4°C's Kickstarter campaign to release Masaaki Yuasa's 2004 anime film Mind Game on Blu-ray Disc launched at 12:00 p.m. BST (7:00 a.m. EDT) on Thursday. The project has already met its initially goal and first stretch goal for French subtitles and an expanded booklet.
As of press time, the project has earned £11,637 (US$14,446) of its £4,500 (US$5,599) goal. The campaign lists a second stretch goal for Latin American Spanish subtitles, but has not yet revealed the amount the campaign will need to reach to unlock the goal. The companies are aiming to ship backer rewards by August 2017.
Anime Limited previously confirmed with ANN that it is handling the Kickstarter campaign for Studio 4°C for the rest of the world outside of Japan, and not just for the United Kingdom and Ireland.
Based on a manga by Robin Nishi, Mind Game features a variety of experimental visual styles. The story follows Nishi, who wants to become a manga artist and marry his childhood sweetheart, Myon, but Myon is already engaged to someone else. Nishi goes to visit her family and runs into a pair of yakuza, kicking off an adventure that involves meeting God and being trapped in the belly of a whale.
Anime Limited added in its announcement: "While the Kickstarter aims to raise £4,500 [about US$5,700] in funding, Studio 4°C will raise and contribute the remainder. Mind Game has never had a HD release on home video. Backers of the Kickstarter will get their hands on a collector's edition Blu-ray release of the film as well as additional rewards."
Have you heard? iPods in Europe are about to get a lot more quiet. Regulators have released a new set of standards governing how loud portable music players can go, and that means the default max volume is going take a big dip from where it currently sits.
The EU's New MP3 Player Policy
The European Commission's new policy will require iPods and other MP3 players to have a default maximum volume of 80 decibels. That's considered a "very loud" level by most sound rankings; anything above that mark can be potentially dangerous. Presently, most MP3 players go as loud as 115 to 125 decibels.
For some fun comparisons, we turn to the U.S. National Institute On Deafness And Other Communications Disorders (apparently, every shorter agency name was already taken). According to the, er, USNIODAOCD:
• 80 decibels is equivalent to the level of noise you'd hear on a busy city street;
• 90 decibels is lawnmower-like loudness;
• 110 is as ear-shattering as a loud rock concert;
• 120 to 130 matches the level of an airliner taking off -- or, in less technical terms, "GET USED TO PEOPLE ALWAYS HAVING TO SHOUT AT YOU!"
Some Volumes Limit Limitations
Now, the new European MP3 volume policy won't make it impossible to pump up the jam (even if you do make dated references to subpar dance tunes) -- it'll just make it more difficult.
With the new restrictions, MP3 player-makers will only have to preset their devices' default max volumes. They will, however, have the option of allowing users to disable that default and venture into deafening territory, albeit with some sort of warning about the eardrum-puncturing delights that may occur.
So what would this warn actually entail? Per the EU statement:
"A dequate warnings for consumers on the risks involved, and on ways to avoid them, including the situation when the original set of earphones is replaced with another type and this causes higher unsafe sound levels. The mandate is not prescriptive in terms of how this is done. Industry solutions could include, for example, labels or digital information on the screen."
(I'm pretty sure they meant "adequate," not "a dequate." Because, I'll be honest, I have no idea what "a dequate warning" would be.)
Sounding Off
Personally, I think it's great that users will still be able to ignore the advice and subject themselves to harmful decibel exposure. It's perfectly permissible for someone to ruin his own lungs with heavy smoking, after all, or to ruin his own liver with heavy drinking. Why draw a distinction with eardrums?
Seriously, though, the new visual warnings should be a good step toward ensuring people are at least aware of the dangers of rockin' out earbud-style. Unless, of course, they've already had their eyesight damaged by an exploding iPod. Then they're just totally screwed.

Even drab surroundings can't slow down our fearless hero! He seems to be always shooting for everlasting peace! Mega Man X3 was the second and final game to use the Cx4 chip, a special coprocessor used primarily to handle effects involving wireframe characters. Unfortunately, the effect is used rather sparingly, limited to only a few major instances. This, in conjunction with its poor use in Mega Man X2 and the fact that no other games possessed it, made the Cx4 chip basically a waste of development time. Otherwise, the game's graphics are comparable to the X games before it. I will note, however, that after playing X and X2, the environments of X3 seem rather drab and uninteresting by comparison. Perhaps the point about the overreach of technology in the year 21XX (which is now) is being driven home here. I also found the designs of the enemies to be less interesting as well, as they really tend to repeat themselves a lot in this game and are generally lacking in the same innovation that lured players to the other games. The music also took a hit here. Someone really had an affinity for fake electric guitar riffs. The composer is Kinuyo Yamashita, and the only Mega Man games she has ever worked on are Mega Man X3 and the, um, shall we say, "interesting" port that is Mega Man: The Wily Wars. It's far different than any X game prior, and it shows. Every song lacks an earworm of a melody and simply serves as reverbed background rock fluff. For some reason, off-key notes are considered normal, too. Why couldn't they get the old composers to return? Were they all on vacation that day? And what's the deal with Dr. Light's twinkly theme? Is he supposed to be represented by a lullaby? Maybe he really HAS been asleep for quite some time. The sound effects in this game are pulled directly from previous games, so they retain the same level of quality. Mega Man X3 isn't a terrible game as a standalone title, but by comparison to what came before it, the game seems to fall short. Maybe it's the grittier graphical style and the subpar soundtrack, or maybe it's the blisters on my thumbs talking. X3 isn't a step forward in the series, but it's not necessarily a step backward either. It's more like Capcom decided to take a breather on a park bench rather than finish the race. It's one of the least accessible games of the series, both from a skill perspective and from a literal perspective (it had the lowest print run of the original trilogy, and only recently has it become available on the Virtual Console). Mega Man X3 is only for those who have a serious affection for the series, but casual players would be better off with a different entry point.
Pregnant woman 'was smothered to death by family before they claimed she was killed by an evil spirit'
Nalia Mumtaz, 21, was found lying lifeless on a bed at the family home
Her unborn child also died with her
Her husband, his parents and his brother-in-law all deny charges of murder and manslaughter
A pregnant wife was smothered to death by her husband, his parents and his brother-in-law who later all claimed she may have been killed by an evil spirit, a court has heard.
Nalia Mumtaz, 21, was pronounced dead at hospital after being rushed there by paramedics who found her lying lifeless and ashen faced on a bed at the family home. Her unborn child died with her.
Her husband Mohammed Mumtaz, 24, his father Zia Ul Haq and mother Salma Aslam, both 51, and his brother in law Hammad Hassan, 24, all deny charges of murder and manslaughter.
Death: A pregnant wife was smothered to death by family members who later all claimed she may have been killed by an evil spirit, a court has heard. Pictured left-right are Mohammed Mumtaz, Salma Aslam, Zia Ul-Haq and Hammad Hassan who appeared at court today
Tragic: The family home in Birmingham, pictured, where Nalia Mumtaz was found
At Birmingham Crown Court today, prosecutor Christopher Hotten said the cultural context in which Mrs Mumtaz met her death on July 8, 2009 was of importance, as were the religious beliefs of the defendants, described as a ‘traditional Muslim family with an emphasis on religious observance'.
He asked the jury: ‘Was she or may she have been possessed by an evil spirit which took her life as the defendants were to suggest both at the time and after her death?
‘Or may she have died as a result of some unknown or undetected illness?
'Or will you be sure that, as we say, she was assaulted, smothered, by these four defendants all of whom admit they were present when she died?'
Mrs Mumtaz was born in Pakistan and willingly entered into an arranged marriage with her husband, then a student at Wolverhampton University, in August 2007.
In the dock: Nalia Mumtaz was born in Pakistan and willingly entered into an arranged marriage with her husband Mohammed Mumtaz, pictured. He denies - along with other members of his family- killing her
She came to Britain for the first time the following May after obtaining a visa and moved into his parents' modern, three bedroom detached home in Birmingham.
Mr Hotten said she was attractive, bright and was ‘thrilled' by the prospect of motherhood after falling pregnant in February 2009.
During her pregnancy, she was regularly seen by a GP and various midwives – the last time two days before her death - and both she and her unborn child appeared healthy.
But her parents said she phoned them at their home in the Jhellum district of Pakistan the day before her death and told them she was ‘not at peace' living with her in-laws and was upset, Mr Hotten said.
The jury was also told that numerous telephone calls were made to Mrs Mumtaz 's relatives in Pakistan, the emergency services and other individuals in the hours before she was taken to hospital.
During the calls it is alleged that Ul Haq claimed that a ‘djinn' - or evil spirit - had been sent from Pakistan, while a woman at the house was allegedly heard to say ‘don't call an ambulance yet - we will cure her ourselves.'
Part-way through Mr Hotten's opening speech, Mumtaz collapsed in the dock in a clearly distressed state and the jury was sent home until tomorrow.

Tech company Mozilla said this week it plans to find and fire an employee suspected of posting hateful and sexist comments online.
Mozilla CEO Chris Beard said yesterday if a Reddit user who made a series of posts about women at the company is confirmed to actually be an employee, he will be fired. The commenter made a post celebrating the departure of community organizer Christie Koehler, which came after she posted a series of tweets decrying the lack of diversity at the company.
"Frankly everyone was glad to see the back of Christie Koehler," user aioyama wrote. "She was batshit insane and permanently offended at everything. When she and the rest of her blue-haired nose-pierced asshole feminists are gone, the tech industry will breathe a sigh of relief."
Beard said the comments constitute hate speech and would not be tolerated at Mozilla. "When I talk about crossing the line from criticism to hate speech, I'm talking about when you start saying 'someone's kind doesn't belong here, and we'll all be happy when they're gone,'" he said.
The same user had previously posted to /r/MensRights whining about an invitation to Google's I/O tech conference that was only extended to women employees in an attempt to foster diversity. Recent numbers show women only hold 11 percent of executive positions in Silicon Valley.
He's worked with Earnie Stewart before
Although he originally started in the academy for Sparta Rotterdam, Wijnaldum moved to AZ's academy and made his first team debut under Stewart in the 2010-11 season. He played for AZ while Stewart was at the club for a total of three seasons.
He's a Dutch Cup champion
Wijnaldum's first topflight trophy came while with Stewart's AZ club in 2012-13, when he helped his team win the KNVB Cup. The leftback started the final, playing all 90 minutes in a 2-1 victory over PSV Eindhoven
He's been teammates with some United States Men's National Team players
While with AZ, Wijnaldum laced up the boots alongside Toronto FC's Jozy Altidore as well as fellow USMNT forward Aron Johansson
He's part of a family of footballers
You may also know Giliano's brother, Liverpool and former Newcastle midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum. His half brother, Rajiv van la Parra, also plays in England, for Championship side Huddersfield Town.
He has international experience at the youth level
Wijnaldum has made appearances across the Netherlands' youth system, most recently for the Under-20s. He scored his first international goal on June 1, 2012 in a friendly against France.
I drink coffee. But my coffee life is not as simple as it may sound. My coffee life may be richer than you imagine.
I buy freshly-roasted, whole coffee beans at a local shop where I recklessly invest precious time discussing with the owner the virtues of the various beans: the distant land from whence they come, the soil of their upbringing, their method of cultivation, their roasting styles and their freshness. Thus I bring my beans home with great pride and thankfulness.
Each morning I wake early and while my family sleeps, I begin my day by preparing my coffee. I delicately measure out a large handful of those lovingly chosen beans and place them into the holy crucible — my unique, ceramic, Japanese hand-grinder. I then take several awareness-filled minutes to hand-grind those sacred beans. The sound of the grinder fills those meditative minutes as the delicate beans slowly and gently become a rich, fine, brown, fragrant powder. My labor of love yields a sensual aromatic earth which magically transforms my kitchen into an expensive, warm, cozy cafe.
Then my church bell, the teapot, rings out to call me to the next step of the holy ritual. The hissing pot also wakes my dogs who slumber into my cafe to join me as I gently place my hand-ground alchemy into the chalice — my French-press. The stove is turned off, the water allowed to cool to the perfect temperature and the communion transformation is initiated as the attentively prepared water is gently poured into the chalice. Now, time. Time for the effort of those who graciously planted, picked, bagged, transported, roasted and sold me the trees' offerings to become the elixir of my life.
I won't bore you with the details of how I actually drink my coffee (a story in itself) — for you are perhaps not sympathetic to my religion. Indeed some people tell me my religion is delusional. They tell me that my experience is all in my head. They claim that their machine-ground, pre-packaged secular coffee tastes no different from mine — sacrilege! They have even challenged me to try a taste test, but I refuse. I would never give up the magic of my ritual. Even if somehow they momentarily tricked me into feeling their profane factory coffee is no different from my sacred brew, I know my life would lose deep flavor and meaning without my loving ritual. They can not understand — the taste is more than the components — it is the lived experience.
Conclusion: When we discuss religion with people, we often forget how the mind works and how people are served by their rituals and beliefs. This morning I intended to read and write about the Ramayana, but this analogy came to mind during my morning ritual and the blogging muses demanded keyboard time from me. I was unabashedly blatant about some of the parallels in the analogy but I left the rest for the reader to imagine. Hope you enjoyed it.

er page load than the global average, while Germany, France and India have fewer. (Germany and many European countries are known for their culture of strong data privacy.) The advertising supply chain represents the vast majority of tracking companies.
New regulatory efforts to protect consumer privacy will significantly hinder these companies' ability to collect data via tracking scripts. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which goes into effect next year in Europe, will require companies to get explicit permission from consumers to collect their data.
Too many trackers can often create slower web experiences. A Princeton study earlier this year found that mainstream news websites use more third-party ad tech vendors than any other type of website: sports, shopping, adult, etc. Such partnerships can slow down load times for publisher sites if there are too many trackers dropped on a page, or if they're using certain techniques to capture data.
So me of the more heavily-trafficked user websites ar e trying to peel back on these partnerships to speed up their sites. Bloomberg, The Washington Post and others have made significant efforts to curb the number of tracking scripts on their web-pages in an effort to keep their sites nimble.

Facebook won a critical privacy lawsuit in July over tracking users' internet activity through "like" button trackers even after they logged out of the social media website, per Reuters.
Our thought bubble: It benefits these ad companies to have as access to as much data as possible, not just for profit, but because they want to provide better advertising experiences for users. (Studies have shown that consumers prefer customized ads.) Some may argue it's the cost of having free access to their tools.
Methodology: The data was collected by the Ghostery browser extension's GhostRank feature and covers all major browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera, and the Ghostery Privacy Browser for iOS and Android). It encompasses the internet activity of 850,000 internet users internationally across 440 million-page loads.
Welcome to MHRA Connect
The thing that MHRAs are very good at is research, being accurate and being rational. We have good ideas and understand how to create effective and fair systems.
The thing we suck at is networking.
Several times now, I've heard prominent MHRAs say "people come up to me and ask; what can I do to help?" And their reply is usually along the lines of; "I don't know, what can you do?" And that's the thing; lots of people want to help and lots of people need help but they have trouble finding each other.
How this site works;
1. You add your skills to our database.
That's it. That's all you need to do to help get men equal rights. You never know what might be useful. Simply being in a particular state or job or frame of mind can be useful.
You can do more of course, but that's the core of the system; letting people know what you can do and that you are willing to help.
When one of the members creates a project that requires your skills, you will be emailed about it. You may not be interested in it - so don't reply. Nobody knows it's been sent to you. You can't be guilted in any way. Or it may be a perfect fit. So you reply and help out.
You can also create your own projects and shoutout to people who have skills that you need. And you can be as specific as you like. If you're doing a project on a specific type of suicide you can call on all Transsexual males in Vancouver with depression (see, state of mind can be useful). Or people who are willing to binge-watch Game of Thrones, or people who have a knowledge of the Law in South Australia.
You can be as involved as you like. Set your contact settings to real-time and you'll be notified by email as soon as a project comes up that needs your skills. Or set it to weekly or monthly or never. If you set it to never, you'll have to come to the site to see if there's anything for you.
We'll also be sending out occasional Alerts to let you know of major milestones. (You can set that to no-contact as well, if you like)
If you're interested, go ahead and register. It's all free.
Cheers

In my previous article, I have written about the difference, and pros/cons of Ionic 2, ReactNative and NativeScript, but my article was mostly conceptual, therefore some people might have complained about its quality, so why not show our readers an actual practical example of the framework? Also, it makes sense to talk about one framework first, and then move on to other frameworks.
Ionic 2 is a hybrid mobile development framework designed solely for creating mobile applications with a single code-base, while ReactNative and NativeScript claim to be as close to native as possible, meaning Ionic 2 has the edge over these platforms when it comes to prototyping applications or speed of development. But, ReactNative and NativeScript provide easy integration to native UI components, so the experience will be truer to native UI and faster in performance.
It's not very difficult to make the transition to Ionic 2 if you are coming from AngularJS 2 (which I assume you are, considering you are one of my readers!). If you remember my previous articles, I once wrote about how to use HTTP (and its services) in AngularJS 2. A moment later, you will witness the emergence of a same structure, forcing you to question if you are still working with AngularJS 2 or Ionic 2.
In this article, I am going to build an application containing a YouTube search using the Ionic 2. Let's get started!
Building a YouTube search application with Ionic 2
Ionic 2 is a kind of upgrade of Ionic 1, or you can say that it takes some features from previous versions, while improving (or adding) extra features. Even though you can use native functionalities through Cordova plugins (with the help of Ionic-Native), I won't be covering it at this moment (perhaps in the next article?). I will demonstrate an application that can run on any supported platform.
The architecture of Ionic 2 is modular, similar to AngularJS 2, in fact, when building applications for Ionic 2 you would get the similar feeling, but there are some changes (which you will understand soon). In Ionic 2, every page or component has its own folder as part of its component-based structure, meaning whenever you create a new component through Ionic CLI, then a separate folder is created for the page that contains its .ts (or component) code and their respective HTML and CSS/Sass code.
But, we won't be using advanced AngularJS 2 features like Feature Modules, Shared Modules, Core Modules, etc. and rather just stick with @NgModule or standard approach provided with Ionic 2. I will first create a sample application, and then we will build our application from the same code-base.
The fact that I am writing the code in TypeScript/AngularJS 2 is because I know that you have read my previous articles on AngularJS 2 and therefore you will have a seamless transition.
Creating a project
We won't be creating complex apps, but a simple YouTube API app that has a search input field. Assuming you have already installed the Cordova and Ionic (including their respective CLI!), you can use the Ionic 2 right away!
$ ionic start YouTubeAPI blank --v2
Ionic has four templates available: tabs, sidemenu, blank and tutorial. We are using the blank template here, because we simply need to provide an input field for testing YouTube API, but if you visit their tutorial site (https://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/setup/tutorial/), you will notice that they actually use the tutorial template for the start-up projects.
If you do “ionic serve” you will see nothing but a very basic template.
The cool thing here is that the same AngularJS 2 tools would be used, so for example, we would be using Chrome DevTools for debugging, meaning the errors on the JavaScript side can be seen from the “Console” tab.
The project structure is a lot of similar to AngularJS 2 structure. For example, the app starts with “src/index.html” which is the main entry point of the app. You should notice something in it:
<ion-app></ion-app>
This is our main selector (remember the selectors in our previous AngularJS 2 tutorials?). The “src/” folder contains all the files that we are going to work with. If you open “src/app/” folder, you will find “app.module.ts”, which is our main entry point of the app. Following is its contents:
app.module.ts
import { NgModule, ErrorHandler } from '@angular/core'; import { IonicApp, IonicModule, IonicErrorHandler } from 'ionic-angular'; import { MyApp } from './app.component'; import { HomePage } from '../pages/home/home'; @NgModule({ declarations: [ MyApp, HomePage ], imports: [ IonicModule.forRoot(MyApp) ], bootstrap: [IonicApp], entryComponents: [ MyApp, HomePage ], providers: [{provide: ErrorHandler, useClass: IonicErrorHandler}] }) export class AppModule {}
As we are using AngularJS 2 model structure, we are loading every component in this class. IonicModule.forRoot(MyApp) is for bootstrapping the MyApp module in order to assure that it's an Ionic module.
After the build, the files are moved to “www/” folder, so we won't be touching it for now. “config.xml” is for the configuration when the application needs to be installed on a device. “plugins” folder contain Cordova plugins (which we are not using, so let's not touch it!). “resources” folder contain resources like icons, and splash screens.
Ionic 2 contains pages, which are like activities in Android. Pages are put in a stack, and so they are retrieved on a principle of LIFO (Last In First Out).
To create new pages:
$ionic g page page-name
By default, you would find “home” directory in “pages” folder, which contains a very basic code.
home.html
<ion-header> <ion-navbar> <ion-title> Ionic Blank </ion-title> </ion-navbar> </ion-header> <ion-content padding> The world is your oyster. <p> If you get lost, the <a href="http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2">docs</a> will be your guide. </p> </ion-content>
Here, the <ion-header> defines the header of the page, within that <ion-navbar> is used for navigation bar, <ion-title> displays the page title. </ion-content> shows that it contains the contents, we have provided some padding in it. We will see more selectors later.
Delete the “home” folder and also make sure to delete all the instances of home in “app.module.ts”. So, let's create our YouTube page component:
$ionic g page youtube
In your “app.component.ts”, import the YoutubePage component and change your “rootPage” to “YoutubePage”. Following is its contents:
app.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core'; import { Platform } from 'ionic-angular'; import { StatusBar, Splashscreen } from 'ionic-native'; import { YoutubePage } from '../pages/youtube/youtube'; @Component({ templateUrl: 'app.html' }) export class MyApp { rootPage = YoutubePage; constructor(platform: Platform) { platform.ready().then(() => { // Okay, so the platform is ready and our plugins are available. // Here you can do any higher level native things you might need. StatusBar.styleDefault(); Splashscreen.hide(); }); } }
Make sure to include it in your “app.module.ts”. You can refer to the previous code provided in this article, and simply change “Home” to “YoutubePage” wherever you find it on the page.
We are not using several pages in our application, so you won't see many menus (we will cover the menus in next articles!).
For the YouTube API, we will use the same code as our previous AngularJS 2 project that we adopted from ng-book 2. We will modify it a bit. Copy the following content to “youtube.ts”:
youtube.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core'; import { NavController, NavParams } from 'ionic-angular'; import { Injectable, OnInit, ElementRef, EventEmitter, Inject } from '@angular/core'; import { Http, Response } from '@angular/http'; import { Observable } from 'rxjs'; export var YOUTUBE_API_KEY: string = 'AIzaSyDOfT_BO81aEZScosfTYMruJobmpjqNeEk'; export var YOUTUBE_API_URL: string = 'https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search'; class SearchResult { id: string; title: string; description: string; thumbnailUrl: string; videoUrl: string; constructor(obj?: any) { this.id = obj && obj.id || null; this.title = obj && obj.title || null; this.description = obj && obj.description || null; this.thumbnailUrl = obj && obj.thumbnailUrl || null; this.videoUrl = obj && obj.videoUrl || `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=${this.id}`; } } @Injectable() export class YouTubeService { constructor(public http: Http, @Inject(YOUTUBE_API_KEY) private apiKey: string, @Inject(YOUTUBE_API_URL) private apiUrl: string) { } search(query: string): Observable<SearchResult[]> { let params: string = [ `q=${query}`, `key=${this.apiKey}`, `part=snippet`, `type=video`, `maxResults=10` ].join('&'); let queryUrl: string = `${this.apiUrl}?${params}`; return this.http.get(queryUrl) .map((response: Response) => { return (<any>response.json()).items.map(item => { return new SearchResult({ id: item.id.videoId, title: item.snippet.title, description: item.snippet.description, thumbnailUrl: item.snippet.thumbnails.high.url }); }); }); } } export var youTubeServiceInjectables: Array<any> = [ {provide: YouTubeService, useClass: YouTubeService}, {provide: YOUTUBE_API_KEY, useValue: YOUTUBE_API_KEY}, {provide: YOUTUBE_API_URL, useValue: YOUTUBE_API_URL} ]; @Component({ outputs: ['loading', 'results'], selector: 'search-box', template: ` <p>Enter something in the field and see the asynchronous results!</p> <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Search" autofocus> ` }) export class SearchBox implements OnInit { loading: EventEmitter<boolean> = new EventEmitter<boolean>(); results: EventEmitter<SearchResult[]> = new EventEmitter<SearchResult[]>(); constructor(public youtube: YouTubeService, private el: ElementRef) { } ngOnInit(): void { Observable.fromEvent(this.el.nativeElement, 'keyup') .map((e: any) => e.target.value) .filter((text: string) => text.length > 1) .debounceTime(250) .do(() => this.loading.next(true)) .map((query: string) => this.youtube.search(query)) .switch() .subscribe( (results: SearchResult[]) => { this.loading.next(false); this.results.next(results); }, (err: any) => { console.log(err); this.loading.next(false); }, () => { this.loading.next(false); } ); } } @Component({ inputs: ['result'], selector: 'search-result', template: ` <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3"> <div class="thumbnail"> <img src="{{result.thumbnailUrl}}"> <div class="caption"> <h3>{{result.title}}</h3> <p>{{result.description}}</p> <p><a href="{{result.videoUrl}}" class="btn btn-default" role="button">Watch</a></p> </div> </div> </div> ` }) export class SearchResultComponent { result: SearchResult; } @Component({ selector: 'page-youtube', templateUrl: 'youtube.html' }) export class YoutubePage { constructor(public navCtrl: NavController, public navParams: NavParams) {} ionViewDidLoad() { console.log('ionViewDidLoad YoutubePage'); } results: SearchResult[]; updateResults(results: SearchResult[]): void { this.results = results; } }
Now copy the following content to “youtube.html”:
youtube.html
<ion-header> <ion-navbar> <ion-title>YouTube API</ion-title> </ion-navbar> </ion-header> <ion-content padding> <div class='container'> <div class="page-header"> <h2>YouTube Search </h2> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="input-group input-group-lg col-md-12"> <search-box (loading)="loading = $event" (results)="updateResults($event)" ></search-box> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <search-result *ngFor="let result of results" [result]="result"> </search-result> </div> </div> </ion-content>
You can see that I have added the YouTube HTML code within the <ion-content> element.
Make sure to include all the pages in “app.module.ts”. Following is its complete content:
app.module.ts
import { NgModule, ErrorHandler } from '@angular/core'; import { IonicApp, IonicModule, IonicErrorHandler } from 'ionic-angular'; import { MyApp } from './app.component'; import { YoutubePage } from '../pages/youtube/youtube'; import { youTubeServiceInjectables } from '../pages/youtube/youtube'; import { SearchResultComponent } from '../pages/youtube/youtube'; import { SearchBox } from '../pages/youtube/youtube'; @NgModule({ declarations: [ MyApp, YoutubePage, SearchResultComponent, SearchBox ], imports: [ IonicModule.forRoot(MyApp) ], bootstrap: [IonicApp], entryComponents: [ MyApp, YoutubePage, SearchResultComponent, SearchBox ], providers: [youTubeServiceInjectables, {provide: ErrorHandler, useClass: IonicErrorHandler}], exports: [ YoutubePage ] }) export class AppModule {}
…and that's all! You can “ionic serve” now to see the results!
At this moment, I like to highlight that Ionic 2 provides cool Progressive Web App (PWA) demos here (http://pwa.ionic.io/), so you can run the apps as if they are applications on your mobile devices! For instance, you get the app-like experience from the applications that are actually built on web technologies, for example, you can use your mouse (on PC) to turn the page or to slide something aside, as if your mouse is your hand on a touchscreen!
Building for android
As our application is already finished, why not build the .apk out of it to test on our mobile devices? Thankfully, Ionic CLI provides very easy commands that builds the application for the android (or iOS) for you.
First you need to add the platform for the android:
$ cordova add platform android
This will create a folder for the android (under “platform/” directory). Now, run the following command:
$ cordova build --release android
If you get the errors, then make sure that recent Android SDK is installed on your device AND that the PATH is set correctly for the SDK. This will create an “unsigned” application in “platforms/android/build/outputs/apk” directory. This is enough for running the application on your device assuming that you have enabled the installation of unsigned applications in your device.
For making the application “signed”, you can check this link (https://ionicframework.com/docs/guide/publishing.html).
You can also emulate android app on your PC:
$ cordova build --release android
Make sure that Android Emulator is installed on your computer (refer to Android SDK Manager for that).
Conclusion
Thus, so far, you can see the real example of Ionic 2 of the YouTube API. You can enjoy and run the application in your mobile devices, and see that it's hard to distinguish this app from the app created from a purely native code. In the next articles, I will discuss Ionic 2 in further depth.

Maternal depression can make it more difficult for women to breastfeed, keep up with doctors' appointments and interact with their babies. But some health care researchers are hoping the Affordable Care Act will improve treatment for a condition that affects 11 percent of infants' mothers on average, but which is more prevalent among low-income mothers.
“Low-income mothers were more likely to have severe depression,” said Marla McDaniel, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, author of a draft research paper based on national estimates from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health that compared the health of low-income mothers with that of all mothers. Her comments came as part of a panel Thursday on depression and maternal health at the Urban Institute, a Washington D.C. research group.
Eighty two percent of infants living in poverty in households with depressed mothers were enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP programs, health care programs for low-income people, according to a separate 2010 report by the Urban Institute about children affected by maternal depression. Of the mothers, at least 40 percent were not receiving any treatment. Outcomes were consistently worse for uninsured families.
Having a lower-income household also affected the type of mental health provider treating the women, according to the draft paper. Ten percent of lower-income mothers visited a psychiatrist for treatment, about half as many as the higher-income mothers. Seven percent of the low- income mothers received treatment from social workers, compared to 2 percent of higher income women and 5 percent of the uninsured.
But states choosing to participate in the expansion of Medicaid could improve access to the prevention and treatment women need, said Larke Huang, a psychologist and senior adviser at the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, who was also part of the forum. Medicaid currently covers pregnant women considered “medically needy,”who might not meet income requirements. The coverage continues until six months after they give birth. In states that expand the program, many of those women will now qualify for the program after the six-month period, she said.
Huang said the Obama administration was also calling for higher quality of treatment and services. She said having providers and community workers incorporate changes like electronic health records or more careful screening could impact how efficiently the care was delivered.
Regardless of coverage, Huang said connecting proven clinical interventions to other community and welfare programs is an important part of screening and treating maternal depression. She suggested that linking clinical screening to programs such as the Women, Infants and Children Program (WIC) , which provides federal funding for nutritional programs for mothers and children, and Head Start, which provides educational support for low-income children, was the best way to reach lower income women.
Deborah Perry, a Georgetown professor, said providing mental health care to the poor communities was further complicated by the social stigma and misinformation surrounding the diagnosis of depression. Through her work with community health organizations, she observed that many of the families didn't consider the disease worthy of clinical treatment.
“Depression is like a chronic medical condition,” she said. “But that's not how they saw it – they saw it as a natural reaction to their crummy life circumstances.”
This week we're excited to have on the show one of the more famous South Asian actors in America: Utkarsh Ambudkar. He is a musician, rapper, actor, and basketball nerd who has been on everything from The Mindy Project to Pitch Perfect to being the first Indian American on The Simpsons to Barbershop 3 (which drops April 15th). He joins us for what turns into a free-flowing conversation amongst three brown men who are figuring shit out. We dive into topics from showing up on time to work, to how someone showing their DD's to Utkarsh is how he started acting. We also talk about the insecurities we faced growing up, whether it would be easier being white, and who were our role models as kids/what kind of role models can we now be. But as if that wasn't enough we also got to hear about his amazing experience working with South Asian kids in a program that took Basketball to India. This meandering but fascinating conversation cuts into the core of what we are trying to do with this podcast: we question the status quo and keep on questioning...so pull up a cup of chai and listen in. We know you want to.
Oklahoma State Rep. George Faught (Facebook)
On Tuesday, the Oklahoma House met to discuss engrossment of its controversial House Bill-1549, which would prohibit anyone from seeking an abortion in the case of a genetic abnormality.
Oklahoma State Rep. Cory Williams (D) asked Rep. George Faught — who authored the bill — if rape is the “will of God.”
“Well, you know, if you read the Bible, there are actually a couple circumstances where that happened,” Faught began. “The Lord uses all circumstances. I mean, you can go down that path, but it's a reality unfortunately,” he said.
Williams followed up, asking if incest is the “will of God.”
“Same answer. Doesn't deal with this bill,” Faught said. Williams argued that the questions matter to the legislation, given that Faught was unwilling to make exceptions in the case of rape or incest. “You are proffering a divine intervention as the reason why you won't do that and so I think it is very important.”
“This body wants to know — and myself personally — whether you believe rape and incest are actually the will of God,” Williams questioned.
“It's a great question to ask,” said Faught. “And, obviously if it happens in someone's life, it may not be the best thing that ever happened, but — so you're saying that God is not sovereign with every activity that happens in someone's life and can't use anything and everything in someone's life and I disagree with that.”
Watch the full clip below.
The Sunday Times dropped a bombshell this weekend, reporting that the top secret files leaked by Edward Snowden have been obtained by the Russian and Chinese governments. The story claimed Western intelligence agencies were "forced into rescue operations" to mitigate the damage, and one UK government source claimed that Snowden had "blood on his hands."
It would be a major blow to Snowden and the journalists who worked with him—if it were true. But the bold claims started falling apart shortly after it was published this weekend. The story is behind a paywall but available elsewhere. It's based entirely on anonymous British officials and contains some glaring inaccuracies.
Snowden confidante Glenn Greenwald immediately attacked it as "journalism at its worst." Greenwald is a predictable critic, to be sure, but Times reporter Tom Harper was later questioned about his story on CNN and admitted he's been unable to check out any of the far-reaching claims told him by government sources. The reporter answered one question after another with some version of "I don't know," admitting he has no idea how any "hack" took place, how or when any foreign governments got the files, or if the files were encrypted at all. Harper simply maintained that the Snowden hacking story was the "official position of the British government."
This morning, lawyers at Times Newspapers took a step to limit Greenwald's criticism, sending a notice telling The Intercept that Greenwald's story, which included a low-res image of the Times' front page, violates their copyright. The Intercept quickly published the takedown notice, and on Twitter Greenwald made clear that his publication won't be deleting his copy of the Times' "humiliating headline."
The relevant portions of the copyright letter, from the legal department of Times Newspapers, reads:
We write on behalf of Times Newspapers Limited (TNL) the publisher of The Times and The Sunday Times. TNL owns the copyright in the typographical arrangement of the front page of The Sunday Times published on 14 June 2015 (Material). The Material is an original work created by employees of TNL. A copy of the Material is enclosed. A copy of the Material appears at [link] under the headline: SUNDAY SNOWDEN STORY IS JOURNALISM AT ITS WORST—AND FILLED WITH FALSEHOODS (Infringing Content). The Infringing Content has been reproduced, communicated to the public and published onto the Website without permission and as such infringes the intellectual property rights of TNL. A copy of the Infringing Content is enclosed.
The "infringing" picture of The Sunday Times' front page, reproduced in part, above, doesn't have sufficient resolution to allow the article to be read. And Greenwald didn't reproduce the Times story in full, although considering how much he had to say about the piece, doing so would likely be well within his rights.
The Sunday Times legal department didn't respond to Ars' request for comment on the DMCA notice.
Errors and omissions
The Times' behavior since publication has become a perfect example of why outside criticism and fact-checking are so necessary. The article's most glaring error, a statement that Greenwald's partner David Miranda visited Snowden in Moscow, was deleted without any notice. A Times spokesperson promised there will be a correction in this Sunday's edition.
Critics have pointed to numerous inconsistencies in the Sunday Times piece, including the fact that the piece misuses the terms "agents" and "officers," which have specific meanings in the context of British intelligence.
The story asserts that it isn't clear "whether Russia and China stole Snowden's data, or whether he voluntarily handed over his secret documents." Of course, if Snowden handed over the documents willingly, it isn't clear why they would need to be "cracked" by foreign governments in the first place. Further, Snowden and the journalists working with him have stated he kept no files after handing them to journalists in Hong Kong.
The quote suggesting Snowden has "blood on his hands" is immediately followed by a statement noting that there was "no evidence of anyone being harmed."
Other critics have suggested that the story's timing is no coincidence, having come just days after a 373-page report was published in the UK critical of the nation's terrorism laws. The report's author, David Anderson, called the current system "undemocratic, unnecessary, and in the long run, intolerable."
Carl Sagan famously said "extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof." Journalism isn't exempt. The Times has published a story that's evidence-free and raises questions about the practice of using anonymous sources as the sole foundation of reporting. Greenwald has lambasted the story as "pure stenography," a critique that the story's authors have not rebutted.
Updated An analysis of Apple's iOS operating system by a security expert has revealed various tools in the software that could be used for surveillance if one were so inclined.
Jonathan Zdziarski concluded that the vast majority of iThing owners are unaware of lax mechanisms protecting their data.
Data forensics expert and author Zdziarski wrote an academic paper on his findings in March, and gave a related talk [PDF mirror] at the Hackers On Planet Earth (HOPE X) conference in New York on Friday.
The results of his research – triggered by reports of the NSA spying on Apple products – indicate a backdoor in iOS, although it's not as wide open as some reports have suggested.
"There are certain steps that have to be taken to get this data," Zdziarski told The Register. "Backdoors are guarded, there are things protecting it – you don't just type 'Joshua' for full access."
Zdziarski's analysis shows that 600 million iOS devices, particularly those running the most recent version 7 builds, have data discovery tools that are separate from those used by Apple for standard backup and storage. These include a file-relay service that can snoop out data, bypassing the Backup Encryption service offered by Apple.
This data includes a copy of the user's address book, stored photos, the voicemail database and audio files, any accounts configured on the device such as iCloud, Facebook or Twitter, a cache of screenshots, keystrokes and the device's clipboard, GPS data, and – on iOS 7 – metadata disk sparseimage of the iOS file system.
Zdziarski notes that this is a one-way tool, in that it's very useful for taking data off the device but not for putting it back on for a backup service. The data is also in too raw a format to be of any use to a Genius Bar tech support team.
In addition there is also, we're told, a packet sniffer dubbed com.apple.pcapd on the device that fires up without notifying the iOS device's owner. This can log and export network traffic and HTTP request/response data from the device and could be targeted via Wi-Fi for remote monitoring, Zdziarski said.
This software isn't some legacy code left on the device by Apple engineers for testing – it has been actively updated and expanded in various iOS revisions, according to Zdziarski.
But it's not something Apple has talked about, or even officially documented, and seems to have little to offer other than for those who seek to slurp data off iOS devices. It is separate from the packet-tracing techniques described on the Apple developer website.
When the cops coming knocking...
One possibility is that the software is needed so that the gadgets conform to the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), which requires tech firms to have systems in place to allow properly accredited law enforcement limited access for wiretapping.
But Zdziarski told El Reg that the software didn't look fit for that purpose.
"I think Apple has exceeded any requirements the CALEA law has with these tools," he said. "The existence of these interfaces exceeds anything that law requires. It could be that there's some kind of secret court order requiring this, but if there is then the public needs to know about and understand that."
Of course, to access all these hidden tools you'd need access to the target's iPhone, and Apple's security is invincible, right? Not so fast there: Zdziarski has also uncovered a way to get around this that, while hard for common-or-garden hackers, wouldn't be too tough for law enforcement.
When an iOS device pairs with a desktop system to sync data, the mobile operating system establishes a trusted connection and stores a set of keys and certificates on the PC and the device, and stores it in a single file on both machines. Only a factory reset wipes this pairing data from the iOS device.
While pairing is done over USB, if someone has access to this pairing data, the device becomes much easier to crack. The pairing data is exchanged via TCP port 62078, and an attacker could log onto the device in seconds if they share the same Wi-Fi network.
Getting access to pairing data would be tricky for a hacker working alone, but if law enforcement impounds someone's desktop, it's easy for a cop or g-man to crack any iOS device the PC is paired with. If you're the NSA, with a Tailored Access Operations division that specializes in this sort of thing, getting into Apple's backdoor is easy as pie.
Zdziarski said he was inspired to delve deeper into iOS security after reading a report in Der Spiegel that the NSA was targeting iOS gadgets and the systems they are paired with. While Zdziarski says he doesn't want to be sensationalist about his findings, it's clear Apple owes customers some answers.
Cook & Co were unavailable for comment at time of going to press. ®
Updated to add
After publication, Apple apparently briefed journalists that the services identified by Zdziarski are not deliberately provided for government agencies to exploit. Instead, they are for "diagnostic" purposes and to allow enterprise IT bods to manage workers' devices.
"The problem with this is that these services dish out data (and bypass backup encryption) regardless of whether or not 'Send Diagnostic Data to Apple' is turned on or off, and whether or not the device is managed by an enterprise policy of any kind," Zdziarski responded on his blog.
"Every single device has these features enabled and there's no way to turn them off, nor are users prompted for consent to send this kind of personal data off the device."
Defenders of Apple have been quick to suggest that the mechanisms highlighted by Zdziarski are known to some developers; for example, an unofficial open-source client exists for the file-relay service so that Linux computers can talk to iThings, and some notes exist for lockdownd . However, the presence of these services are not flagged up to users, and the pcapd daemon remains unexplained – indeed, Apple's documentation insists: "iOS does not support packet tracing directly." All of which is a cause for concern.
"The consumer is also not aware of these mechanisms, nor are they prompted in any way by the device. There is simply no way to justify the massive leak of data as a result of these services, and without any explicit consent by the user," he added.
"I don't buy for a minute that these services are intended solely for diagnostics. The data they leak is of an extreme personal nature. There is no notification to the user. A real diagnostic tool would have been engineered to respect the user, prompt them like applications do for access to data, and respect backup encryption."

Tennessee's urban forests, currently valued at about $80 billion, also provide almost $650 million in benefits such as carbon storage, pollution removal, and energy reduction according to a new U.S. Forest Service report.
The authors of Urban Forest of Tennessee, 2009 (published in early 2012) found there are 284 million trees in urban areas in the state, with canopies covering 33.7 percent of 1.6 million acres of urban area. Those urban forests provide an estimated $204 million per year in pollution removal and $66 million per year in energy savings. The study is the first of its kind in Tennessee.
“This report, for the first time, puts a face on the urban forest resource and what it means to the state in terms of economic and environmental value, ” said Steven Scott, Tennessee State Forester and head of the Tennessee Division of Forestry, which collected the data for the report. “Perhaps the most significant finding is the immediate impact of urban trees on the use of energy, the savings we get as a result of shade near homes, businesses and industrial areas.”
David Nowak, Northern Research Station project leader and research forester, led the pilot study, which sampled trees in all the state's urban area and analyzed their value using a model developed by the Forest Service. “Urban forests make our cities healthier, more vibrant places to live,” said Nowak. “They provide healthy outdoor spaces for our kids, they clean our air and water, and – as this study shows – they provide tremendous economic benefits. We must continue our work to protect these critical natural resources.
There are more than 100 million acres of urban forest across the U.S., but a recent study shows that many are in decline.
The Tennessee report includes an extensive assessment of urban forest health, providing information about present damage and potential risks. In addition to nonnative invasive plants, Tennessee urban forests face risks from exotic pests that include the recently discovered thousand cankers disease, which impacts black walnut; hemlock woolly adelgid, which kills eastern and Carolina hemlocks; the Asian longhorned beetle, which kills a wide range of hardwood species; and the emerald ash borer, which decimates ash trees. This last insect was recently documented in East Tennessee.

I recently watched “Einstein and Eddington”. The storyline is about how the English scientist Eddington became interested in Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, and how he helped “release it to the world”. This all happened around the time of World War I. The Great War provides a continuous backdrop to the story; the scandal that an English scientist was promoting the work of a German-born scientist.
I'm unsure how historically accurate the storyline is (for example, did Eddington really write to Einstein to ask if his theories could predict the orbit of Mercury that could not quite be explained by Newton's Theory of Gravity?). Nevertheless, I enjoyed the film and would recommend it.
So, how did Eddington demonstrate that Einstein was right?
One of the things that General Relativity predicts is that light will bend around a massive object (such as the Sun). Newtonian gravity also predicts this. However, General Relativity predicts that light will bend twice as much as the value predicted by Newtonian gravity.
So, we have something that can be tested. If we can measure how much light bends around the Sun, then the value obtained will show which prediction was right: Einstein's or Newton's.
An experiment could be devised to test this.
There are plenty of light sources that can be used to see how much light bends when passing by a massive object; there are millions of stars that we can see in the night sky. The problem is the “night sky” bit of that last sentence. We see the stars at night when the Sun isn't there. How can we check if the Sun is bending starlight when the Sun is too bright to allow the stars to be seen?
Simple: run the experiment during a total eclipse.
So, Eddington and his colleagues performed some calculations to find a suitable location to observe the next solar eclipse, and determined which stars would be close to the Sun during the eclipse.
They calculated that the tiny island of Príncipe off the coast of West Africa would be an excellent place from which to observe and photograph the next solar eclipse on 29 May 1919. Eddington himself would go to Príncipe and he also despatched one team to Sobral in Brazil.
The Hyades open cluster was selected as the stars that would be measured. This is how it looks in the night sky:
Eddington's experiment would attempt to image this star cluster during the eclipse. An image taken during the eclipse would then be superimposed on top of an image taken of Hyades at night (i.e. when the light from stars in the cluster was nowhere near the Sun). Both Einstein and Newton's gravitation theories predict that stars in the eclipse image that were close to the Sun would appear to be shifted away from the corresponding stars in the night time image – i.e. there would be a gap between stars on the eclipse image and the night image. The theories predict different values; the size of this gap would determine which prediction was right.
When the eclipse and night images were compared a gap was found. And when measured, it confirmed that Einstein's prediction was right. Something that the General Theory of Relativity (and its explanations for gravity) had predicted had now been confirmed experimentally.
The results were reported by the worldwide press. The Illustrated London News explains the experiment well with a nice graphic:
The New York Times got a bit “tabloidy”:
Almost overnight, Eddington had turned Einstein into an international celebrity.
The rest is history.

The MMA connection to U.S. pro wrestling continued on Sunday night when Bobby Lashley, King Mo Lawal, Stephan Bonnar and Colby Covington were all involved in an Impact Wrestling pay-per-view event from Ottawa, Ont.
In addition, Ronda Rousey has been regularly training at the WWE's Performance Center in Orlando, Fla., to get ready for a match that is now expected to take place in April at WrestleMania.
Lashley and Lawal, both Bellator fighters, along with retired UFC Hall of Famer Bonnar, and UFC's Covington, along with ATT owner Dan Lambert, were involved in several months of storylines on Impact's television show on Pop TV.
Lambert, who is actually a huge pro wrestling fan, had claimed that his real fighters would expose the pro wrestlers for being loudmouths who couldn't fight. The story itself started when Lambert, purely in storyline, tried to get Lashley to quit pro wrestling to concentrate on MMA.
Impact was the former No. 2 pro wrestling group in the U.S., but has fallen on hard times in recent years and is struggling badly after losing its television deal on SPIKE TV three years ago.
This built to a six-sided cage match with Lashley & Lawal against Bonnar & Moose, real name Quinn Ojinnaka, a former NFL star, who has been a pro wrestling regular for several years, at Sunday's Bound for Glory event, the company's biggest show of the year.
Thiago Alves had been part of the television storylines, but he was not at Bound for Glory. Lambert brought Covington, whose usage of old-style pro wrestling heel interviews in recent weeks has made him a controversial UFC character, and two others to Canada to be part of the show.
In the match, Lawal and Moose ended up outside the ring after going through the cage door. Lambert threw Lawal back into the cage. Lambert and his ATT crew all got in the cage and locked the door, leaving Moose on the outside and Bonnar to face six people. Eventually Moose climbed the cage from the outside and dove on several of the ATT crew. The match ended when Covington distracted Moose and Lashley speared him for the pin.
Impact will be taping all of its television through early January over the next week in Ottawa. With the heel side winning, the angle will likely continue at the tapings, which continue through Friday.
This means Lawal and Covington, along with Lambert, will likely be on the shows for the next few months.
Rousey, Jessamyn Duke and Marina Shafir, the MMA Four Horsewomen, along with Shayna Baszler, had teased a confrontation with the WWE's Four Horsewomen, Charlotte Flair (the daughter of legend Ric Flair), Becky Lynch, Sasha Banks and Bayley back in July.
Nothing has been followed up from a television or streaming video standpoint after the early interviews, but since that time, Baszler has signed a WWE contract and is performing on their developmental NXT brand. The other three have all been training at the WWE's Performance Center. Rousey and Duke had first started training in California with Brian Kendrick, a WWE wrestler. Shafir is engaged to a WWE developmental wrestler, Roderick Strong, and was featured in several angles a few months back.
While many expected the match for Survivor Series, which takes place in two weeks, the word in wrestling is that the match is expected to be at WrestleMania, the company's biggest event of the year, which takes place on April 8 at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans.
After Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez asked the umpire staff to check out Will Smith's arm in Thursday night's game, it seemed like one question came up in a variety of places: Will the Brewers do something to retaliate over the next three games of the series? More specifically, will the Brewers intentionally throw at a Braves batter?
Here's my thoughts on that:
Don't. Please don't, Brewers.
Smith was ejected after umpires looked at his arm and saw the very obvious smear of rosin and sun screen. That's clearly against the rules. But the Brewers were upset after the game because it's really more "against the rules" than against the rules. Most pitchers do use substances to get a better grip, many players admit. And batters (like Atlanta's Freddie Freeman) prefer pitchers can grip a ball. The issue, for Gonzalez, came in how blatant Smith was about it. And the Brewers were upset because, well, the Braves pitching staff surely does the same thing.
Asked about any potential retaliation against the Braves, this is what manager Craig Counsell offered:
Asked about possible retaliation, Craig Counsell said, "We're going to try to beat them the next three days. That's the best retaliation." — Tom (@Haudricourt) May 22, 2015
Which is exactly what he should say and try to do. I bolded that 'and' because the doing remains to be seen. It would be very dumb for him to say "Yes, we are going to throw at the Braves in the first inning of tomorrow's ballgame". That'd get him into pretty big trouble if the Brewers were to throw at a Braves batter. But I really hope that Counsell sticks to that.
Intentionally hurling very hard objects at somebody else's body at 90+ miles per hour is a very dumb, jerk thing to do. It's the kind of classic machismo that just, frankly, is incredibly frustrating and awful. Unfortunately, it's also a thing that happens way too often in baseball. Whether it's for going against one of the billion 'unwritten rules' in baseball, or as a 'you hit my guy, I hit your guy' thing, it's dumb. If you're throwing a baseball at someone, you're looking to hurt them, and trying to hurt somebody intentionally is an awful thing to do, unless you're a professional prizefighter.
The Brewers should know that well. They weren't intentional, but three times have Brewers players been hit in the head by a pitch this year; two of those happened to Jean Segura and one to Carlos Gomez. Getting hit by pitches is not a joke. Intentionally hitting a batter is despicable.
It doesn't matter if you're aiming at their head, their ribs, or their legs. Batters have bones that could break anywhere. And if someone vouches for intentional plunkings that are slow pitches with no risk of hurting a player, then what's the point at all? You might even get (another) suspension out of it. If you're softly tossing at somebody to intentionally put them on base as retaliation, then not only do you look like an ass, but you look like a stupid ass. Don't be either of those things.
It's a no-win proposition. And it's silly. The whole thing about intentionally plunking players is silly. It shouldn't happen, but it does. I get some of the elements of 'protecting your players', but potentially hurting someone isn't the way to do that. And strategically, It's such a weird thing in baseball to intentionally let a player reach base in that manner.
In recent years, the Brewers haven't been the kind of team to have a retaliatory plunking just to get back at the opposing team for a perceived slight. I hope Milwaukee continues to stick with that philosophy. Counsell has it right, the best retaliation is to go back out and win a few games.
Project cars are some of the most rewarding projects a gear head can work on though they may be a bit frustrating at times. When most people think of project cars, they might think a little restoration needed, or maybe a few performance upgrades. But one Mazda MX-5 owner took it to an extreme level with his project car. Dubbed “Project Thunderbolt” this MX-5 got a monster LS3 engine, and some other go-fast upgrades.
Looking for Parts for your Project MX-5? Find the OEM Mazda Parts You Need Here
The big engine little car concept is one that's worked out magically in automotive history. So this MX-5 project was promising from the start.
Beginning with a tear down and removal of the original engine this project took place over several weeks.
The engine drivetrain had to be removed from the car for the conversion.
The build got completely new guts during the build.
A lot of modification went into simply getting the power train and drivetrain to fit in the car.
The results of the LS3 swap in a light car are well worth the effort.
The payoff is a lightening fast car, and you can barely tell by looking at it that anything was changed.
In fact, the GM LS engine looks stock in this Miata.
However, most people who see what's under the hood aren't going to want to mess with this car anymore. It has the power of an American beast, in a small nimble package and not much else is going to be able to keep up!
This is one to build that raises the standard for project cars everywhere.
Virtual reality: a new creative medium where the default state is belief
Chris Dixon Blocked Unblock Follow Jan 22, 2015
The holy grail of virtual reality, the one that's always been out of reach until now, is presence.
In the VR community, “presence” is a term of art. It's the idea that once VR reaches a certain quality level your brain is actually tricked — at the lowest, most primal level — into believing that what you see in front of you is reality. Studies show that even if you rationally believe you're not truly standing at the edge of a steep cliff, and even if you try with all your might to jump, your legs will buckle. Your low-level lizard brain won't let you do it.
With presence, your brain goes from feeling like you have a headset on to feeling like you're immersed in a different world.
Computer enthusiasts and science fiction writers have dreamed about VR for decades. But earlier attempts to develop it, especially in the 1990s, were disappointing. It turns out the technology wasn't ready yet. What's happening now — because of Moore's Law, and also the rapid improvement of processors, screens, and accelerometers, driven by the smartphone boom — is that VR is finally ready to go mainstream.
Once VR achieves presence, we start to believe.
We use the phrase “suspension of disbelief” about the experience of watching TV or movies. This implies that our default state watching TV and movies is disbelief. We start to believe only when we become sufficiently immersed.
With VR, the situation is reversed: we believe, by default, that what we see is real. As Chris Milk, an early VR pioneer, explains:
You read a book; your brain reads letters printed in ink on paper and transforms that into a world. You watch a movie; you're seeing imagery inside of a rectangle while you're sitting inside a room, and your brain translates that into a world. And you connect to this even though you know it's not real, but because you're in the habit of suspending disbelief.
With virtual reality, you're essentially hacking the visual-audio system of your brain and feeding it a set of stimuli that's close enough to the stimuli it expects that it sees it as truth. Instead of suspending your disbelief, you actually have to remind yourself not to believe.
This has implications for the kinds of software that will succeed in VR. The risk is not that it's boring, but that it's too intense. For example, a popular video game like Call of Duty ported to VR would be frightening and disorienting for most people.
What will likely succeed instead are relatively simple experiences. Some examples: go back in time and walk around ancient Rome; overcome your fear of heights by climbing skyscrapers; execute precision moves as you train to safely land planes; return to places you “3D photographed” on your last vacation; have a picnic on a sunny afternoon with a long-lost friend; build trust with virtual work colleagues in a way that today you can only do in person.
These experiences will be dreamt up by “experience makers” — the VR version of filmmakers. The next few decades of VR will be similar to the first few decades of film. Filmmakers had no idea what worked and what didn't: how to write, how to shoot, how to edit, etc. After decades of experiments they established the grammar of film. We're about to enter a similar period of exploration with VR.
There will be great games made in VR, and gaming will probably dominate the VR narrative for the next few years. But longer term, we won't think of games as essential to the medium. The original TV shows were newscasts and game shows, but today we think of TV screens as content-agnostic input-output devices.
VR will be the ultimate input-output device. Some people call VR “the last medium” because any subsequent medium can be invented inside of VR, using software alone. Looking back, the movie and TV screens we use today will be seen as an intermediate step between the invention of electricity and the invention of VR. Kids will think it's funny that their ancestors used to stare at glowing rectangles hoping to suspend disbelief.
Duarte[a] ([duˈaɾt(ɨ)]; 31 October 1391 – 9 September 1438), known in English as Edward and called the Philosopher (o Rei-Filósofo) or the Eloquent (o Eloquente), was King of Portugal and the Algarve and Lord of Ceuta from 1433 until his death. He was born in Viseu, the son of John I of Portugal and his wife, Queen Philippa of Portugal, a daughter of John of Gaunt. Edward was the oldest member of the "Illustrious Generation" of accomplished royal children who contributed to the development of Portuguese civilization during the 15th century. As a cousin of several English kings, he became a Knight of the Garter.[b]
Early life [ edit ]
Before he ascended the throne, Duarte always followed his father in the affairs of the kingdom. He was knighted in 1415 after the Portuguese capture of the city of Ceuta in North Africa, across from Gibraltar, in the Battle of Ceuta. He became king in 1433, when his father died of the plague.[1]
As king, Duarte soon showed interest in building internal political consensus. During his short reign of five years, he called the Portuguese Cortes (the national assembly) no less than five times to discuss the political affairs of his kingdom. He also followed the politics of his father concerning the maritime exploration of Africa. He encouraged and financed his famous brother, Henry the Navigator, who initiated many expeditions on the west coast of Africa. An expedition of Gil Eanes in 1434 first rounded Cape Bojador on the northwestern coast of Africa, leading the way for further exploration southward along the African coast.
Colonial affairs [ edit ]

The colony at Ceuta rapidly became a drain on the Portuguese treasury, and it was realised that without the city of Tangier, possession of Ceuta was worthless. After Ceuta was captured by the Portuguese, the camel caravans that were part of the overland trade routes began to use Tangier as their new destination. This deprived Ceuta of the materials and goods that made it an attractive market and a vibrant trading locale, and it became an isolated community.
In 1437, Duarte's brothers Henry and Ferdinand persuaded him to launch an attack on the Marinid sultanate of Morocco. The expedition was not unanimously supported and was undertaken against the advice of the Pope.[1] Infante Peter, Duke of Coimbra, and the Infante John were both against the initiative; they preferred to avoid conflict with the Marinid Sultan. Their instincts proved to be justified. The resulting Battle of Tangier, led by Henry, was a debacle. Failing to take the city in a series of assaults, the Portuguese siege camp was soon itself surrounded and starved into submission by a Moroccan relief army. In the resulting treaty, Henry promised to deliver Ceuta back to the Marinids in return for allowing the Portuguese army to depart unmolested. Duarte's youngest brother, Ferdinand, was handed over to the Marinids as a hostage for the final handover of the city.
Late life [ edit ]
The debacle at Tangier dominated Duarte's final year. Peter and John urged him to fulfill the treaty, yield Ceuta and secure Ferdinand's release, whereas Henry (who had signed the treaty) urged him to renege on it. Caught in indecision, Duarte assembled the Portuguese Cortes at Leiria in early 1438 for consultation. The Cortes refused to ratify the treaty, preferring to hang on to Ceuta and requesting that Duarte find some other means of obtaining Ferdinand's release.
A Portrait of Edward.
Duarte died late that summer, in Tomar, of the plague, like his father and mother (and her mother) before him. Popular lore suggested he died of heartbreak over the fate of his hapless brother; Ferdinand would remain in captivity in Fez until his own death in 1443.[1]
Legacy [ edit ]
Duarte's premature death provoked a political crisis in Portugal. Leaving only a young son, Afonso, to inherit the throne, it was generally assumed that Duarte's brothers would take over the regency of the realm. But Duarte's will appointed his unpopular foreign wife, Eleanor of Aragon, as regent. A popular uprising followed, in which the burghers of the realm, assembled by John of Reguengos, acclaimed Peter of Coimbra as regent. But the nobles backed Eleanor's claim, and threatened civil war. The regency crisis was defused by a complicated and tense power-sharing arrangement between Eleanor and Peter.
Another less political side of Duarte's personality is related to culture. A reflective and scholarly infante, he wrote the treatises O Leal Conselheiro (The Loyal Counsellor) and Livro Da Ensinança De Bem Cavalgar Toda Sela ("Book of Teachings on Riding Well on Every Saddle") as well as several poems. He was in the process of revising the Portuguese law code when he died.
Marriages and descendants [ edit ]
Duarte married Eleanor of Aragon, a daughter of Ferdinand I of Aragon and Eleanor of Alburquerque, in 1428.[2]

Confidential NSW Government blueprint shows toll-road pollution stacks on Sydney's north shore, northern beaches
Updated
The New South Wales Government has plans to build pollution ventilation shafts in Sydney's north shore and northern beaches areas, as part of the multi-billion-dollar Western Harbour Tunnel and Beaches Link project.
Shafts between 20 and 35 metres high will be constructed near schools and homes, to disperse the fumes from thousands of trucks and cars expected to access the new underground toll-road.
A planning document marked "cabinet-in-confidence", seen by ABC News and Fairfax, pinpoints the locations of the shafts and maps the air quality impact zones surrounding them.
It also red-flags political issues that could anger local residents and "impose significant project risk".

Where are the stacks going?
Engineering maps show a 500-metre radius around homes, schools, and parklands where dispersed pollution mixes with air, all marked as "sensitive receptors".
The review also warns Cabinet members that "a major risk to the project is perceived air quality impacts".
In Balgowlah, where the shaft is located at the bottom of a valley, the document identifies a risk of "plume downwash" — where pollution is drawn close to the ground, potentially entering houses and buildings.

In North Sydney, "existing residential buildings" are identified as a "potentially significant constraint" around shafts. At other locations on the route the document recommends further air-quality modelling to identify pollution concentrations in neighbourhoods.
Risks revealed in report
The risks of breaching air safety is also explored in a chapter of the report.
The southern shaft location — near Wenona School — is identified as problematic. Dispersal of pollution is hindered by tall apartment buildings less than 20 metres away.
Background pollution in North Sydney is also elevated by nearby freeways, and the report says the project may cause "cumulative air quality impacts".

A data set shows unsafe levels of PM2.5 and PM10 recorded in nearby monitoring stations.
The microscopic particles are found in exhaust fumes, and were declared carcinogen by the World Health Organisation in 2013.
The report says authorities should consider alternative location for the southern stack, away from residents and schools.

Additional wind modelling is also recommended. But major changes to the route and scope of works are unlikely.
A final business case — the "Base Plan" and strategy for final approval is also contained in the report.
The key recommendation is that the Planning Minister could declare the Base Plan as "critical state significant infrastructure", limiting objectors who oppose the project, and fast-tracking environmental approvals.
Melinda Pavey, the NSW Roads Minister, was approached for comment.
A spokesperson declined to answer specific questions, but said exhaust outlet locations were not finalised, as "geotechnical work is ongoing to determine the preferred route".

* Finland expects 10-fold increase of asylum seekers
* Eurosceptic coalition partner against EU migrant quotas
* Finnish economy shrinking for fourth year, jobless rising (Adds quote, background)
By Anna Ercanbrack and Jussi Rosendahl
HELSINKI, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Finland's government on Thursday proposed increasing capital gains tax and income tax on high earners to help pay for a 10-fold increase in refugees expected to arrive this year, its finance minister said.
The EU migrant crisis proposes a political as well as a financial challenge for the coalition, whose foreign minister, Timo Soini, heads the Eurosceptic party, The Finns, which campaigned for tighter controls on immigration.
Finance Minister Alexander Stubb said the highest bracket of capital gains tax would be raised by 1 percentage point while people earning more than 72,300 euros ($81,000) would be required to pay a so-called solidarity tax for two years, lowering the threshold from 90,000 euros.
"These will help to cover higher immigration costs which we estimate to be about 114 million euros this year," Stubb told a news conference.
The centre-right coalition, which took office in May, is struggling to cut government spending quickly in a shrinking economy where unemployment is on the rise.
Finland last week doubled its estimate for the number of asylum seekers expected this year to up to 30,000, compared with just 3,600 last year.
The government agreed before the summer that any EU plan to apportion asylum seekers among EU states should be voluntary. Nevertheless, its interior minister, from the pro-EU National Coalition party, agreed in July to take about 800 refugees from among those who had arrived in Greece and Italy.
The government is due to decide on Friday on how to respond to a new EU quota proposal.
The tax proposals may also be aimed to counter accusations that the poor and middle class have been hit the worst by government policies. The government also announced that members of parliament would be required to take a week's unpaid holiday and all ministers would forgo a week's pay.
Earlier this week it presented labour market reforms that included reductions in holidays, prompting a hostile reaction from trade unions who said it went against Finland's traditional consensus politics.
Finland's economy is shrinking for a fourth year in a row due to weak demand from European and Russian markets and problems affecting its main export industries, including technology. ($1 = 0.8935 euros) (Editing by Robin Pomeroy)

Frank Lloyd Wright – a Wisconsin native born on June 8, 1867 – is widely regarded as the greatest American architect ever.
As a self-assured and sometimes outspoken public figure, that's a distinction he would welcome, and for good reason: Wright revolutionized building and design by perfecting what he called “organic architecture.”
Wright meticulously designed his homes and buildings, inside and out, to exist harmoniously with nature.
He is perhaps best known for his Prairie School-style of architecture, which stresses clean, horizontal lines, expansive interiors, low-sloped roofs and clean, strong construction that makes use of its surroundings while steering clear of ornate decorations.
Wright completed more than 500 works in his lifetime – many of which are located in the Midwest.
His own home and studio, which he built in 1889 and lived in for 20 years, is in the village of Oak Park on Chicago's West Side.
Wright continued working up until his death on April 9, 1959, at the age of 91.
The Frank Lloyd Wright Trust, which restores and operates several Wright properties, is hosting several programs and events in honor of the architect's 150th birthday on Thursday.
Joining us to discuss Wright's legacy on the eve of this special anniversary is David Bagnall, the Frank Lloyd Wright Trust's curator.

The next version of Google's smartwatch operating system is slated to arrive on February 9th, according to mobile reporter Evan Blass. The leak follows last week's report that Google had notified developers of Android Wear 2.0's upcoming release so they could prepare to update apps for continued support.
Blass is also reporting that Android Wear 2.0 will arrive first to two new smartwatches manufactured by LG: the LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style. Both watches feature circular OLED displays, 4GB of internal storage, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth connectivity. The Sport version will reportedly offer LTE service, a heart rate sensor, and GPS. We'll hear more details about these watches when they're officially announced and showcased at Mobile World Congress in late February.
Since we didn't see many smartwatches launch over the holiday season, Android Wear 2.0 will likely roll out to older flagship devices as well, such as the Moto 360. We've reached out to Google for comment and will update if we hear back. For now, I guess it's time to mark your calendars.
This is Part 2 of 4 of another oral presentation that I recorded earlier this year. Below is the original audio plus a transcript of the recorded speech. The full presentation is also available to download on the Books page of the website. Here is the link to Part 3.
Part 2: The Problem
Transcript
Now I would like to move on to the next part of this presentation. I would like to discuss the structure of this matrix. I would like to discuss more in-depth how we've gotten to where we are now. What happens in the time between when a new child is born, and then when they become an adult. What is it that happens that takes this divine being, this purity, and turns it into a being based in fear.
Well, from the moment we're all born, we enter this world, and we become conditioned. We become conditioned to every aspect of our environment, and this is through our parents, our education system, the television, our friends, politics, money, everything.
Every single aspect becomes an imprint in our identities, and when we are not taught from an early age how to distinguish between the superficial ego-driven identity that we create for ourselves as a defense mechanism and our true divine selves, what commonly occurs is confusion, is disconnection, distraction from what's really important, and instead of everybody getting along and living in harmony, what we see is exactly the opposite.
We see teenagers who are looking to escape. We see them going to school and finding even more division. They see those cliques, they see the jocks, the athletes, the preps, the goths, punks, nerds, we have all of these superficial labels that categorize people into different places on the social ladder.
And without any type of official placement, we find ourselves in this caste system. Oh, I can't date her because she's cooler than me. Oh, I can't be friends with them, they're on the football team, I'm not.
We look to these superficial qualities, these characteristics of our identities that are truly just fabrications of our subjective realities. Because when you look at reality from an objective perspective, you see that everything is the same, there is no disconnection, we are all one. We are all made of the same energy source.
When you turn out the lights, and you see that everything is just darkness, everything is made of the same thing, and then when you turn the lights back on again, you see all of the individual solid objects.
It is this separation that we perpetually live in that creates this invisible layer of fear between human beings. It is this fear of not fitting in, of not upholding some type of false reputation that drives us to insanity.
It drives us to escape from reality and fill the void that is within us with some kind of quick fix, whether that's a violent movie or video game, or drugs, alcohol, pornography, thrill seeking, whatever it is, it's all a way to mask pain, to put a band-aid on a wound that really needs a full operation.
And once again this is not to say that there is anything wrong with anyone. Everyone is fine exactly how they are. No one is bad. No one is doing anything wrong. There is no judgment in this observation, this is merely analyzing human behavior, and understanding what is the root cause for all of this disharmony.
Why don't you go to a school and see that all of the kids are friends? And that they're all not just a united team. They're all there to experience learning together and growing up together, and they should all be there for one another and see past all of their superficial qualities.
So it is this conditioning that goes on a massive scale that takes us as pure, divine beings, and puts on this mask, this costume of some type of identity with the intention of providing some type of purpose, some type of reason to give us, some motivation just to simply go on, to simple keep breathing, to go to class every day, to go to work every day, and the final result is usually a shadow of a man. It is someone who is unsatisfied with their life, and once again resorts to some type of addiction. What is their favorite pleasure to relieve themselves of the pain that they are too afraid to honestly look at in the mirror.
And when we look all around us in our environments, in the mainstream media, in the entertainment industry, in politics and finance, what we see everywhere is this same corruption and manipulation.
We see all of these different facets of society abusing and using people's insecurities to convince them to buy something, or vote for something, invest their energy into something that is truly not in their best interest.
Is that not what advertising has become? Buy this car because it will make you feel proud of yourself. It will make you feel like a man. Watch football. Drink beer. Eat pizza. This is how an American man lives, and if you do not fit this description, then you are an outcast, and you will not have friends, and you will not be successful, and you will not be living some type of dream.
Well that dream is a pipe dream. That dream of fulfillment, satisfaction, only comes from within yourself. It only comes from knowing that you're doing the right thing, that you're living with integrity, and that you're coming from a place of love.
It is this conditioning that is the result of our current status on this planet. It is the reason why we still have an obsolete education infrastructure. It is why we still rely on money that is so obviously manipulated, based on fiat currency, that day in and day out, we are all too afraid of stepping outside of the box to do anything about it.
Yes, there are organizations. There are protests. There are people trying to do something about it, of course. But what I'm talking about is humanity as a collective. I'm talking about everyone stepping up and saying no more.
And this does not require protesting. This does not require anything but peaceful noncompliance. It simply means live within your values.
You don't have to go protest on Wall Street to make decisions that are the best for you. It is through making healthy decisions that we can change our reality. Because how this reality is formed is through our co-creation. It's through our collective thoughts, our collective agreements building the foundation.
It is through all of us together saying yes, we're still going to support this money system even though we don't want to, that keeps it going. It is through all of us saying oh, war is so terrible, and then turning our heads and watching a movie about war. Throwing our money at war, playing violent video games, supporting our troops, it's all a fabrication, it's an illusion.
It's some kind of false pride that we have. That we have to uphold some type of reputation, and say oh, well those soldiers are doing their duty, they're fighting for our freedom. They're fighting for our freedom? Really?
That's funny, because they've been fighting for a long time, and I'm pretty sure we have not become any more free than when they started fighting. In fact, we are in a much worse situation now than when we were before. So how has this exactly resulted in fighting for freedom?
It is an understanding that this physical reality, when you look at it from a subjective point of view, is completely built upon our agreements. And when we all collectively agree, even though we say something, it is our actions that are actually the concrete definition.
It is an understanding that this physical reality is an illusion. What we are living in is a perpetual virtual reality video game, a computer software program.
We are the godsparks, we are the architects of this reality, and here we are in our biological vessels thinking that these bodies are all that we are, and it is true in this subjective third dimensional sense.
In this reality, from a subjective perspective, yes, we are simply water-based bodies with skin, nails, and hair, but if you look at it from a much greater perspective, you realize that not only are we all made out of the same thing, energy, but if you look at it keeping the analogy of a computer program, that all we are are pieces of code. We are functions designed to serve a purpose.
We are the ultimate artificial intelligence programs here in many different forms: man, woman, black, white, lawyer, garbageman, actor.
We are all here in our different forms to perform a function, and to do an objective duty that contributes to the facilitation of this system, of this macrocosm.
We are the ones who decide how the future of this reality is going to unfold. We are the ones who build factories. We are the ones who start wars. All of these things that we do affect our reality, and much more so than we even realize.
When we dropped a nuclear bomb on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, the effects of that radiation did not simply stay enclosed within that immediate area. That radiation emitted out into space, and it is acts of terror such as that that have gotten our cosmic relatives involved.
They have always been involved, but they have been unable to interfere. But since that happened, and also in Fukushima now, they have been allotted more interference, and it has been assured that that type of action will not occur again.
Planet Earth will not be destroyed. It will not be completely devastated, that is not the fate of this planet. The fate of this planet is something much greater.
Schenectady High School senior Draven Rodriguez has a vision and that vision involves getting a senior photo of himself holding Mr. Bigglesworth the cat in his school's yearbook.
And we haven't even gotten to the lasers.
The 16-year-old launched a drive on iPetitions to convince his school in upstate New York to include a photo of him in a suit holding his fluffy cat — the aforementioned Mr. Bigglesworth.
“Hi all. This is my photo that should be going into the yearbook, but we know how finicky the school systems can be. I'm hoping that with enough signatures, my school simply can't turn this down,” Rodriguez wrote on the petition page.
In a note Rodriguez points out that the school district has not rejected the picture taken by Vincent Giordano of Trinacria Photography.
Click here to see more awesome photos of Rodriguez and Mr. Bigglesworth with amazing lasers, lasers and more lasers.
Rodriquez told the Daily Gazette in Schenectady that as a junior he vowed his senior picture would be different.
“I don't want to go in the yearbook with the generic ‘I-look-like-everyone-else' photo,” he told the Gazette. “I wanted a ‘He looks great. Only he would try that' photo.”
A school spokeswoman told the newspaper that the photo can be included in the yearbook, but not in the senior portrait section.
What do you think?
Should they accept the picture?

Zac Waters has come a long way since his first feature with us back in 2014.
Although the Australian producer remained relatively underground throughout the years, Waters still managed to score numerous releases through various Armada sub-labels (including Armada Captivating and Who's Afraid Of 138?!), all while continuously perfecting his craft.
Earlier this year, Waters released his incredibly fresh single “Freak” via Monstercat, a label that took note of his off-kilter, underground production style.
Just two months later, Mr. Waters is back once again with “A Lot Like You,” a track that takes a complete 180 from the direction of his last Monstercat release. “A Lot Like You” sees Waters returning to the world of progressive trance, but with a little bit of a bite this time around.
We won't spoil all the surprises this track has to offer, though.
﻿
We had the pleasure of having Waters for a brief Q&A, where he explained the inspiration behind “A Lot Like You,” among other various topics. Check out the interview below:
Hey Zachari! Thanks for joining us today.
Thanks for having me!
First of all, this new track is absolutely stunning. Can you tell us a little bit about it and where the inspiration for it came from?
I started writing the song about a year ago. I was really attracted to contrasting sounds and styles within the same song, so experimenting between the bright and dark aspects felt really natural. It was only until midway through the year that I realized that the contrast was reflective of the relationship I have with my father, and our journey through accepting music as a career despite some hesitation and friction early on. The first 2 minutes represents the early chaotic stage, the breakdown is the realization, and the last minute is the resolution. I think the vocal suited the story so well too, like the final piece of the jigsaw. The sample itself wasn't too spectacular quality wise so I ended up singing it instead.
Would you say this is your favorite track that you've produced? If not, what is?
I think I'd have to say yes. I can't recall putting this much effort into a single before.
Who are some of the key artists that have influenced your sound?
A pretty broad variety, and for a bunch of different reasons! Above & Beyond for emotion, Porter Robinson for innovation, deadmau5 for progression, Gesaffelstein for experimentation. Recently though, guys like Bad Computer and Alon Mor have been motivating me to push harder with sound design and production techniques.
How has it been working with Monstercat (a label that typically doesn't release music in your style)?
Like a dream. I'm so grateful for the opportunity that Monstercat have given me to release music, especially in such varying styles. The freedom that they give artists to create is incredibly refreshing.
Since the end of the 2017 is nigh, what was your favorite single & album of the year?
Favourite album I'd have to say is Long Awaited Journey by Alon Mor. If you're a producer, do yourself a favor and sit through this masterpiece. This guy has set the benchmark for production quality. Favorite Single is a tricky one, but I'd have to say “The End of Us” by Xavi. The contrast between start and finish is amazing, and the progression is somehow melancholic and uplifting simultaneously. 10/10 snare too.
Do you ever get confused for Zak Waters (the vocalist)?
I used to a fair bit, especially when I was new to Twitter. I think I joined at the same time he featured on a Madeon record. I still have hopes of collaborating with him eventually.
Can you give us some insight into any collaborations or special projects you're working on?
I've been working on an alias for the past few years. I can't give much away at this stage but I'm sure more info will unfold in the near future! Collaboration wise: a new one with EDDIE, a techno number with Blair Rouge, and something cooking with Bad Computer.

Two brothers have been arrested on suspicion of murder in connection with the deaths of their parents, whose bodies were found in their San Jose home over the weekend near what sources said was a scrawled message apologizing for a "clumsy" killing. Michelle Roberts reports. (Published Thursday, April 28, 2016)
Two brothers have been arrested on suspicion of murder in connection with the deaths of their parents, whose bodies were found in their San Jose home over the weekend near what sources said was a scrawled message apologizing for a "clumsy" killing.
Police on Thursday announced the arrests of Hasib Bin Golamrabbi, 22, and his 17-year-old brother, who attends Evergreen High School.
"Needless to say," Evergreen Islamic Center spokesman Faisal Yazadi said,"this is one of those tragedies nobody ever wants to be in. All we can do is pray."
Golamrabbi had been missing until he was taken into custody Wednesday night. NBC Bay Area was the first to report, through sources, that Golamrabbi had been found near Tracy in the Central Valley. Jail records show Golamrabbi was booked Thursday morning and held without bail.
Son Held With No Bail After Parents Found Shot to Death in San Jose Home: Records
The son of a Bangladeshi-born couple who have lived in San Jose for the last three decades, was taken into custody after his parents were found shot to death in their home on Sunday. Damian Trujillo reports (Published Thursday, April 28, 2016)
The younger son — who was in school Monday and whom police initially said was not a suspect — was booked into juvenile hall. NBC Bay Area is not naming him because he is a minor.
They have not yet been charged by the district attorney.
The brothers' parents, 59-year-old Golam and 57-year-old Shamima Rabbi, both natives of Bangladesh, were found shot to death Sunday afternoon inside their Lucas Court home.
Video Muslim Funeral For Double Homicide Victims Delayed
Board members at the mosque where the couple attends said the Rabbi's bodies were released Wednesday afternoon to relatives and the funeral is being planned for Friday at the Five Pillars Farm Cemetery in Livermore.
Police did not provide evidence or a motive in announcing the arrests but said "there are no outstanding suspects." Sources told NBC Bay Area the parents did not approve of the older son's sexual orientation. Cousin Nafees Hasan said his family had never discussed that matter, but if it were true, the "family wouldn't have accepted that." He added the parents were very strict about gender orientation.
Sources who witnessed the crime scene before police arrived told NBC Bay Area chilling messages were written on the floor and wall near the bodies, including one that read: "Sorry my first killing was clumsy."
Another, longer message, allegedly ended, "I can't be like you, telling a lie. I can't love someone without telling them."
San Jose police have not confirmed the validity of the messages, and it is unclear who wrote them.
Efforts to reach the brothers or find out if they had attorneys were unsuccessful. A cousin thought they might be looking into public defenders. When reached Thursday morning, several neighbors and mosque members said they knew nothing of the arrests until notified by NBC Bay Area.
"I can't believe it," said mosque board member and family friend Hasan Rahim, who described both sons as "taciturn." While the father was very friendly, Rahim said, the boys were "not very communicative," Rahim said.
As for the older son's sexual orientation, Rahim had never heard the father, with whom he was friends, talk about it. And even if it were true, Rahim is of the belief that the Silicon Valley Bangladeshi community is more tolerant of homosexuality, which is forbidden in Bangladesh.
"Live and let live,” Hasan said. “The Pope said it most famously,' Who am I to judge.' "
Everybody knows cheating is rampant in India, but there's just something about these images:
In the ultimate act of enabling, hundreds of parents and family members in Bihar were caught on camera brazenly climbing walls and standing on window ledges to pass papers to students taking the state's class 10 standardized test.
One parent told NDTV why he felt the need to help his kid: ”These government teachers don't teach anything in schools. Most of the time they are absent. That's why we have to resort to such things to help our children.”
The government doesn't do anything to help students because it doesn't have to, economist Atanu Dey tells Quartz. Bihar is a mineral-rich state, so there's no incentive for corrupt government officials to focus on education.
“This is called the natural-resource curse,” Dey says.“Whoever controls the levers of government gets to extract quite a lot of that wealth.” One reason places like Hong Kong and Singapore have high rates of education is that they don't have natural resources, so the governments have to invest in their people for economic gain, Dey says.
Students around the country have been taking the class 10 and class 12 board exams this month, inspiring obsessive news recaps. Students must pass the class 10 exams to move on to upper secondary school and to eventually have a chance at university.
Because the government has such low incentive to invest in education, there are limited seats in class 11 and a miniscule acceptance rate at India's most competitive colleges. So in order to get one of those seats, it's not enough to just study and do well on these tests, Dey says. You have to be the best.
“It's a dog-eat-dog world, in some sense,” Dey says. “Poor government leads to these outcomes.”
A brazen attitude
School authorities in Bihar have barred more than 500 students from taking the test in response to this latest round of open cheating. The state's education minister put some of the blame on parents, telling press that the state could not be expected to ensure fair testing with more than 1.4 million test takers.
This isn't the first cheating scandal to hit India. NDTV notes that a few hundred students faced the same punishment for cheating during Class 12 exams last year, and an LA Times story last year detailed nation-wide stories of bribery and high-tech cheating.
The cheating in Bihar has been open, with few people seeming to expect this level of retribution. A Indian photojournalist who documented the students cheating told the BBC that no one seemed to take note or stop what they were doing when he started taking photos.
Amitava Kumar wrote A Matter of Rats, a book about Bihar's capital city, Patna. In it he details how administrative corruption and entitlement have created a culture of open cheating without consequences, even past secondary school. From the book:
Revelations about Songs of Experience on “Written in My Soul”
Original Story by Aaron J. Sams (2017-10-18)
Bono was interviewed on Bill Flanagan's show “Written in My Soul” which airs on Sirius XM radio (satellite radio.) We've put together some notes about this interview which originally aired on October 18, 2017, but was recorded just as “The Blackout” was released, on Labour Day in the Sirius XM studios in New York City. The interview opens with a discussion of “You're The Best Thing About Me”, which at the point of the interview had not been released yet. Flanagan has heard the entire album, and likens it to going on a journey, and says it's better than Achtung Baby. We will try to cover some interesting points from the interview, but it will be far from covering the whole interview. The interview will repeat on Sirius XM over the next week, if you have access.
There is a new song on the deluxe version of the album “The Book of Your Heart” a song about helping your partner to get through life and vice versa. Not on the main album, but only on the deluxe version. Bono writes about the cold passion of relationships. “Great relationships need management. In a great relationship that management is shared”, and Bono feels he was managed through difficult periods by Ali.
“Landlady” is a song about Ali helping Bono out as the band was starting. “The landlady is the person that put you up and paid your keep.” Bono: “I rather liked it”.
“Summer of Love” is a sexy song, but a dark undertow, and the song deals with Aleppo. It starts as a couple in a position of privilege talking about moving to California and moving on in life, but as the song shifts it becomes a song about refugees drowning, trying to get to a better life. Bono: “It's so light a listen, you can miss the dark undertow in it. It's a beautiful sexy song.” Bono talks about looking out on the Mediterranean at his home in France, and realizing it was the same water that refugees are dying in, risking everything to flee war. Lyric: “I've been thinking of the west coast, but not the one everyone knows” (a reference to Syria)
There's a “lunatic preacher” who is “reinventing the attitude” at the end of “Get Out of Your Own Way” going into the start of “American Soul”: “Blessed are the superstars, in their luminescence we discover our own inadequacy. Blessed are the filthy rich, for you can only truly own what you give away, like your pain. Blessed are the arrogant, for theirs is the kingdom of their own company. Blessed are the bullies, for one day they will have to stand up to themselves. Bom bob. “American Soul.” Blessed are the liars. Bom bom. Because the truth can be awkward.”
“Love is Bigger Than Anything In Its Way” is the first time Bono has sung about the house he lives in in Killiney: “If the moonlight caught you crying in Killiney bay, sing your song, let your song be song. If you listen you will hear the silence, when you think you're done you've just begun”. Song is a letter to his sons, what he would say to them if it was the last thing he could say to them. “The door is open for you to go through. If I could I came too. But the path is made by you as you're walking. Start singing stop talking. If I can only listen to what I say. Love is bigger than anything in its way. So young to be the words of your own song. I know the rage in you is strong. So write a world where we can belong to each other, and sing it like no other. I could listen to what I say. Love is bigger than anything in its way”.
“American Soul” will follow “Get Out of Your Own Way” on the album.
“Summer of Love” will follow “American Soul” on the album.
“The Showman” contains the lyrics “you look so good a little better you look so good that's whats going to get you” and may be what happened to the song “Much More Better”. It's a letter to the audience to be careful of performers. Lyric: “I lie for a living, i love to let on, but you make it true, when you sing along”. Bono says its almost a country twist to the song. Lyric: “Babies cry because they are born to sing. Singers cry about everything. Still in the playground falling off a swing. But you know by now. Walk through the room like a birthday cake. When I'm all lit up You can't make a mistake. There's a level of shallow you just can't fake. You know that I know. You don't care. You Know I'm there.”
“The Showman” will lead into “The Little Things that Give You Away” on the album. It is conversation where your innocence challenges the person you've become.
Bono enjoys the psalms where David argues with God, and “The Lights of Home” is Bono arguing with God. Lyric: “I saw a statue of a gold guitar”.
The studio version of “The Blackout” was played as going to commercial break and about 45 seconds of the studio version of the song was heard. After the break, the conversation shifted to a discussion of Leonard Cohen, the merits of focusing on just being an artist instead of pursuing his activism, Father Jack Heaslip, a discussion of “Kite”, written as a letter to Bono's daughters as a precursor to this new album which has been described as a series of letters to family and friends, and even to the audience. The music at the end of the second segment was “Kite” from All That You Can't Leave Behind.

New CBS News poll out confirms every other poll we've seen on the topic – the American people are solidly against tax cuts for the rich.
53% of respondents said there should only be tax cuts for the middle class and no tax cuts for people making over $250,000. That's the number most people in the media are using, but that's not quite accurate. Another 14% said they don't want tax cuts for anybody, including the top bracket. So, the reality is that an overwhelming 67% of the country don't want tax cuts for the rich (including 52% of Republican voters!). Only 26% said that everyone should get a tax cut, including the rich.
So, let's do the math for people who are a little slow. That's 67% to 26%. That's a crushing 41% lead. If it was an election, that margin would be so large they would think it was rigged. The group that doesn't want tax cuts for the rich is more than two and half times the group that does.
If that weren't enough, there is an internal memo being sent around to Democrats on the Hill by Anzalone Liszt Research that shows that 77% of Americans would let the Bush tax cuts for the rich expire if the extra money went toward helping small businesses and balancing the budget. 77%!!!
Now, as a politician, how stupid do you have to be on the other side of this issue? . . .
But that's not entirely fair because the Republicans have built their entire party on being on the other side of this issue and they're doing well. Why? Because they get handsomely compensated by those same millionaires and billionaires who benefit from the tax cuts. They use the money they collect from those guys into deceiving the American people into voting for them during the elections. That sucks for the rest of us, but at least that makes sense. There is a logical reason for them to take the more unpopular side of this equation.
Democrats on the other hand just got their ass kicked by that money spent to make sure they lose. Now, they would like to do a favor for the people who just killed them in the election and in the meanwhile take a position that 67% to 77% of the American people are against. How stupid do you have to be to do that?
That is the position of the Obama administration right now as they argue for a “compromise” where they extend the Bush tax cuts for the rich for another two years. Even Pat Buchanan laughed on-air and said that's no compromise at all. That's complete victory for the GOP. Remember, in two years there will be a new president – and if it's a Republican, the tax cuts will be extended forever. Complete and utter victory for one side. Complete and utter capitulation for the other side. Pathetic.
Of course, there are two other explanations for the actions of Obama White House. The first one is that they're not dumb, they are embarrassingly weak. They know they should side with 67% of the American people, they know they shouldn't help the people who crushed them in the last election, they know they are showing no leadership by constantly cratering to the other side, but they can't help themselves. It is in Obama's nature to always compromise, no matter what the situation is. He hates to fight. He is No Drama Obama. He will do anything to avoid a confrontation, including giving the other side exactly what they want in the guise of a sage and tempered compromise.
The last possible explanation is the worst of all. He is complicit. He is among the top 2%. So is nearly everyone he knows. Everyone in his bubble is rich, fabulously rich. So, all of the people he knows thinks it's a brilliant idea to give more tax cuts to the rich, namely them. Plus, most of the Democrats also get campaign donations from the millionaires and billionaires. Though it's self-destructive in the long run because those guys will always give more to the Republicans, they can't wean themselves off of that money. So, they go along with whatever their rich funders want.
All three options are sickening. But there is no fourth option. No one in their right mind can possibly think that opposing at least 67% of the American people to help the political opposition is a good political idea.
And one last note, when President Obama agrees to this and they add another $140 billion dollars to the deficit over the next two years because of these tax cuts for the rich, who do you think the Republicans will blame for that deficit? You guessed it, the man who just gave them everything they wanted — Barack Obama.
Come on, how stupid do you have to be? Or at least, I hope they're just stupid and not the other options.

However they dress up their worries in the rhetoric of freedom, the great complaint of the naysayers is having to campaign at all. A faith that once faced lions is indignant about being challenged.
“We're under assault,” cries Cory Bernardi but offers no proof of rough treatment. Sure, the contest has been a bit too willing at times but where's the biff? Where are the martyrs? Who has actually been silenced?
Free speech has won every round that matters in this contest.

Yet the Catholic archbishop of Sydney, Anthony Fisher, lists at number two on his scare sheet of “5 reasons I will be voting no”: “People's right to speak freely is endangered if they can be dragged before anti-discrimination tribunals, fined or fired for speaking in favour of real marriage.”
Put to one side Fisher's legal right to fire anyone he employs who speaks in favour of equal marriage, what's he talking about here?
One Christian at IBM and another at Macquarie University have both been targeted by a zealous yes warrior who reckons they should be dismissed because their advocacy for traditional marriage is at odds with the ethos of their employers. So have they lost their jobs? No and nor should they.
The result? A good win for free speech.
Julian Porteous, archbishop of Hobart, faced an anti-discrimination tribunal last year when another yes zealot Martine Delaney complained a church booklet on marriage was insulting and offensive to gay men and women and the children they raise.
Was Porteous dragged? Hardly. Handcuffed? No. He had a couple of conciliation sessions with Delaney who then withdrew her complaint in May last year. The church won.
Yet every campaigner for no cites the Hobart case as an outrage against liberty. Porteous speaks darkly of issues left unanswered by the Tasmanian anti-discrimination commissioner, “In particular the ability of the church to freely express its view on marriage.”
But Your Grace, you won. Hands down. The church's freedom to distribute your pamphlet Don't Mess with Marriage is now beyond question across Australia.
Even the Institute of Public Affairs, while deploring the laws in Tasmania, acknowledged the result as a victory for free speech and freedom of religion.
Those unhappy mothers in those television ads afraid their boys will be put into frocks and endure lessons on gender fluidity don't remind viewers that the church campaign – backed heavily by News Corp – killed the federal Safe Schools program.
The last federal money runs out in October. It won't be renewed this side of a Labor victory at the polls.
I don't call that a victory for free speech, but who can deny it was a smashing victory for the hardliners of the faith. It's their biggest win in the perpetual syllabus wars since they lost on evolution.
Depicting such victories as defeats is strategy 101: always claim to be the underdog. But there is something else going on here: a sense that the real offence to religious liberty is having to go into battle to defend it. Win or lose, the hardliners resent the contest. It shouldn't be necessary. And it shouldn't be so hard.
Church leaders have been complaining for years about finding themselves driven from the public square. They love that phrase. It's so first century. Well they are in the square now and finding it uncomfortable.
They feel the rules are skewed against them. In a way they're right. What works in the pulpit doesn't work in the square.
The message of every sermon I heard when I was growing up – and I sat through hundreds – was fear of the future. Over and over again I was told that only Christ could save us from the terrors that lie ahead.
It kept me in line for years.
Tony Abbott preaches the terrifying consequences of equal marriage. John Howard in his grizzled suburban way has the same message of fear. So do those unhappy mums on TV.
At the launch of the no campaign last Saturday night Cory Bernardi preached pure terror: should equal marriage become law, anti-discrimination laws will be “weaponised” and “legal warfare” will be waged against supporters of traditional marriage.
Bernardi's congregation gave him an ovation. But out in the square citizens are doing what worshippers never dare from the pews: asking questions, disputing facts and even, from time to time, having a laugh at the expense of the religious.
Hardliners find this difficult to handle. They are used to respecting and obedience. It's the air they breathe. Anything less can seem a portent of the dystopian future in which religious liberties will disappear one by one once we allow equal marriage.
They should take heart.
Don't doubt the sincerity of the fight to limit the rights of LGBTI. That's deep in the DNA of the faiths
The laws of God may be going out the window, but the laws of politics will remain hard and fast. All the dark outcomes predicted by Bernardi and Abbott and Howard and the commentariat of News Corp must first pass parliament.
Politicians aren't going to suddenly commit political suicide just because blokes can marry each other. Democracy will continue to work. Nothing will change without public backing. Parliaments will be the best protection the churches have for religious liberty.
But not for religious privilege. That's where the warriors of no have every reason to worry about the future.
Over the last 60 years, the people of Australia have walked away from traditional Christian teaching on sex and marriage. This profound shift has been fought every step of the way by the churches. But where the community has led, parliaments have eventually followed.
Secular law is permeated with church doctrine that's not about mercy or turning the other cheek. Euthanasia. Surrogacy. Abortion. Contempt for LGBTI. These laws are inevitably under scrutiny by a community less and less persuaded by old church teaching.
In the face of this slide, church leaders are demanding in the name of religious liberty that there be no more change. Things must stay as they are. That's not a demand for freedom, but protection.
The postal ballot is a great risk for the churches. Their power has always rested on the shadowy notion that they can rally great forces in a crisis. Well the crisis has come but this time their remaining power will be precisely calibrated. The result will be known down to the last number.

Very secular.
But if they do lose, and lose badly, other changes will follow. That's inevitable. But we won't fall off a cliff. Change will be democratic, slow and cautious. It always is in this country. Attacks on true religious liberty are unimaginable.
Don't doubt the sincerity of the fight to limit the rights of LGBTI. That's deep in the DNA of the faiths. But they are fighting this campaign knowing that anything but a convincing win will transform their political standing in this country for the worse.
A bad loss in the ballot will confirm there is indeed a slippery slope here, and they are on it.
But if they win, Australia will have fallen victim to martyrs that never were and fears that could never be realised mustered by faiths that hold to a distaste for homosexuality that this country no longer shares.

Bitnation, the decentralised governance project which offers blockchain IDs and Bitcoin debit cards to refugees, has done a deal with Estonia to offer a Public Notary to e-Residents.
Starting December 1 2015, the blockchain notary service will allow e-residents, regardless of where they live or do business, to notarise their marriages, birth certificates, business contracts and more, on the blockchain.
The blockchain is a public ledger distributed across hundreds of thousands of computers around the world. The distributed and immutable nature of this public notary makes it more secure than any notary currently offered by traditional nation states.
The Estonian e-Residency programme is far and away the most advanced of its kind on the planet. This agreement takes that a step further into wholesale decentralisation.
Bitnation is doing for identity and statehood, what Bitcoin is doing for money. Bitnation CEO and founder Susanne Templehof has said, in reference to the current refugee crisis, that the project seeks to eradicate the most criminal part of our existing legacy systems – borders.
She told IBTimes in an email: "We have made a deal with Estonia, and the ultimate goal is to gain recognition for Bitnation as a sovereign entity, thus creating a precedent for open source protocol to be considered as sovereign jurisdictions."
Bitnation, as the world's first blockchain powered virtual nation, provides "DIY governance services", and has received international attention for providing refugee emergency response and world citizenship ID on the blockchain, as well as pioneering marriage, land titles, birth certificates etc.
On the subject of marriage, Templehof points out that in many countries gay marriage, for example, is illegal: "Blockchain doesn't give a s**t about that," she said.
Estonian e-Residency is an initiative that allows anyone around the world to take advantage of the secure authenticated online identity the Estonian government already offers its 1.3 million residents.
Kaspar Korjus Estonia's e-Residency program director, said: "In Estonia we believe that people should be able to freely choose their digital/public services best fit to them, regardless of the geographical area where they were arbitrarily born. We're truly living in exciting times when nation states and virtual nations compete and collaborate with each other on an international market, to provide better governance services."
If a couple get married on the Public Notary, it doesn't mean they get married in the jurisdiction of Estonia, or in any other nation state jurisdiction. Instead, they get married in the "blockchain jurisdiction".
The technology provides a worldwide legally binding proof of existence and integrity of contractual agreements for things like banking, incorporating companies quickly and cheaply, and generally empowering entrepreneurs and citizens around the world.
Tempelhof said she believes the Estonian government understands the dynamics of the globalisation era far better than any other government she can think of.
"I'm delighted to work with Estonia's e-Residency program to set a standard practice of competition of governance services on a global market, and to enable others to exercise self-determination and follow Bitnation's path to sovereignty" she said.

SDF troops capture more ground in Raqqa, expel ISIS from two districts
ARA News
On the first anniversary of the liberation of Manbij city from ISIS, the Manbij Military Council said it will protect the city from the Syrian regime and Turkey-backed rebels.
The Manbij Military Council was formed by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) during the fight against ISIS in Syria's northern Manbij city.
“We must take the interests of all the social parties into consideration and overcome any forms of division and disputes, in order to confront any hostile agenda by the Syrian regime and pro-Turkey rebel groups,” the council said in an official statement on Tuesday.
“We in the Manbij Military Council pledged ourselves and our martyrs before God and our people, that we will remain ready to defend the gains of the people in Manbij and its countryside,” it said.
“We will do whatever it takes to ensure security and stability in Manbij. We will not hesitate at any moment to exercise our legitimate right to defend the city against any possible attacks by any party, in parallel with continuing to pursue terrorism that threatens our country, our cities and villages.”
“At the same time, we affirm that we will continue our vital mission in defending Manbij from any potential danger, whether from the regime or from the mercenary groups operating under the precepts of the regional states,” the council concluded.

Louisville Metro Police have arrested two additional teenagers in connection with the shooting death of a 30-year-old man in the Cherokee Triangle neighborhood.
The suspects, both 15 years old, were taken into custody Thursday, according to a statement from LMPD spokeswoman Alicia Smiley.
Jason Spencer, a Humana employee and creator of the Louisville Humor Twitter account, was killed Sunday night while walking with his wife in the Cherokee Triangle neighborhood.
Police spokesman Dwight Mitchell said Thursday it was a "botched robbery attempt."

Background: Humana employee killed in Cherokee Triangle shooting, teen arrested
The first suspect, another 15-year-old boy, was found shot later Sunday near the intersection of 11th and Hill streets in the Park Hill neighborhood. A police statement on Tuesday said Spencer had a gun and returned fire at the suspects.
Police did not immediately respond Thursday to requests for information on the injured 15-year-old suspects' charges or whether there were other outstanding suspects.
The condition of the shot suspect has not been confirmed.
The homicide prompted alarm from neighbors, leading to more police patrols in the Highlands neighborhood, according to a newsletter from the district's councilman.
"Murder and violent gun crime in the Highlands are rare, so, naturally, District 8 is shocked, saddened and scared right now," Councilman Brandon Coan said in a newsletter to constituents Tuesday night.
This year, there have been 99 homicides in Jefferson County. Last year, LMPD handled 118 criminal homicides investigations, the most in its 14-year history.

Spencer's death marked the first murder in Coan's District 8 since December 2015 and the seventh since 2011, according to Coan.
The police response after a homicide varies by neighborhood, said John Bradley, LMPD's public information commander.
"In essence, it is up to the division commander to take a look at it and formulate a plan," Bradley said. "The standard part is that the division commander is confronted with a homicide in his division and looks at the factors and decides what resources to place in different areas."
LMPD's Fifth Division, where Coan's District 8 is located, has the lowest total combined crime (violent and property) and calls for service of all eight LMPD divisions.
"I think the difference is that Councilman Coan's area has not traditionally had the kind of violence that my area experiences on a regular basis," said Councilman David James, whose District 6 includes neighborhoods such as Algonquin, California, Shelby Park and Smoketown. "So he is experiencing what me and some of my other council members experience daily and weekly."

Health Care Plan Championed By Trump Hurts Counties That Voted For Him
The Affordable Care Act replacement plan championed by President Trump would hurt low-income people in rural areas that voted heavily for the Republican last fall, according to an NPR analysis of data on proposed subsidy changes from the Kaiser Family Foundation.
The new changes in tax credits and subsidies for older Americans are a big reason many Republicans are hesitant to get behind the American Health Care Act, which is set for a vote in the House on Thursday.
A major component of the Affordable Care Act, subsidies helped lower- and middle-income people offset the cost of the health care premiums.
If the new GOP replacement plan does pass — which is still very much in up in the air — the bill would still face substantial hurdles in the Senate. Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins articulated her opposition to the bill in its current form Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press, citing how it "disproportionately affects older rural Americans."
In an effort to woo reluctant members, one of the amendments announced on Monday evening by House leaders would give the Senate the opportunity to give more tax credits to people aged 50 to 64. However, there's no requirement to make that happen once it passes over to the Senate.
Still, as the Congressional Budget Office also found, it's older, poorer people who would see some of the largest reduction in both cost and coverage.
And they're also largely in rural areas and smaller counties that voted overwhelmingly for Trump. According to NPR's analysis of the 2016 election results, Trump won 68.5 percent of the vote in rural counties, and he also carried smaller counties with a similar 63.4 percent of the vote. That's based on classifications by the U.S. Department of Agriculture that factors in both their level of urbanization and their proximity to metro areas; the groupings of rural counties and small counties are reliant on the degree of urbanization in the county.
But in major metropolitan areas, Trump only got 44 percent of the vote compared to Clinton's majority.
And ultimately it's those major metro areas that would see some of the smallest changes to the health care subsidies they're receiving. For example, both 27-year-olds and 40-year-olds making $20,000 per year would only see a drop in their subsidies by about $1,000. However, 60-year-olds in metro areas in that same income bracket would see their subsidies decrease by almost $5,000.
But 27- and 40-year-olds in higher income brackets from $40,000 to $75,000 a year would actually see an uptick in their subsidies, ranging from $1,500 to $3,000. In 60-year-olds, though, only those making $75,000 a year would see an increase in subsidies of about $4,000. Sixty-year-olds in other income groups would see a dip.
In the more Trump-friendly areas, those differences are far more pronounced. In rural counties, a 60-year-old who makes just $20,000 a year would see their subsidies drop by $6,700. Only a 60-year-old who makes $75,000 or more a year would see an uptick. However, 27- and 40-year-olds who make at least $40,000 a year in rural areas would see an increase in subsidies, ranging from just over $1,000 to $3,000 more for a 40-year-old who makes $75,000. Smaller counties would also see similar changes.
Why the change in different areas around the country? The major reason seems to be because, unlike the Affordable Care Act, the Republican bill does not take the local cost of insurance into account — usually much higher in rural areas — and doesn't increase the subsidies if local insurance premiums rise. And credits are the same across the board regardless of income.
Overall, though, despite the fact that premiums are typically higher in rural areas, people in metro areas would be less affected by the potential subsidy changes. For a 40-year-old who makes $30,000 a year, subsidies would drop in rural and small areas, but there's about a $1,016 difference between rural areas and metro areas, where 40-year-olds in that income bracket would see an increase. Ultimately, the discrepancies between rural and metro areas only begins to close in higher income brackets.
Trump has traveled over the past week to some of the areas that might be most adversely affected by the bill, though both in Nashville, Tenn., and Louisville, Ky., his lobbying at the campaign rallies he held was not that pronounced. And many of the conservative members who are on the fence about the bill come from rural areas or small towns — that went heavily for Trump.
But even if the law does pass and these changes go into effect, it's unclear if once-loyal voters would turn on Trump or even place the blame with him. A telling anecdote from the Washington Post's Jenna Johnson covering Trump's rally last week was a woman who praised Trump for lowering her son's premiums by almost $500 since he took office. However, those changes were due to the Affordable Care Act, not anything enacted by Trump in the two months since he took office.
Methodology
Kaiser Family Foundation estimated differences in federal subsidies under the proposed Republican plan in 2020 at the county level. A caveat: Kaiser's analysis at the $20,000 income level excludes Alaska, Minnesota, New York and Washington, D.C. In 2020, those residents would be eligible for Medicaid (Alaska and Washington, D.C.) or the Basic Health Program (Minnesota and New York).
We grouped each county into one of three groups based on its USDA Rural-Urban Continuum Code. Metro counties had a code between 1 and 3, small-town counties had a code between 4 and 7, rural counties had a code of either 8 or 9.
Election results data came from the Associated Press. These results were last updated on Nov. 28, 2016, and are not the final certified results. The average vote calculations for rural, smaller and metro counties do not include Alaska, as the AP does not report election results on the county level in Alaska.
We calculated an average value for each county grouping, weighted by population. For each county, we multiplied the county's dollar difference for each age and income bracket by the county's population (according to 2015 American Community Survey 5-Year data) to create a weighted score. Then, for each county grouping (metro, small town, metro), we summed the weighted scores for each age and income bracket and divided it by the summed population of those county groupings.
Donington Park is undertaking a major upgrade plan this winter including a new restaurant, circuit office, grandstands and rebranding having been acquired by the MotorSport Vision Group (MSV) this year.
In August it was confirmed MSV were given the green light to take over the Leicestershire circuit by the Competition and Markets Authority having initially reached an agreement in January this year. MSV, which also runs Brands Hatch, Snetterton, Oulton Park, Cadwell Park and Bedford Autodrome, have secured a 21-year lease of the Donington Park estate and had key plans in place to upgrade the circuit after this season's racing calendar wrapped up to prepare for 2018.
The major changes include making the paddock entrance into the circuit's main entrance with current pedestrian and vehicle roads resurface, work that had commenced earlier this year, while a brand-new grandstand is being constructed on the outside of Hollywood corner to provide views from Redgate all the way to Schwantz Curve which will boost circuit capacity.
A new circuit office next to the Formula E office buildings is being built plus a new restaurant and bar for spectators on the Donington Park grounds along with a complete rebranding to come into line with MSV's colours – switching from blue and white to red and white.

“We look forward to launching Donington Park's 2018 season with vastly-improved facilities for all our customers, whether they are spectators, competitors or track day participants,” Giles Butterfield, Group Operations Manager at MSV, told WorldSBK.com. “The works that are already underway at Donington Park will ensure this great circuit is brought in line with our other venues across the UK.”
Donington Park will host a number of major championships in 2018 including World Superbikes, British Superbikes and the British Touring Car Championship. The circuit was also in the running for MotoGP but missed out on a deal to Silverstone.
Watching the Baltimore Ravens offense was troubling, disturbing, if not frustrating.
Not because of anything the Ravens do, or did. But because of how the offense operates, even when not at full strength.
In my opinion the closest receiver in the NFL to Mike Wallace is Baltimore's Torrey Smith. Both are home run hitting receivers who draw cloud coverage regularly, and are called on to utilize their speed to create big plays.
In Baltimore's offense the Ravens move Smith around to create favorable matchups. And not just for Smith, but for the entire team. One snap he's the Z, one snap he's the Y, the next series he's the X.
The Ravens use Smith like a chess piece.
Larry Fitzgerald moves in Arizona. Brandon Marshall moves in Chicago. Andre Johnson moves in Houston, and Desean Jackson is all over the place in Philadelphia.
After four games Smith has caught 21 passes for 435 yards and has scored one touchdown for the Ravens. He's averaging 20.7 yards per reception, which is slightly higher than his career average of 17.8 yards per reception since joining the NFL in 2011.
Now let us take a look at Mike Wallace, whom I wrote a column about in Friday's newspaper, explaining how he's a mystery to everyone, INCLUDING the Dolphins coaching staff. READ IT PLEASE, because I wrote it for you. Yeah, I'm talking to YOU.
Wallace, who came to Miami averaging 17.1 yards per reception, is sparingly moves. He's on the right side of Miami's formation approximately 95 percent of Miami's plays. He's usually getting cloud coverage, and the only time the Dolphins throw deep to him is when Ryan Tannehill sees single-safety high looks, which are usually baited looks trying to get Miami to waste a down.
Why is Wallace, who came to the Dolphins averaging 17.1 yards per carry, so stagnant in Miami's offense?
“There are a number of reasons," coach Joe Philbin tried to explain. "Primarily, when we are in our quick tempo and moving things around, we want to get guys in a position where they can line up a little bit faster, get the play entry in and get the clock moving. That's the primary reason.”
Hold up! Are the Dolphins a quick, uptempo team? NO. Rarely!
Even without huddling, how difficult would it be to put Wallace in motion, or have him line up as the slot?
Can keeping Wallace so stagnant in the offense be used against the Dolphins considering it doesn't challenge an opposing defensive coordinator, or possibly force confusion to opposing defenses?
Look at it from the reverse perspective. Wouldn't Torrey Smith vs. Jimmy Wilson is the slot scare the crap out of the Dolphins coaches?
“They can match up. There will not be a lot of mysteries to what side, as you mentioned, to where we line up," Philbin explained. "That's their decision. I can't speak to how much of an advantage it is.”
So, Philbin just said there's no mystery to the Dolphins offense? No attempt to confuse defenses, no desire to create favorable mismatches?
That's a head-scratcher!
“There are different ways of doing it," Philbin said, explaining why Wallace doesn't get moved. "That's just a decision we made, and that's how we do it. I don't know if there is a specific downside to it.”
WELL, I'd say having the Dolphins' most expensive player, and the biggest offensive playmaker serve as a decoy is a major downside.
Wallace has 15 catches for 176 yards and one touchdown, but most of those stats come from his Colts game, which was a game Indianapolis gave him a lot of off coverage looks, and he turned those looks into nine catches for 115 yards and a touchdown.
It is highly unlikely that another NFL team will cover Wallace with off coverage again. Why would they if he's contained in man coverage with a safety over the top?
Every NFL team's strategy will likely be to make everyone else on the Dolphins offense beat them, and it appears the Dolphins are comfortable with that.
But is Wallace?
"I'm not trying to lead the league in yards or catches. I'm definitely not the only guy getting these coverages, but other guys still make plays," said Wallace, who is tied with Brandon Gibson for the second most targets (28) on the team, and also tied with him for a team-leading three drops.
"There's no excuse for me to use. I look at it as a weak point in my game if guys are covering me and I can't get open. That's weak on my part," Wallace told the Sun-Sentinel. "If I want to be the player I set out to be I can't use that as an excuse. I feel like I should still be getting open, still be making plays."
But is he being put in position to succeed by the Dolphins coaching staff?
"It is an adjustment standing on one side, but it is something I'm getting used to. Sometimes you want to go to the other side because there are certain mismatches in certain games. You want to get to a cornerback, or you want to run a certain route off a certain coverage," Wallace said. "But that's just not the way the offense is. Every day I learn to accept it. I'm not going against it. I'm just continuing to play and continuing to work."

INDORE: Improving the financial health of the state-owned BSNL is the top priority of the BJP-led NDA government, telecom minister Ravishankar Prasad said on Sunday."To improve the financial condition of BSNL is my top priority. We are trying our best in this direction. We are going to better BSNL for sure," Prasad said at a BSNL function here.In a veiled attack on the previous UPA regime, he said, "BSNL was in 10,000 crore profit when the tenure of Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led government came to an end in 2004."10 years later when we (NDA) returned (to power), we found BSNL running in 8,000 crore loss", the telecom minister added.He said the NDA government's steps to improve BSNL has started paying off as the telecom company's operating profit has come to 672 crore in the last fiscal.The minister said he along with BSNL chairman and chief managing director (CMD) Anupam Shrivastava will move around in the city on Monday to personally know the areas facing call drop problems.The BJP leader further said he had directed officials to ensure that the state-owned company provides the best service during the Simhastha-Kumbh Mela beginning April 22 at a religious city in (adjoining) Ujjain district.Stressing on the need for a rapid change in the functioning of Post department, he said, "I want to bring it out of ... somber state. Post department staffers should provide services to customers with a smile."According to the minister, efforts are on to link Post Department with e-commerce and the Centre was working on launching payment bank by March 2017.

As is our custom we loaded up the Econoline and made our way out to Lafayette, Louisiana this weekend for the big Festival International party in Acadiana.
It's the finest music festival in the state.
The best concert we saw in 2015 was staged at Festival. Dakhabrakha, a group of drummers, accordionists and singers from Ukraine leveled Lafayette Parish leaving a stunned crowd writhing on the pavement in front of the stage.
It was a real eye-opener.
Unfortunately that experience was not duplicated this year. We saw some great bands but none was on the level of the Ukrainians.
You could go just for the food, wear earplugs, and not even listen to a single group and have the time of your life as the organizers curate a who's who of Cajun cooking to keep the crowd fed.
We gorged on pistolettes, feasted on po boys and took down an array of meat pies, and never even scratched the surface. Most patrons were walking around with bread bowls brimming with what amounted to spinach queso. It held little appeal to our group but it was easily the most popular dish at the event.
The best line of the day went to a barkeep we were chatting with in a downtown drinkery. When we walked in, the bar was packed with smokers and we mentioned that LaToya Cantrell (the California transplant who infamously got tobacco banned in New Orleans) would not be happy. “Fuck LaToya Cantrell!” was her response followed quickly by a “Who's LaToya Cantrell?”
It brought the room down.
Here are a few images we captured at the fete:

Today, Statsbot announces integration for Slack's newest feature — Message Menus. We're happy to say that Statsbot was chosen as one of a limited number of partners build an integration for the new feature.
Below we discuss this feature's uses and advantages according to our own experience.
Clean interface
Check out how the Statsbot Dashboard has improved with Message Menus:
Message Menus allows many variations in one form. Previously, we used Slack Buttons to ease onboarding and help to make our user interface more readable and convenient. Now, with Message Menus, our UI is even better.
Buttons allow the app designer/developer to use up to five buttons in a single message. Before, we needed to use several rows of messages in one command to get the most out of this feature.
However, Message Menus bridges the gap between a clean interface and diversity in options. This new feature frees up message space for us to use.
Mobile version
Replacing buttons with one control element is definitely great for using Statsbot via mobile. A touch-friendly user interface makes it much easier to find exactly you are looking for.
That's how Message Menus looks in mobile version
Quick search
Often, when drop-down lists have more than 10 options it's difficult for users to scan and navigate. However, Slack Message Menus offers a search field so the list can be as long as needed. It's a quick way to find the option you're looking for, and opens new possibilities in interface development for apps like Statsbot.
Dynamic content
Content inside Slack's Message Menus updates сontinuously. This means the feature can be used in different ways depending on the specific app. For example, at Statsbot we include our most popular metrics in Message Menus, which could change in real-time depending on usage. We believe this will help companies that are unsure what are the most important metrics to track.
ASO in Slack Directory
There is now a special featured category in the Slack App Directory for apps utilizing the Message Menu update. This has the potential for added marketing outreach for particular apps. At Statsbot, many of our new customers come to us from a Slack Directory search.

After Spicer's flagrant misstatement of Inauguration Day crowd figures over the weekend, Fleischer — a former White House press secretary trying to help the current one — offered some free advice Monday on Fox News.
“As soon as a press secretary gets into statistics and facts, the press is going to fact-check the press secretary,” Fleischer said. “So don't use a fact, don't use a stat, unless you're 100 percent certain you've got it nailed down.”
Simple, right? Don't make trouble for yourself and your president by saying provably false stuff to reporters.
And yet! Spicer stood before reporters on Tuesday and delivered this whopper, in defense of President Trump's bogus claim that massive voter fraud cost him the popular vote in November: “I think there's been studies. There was one that came out of Pew [in] 2008 that showed 14 percent of people who have voted were not citizens.”
It is hard to overstate what a brazen lie this was. I say “lie” — a loaded word that suggests Spicer knew he was telling a falsehood — because it is inconceivable that he believed it to be true. Trump has mischaracterized Pew's research on more than one occasion, and fact-checkers have crushed him for it. There is no way that Spicer, whose job requires him to obsess over media coverage, did not know that this absurd claim has been debunked.
And just think about how ridiculously large that number, 14 percent, really is. Did Spicer really expect anyone — even people who believe, despite a lack of evidence, that voter fraud is a big problem — to buy the idea that 1 in 7 voters is not a U.S. citizen? And that a respectable outfit like the Pew Research Center would have published that kind of garbage?
For the record, Spicer appears to have conflated two different studies, neither of which showed what he said. In one, researchers at Old Dominion University surveyed noncitizens in 2008 and 2010 and asked whether they are registered to vote; 14 percent said yes.
There are reasons to be skeptical of that figure (explained in detail here), but let's go with it for a minute. A conclusion that 14 percent of noncitizens are registered to vote is very different from a conclusion that 14 percent of all voters are noncitizens. Noncitizens represent just 7 percent of the U.S. population. If 14 percent of them are registered to vote, we are talking about 1 percent of voters.
The second study, published by Pew in 2012, concluded that “approximately 24 million registration records, or nearly 13 percent of the national total, are estimated to be inaccurate or no longer valid.” Again, there is a big difference between inaccurate voter rolls and fraudulent ballots.
Voter registration records can be inaccurate for all kinds of reasons. After Spicer's news conference on Tuesday, I decided to check my registration status in Massachusetts, where I lived before moving to Virginia in the fall of 2015. Guess what? The Massachusetts secretary of state's office still says I'm active in the Bay State. I guess Bill Galvin doesn't know that I moved, which is kind of hurtful; I assumed that he missed seeing my byline in the Boston Globe.
Anyway, like 2.8 million people in the Pew study, I am apparently registered in more than one state. But that doesn't mean I actually vote in more than one state, and there is no evidence that tons of other people do, either.
Spicer knows this stuff. It's his job to know this stuff. Yet, with his credibility already damaged, he told the White House press corps another fat one on Tuesday.
With phony figures, Spicer is killing his standing among journalists — and it's only the first week of the Trump era.
An illegal alien has been charged with raping and sexually assaulting his 17-year-old stepdaughter to get her pregnant, as he believed it would prevent him from being deported from the United States.
Horacio Alvarado, a 32-year-old illegal alien, is charged with three felonies, according to the Milwaukee Sheriff's Office, after sexually assaulting and impregnating his teenage stepdaughter so he could have an “anchor baby” with her, which he believed would have prevented his deportation.
An anchor baby is a term used to describe the child of an illegal alien, as the U.S. grants birthright citizenship to any child born in the country. Illegal aliens, through having children in the U.S., are able to anchor themselves in the country but are not exempt from deportation by federal immigration officials.
According to police, Alvarado is accused of first-degree sexual assault resulting in his stepdaughter's pregnancy, sexual assault of a child, and incest.
The victim, police say, came forward about the sexual assaults and pregnancy after being sexually abused since she was 14-years-old by Alvarado. The victim described the abuse as incidents that would take place at her family home when her mother was either at work or asleep.
Alvarado, according to the victim, would also take the teenager in his car to parking lots or friends' houses so he could have sex with her.
The victim's mother, though, did become aware of the sexual abuse by the illegal alien, police say, but did nothing to prevent it from happening. The victim told police that her mother had walked in on Alvarado sexually abusing her, but all she did was speak with her husband about the incident.
The criminal complaint alleges that the victim told her mother that she had become pregnant with her stepfather's child.
The victim's mother is now charged with child neglect for allegedly failing to take action against her husband's reported sexual abuse.

In 1983, Dennis Tueller, a police officer, published an article discussing the need to defend against an attacker armed with a knife or blunt weapon. Through his tests and studies he determined that a person would be in danger if the attacker came at him from 21 feet or fewer. In short, the attacker could get to his victim before the victim was able to draw and accurately fire his handgun. While this study was done to educate police officers, it obviously is just as important to the armed citizen. However, through the passing years, various interpretations of Tueller's study have led to some confusion. And it is confusion that just might get the armed citizen in trouble.
Suppose that you are forced to shoot an attacker in self-defense. Suppose further that your attacker was armed with a knife and, during your court proceedings you refer to the “21-foot rule” as your justification for using deadly force. And that would be the time that the prosecutor produces an investigating officer who testifies that the actual distance between you and the attacker was 28 feet. Hopefully your attorney would be able to overcome this discrepancy and still convince the court that it was reasonable for you to be in fear for your life. But it has created doubt that just might sway the jury against you.
The simple fact is that 21 feet is an arbitrary distance that may, or may not, relate to your particular situation. To begin with, few people can point to the ground and accurately point out what 21 feet looks like. Secondly, while the Tueller studies are extremely sound, there are a lot of factors that make it an arbitrary distance.
One consideration is the physical condition of your attacker. Obviously, a young man in good condition can cover the ground a whole faster than an old, fat man. How fast the attacker is moving has a great bearing on how quickly he can get within striking distance of his victim.
Another consideration is the condition of the terrain. A person can travel across a smooth floor, or paved parking lot, much faster than he can across rocky ground, or ground that is covered with other obstacles.
The condition of the victim also factors into this question. Are you in good shape, or packing too much weight? Have the years begun to slow you down? Are you carrying your defensive handgun openly, or is it concealed in deep cover? Can your draw and hit in one second, or does it take more like 2½ seconds? Were you able to step behind cover, or were you caught out in the open? All of these factors affect how quickly you can respond to this deadly threat. And all of these factors affect how the Tueller studies will relate to you.
If I were going to rely on this premise in the wake of a defensive shooting during police questioning or courtroom testimony, I would never refer to the matter as “The 21-foot Rule.” I would call it "The Tueller Study." And I would explain that I was concerned with a distance of approximately 21 feet because I never had the opportunity to actually measure the ground between me and my attacker. And I used deadly force because I honestly believed that the bad guy was close enough to place me in fear for my life or serious bodily injury.
For further information and study on this matter and some training drills, I refer you to the April, 2015 issue of Shooting Illustrated. My friend and co-worker Richard Mann has an excellent article on the matter entitled “Twenty-one Feet.” Just remember that it is “The Tueller Study” and the distance is approximately 21 feet.

Police in Spain have confirmed that they have arrested a man who attempted to plan a mass shooting of gay people in Barcelona.
Authorities arrested the 36-year-old man who attempted to use social media to urge more people to shoot gay people.
The man was in possession of a pistol which could fire blanks, which featured in his videos.
According to authorities, 31 videos had been posted by the man in the past month.
In one of the videos, he says that his followers have 13 days to “prepare” for a gay party in Barcelona.
Many of the videos have already been removed by YouTube.
But the man was also accused of posting tweets which urge people to commit hate crimes against gay people and groups.
Several people reported his tweets to authorities.
He could face a prison sentence of between one and four years, and could face a fine of between 600 and 30,000 Euros.
Shares of Morneau-Shepell, the finance minister's former company, were sold a week before Bill Morneau tabled tax legislation that might have affected the company's shares, an MP alleged in Question Period Monday.
Tory MP Pierre Poilievre said there were 680,000 shares of the company sold on Nov. 30, 2015 – one week before the tax legislation was tabled on Dec. 7, 2015.

He asked the minister to name who sold the shares, because “it is government's responsibility to ensure no minister ever uses inside knowledge to benefit from transactions of the stock market.”
He also asked Morneau in Question Period whether he sold the shares himself.
“On Dec. 7, 2015 the minister of finance introduced a motion in the House of Commons to raise taxes effective Jan. 1 in the forthcoming year,” he said in Question Period.
“The stock market dropped and so did Morneau-Shepell … but not before someone could sell $10 million in Morneau-Shepell shares, one week before that drop and that bill was introduced. Can the minister tell us who sold those shares.”
“Was that this minister?”

He said the difference between selling shares before the legislation was tabled at $15 a share, compared to after at around $14.2 per share, amounted to a profit of around $500,000.
For his part, Monreau deflected the question, saying Poilievre was “trying to concoct conspiracy theories out of thin air.”
His office later called the accusations false and wrong.
“The absurd allegations being made by the opposition are completely and utterly false,” Chloe Luciani-Girouard, spokesperson for Morneau, said in an email to Global News.
“The opposition continue to show they would rather focus on the minister of finance than the priorities of Canadians.”

Poilievre also referenced documents viewed by the National Post, which said the minister sold 680,000 in shares for just over $10 million.
Poilievre told Global News he had viewed public trading records that confirm 680,000 shares were sold for $10.2 million at 10:25 a.m. on Nov. 30, 2015. It was not clear if the Post report referred to the same transaction, though the journalist said the relevant statements were dated Dec. 3.
Just re-checked my notes. Morneau's office did indeed tell me he sold 680,000 shares at $15 a share. I saw a statement dated Dec 3, 2015 – clearly well before Dec 7 when Finance Minister announced tax changes. A further 320,000 were sold Dec 17 for $14.26 and donated to charity. — John Ivison (@IvisonJ) November 27, 2017
Though Poilievre said he wasn't accusing Morneau, he is calling for him to come clean on when exactly he sold all his shares in the company.
“Obviously finance ministers are privy to highly sensitive financial information, they need to ensure that they are operation with the highest ethical standards in buying and selling shares on the stock market,” he told Global News.
“I'm not accusing the minister of anything. I'm simply asking him to tell us when he sold his directly held shares in Morneau-Shepell.”
This is the latest attack on Morneau, after criticism in recent months over his controversial small business tax proposal, as well as perceived conflicts of interest having to do with Bill C-27. (In that case, the bill in question would affect pensions and Morneau's family company is Canada's largest provider of pension administration technology and services.)
The office of the ethics commissioner is currently investigating Morneau for his involvement in that bill.
Poilievre was one of the MPs, along with NDP MP Nathan Cullen, who called for the office to investigate.
Morneau is now in the process of selling off his shares and placing his other considerable assets in a blind trust.
