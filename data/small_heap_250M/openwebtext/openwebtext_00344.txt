The tight end position is in demand, and business is booming for top prospect O.J. Howard.
In the next week, Howard has an on-campus workout scheduled with the Carolina Panthers, followed by visits with the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Chicago Bears, he told NFL.com on Thursday. Howard had previously spoken with the Titans and Buccaneers.
Howard, who is back home in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, working out with the Crimson Tide staff, has conditioned himself to be meticulously prepared in any situation. The Nick Saban school of hard knocks will do that to you.
It should come as no surprise that he's planning on acing all of his meetings.
"You just want to make sure when you go on these visits you meet people and you know everybody," Howard said. "You want to know people by name, then just go in and have a good time. You know what to do. They'll make you do some board work and talk football. Just go in and do what you normally do."
To help, Howard has a study aid at his disposal.
"I have a book," Howard said. "It has every team and every coach on the staff and every personnel guy -- everyone in the whole organization is in that book. So you just look up the team, go up and down and you can kind of learn it that way."
The on-campus workout with the Carolina Panthers will be a little easier. Howard can just display what he does best. While this is his first private workout with a team, Howard said he expects to go through plenty of in-line blocking drills. In previous entries, Howard has discussed his love of blocking and it's one of the main reasons he has been a mock draft darling this time of year.
But he's also determined not to rest on his reputation, which is where the return trip to Tuscaloosa comes in.
Howard checked in after another grueling workout with legendary Alabama strength and conditioning coach Scott Cochran and his staff. Cochran has built some college football's most impressive athletes and might have outdone himself this year with Alabama's class of prospects.
"He's with us all the way," Howard said. "His staff, they're all perfect and they'll work you out. It's just like when you played ball here it's the same thing."
Seeing Howard in college football shape was enough to garner a significant amount of interest. Now Howard is looking to turn heads this week with the pro-ready version.

Prophecy, who finished second to Epsilon in the inaugural season of the Gfinity Elite Series, have parted ways with their CS:GO roster.
The British esports organization Prophecy was represented by a mixture of European players since June, when they picked up the likes of Ádám "kolor" Domoszlay, Vladyslav "arch" Svistov and Fredrik "slap" Junbrant. The team, lead by former Epsilon member Karl-William "kalle" Haraldsen, competed exclusively in the Gfinity Elite Series.
kalle will be on the lookout for a new team
Prophecy finished third out of eight teams in the regular season of the league, earning a spot in the playoffs. There, they defeated EnVyUs Academy in the semi-final, but lost the grand final to Epsilon, placing second.
Despite the high placing, Prophecy decided to part ways with the six-man roster that represented them over the last three months, meaning that the following players are now free agents:
In the meantime, the Hungarian duo fleav and kolor were seen playing for volgare, who are set to compete in the Esports Balkan League, kalle played the WCA qualifiers with a Swedish mix AWTR, while slap stood in for Red Reserve at the end of August, but doesn't seem to be sticking with the squad.
Woo Hoo Welcome Back “Great British Bake Off”.
One of my absolutely favorite baking programs returned to TV last Wednesday, needless to say I will be commandeering the TV & Sky remote for the next 6 weeks and I don't give two hoots what Champions League Football match is on.!! The TV is Mine for that hour!!!
Wednesday will now be known as Bake Off Wednesday in my house and I suspect it will be the same across most of Ireland & the UK. So because it's such a “special day” I decided it would be only fitting to bake something very delicious to have with my cuppa whilst watching the GBBO Gang and this Raspberry and Cream Cheese Loaf fits the bill perfectly.
I think its fantastic the way a TV programme has had such a positive effect on baking, taking it out of the dark ages, making it “cool” not just something Mammy's and Nana's do in the kitchen. I got my love of baking from my own Nana and my Mum,, who were/are both brilliant bakers.
My Mum especially was a huge Mary Berry Fan, she had two Mary Berry Cook books which were her “bibles”. Sunday was Baking Day in our house and I spent many happy Sundays covered in flour, learning all my Mam's recipes. I didn't bake so much when I started secondary school. It was ALL about music & boys . I was lucky to be a teenager in the 80's , the best decade for music and I'm not ashamed to say I was a huge Wham Fan. It wasn't until I had my own kids that I rediscovered my passion for baking. I got all my four kids baking from a young age.. and two of them Andrew now age 13 and Amy 21( the youngest & oldest ) are both brilliant bakers in their own right.. the other two Adam and Daniel became the official tasters.
It was Nigella Lawson who is the one responsible for re-igniting the baking flame for me.. I love her style of baking. Her “How to be a Domestic Goddess Book” is still my go-to book and is definitely one worth having on your book shelf. If I was ever asked to to name my baking heroes..it wouldn't be very difficult.. there are three of them Nigella Lawson, Mary Berry and a Canadian Anna Olsen.. All very different but each a Queen Of Baking in their own right
Gosh any way back to the “Raspberry and Cream Cheese Loaf” ..this is a simple pound cake recipe with the addition of cream cheese in the cake batter & the frosting on top and of course juicy fresh raspberries
A little lemon is added just to cut through the sweetness of the raspberries and cream cheese which are just a perfect combination.
This is one of those recipes where fresh fruit is an absolute must. I used Keelings Irish raspberries, very sweet beautiful little rubies that are like little jam bubbles hidden inside the cake. I always use full-fat cream cheese when I'm baking but I'm sure low-fat would work ok. Just make sure it's a good quality one . I'm a cream cheese snob because I always use Philadelphia when I'm baking but just use what every one you prefer .
dredge raspberries in flour to stop them sinking
I baked this for about 50 mins . I kid you not the smell was unbelievable, that good that my teenage boys were in front of the oven every five mins asking “is it done yet”.
The Raspberry and Cream Cheese Loaf HAS to be cold before adding the frosting and that's the hard part it , it takes will power not to cut a slice and to hell with the frosting ..but be strong and resist the temptation. This frosting takes the cake it to a completely different level of deliciousness.
I had two scrumptious slices with my coffee whilst watching Great British Bake Off. I'm now wondering what to make for next week!! Maybe I might try the Gin & Tonic Madeira from this week's show.
All I can say now is “Roll on Bake Off Wednesday”

1. There's no way to protect my brand in China against counterfeits, so I may as well not try. This is both false and self-defeating. China offers a number of ways to protect your IP, and is getting better every year. The first and most important step is to file a trademark application in China as soon as possible to cover your goods and/or services. This will provide you with a first line of defense against counterfeiters and trademark squatters. Once your trademark is registered you will be able to submit takedown requests to Chinese e-commerce sites, request Chinese customs to seize goods, and bring lawsuits for trademark infringement. And, at the same time as you file your trademark application, you can begin to craft a comprehensive IP protection strategy that incorporates copyright and patent registrations.
2. My Chinese trademark registration for my blockbuster movie will allow me to take action against people using “my” trademark on other goods, like clothing or breakfast cereal or toilets. Trademark protection in China is limited by the classes and subclasses of goods and services covered by your registration. If you want protection for other products, you need to register in the appropriate classes AND subclasses to cover those products. For some companies this means registering in all 45 classes. For other companies it means figuring out which products or services you really, really don't want someone else to be selling under your name. And for most everyone, it is critical to file directly in China and not in Madrid.
3. You can remove counterfeit goods from Chinese e-commerce websites with a US trademark. Alibaba has been amenable to removing listings from Alibaba and Aliexpress, its foreign-facing sites, with just a US or a European trademark registration. But to remove listings from domestic Chinese e-commerce sites like Taobao and 1688.com you typically must have a Chinese trademark registration. Much other e-commerce or social networking sites require a Chinese trademark registration and every site will take action more quickly with one. When counterfeit goods of your product are being sold, time is literally money.
4. China is the biggest source of counterfeit goods in the world. Totally true. According to the 2016 annual report from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), more than 80% of all seized merchandise that infringed intellectual property rights came from either China or Hong Kong.
5. Chinese customs will seize counterfeit goods even if you only have a US trademark. Trademarks are national in scope, and with few exceptions a US trademark has no relevance in China. It certainly means nothing to Chinese customs. Imagine trying to convince U.S. Customs and Border Patrol to seize goods based on a Chinese trademark registration. It would never happen. If you want to be able to have Chinese customs seize infringing goods you need to have a Chinese trademark registration and you need to have registered that trademark again with Chinese customs.
6. The only way to have Chinese-made counterfeit goods seized is when they come in to the United States. U.S. Customs does actively inspect incoming shipments, but Chinese customs also actively inspects outgoing shipments. If you can provide the who, when, and where details about an upcoming shipment of infringing merchandise, you can have that merchandise seized by China customs.
7. My brand is famous outside China so that means the Chinese government will take action against counterfeit goods. No. Just no. The only way to be sure you have trademark rights in China is to register your trademark in China.
8. If I have my products manufactured in China, there's nothing I can do to stop my manufacturer from selling them out the back door. Wrong. There is a lot you can contractually do to prevent your own manufacturer(s) from selling your own products as its products, starting with a China-centric NNN Agreement and/or NNN provisions in your manufacturing agreement. Using a China Product Development Agreement also often makes sense when you are in the early stages with your China manufacturer.
The Year 2000 problem is understood by most people these days because of the large amount of media attention it received.
Most programs written in the C programming language are relatively immune to the Y2K problem, but suffer instead from the Year 2038 problem. This problem arises because most C programs use a library of routines called the standard time library . This library establishes a standard 4-byte format for the storage of time values, and also provides a number of functions for converting, displaying and calculating time values.
The standard 4-byte format assumes that the beginning of time is January 1, 1970, at 12:00:00 a.m. This value is 0. Any time/date value is expressed as the number of seconds following that zero value. So the value 919642718 is 919,642,718 seconds past 12:00:00 a.m. on January 1, 1970, which is Sunday, February 21, 1999, at 16:18:38 Pacific time (U.S.). This is a convenient format because if you subtract any two values, what you get is a number of seconds that is the time difference between them. Then you can use other functions in the library to determine how many minutes/hours/days/months/years have passed between the two times.
If you have read How Bits and Bytes Work, you know that a signed 4-byte integer has a maximum value of 2,147,483,647, and this is where the Year 2038 problem comes from. The maximum value of time before it rolls over to a negative (and invalid) value is 2,147,483,647, which translates into January 19, 2038. On this date, any C programs that use the standard time library will start to have problems with date calculations.
This problem is somewhat easier to fix than the Y2K problem on mainframes, fortunately. Well-written programs can simply be recompiled with a new version of the library that uses, for example, 8-byte values for the storage format. This is possible because the library encapsulates the whole time activity with its own time types and functions (unlike most mainframe programs, which did not standardize their date formats or calculations). So the Year 2038 problem should not be nearly as hard to fix as the Y2K problem was.

TBILISI, Georgia — As part of a new nationwide initiative, 350 foreigners will descend this week on rural and impoverished Georgian public schools to teach English.
The initiative, "Teach and Learn with Georgia," is the brainchild of Georgia's staunchly pro-Western president, Mikheil Saakashvili, who announced in August an ambitious program to have every Georgian schoolchild speaking English in the next four years. English language and computer skills are essential to Georgia's economic and technological development, he said.
While few in Georgia disagree with the abstract goals of "Teach and Learn with Georgia" — which, according to Saakashvili's ambitious plans, will bring thousands of foreign English speakers to Georgian public schools in the next four years — the implementation of the program has been controversial since its inception last spring.
Many say the planning of the program, condensed to less than five months, was unnecessarily rushed and poorly executed. Others worry the program will be a catastrophic misuse of Georgia's already limited educational funds.
When Saakashvili first announced the program in April, he promised, like a modern day Herbert Hoover, not to put "a chicken in every pot," but to put an American in every classroom. The original goal was to place 1,000 Americans in public schools across Georgia by mid-September, where they would both teach students and help Georgian-born English teachers improve their own language skills.
With the start of school, the program appears to be off to a slightly more modest start. Only 350 foreign teachers have been placed in Georgian classrooms so far — and they won't all be American. Still, Maia Siprashvili-Lee, coordinator for "Teach and Learn with Georgia," says the program is already a success.
"We are still accepting applications and training new teachers every week, even after school starts," she said. Her office expects to admit more than 100 teachers per month through December. "We're just getting started."
"Teach and Learn with Georgia" is modeled after other government-funded English-language programs in Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan, where the goal is to “improve people-to-people communication, which aids in business and development,” Siprashvili-Lee said. “English language is vital for our country.”
Similar initiatives that prioritize learning English — like Chile's 2003 program, “English Opens Doors,” which made learning English mandatory for schoolchildren — have been successful models for Georgia. Saakashvili has called Georgia's “Teach and Learn with Georgia” program “a real educational revolution.”
"It will give us an opportunity to make major progress and to make the largest breakthrough in next decades in the entire post-Soviet space and that's the greatest contribution we will make to the future development of our country," he said during a speech Aug. 15.
"Teach and Learn with Georgia" teachers are mostly in their 20s and hail from the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, western and eastern Europe, Scandinavia — and in one instance — the Philippines. While a handful are retired or out-of-work educators in their home countries, most have never taught in a classroom. Each will be placed with a teaching partner at a public school, mostly in remote rural villages, Siprashvili-Lee said.
Is learning English the best way forward for Georgian children? Join the conversation in the comment section below.
Chris Walters, a former Peace Corps volunteer in Georgia and the current director of IREX, a Tbilisi-based international nonprofit that works on educational issues, said he thinks the program is a good idea, but emphasizes the importance of managing expectations, especially for idealistic young teachers who have never lived abroad and have no experience in often chaotic public schools.
“It can be like living in a fish bowl,” he said. “You have to be 'on' all the time, and nothing happens like you expect it to.”
Hannah Mintek, a former private English teacher in Tbilisi and a former U.S. Peace Corps volunteer in rural Georgia, worried that “Teach and Learn with Georgia” teachers have not receive adequate training.
“I'm afraid it will be much more difficult, psychologically and emotionally, than they expect,” she said.
The U.S. Peace Corps, the U.S. State Department's international service program, brings about 40 new volunteers to Georgia each year, many of whom teach English in rural public schools. It provides its volunteers with two and a half months of language, cultural, safety and pedagogical training before placing them with host families in Georgian villages. "Teach and Learn with Georgia" teachers will receive one week of training.
The question of cost for the “Teach and Learn for Georgia” program has also been a primary source of controversy among Georgian educators. While the Peace Corps is funded exclusively by the U.S. State Department, the Georgian government will have to pick up the tab for "Teach and Learn for Georgia"
Georgian educators question spending money on shipping in foreigners, when many Georgian public schools, despite recent a recent round of renovations, still lack central heating, an adequate number of desks and basic materials like workbooks and chalk.
Although the Ministry of Education has refused to reveal either its budget or its funding sources, “Teach and Learn with Georgia” is expected to cost between $5 million and $6 million a year.
“Teach and Learn with Georgia” teachers will receive free room and board with a Georgian family, a medical insurance package, a round-trip ticket to Georgia, and one round trip ticket home for vacation. They will be paid 500 Georgian lari (about $300 dollars) per month — more than twice what their Georgian counterparts will be making.
“The Georgian teachers are going to be thinking, ‘What, the government can pay this kid who has no background in education, no educational training, but it can't pay me?'” said Mintek, the former Peace Corps volunteer. “It's a recipe for trouble.”
Michael Decker, 31, a “Teach and Learn with Georgia” teacher who has already been placed in Tsoniarisi village in Adjara, a region in Georgia's rainy west, said that while the challenges are clear, he thinks the program has the possibility of being a real success.
“We're going to have to figure out what our roles will be in our schools, how to balance the pre-existing Georgian curriculum with our conversational instruction, and how to speak Georgian,” said Decker, with a laugh. He has worked as a high school Latin teacher in Virginia for four years. “It's not going to be easy, but I guess that's the point.”
“I want to be a resource. I want to be helpful,” he said. “That's why I'm here.”
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched in central Tel Aviv on Saturday night as part of a large-scale protest movement against the housing shortage and high rent prices in Israel.
Tel Aviv protesters demand reduction in housing prices
The protest was an extension of the "tent cities" which have sprouted up across the country as part of an organized effort led by a cross-section of Israeli society - including the middle class, young people, students, Holocaust survivors, and the elderly.
The demonstrators marched from the tent city on Rothschild Boulevard toward the Tel Aviv Museum, where they heard speeches from various protest leaders calling on the government find a sustainable solution to the housing crisis.
During the march, demonstrators yelled slogans such as "proper housing, legitimate prices", "the power is with the citizen", and "this generation demands housing". Some of the marchers called for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's resignation.
Politicians were not set to address the crowd, although several Knesset members, including Ilan Gilon (Meretz), Dov Khenin (Hadash) and Muhammad Barakeh (Hadas), Nino Abesadze (Kadima), and Rachel Adato (Kadima), could be found among the demonstrators.
"I'm proud of the vast number of participants, especially the young people who give me great hope for real change," Barakeh said. He added that he hoped that the demonstration marked "the beginning of a process to replace the current government with a government that is socially sensitive and has a perception of true peace."
In her speech, Daphni Leef, who initiated the protest, called upon the elected government to find solutions to increasing housing prices. "We're constantly being asked what we want and we say, 'Affordable housing for all.' They tell us, 'Suggest solutions,' and we say, 'Why? That is what we have elected representatives for.'

Leef also said in her speech, "Under these conditions we will soon have no dreams. There is no time to dream when you're constantly looking to cover your rent. There's no time to dream when you're constantly looking to cover a mortgage. We are the power, we, the nation, we are not suckers."
At the end of the demonstration, Leef returned to the stage and directly addressed the prime minister. "You, Bibi, with your wild policy and your irresponsibility, you pushed us into a nadir. You, Mr. Netanyahu, caused us – the Facebook generation – to head to the streets and protest," she said.
Following of the demonstration, hundreds of protesters blocked the intersection of Kaplan and Ibn Gvirol Streets. They sat in the middle of the intersection calling out, "The people demand social justice."

Police tried to forcibly clear hundreds of protesters from blocking the intersection of Kaplan and Ibn Gvirol streets, but were unsuccessful. Protesters retaliated by throwing objects and rubbish at the police. At least 15 protesters were arrested.
Police did manage to clear the crowd from the middle of the road, enabling the intersection to open to traffic, but protesters remained close by, bursting onto the road from time to time.
Although most of the demonstrators at the rally were young, a number of elderly people joined the protest in order to show solidarity against the high cost of living in Israel.
The past few days have seen dozens of organizations and individuals join the ongoing protest movement, including youth groups, representatives of the Haredi movement, womens organizations, doctors and residents, and social workers.

CARLSBAD – Legoland California Resort officials on Thursday unveiled plans to add a new 1-acre themed land based on Lego's popular Ninjago toy and cartoon franchise. Its highlight will be a four-dimensional, interactive dark ride to open in the spring.
Ninjago Land will be in the southeast portion of the park behind Imagination Zone and will feature Lego building stations, games for kids, stores and an Asian restaurant.
The land's signature attraction will be Ninjago – The Ride, which officials say, “features technology guests have never experienced at any other theme park in the world.”
Up to four guests will hop on a ride vehicle and journey into the world of Ninjago. Guests will wear 3D glasses and experience elements such as wind, heat and smoke. Using hand gestures riders will be able to either blast a fireball, lightning, shockwaves or ice as they train in dojos before heading into battle against Ninjago's main enemy, the Great Devourer serpent.
“I am proud and thrilled to say that this is our 11th straight year of continuous attendance growth and we attribute much of this to our winning formula of providing our guests a family environment filled with fun, interactive experiences that create lasting memories,” Peter Ronchetti, general manager at Legoland, said in a statement.
“Ninjago – The Ride will be the ultimate experience providing interactive fun for all,” he said.
The ride's maker, Triotech, is the same company Knott's Berry Farm used for its newly released interactive dark ride, Voyage to the Iron Reef.
Legoland's announcement comes a few months after the unveiling of other new attractions to the Carlsbad theme park. In March, the park added a 6-foot-wide Lego version of the Death Star to its Star Wars Miniland. This summer, it also unveiled Heartlake City based on Lego Friend's popular toy franchise.
Legoland broke ground on Ninjago Land in July.

Fully recovered from injury troubles that caused him to miss much of the season, Portland Thunder quarterback Kyle Rowley prepares to lead his new-look team into Saturday's key home game against the Los Angeles KISS.
With three games remaining in the regular season, Portland leads Los Angeles by one win for the final playoff spot in the National Conference. Los Angeles (3-12) has defeated Portland twice already, including a 69-61 game on June 14 that was Rowley's return after a seven-week absence following MCL surgery.
“I'm 10 weeks out of surgery now,” Rowley said. “It was very tight the first two games, but it was good enough for me to drop back and throw. Now I'm starting to get to the point where it's not even a factor in my head, so I'm feeling very comfortable.”
Portland's receiving corps will be different from past weeks with the loss of top receiver Eric Rogers, who was signed by the Calgary Stampeders of the CFL on Monday. In only nine games for the Thunder, Rogers caught 73 passes for 903 yards and 27 touchdowns. But Rowley believes the loss of Rogers can be offset by the return of two key receivers: Douglas McNeil III, who was activated from injured reserve in time to catch two touchdown passes last week against the Cleveland Gladiators, and Duane Brooks, who had 45 receptions in nine games to start the season and is used as a kick returner.
This week the Thunder also added linebacker Marquis Jackson, who last played at Portland State, and Okechukwu Okoroha, a defensive back out of Marshall University.
“We've had a little turnover in the last two weeks," Rowley said. “Doug's a great receiver so it's good to have him back because Eric was a big loss. [Brooks] looks sharp. He looks fresh. I kind of forgot how fast he is.”
Jamar Howard has emerged as a favorite target of Rowley. In the Thunder's 61-40 loss to Cleveland, Howard had eight catches for 161 yards. Rowley threw for 297 yards, with five touchdowns and four interceptions, in a game that saw Cleveland pull away late in the third quarter.
“We made critical errors in the first quarter, and when that happens it forces errors deeper into the game as well because you're playing with your back's against the wall. We just need to start faster than that.”
Since joining the Thunder, Rowley has thrown 29 touchdowns and just seven interceptions.
“We had a slow start to the season,” Rowley said. “When I got here, we were really in a hole, so we've been digging out that this whole time.”
“We're used to pressuring filled games so this isn't anything too new to us. Every week's been the biggest game of the season for us, and that's good, you know, that might help us when the playoff time does come because we're used to playing under pressure.”

NEW ORLEANS — Cameras that can spot guns through layers of clothing — using infrared or similar technologies — may be included in sweeping new security measures for Bourbon Street to be proposed soon by Mayor Mitch Landrieu, according to several people familiar with the plan.
The cameras would be able to pick up on differences in the temperature between guns and human bodies, allowing officers to then focus on those carrying weapons.
Related article Police departments test gun-mounted cameras
The idea is part of a broader effort to prevent the type of shootout that killed one person and wounded nine others on Bourbon Street in November, as well as to avert potential terrorist attacks. But stepped-up surveillance of that kind will inevitably raise questions about privacy and constitutional rights.
Details about the overall security plan have not been released by Landrieu's administration, and it is unclear whether the high-tech scanners will end up in the final version of the proposal, which also calls for making much of Bourbon Street a pedestrian mall.
But several people briefed on the ideas being discussed said infrared-type cameras are on the table.
Bob Simms, who runs the private police details known as the French Quarter Task Force, said administration officials had discussed using the new cameras as they laid out the security plan and likened them to installing metal detectors. But Simms said the cameras would likely involve fewer logistical challenges than trying to corral revelers through security gates and might seem less intimidating.
"A lot of the businesses don't like (metal detectors); they think it gives the wrong impression," he said. "I think people are looking at whether there is other technology that would achieve the same objective."
Various research papers have been written about the possibility of using infrared and other imaging technologies for just such a purpose. Several companies also market cameras claiming to detect any kind of contraband through clothing.
But it is not clear whether any city has tried to deploy the cameras on a widespread basis or along a public street.
Several media outlets reported in 2013 that the New York City Police Department was testing the technology, though it does not appear it was ever put to use. An NYPD spokesman said the department "does not have cameras that would be able to detect concealed weapons."
Published reports about the technology suggest it has a limited range and would not be suitable for scanning large crowds, meaning the devices likely would have to be set up at checkpoints near various entrances to the street.
Overall, the plan calls for an increase in the number of cameras monitoring Bourbon Street; the results could be fed into a centralized command center. Other cameras capable of reading license plates could be installed on the edges of the Quarter to allow officers to track suspects fleeing the scene of a crime, Simms said.
"I think we have a very multifaceted approach to this thing. Some people say, 'Let's just put more cops on the street,' but that's not going to solve everything even if we had them," he said.
But the surveillance plan, and the potential for new cameras in particular, raises concerns among some.
Marjorie Esman, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, said she had not heard anything about the plans or the technology but found it "very disturbing."
"I think that this is a violation of people's constitutional rights, and I cannot imagine that the public will accept that," Esman said. "It really defies common sense because it presumes that everybody carrying a weapon is going to use it for an improper purpose, and that's just not the case."
There are significant questions about how police would use the information gleaned from the cameras and whether that information would be enough justification to search those believed to have weapons, Esman said. That's particularly true if they would be set up on a public street, where standards are different than requiring people to go through metal detectors or body scanners at airports.
And, she said, significant surveillance in any public area is cause for concern when it's not clear how the video will be used, who will view it and how long it will be stored.
"We know that people come to New Orleans and they do things that they don't necessarily want to be sent back to friends, neighbors and colleagues wherever they live," Esman said.
And, she noted, the recent high-profile shootings on Bourbon Street have come with police standing nearby.
"I'm not sure what a camera is going to do," she said.
Jared, meet Kamiia Warren. Your company nearly ruined her life.
ProPublica's Alec MacGillis has an infuriating new story in The New York Times Magazine on a company called JK2 Westminster L.L.C., which for years relentlessly pursued former tenants of its Baltimore-area housing developments for unpaid rent. In Warren's case, the single mother of three had received written permission to break her lease early, and she owed no rent, but Westminster sued her anyway — for $3,014.08. She ended up losing on a series of technicalities — she did not have a lawyer — and the company went so far as to garnish her wages from her in-home elder-care job.
The company, meanwhile, ignored multiple complaints about poor upkeep and disrepair in its housing developments.
JK2 Westminster L.L.C., tenants soon found out, was owned by Jared Kushner:
At the Carroll Park complex, I met Mike McHargue, a private investigator, and his girlfriend, Patricia Howell. “They're nothing but slumlords,” Howell told me of Westminster Management. “They take everyone's money.” When I asked if they knew who was behind the company, they said they did not. “Oh, really?” Howell said when I mentioned Kushner's name. “Oh, really. And I'm a Trump supporter.”
Although Kushner stepped down as chief executive of Kushner Companies in January, he remains a stakeholder and “his share of company-related trusts is estimated to be worth at least $600 million,” MacGillis reports.
Of course, it's not uncommon for a landlord to pursue unpaid rent from tenants. But what was unusual for Kushner's company was how aggressively it pursued people. The company even targeted former tenants from before Westminster even owned the building:
When I presented JK2 Westminster's record of litigation to Matthew Cypher, a Georgetown University business professor who used to work for the real estate giant Invesco, he said it was highly unusual to put so much effort into pursuing former tenants in court. “These people fade into the shadows of the night,” he said. “It's amazing to me that there's that much to go after.” Brian Pendergraft, an attorney in Greenbelt, Md., who works on both sides of landlord-tenant litigation, told me he had heard of large property-management companies pursuing former tenants for unpaid rent but not going so far as to pursue tenants who predated the company's ownership of a complex. “I guess you can do it,” he said, “but I don't think it's cool.”
Kushner, of course, is shielded from these personal stories by layers of bureaucracy and third-party enforcement, via lawyers and collection agencies. When we look closer we see that wealth is accumulated through the systemic, legal harassment of those who are less fortunate and who can't afford a lawyer. I'm thankful that journalists like MacGillis will continue to force Kushner and others to look their tenants in the eye.

Their robot may have permission to travel, but six teenage Afghan inventors are staying put this summer.
They've been rejected for a one-week travel visa to escort their robot to the inaugural FIRST Global Challenge – an international robotics competition happening in Washington DC in mid-July.
The all-girl team representing Afghanistan hails from Herat, a city of half a million people in the western part of the country. To interview for their visas, the girls risked a 500 mile trek cross-country to the American embassy in Kabul – the site of several recent suicide attacks and one deadly truck bomb in early June that killed at least 90 people. Despite the recent violence, the teenagers braved the trip to the country's capital not once, but twice, hoping a second round of interviews might help secure their 7-day visas after the team was rejected on its first try. But no luck.
Roya Mahboob, who founded Citadel software company in Afghanistan, and was the country's first female tech CEO, brought the group of girls together for the project.
“It's a very important message for our people” Mahboob says. “Robotics is very, very new in Afghanistan.”
She says when the girls first heard the bad news about their visas, “they were crying all the day.”
While the State Department won't comment on the visa denials (those records are confidential), recent numbers suggest it's pretty tricky to get a travel visa from Afghanistan to the U.S. According to State Department records, in April 2017, the country gave out just 32 of the B1/B2 brand of business travel visas the girls were trying for. Compare that to Baghdad's 138 B1/B2s issued that same month, or the 1,492 issued at the same time in neighboring Pakistan, and the records suggest the girls' try was a long shot. Still, they persisted.
Back home in Herat, Team Afghanistan is racing against the clock, putting the final touches on their ball-sorting robot that will travel to the U.S. to compete against 163 other machines from around the globe. The students are screwing together joints, programming the machine's sensors and still trying to find one chain. The six haven't had much time to put this contraption together: their raw materials were held up in customs for months this spring, amid fears over ISIS' use of robots on the battlefield. But instead of giving up, the girls took matters into their own hands, and designed their own homemade motorized robotic machines while they waited for customs to clear their parts. Just three weeks ago, those supplies cleared customs, and the team finally started working on their official FIRST robot, with remote programming help from a few robotics grad students at Carnegie Mellon.
FIRST Global President and former Congressman Joe Sestak says he's disappointed that the “extraordinarily brave young women” from Afghanistan won't be joining the other students in DC this summer. On competition day, they'll be across the globe, home in Herat, cheering on their brand-new creation from more than 7,000 miles away (though the girls will be video conferencing in briefly to see their machine, no visa required.)
Other teams from Iraq, Iran and Sudan were all able to secure their travel visas for the competition – and roughly 95% of FIRST global teams will be able to attend. Only team Afghanistan and team Gambia have been denied visas so far.
Though it's not slowing their work.
On a recent Saturday, Afghan Robot maker Fatemah, who's 14, joined her teammates to work on the machine (and giggle a bit, too). She says she enjoys working with robots, that feeling of making something brand new. Speaking in her native Persian through a translator, Fatemah says "we want to show the world we can do it, we just need a chance."
Some months ago, Intellectual Takeout blogged thus:
“From a philosophical standpoint, the following seems to be the case: For those who believe pornography is intrinsically evil, the onus is on them to explain how its use does not accord with the proper telos, or goal, of human sexual activity. For those who believe pornography is a matter of temperance, the onus is on them to explain how its use can correspond to the proper telos of human sexual activity, for (in the tradition of Aristotle) temperance involves a right use of pleasurable activities that are good. And if you think that there is no proper telos to sex, I suppose there's no point in having the debate at all.”
For those unfamiliar with Greek and/or philosophy-speak, the word telos means ‘end' as in ‘goal'. If you don't think sex has a goal or purpose, then debate about its purpose does seem pointless. You will take the view that the means by which one seeks sexual stimulation is nobody's business, as long as nobody “gets hurt” who doesn't actually want to get hurt.
But at the very least, there should be a discussion. For the aforesaid view is not merely false; hardly anybody actually believes it.
For one thing, everybody who hasn't chosen to forget it knows that the biological purpose of sex is reproduction. From that standpoint, the purpose of sexual pleasure is to get us to make babies. Is it adaptive, from an evolutionary point of view, to separate sexual pleasure so completely from reproduction that the latter becomes altogether superfluous? I know of no serious argument that it is, and I can think of more than one reason why it is not.
But rather than explore those reasons, I pose the following question: Does porn make people more or less likely to relate well to their partners?
In part, of course, the answer depends on what is meant by ‘well'. If you think relating well consists in getting your partner(s) to do the kinds of sexual things that many people enjoy viewing as porn, then the answer is that porn use makes it more likely that one will relate well sexually to one's partner(s). But of course, it matters whether the partner freely agrees or not, and it also matters whether, if they do so agree, the relationship is thereby strengthened overall. If the partner does not so agree, then they are being abused. If they so agree but the health and strength of the relationship is not thereby enhanced, then each person is merely using the other.
Now there are people who claim not to mind that. Some of them are doubtless sincere. But again, I know of no serious argument that either individuals or society benefit from the attitude of people who see nothing wrong with using each other (sexually or otherwise) as opposed to treating each other as persons who, merely as such, are valuable for their own sake. Just using each other is not love; treating each other as persons valuable for their own sake is the baseline of love, of which we can all agree there needs to be more.
If you find that a bit too morally earnest and unsexy, ask yourself this: Does regular porn use, on average, even promote good sex? A few years ago writer Naomi Wolf, no prude herself, answered emphatically in the negative in a piece for New York Magazine. And she's got plenty of research to back her up. You can find a quick-and-easy summary of that here, but the peer-review literature in the same vein is growing rapidly.
Pornography is sometimes classified in the genre of “erotica.” But if, as some such as Wolf claim, porn is addictive and inhibits sex with real partners, it's almost as if porn defeats the purpose of eros.
Good luck message to TUSC candidates from Bob Crow's cousin
David Wallis (Click to enlarge)
The Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition (TUSC) has received the following message from David Wallis, Bob Crow's cousin and also a member of the RMT's London Taxi branch:
"I would just like to wish all the TUSC candidates good luck in your campaigns over the next two weeks.
"I have had lots of conversations in my London taxi discussing TUSC and it's been very reassuring that people have listened and taken away what we stand for. I hope that I have been able to turn some heads.
"Bob Crow would be proud to know that you are all fighting for a democratic socialist society run in the interests of working class people. In his words, if we don't fight we will lose every time, but if we fight we might not lose.
"The TUSC party election broadcast was fantastic and just like Bob it was to the point and touched the hearts of people living in austerity.
"I have a picture at my front door of Bob (displayed below). It's a copy of a portrait that was present at his funeral. I look at this when leaving the house every day which inspires me to be strong and fight for what we believe in. I hope the memory of Bob has the same affect for you all. I would like to wish you all the best and hope to meet some of you in the future. Let's have one last hard push for the late great Bob Crow".

Finnish center caps off strong training camp, preseason,
ready to give Blues another weapon down middle of ice
By LOU KORAC
ST. LOUIS -- A two-goal, one-assist final preseason game Saturday was enough optimism for Blues center Jori Lehtera to make the following declaration:
"I think I'm ready to start the season," Lehtera said.
Is he ever.
So much for having to adjust to a narrow sheet of ice.
(St. Louis Blues photo)
Jori Lehtera (12) had six points in five preseason games for the Blues and declared himself ready for the rigors of the NHL season.
Lehtera, the 26-year-old restricted free agent addition that nobody but general manager Doug Armstrong (and perhaps coach Ken Hitchcock) saw coming on a day the Blues also signed the biggest free agent center on the market in Paul Stastny, finally arrived in St. Louis after it appeared that any chance he would play in St. Louis was on life support after Lehtera shunned Armstrong during the off-season in 2013.
But when Lehtera, drafted in the third round of the 2008 NHL Draft, admitted to Armstrong during the Sochi Olympics that he had made a mistake in not coming to the Blues for the 2013-14 season, it set the wheels in motion for the sides to agree on a two-year, $5.5 million contract.
Lehtera, a native of Helsinki, Finland, capped off his first training camp with three goals and three assists in five preseason games.
Lehtera was arguably the best player on the ice against the Minnesota Wild on Saturday night (the Wild played most of their top players in the game) playing on a line with Jaden Schwartz and Joakim Lindstrom. He had been playing much of training camp with Vladimir Tarasenko, his buddy and fellow linemate when the two played together for Sibir Novosibirsk of the Kontinental Hockey League, but Hitchcock wanted to get the 6-foot-2, 210-pound center into as much NHL action and way of living as possible.
"I think these five games, I started to play better and better," said Lehtera, who paid roughly $1 million out of his own pocket to get out of his KHL contract. "I started to get used to the style and everything.
"I got a lot of ice time (Saturday) and played a good game, or our line (did). ... I'm ready. I'm in good shape. I had a very good summer. I worked really hard. I think these five games helped me a little bit to get used to the small rink game. It's faster and you have to do everything faster. I think I'm ready now."
There was an element of the unknown when it came to Lehtera heading into training camp. Nobody knew how he would fit in, nobody knew where he would play and nobody knew how the Blues would use him.
Nobody but Hitchcock, who got a close, extensive view of Lehtera when he played for Finland at the Sochi Games.
"I knew he would have an impact in the game because of his moxie," Hitchcock said of Lehtera. "I saw that in the Olympics; started in the back (of Finland's lineup), got to the front. At the World Championships, he was just good all the way across the board, so you saw that. ... Lehtera played in, I bet you close to 100 games last year. He looks like he's ready to play.
"This is not surprising for me based on what we saw at the Olympics and the World Championships. Olympics especially was very rich competition. He started as a fourth-line left winger and ends up as a second-line center. ... He's a guy playing all this hockey and what (did) he has (Saturday), three points and is a plus player again? Really impressive."
When Schwartz signed his two-year contract Sept. 27, he reported to camp two days later and Hitchcock immediately grouped him with Lehtera and Tarasenko against the Wild on Oct. 2.
"I don't know what's going to happen; we tend to change lines quite a bit, but if I start the season with him, I'll definitely be happy," Schwartz said of Lehtera. "He's a great player. He can make plays in tight areas, he sees the ice really well. But even then, he's responsible defensively, he works hard and he really gets in there on faceoffs, too. Seems like a great overall player. He can definitely make plays, which is nice to see."
The Blues headed into the off-season with questions at center. Adding Stastny was definitely a plus. With Lehtera also in the fold, the Blues have -- dare it be said -- a surplus of players that can play down the middle, including David Backes, Patrik Berglund, Steve Ott and Maxim Lapierre.
"Lehtera has obviously been really good," Berglund said. "Hopefully that can keep going once the regular season starts.
"It's really good that we have a solid two-way player like that that we can drop in the lineup."

Jori Lehtera (12) scored twice and set up another goal in the Blues' final preseason game Saturday against the Minnesota Wild.
A player who played in the Blues' organization with then-American Hockey League affiliate, the Peoria Rivermen, for seven games in 2009 before heading overseas, first to play for Tappara Tampere in Finland and then to the KHL with Yaroslavl Lokomotiv and Sibir.
But Lehtera took advantage of coming in before camp started, dedicated himself on and off the ice to tackling the challenge of playing in the NHL and is anxious to being a key piece to the puzzle as the Blues embark on another journey towards their ultimate goal.
"Practice on the ice is the hardest part for me because there you have to do things that the coach tells you," Lehtera joked. "It's much harder. In the games, you use your hockey sense.
"I've learned a lot of things here about myself, about hockey and everything. I like it here. I'm ready."
Yahoo Inc is focused on selling its core business to U.S. telecommunications company Verizon Communications Inc after reviewing final bids that it received this week, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
A deal would boost Verizon's AOL internet business, which it acquired last year for $4.4 billion US, by giving it access to Yahoo's advertising technology tools, as well other assets such as search, mail, messenger and real estate.
It would also mark the end of Yahoo as an operating company, leaving it only as the owner of a 35.5 per cent stake in Yahoo Japan, as well as its 15 per cent interest in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.
Those two stakes account for most of its $37 billion market capitalization. Yahoo views Verizon as the buyer that can deliver the most value, but negotiations between the two companies are continuing, and no deal has yet been reached, the sources said.
The value of Verizon's bid could not be learned. Bloomberg and CNBC reported the core interenet business was valued at $5 billion in the deal. Yahoo shares were up 0.4 per cent at $38 in morning trading, while Verizon rose 0.6 per cent to $55.71.
The sources requested anonymity because the negotiations are confidential. Verizon and Yahoo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Bloomberg reported earlier that Verizon was nearing a deal for Yahoo's core assets.
In December, Yahoo scrapped plans to spin off its Alibaba stake after investors fretted over whether that transaction could have been carried out on a tax-free basis. It instead decided to explore a sale of its core assets, spurred on by activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP.
When NASA's Dawn spacecraft visited Ceres, the largest world in the asteroid belt, its brightest feature was a huge surprise.
In the center of Occator crater, a large (but not the largest) feature on Ceres' moon-like surface exhibits a series of bright, white spots along the crater floor.
As Dawn flew closer, it was able to perform a distant chemical analysis, determining that this wasn't ice or aliens, but rather salts that were so reflective.
The dome-like structure is at a depth of 4 km (2.5 miles) below the surface, deeper than anything else known.
But the big surprise, as new analysis shows, is that the salts are sodium carbonates, not magnesium sulfates, indicating that at least the surface contains icy, Kuiper-belt like materials.
This represents the largest concentration of carbonate materials in the Solar System outside of Earth. An impacting asteroid could not have delivered them, indicating a recent hydrothermal origin from within Ceres itself.
At the pressures interior to Ceres, liquid, briny water could have existed, depositing salts and then sublimating, leaving the reflective, bright carbonates behind.
These carbonates may be abundant across the surface, as future Dawn data will reveal.

The Alabama men's basketball team will look to clinch its sixth consecutive win when the Crimson Tide (7-2) faces the Oregon Ducks (9-2) on Monday night. But while the game is considered a home contest for Alabama, it will be played in Birmingham and will be the seventh time in 10 games the Crimson Tide has played a game away from Coleman Coliseum.
Having a game in Birmingham was something first-year head coach Avery Johnson wanted to do, for several reasons.
"The idea was we have a tremendous following in Birmingham – alumni, donors, students who live there," Johnson said. "Birmingham is fertile ground for some of the top recruits in the country. I think whatever happens, it's a win-win."
Alabama will look to keep things rolling on the road without two starters. Junior power forward Shannon Hale will miss his second straight game because of "medical reasons," while freshman point guard Dazon Ingram is set to miss the remainder of the 2015-16 season. The Crimson Tide hopes to continue its winning ways in front of a crowded Legacy Arena.
In Tuscaloosa, the majority of UA's students have left town for their respective hometowns for the Christmas holidays, and while the Druid City has its fair share of December activities, the Magic City has a few more, being a bigger town.
"Taking it to Birmingham, there's a lot going on in Birmingham around the holidays so hopefully people come out, whatever they are doing, supporters, and take a look at what we're doing on the floor," Johnson said. "Every time we go into a game we have a lot of questions about our team. Hopefully, we'll get some of those questions answered and people just see how hard our team is working.
"We're very flawed, but we're working hard and we try to overcome some of our weaknesses with effort and organization and making good decisions on the floor and playing with mental and physical toughness and everyone understanding his role."
The early rumblings are the BJCC will hold a decent-sized audience, and that's what Johnson's hoping for Monday.
"From what I've heard we're going to have a pretty good crowd, which is always helpful," Johnson said. "And you're playing against a team that has been hovering in the top 25, have done a good job of building a basketball program that compete in Sweet 16s and hopefully Final Fours.

WHAT THEY'RE SAYING:
Head coach Avery Johnson
- On what he's seen from Oregon on film:
"Dillon Brooks (15.9 PPG, 6.8 RPG), man, what a player. Dillon Brooks, he's strong, he's physical, he rebounds. Their team gets steals. Their team has 91 steals in 11 games. That lets us know we have to take care of the ball. (Tyler) Dorsey (14.4 PPG), whether they start him or bring him off the bench. He's a microwave. They block shots.
"They are a well put-together team. You can tell they were strategic in how they put this team together. They know what they are doing. They are not a team like Xavier, Dayton, Wichita State, Notre Dame, all those teams we played. Clemson. They know what they are doing. They are put together. We're not coaching against a first-year coach."
- On Oregon Coach Dana Altman building basketball at football school.
"One of the reasons I took this job is because I had a chance to do some research on what Billy Donovan did at Florida. It can work at a football school. You look at what Dana Altman has done at Oregon. He's a heck of a coach. You have football schools like Florida, Clemson, Texas, Oregon, Michigan State has been doing it for years.
"That's something Coach (Nick) Saban and I talk about all the time. When he was coaching football there they had basketball and football rolling. It's doable. We feel as our fan base continues to grow and we get our students more involved and the word gets out and our fans travel with us like other basketball programs' fans travel with them, we'll take a step in the right direction."
- On how comfortable he is with point guard Justin Coleman
"Yeah, and it's not even letting the reins off. I feel more comfortable in knowing how to use him in the games. I've only coached these guys a few games. You can do all this summer work, all this drill work, but you've got to get in the games to see how guys function and what works for them. We've been trying to run a play for Justin the entire year. It just doesn't work. So we've thrown it in Lake Tuscaloosa. We're going to try something else."

Authorities in California are investigating possible hate crimes carried out against two Islamic centers.
A burned Koran filled with bacon was handcuffed to a fence outside the Masjid Annur Islamic Center in Sacramento, the largest mosque in the area.
The Koran was attached to a temporary fence erected between the Islamic center and the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department Central Division station.
BREAKING: Potential hate crime-Quran burned, left chained to fence outside Masjid Annur, the biggest Islamic Center in Sacramento @FOX40pic.twitter.com/HCOSNGtIAo — Joe Khalil (@JoeKhalil_Media) June 25, 2017
Meanwhile, in a separate incident, pages were torn out of the Koran on Friday and thrown at the Davis Islamic Center during evening prayer.
Police Sergeant Dan Powell told the Davis Enterprise the pages appeared to be printed text from the Koran that were cut into pieces.
CCTV footage showed a light-colored minivan drive past the center with bits of paper seen flying around the vehicle as it passed. Shortly beforehand, a dark blue sedan drove by, and police aren't sure whether the pages were thrown from the minivan or the sedan.
“It's happening way too often,” Sergeant Tony Turnbull told CBS Sacramento. “To be targeted like that because of your faith is unacceptable.”

Police have reported the incident to the FBI and regional terrorism assessment center. “That's important for these types of incidents,” Turnbull explained. “To see if there are connected, if there is a similar person or group."
In January, the Davis Center experienced a hate crime, when Lauren Kirk-Coehlo broke six of the center's windows and left bacon strips on the door handles. Kirk-Coehlo received five years probation last week.
Mohamed Kheiter, the Islamic Center's treasurer told the Davis Enterprise that while he forgave Kirk-Coehlo, he worried her release could inspire similar hate crimes because people would know, “in the end they walk out.”
“It gives them the green light to do something like that,” he said.
CBS reports the two latest incidents bring the number of attacks on local Islamic centers to six in the last six months. A Stockton and Davis mosque both received hate letters, and a mosque in Roseville was vandalized in February.
After Kirk-Coehlo vandalized the Davis mosque, hundreds in the community gathered to show their solidarity. Following Friday's incident, the group behind the original event, Statement of Love, arranged an event in front of the mosque.
“Our Muslim brothers and sisters will be breaking their fast for the last time before Ramadan comes to an end,” Kate Mellon-Anibaba posted on Facebook. “Let's show our Muslim community that we are here for them and that hate has no place in our town.”
UWP Community Toolkit: Driven by Microsoft, Developed by the Community
Alan Mendelevich Blocked Unblock Follow Oct 31, 2017
Note: this post is based on notes for my talk in front of Microsoft MVPs at CEE MVP Community Connection II 2017 in Budapest. So, there's a slight overemphasis on the MVP angle which could be translated to a broader community.
In this post, I'm going to tell you two fairy tales. They may get a little depressing at some points, but as all fairy tales they have a happy ending…
Imagine a world where every new Windows development framework had all the features of the previous one and then some. Can you? Close your eyes maybe that will help. Well, neither can I…
The reality is that every new technology brings new things but always lacks some core features of the previous one.
Actually, my most popular art project from back in 2009 was precisely about that…
So what do Microsoft and we do after every new platform release?
That's right. Microsoft releases a semi-official toolkit to close the gaps between feature rich but no longer hip technology and a brand new shiny thing. For a year after Windows 10 was released, there was no such thing for UWP.
But then, on August 17th, 2016 UWP Community Toolkit was unveiled.
The UWP Community Toolkit — in their own words — is a collection of helper functions, custom controls, and app services. It simplifies and demonstrates common developer tasks building UWP apps for Windows 10.
You can find all about it at uwpcommunitytoolkit.com.
And you can also download an excellent demo app from the Microsoft Store to see everything that the Toolkit has to offer.
The project was initiated by David Catuhe and the Partner Application Experience (PAX) team within Windows and is now led Nikola Metulev.
Microsoft's Developer Marketing
Let's switch gears for a bit, and I'll tell you the second fairy tale. You may need to close your eyes again…
So, imagine a world where every Microsoft product gets equal attention from Microsoft's developer marketing machine in the field… How are you doing?… Now fast-forward to 2016.
Pretty much the only thing we want to talk about these days is Azure. Don't get me wrong, I love Azure. I use Azure. It's just that there were very few Microsoft-driven opportunities to talk about anything else but Azure in the last couple of years.
Add it to the fact that Windows phone is dead. And you got yourself a pretty demotivated group of 300-something Windows Development MVPs.
So, what do you do when you still love the technology but have very few opportunities to spread the love? You guessed it right, and this is where our two fairy tales converge…
You contribute to an open source project, and there's no more high-profile project in the Windows Development space than UWP Community Toolkit.
If you read the initial release blog post, you will see a list of community members who contributed to the project.
“We are excited about the contributions that several community members already submitted in this first release, including Morten Nielsen, Scott Lovegrove, Pedro Lamas, Oren Novotny, James Croft, Diederik Krols, Hermit Dave, Thomas Nigro, Laurent Bugnion, Samuel Blanchard and Rudy Hyun.”
On that list, every single person is either MVP, RD or a former MVP who works for Microsoft now. Well, this is not precisely true, because at the time this was posted at least two contributors on that list weren't MVPs yet. But that's, in no small part, how they become MVPs.
Leading up to the initial toolkit release, most of the contributions to it were made by Microsofties. However, in just a month since its release, the scales have flipped, and it was the community contributing more than Microsoft.
“Currently, over 80% of contributors are from the community, and most contributions come from the community.”
— Nikola Metulev
At this point over 80% of the contributors are from the community and making most of the contributions.
How to start contributing to the project?
If you find a bug in some part of the toolkit, you can create an issue on its GitHub page, but preferably you can just take the code, fix the bug and submit a Pull Request.
Willing to contribute your time and expertise, but have nothing particular in mind? Go to Toolkit's GitHub page, then Issues and filter issues with “help wanted” label. You will find a bunch of issues you can help solve. And, apparently, there are t-shirts!
Finally, if you have a new feature in mind, you should start by creating a UserVoice entry about it and discussing it with the community and stakeholders. Only after you get a universal approval, you should start coding. Then don't forget to add documentation, a sample in the sample app, unit tests and then submit a Pull Request. You can find the whole guide for contributing to the project on its GitHub page. And remember, only start coding when you get approval for your idea. Unless you don't mind wasting your time. Ask me how I know this…
Back in 2010, I've created an open source charting library for Windows Phone. Once the toolkit was released, I had an idea of porting this library to UWP for inclusion in the toolkit. I've read contribution guidelines and knew that I should ask first, but I wasn't sure how difficult it would be to port and didn't want to commit to doing it before I did my research. Long story short, in a couple of weekends I was able to port the code and resolve all the major issues. So I went ahead and proposed my work for inclusion in the toolkit…
I was commended for my work but was told by David in some murky terms that this is not something they are looking to include in the toolkit right now. I tried to figure out the real reason behind this rejection through other channels but only got some shady smiles and “no comment.” It all got clear 3 months later.
Turns out Microsoft was already working with Telerik on open-sourcing their UWP controls which include charts among other things. Now the rejection became clear and made total sense and was just another reminder to… get stakeholder approval before committing your time.
To summarize
Contributing to an open source project lets you work with the newest technologies on a product thousands of developers will use, and, possibly, get awarded with MVP Award or have your MVP status renewed in the process. Or you can just use the toolkit to build your next great app.
And when you do, you can come to us at AdDuplex to monetize or advertise it.

A UC Irvine student Palestinian-support group begins the school year this month with a two-year probation for disrupting an event on campus featuring young veteran Israeli soldiers.
The campus chapter of the Students for Justice in Palestine, SJP, faces disciplinary probation for two academic years. During that time, members must meet with the dean of students 12 times to discuss free speech issues and must also consult with a representative of the dean's office before hosting or co-hosting any campus event.
This is not the first time SJP has been accused of disrupting an Israeli-related event. The group is appealing the administration's decision and has filed its own complaint against UCI's Students Supporting Israel.
Meanwhile, any further violations of the campus code of student conduct could lead UCI to suspend or revoke the student Palestinian organization's status, university officials said.
“UCI welcomes all opinions and encourages a free exchange of ideas – in fact, we defend free speech as one of our bedrock principles as a public university,” read a statement issued last week.
“Yet, we must protect everyone's right to express themselves without disruption. This concept is clearly articulated in our policies and campus messaging. We will hold firm in enforcing it.”
Kevin Brum, president of UCI's Students Supporting Israel, said Monday: “This is not the first time SJP has tried to shut us down or trample our rights. We're happy the university is taking it more seriously than they have in the past.”
Liz Jackson, staff attorney with Palestine Legal, an organization dedicated to supporting the Palestinian rights movement, said UCI's decision is “not about the facts or the law. It's a politically motivated choice to curtail the speech activities of students who stand up for Palestinian rights.”
“It's clearly UCI that needs the lesson in free speech, not the students,” Jackson said in a statement. Individual students were not sanctioned, she said in an e-mail.
On May 10, the UCI Students Supporting Israel group hosted five former Israeli soldiers to campus. About a dozen people attended the program when about an hour into the event, as a Q&A was underway, a group of more than 30 members and supporters of the SJP group walked in.
At first, they were invited to participate and ask questions, as seen in videos posted online. The Israeli soldiers answered several of the questions about the conflict plaguing the Middle East but emotions soon began to flare. Shouted questions and clapping later dissolved into chants against Israel.
“You're killing our people,” one woman screamed.
The forum with the soldiers took place the same week the campus Muslim Student Union and other organizations put on the annual “Anti-Zionism Week,” which includes marches with chants like “Long Live the Intifada.”
During the week, organizers erect what they call an “apartheid wall,” symbolic of the one built in Israel after terrorist attacks; it is viewed by Israelis as a security measure and by Palestinians as segregationist. “Anti-Zionism Week” organizers say they see the week as an opportunity to share their views on the conflict in the Middle East.
This year, the young Israeli veterans, part of a group called Reservists on Duty, attended every day to pass out their own literature and share their views on the conflict with passersby.
Palestine Legal has filed a complaint against Students Supporting Israel, saying the former soldiers invited to campus harassed the SJP group and their supporters.
Brum, of the Students Supporting Israel group, said the soldiers did not harass anyone. Instead, they were on hand to answer questions, challenge information written on the so-called “apartheid wall” and counter what he called lies propagated by the student Palestinian group.
“They have this whole week where they put up a wall and have a monopoly on the conversation,” Brum said.
Last year's “Anti-Zionism Week” included a counter-event featuring a movie about Israeli soldiers. That movie event was disrupted by protesters and it created a firestorm of controversy, with dozens of organizations supporting each side and demanding the university act. Administrators eventually gave the SJP a warning letter, saying the group violated conduct policies.
There have been other conflicts. Most notably, in 2010, 11 Muslim students from UCI and UC Riverside were arrested and charged for conspiring to disrupt a speech by then-Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren. The following year, a jury found 10 of the students guilty and they were sentenced to three years of probation, cut to one year if they served community service.
President Donald Trump has a unique talent -- and taste -- for making bad situations worse. For making wild claims, then failing to back them up. He was at it -- once again -- on Wednesday morning when he tweeted about his now controversial Tuesday evening conversation with the widow of an American soldier killed in Niger.
That last sentence alone would've been enough to set off a five-alarm fire in any past White House. "Damage control mode," or whatever you want to call it, exists for a reason. But the Trump presidency approaches that concept with disdain. Where his predecessors wielded fire extinguishers, Trump prefers a flame tosser.
And so, he woke up, apparently took in the reviews of his chat, and tweeted this:
Democrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof). Sad!
But first, a quick rewind. How did we get here?
In brief: reporters asked Trump on Monday why he hadn't spoken out about four soldiers killed nearly two weeks earlier during an ambush in West Africa. He didn't quite answer, but did say he planned to call their families. (Yes, there was more , but let's keep focused.) A day later, Trump made contact with the wife of slain Sgt. La David Johnson. Then, according to the family and Florida Rep. Frederica Wilson, who listened in to their exchange, Trump offered this chestnut: "(Johnson) knew what he signed up for, but I guess it still hurt."
Whatever the particular context, the path forward here -- both as a matter of political course and simple manners -- was pretty simple: Say sorry, or nothing, and move on.
But those things are anathema to Trump. He doesn't apologize or keep quiet and, by his own admission , is incapable of letting criticism pass. And we learned a while back that there are no exceptions for the families of US soldiers killed on the battlefield.
So Trump beat on, tweeting against the current of decency, accused the congresswoman of lying and -- here's the most important part -- suggested that he had "proof" to back up his claim. As per usual, he did not provide any evidence to verify its existence, nor did he characterize its form. Is it a tape? A transcript? Did he record the conversation?
The answer is no, according to White House press secretary Sarah Sanders. On Wednesday afternoon, she was asked by CNN's Sara Murray about the "proof," and told reporters in the briefing room that "there were several people in the room from the administration that were on the call, including the chief of staff, Gen. John Kelly." In short, no audio record -- meaning Trump's evidence begins and ends with his word and those of his aides.
Again, even taking Sanders at her word, this shouldn't have come as a surprise. This President's priors all but guaranteed it. Back in May, he tweeted that James Comey, the FBI director he'd fired days earlier, "better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!" A 40-day wild goose chase later , Trump conceded he'd been bluffing.

And then there was the false accusation he leveled against former President Barack Obama back in March.
"Terrible!," he tweeted, in the voice of friend calling you up to share some upsetting gossip. "Just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!"
Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my "wires tapped" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017
A day later, Sanders, then a deputy to former press secretary Sean Spicer, claimed Trump was simply repeating what he'd read in the papers or seen on television.
"Everybody acts like President Trump is the one that came up with this idea," she said. "There are multiple news outlets that have reported this."
That was, of course, false . Trump and his staff offered increasingly painful deflections and head fakes thereafter. The first and perhaps most memorable came when Spicer parroted a Fox News analyst's charge -- which the network's news division ran away from -- that Obama had outsourced the job to British intelligence , which drew the UK's prime minister and its GCHQ into the mess. They quickly and crossly denied it and the White House duly backed off. Both Comey and NSA director Mike Rogers would also shoot down Trump's claim during sworn testimony on Capitol Hill.
In her comment to reporters on Wednesday, Sanders, like her predecessor, breathed some new air into this latest round. By naming Kelly, the chief of staff and father to a son killed in combat, as one of the people "on the call," Sanders drew one of the administration's top officials into the morass.
Kelly is probably mindful enough to stay mum, but the questions now have new legs -- and the situation as whole seems ripe to further deteriorate.
Sony/ATV Music Publishing has been named the No. 1 music publisher in the U.S. for the 20th consecutive quarter — five full years.
The rankings are compiled every quarter by Billboard and are determined by music publishers' market share of the top 100 U.S. radio airplay songs for the previous quarter, according to Nielsen Music data and song splits compiled by the Harry Fox Agency. The most recent survey covers the period April to June 2017.
Sony/ATV Chairman and CEO Martin Bandier said: “Being in first place for five years doesn't happen by accident, but is a tribute to the immense talent of our songwriters, the amazing songs they create and the hard work of our team. It is an amazing accomplishment and one we are very proud of.”
Sony/ATV has dominated the survey since it became administrator of EMI Music Publishing in 2012. That year Bandier led the effort to acquire the catalog (bringing in 1.3 million copyrights for songs by Carole King, Norah Jones, Motown classics, and standards like “Somewhere Over the Rainbow”) in a deal valued at $2.2 billion. Sony, which acquired the half of Sony/ATV it did not already own from the Michael Jackson estate last year, is said to be gearing up to purchase EMI outright at some point in the coming months.
In the most recent quarter, Sony/ATV achieved a 23.3% market share and was represented on 49 of the top 100 songs on U.S. radio during Q2 2017. Nine of the quarter's Top 10 radio songs are co-published by Sony/ATV, led by the Bruno Mars hit “That's What I Like”, which is the period's No. 1 hit, and “Shape Of You”, which was co-written and performed by Sony/ATV songwriter Ed Sheeran, at No. 2. The Sheeran hit spent 12 consecutive weeks at No. 1 on Billboard's weekly Radio Songs airplay chart, the joint longest chart-topping run on the chart this decade.
Hi Guys,
Kyren is still busy moving stuff around, but today has been very productive.
We're working a ton on progression right now. Lots of bits and pieces are coming together and our goal is to get the game fully playable without any admin commands. That means every important item needs to be craftable, getting the costs right and the leveling right for everything that has a level. Making sure ore distributions are correct. That sort of thing. It's going to take us a while but it's a major step towards the completion of the game.
We're also working on the quest system which is going to help give the player direction (if he or she wants one) and alternative ways to earn money and items.
On top of that we've been giving each of the random monsters an evolution. You can see an example of an evolved monster hanging around with his base chums here:
Tuesday night, for the second time in five months, WWE Raw graced Austin with its pageantry of wrestling entertainment at the Frank Erwin Center. Austinites returned the favor by being the same reliably active crowd it'd been in the past, even if Christmas was a bit of a downer for everyone. Please allow me to explain what I mean.
In an unlikely scenario, WWE's flagship show, “Monday Night Raw,” which normally airs live (on, you guessed it, Mondays), taped its upcoming Christmas show to air Dec. 23 six days early, since even wrestlers like to get home to their families. I'll avoid specific spoilers for those who'll wait to watch on Monday, but here were a few Austin-related highlights from the show.
Vickie! Vickie!: More surprising than a few heels winning clean matches, notorious villain and harpy shrew Vickie Guerrero got some good love from the Austin crowd during the six-on-six divas tag match. Impressive, considering this is the same crowd that, back in 2010, spent 3 full minutes booing her so ferociously that Guerrero couldn't get a word out on the mic.
How To Win A Crowd: Hook ‘Em: From Silsbee, TX native, Mark Henry to crowd panderer hero-to-every-six-year-old John Cena, every good guy in the arena put the iconic “”Hook 'Em Horns” hands up in an effort to gain support. Not that Tuesday was a complete lovefest: The ever-intelligent Longhorn crowd remembered Jack Swagger's actually a former Oklahoma All-American and threw in a few “OU Sucks” chants chants or good measure.
How to Lose A Crowd: Call Austin “Houston”: Traveling across the country over 280 days a year can be tough. You get tired, sleep deprived. Sometimes it gets so bad you forget where you are. Such was the case for good guy Darren Young, one half of the Prime Time Players, who somehow addressed the crowd as Houston. Boos rained upon Young and kept him from being able to speak, and his partner had to finish the promo while Young profusely apologized. For a tag match that's normally a time-filler (and a match you're likely to fast forward through on the DVR), the duos match versus the Usos might have been the highlight of the night, with chants of “This is Austin” and “Houston Sucks” echoing throughout the building during their entire bout.
Christmas Is a Downer: After the taping was over, Cena acknowledged to the crowd that, while impressive, Austin's participation was a little weaker than it had been in the past. I'll blame the Christmas-themed episode that subjected the crowd to slow developing, and ultimately boring, matches: The “Battle for Christmas” match pitting Bad Santa against Good Santa, complete with a toilet in the ring, as well a “Christmas Carol Sing Off” were both ultimately good opportunities for bathroom breaks. Christmas episodes are notorious for sacrificing storylines and good technical wrestling for family friendly shenanigans and, this year's episode was no different. It will be a Christmas miracle if I can get the Great Kahli singing “Deck The Halls” out of my head by next week.
Is a $15 gift card enough to compensate for public humiliation at your local grocery store? According to one Georgia woman, the answer is absolutely not.
Cindy Nerger, 28, who relies on food stamps to feed her family, said she was brought to tears after being embarrassed by a manager at a Kroger store in Warner Robbins, Ga.
"He said, 'Excuse me for working for a living and not relying on food stamps like you,'" Nerger said the manager told her.
The man's comment came after Nerger and two other store employees disagreed over whether her total purchase was eligible for food stamps - the employees had insisted that roughly $10 of her bill was not covered. She said the manager ultimately told the employees to "just give it to her."
After Nerger then stressed that she had been right all along, the man made his "working for a living" remark, she said.
"I turned around and realized how many people heard him and how many saw that happened and I was so embarrassed… I started crying," she said.
In a statement to ABCNews.com, a Kroger spokesman said, "We deeply regret our customer's experience. The comments made were not reflective of our company's policy. We value all of our customers. Please know that we have taken immediate steps to make sure something like this never happens again."
WATCH: Customers React When They See a Woman Heckled for Running Out of Food Stamps in a "What Would You Do?" Scenario
The spokesman did not reply to a follow-up message asking for more information, but a local Georgia television station reported that Kroger had transferred the manager at the center of the controversy to another store.
Nerger said the reason she and her family - she is married with a daughter - must rely on food stamps is because her husband's carpentry business isn't profitable enough to support the family.
Meanwhile, Nerger must devote 12 hours every night to a dialysis treatment to combat her kidney disease, which she's struggled with since the age of 11. She's been on a kidney transplant list for five years and hopes that someday, after a successful transplant, she can become a working member of society. She would like to attend college to major in child psychology.
"There's just so much stigmatism put on people on food stamps. They're just some losers who don't want to work. That isn't the case in every situation," she said.
Nerger's account of her run-in with a Kroger manager went viral after she posted it to her Facebook page, prompting friends to encourage her to post a message to a local television station. The station ended up contacting her and doing a story.
Kroger, meanwhile, responded to a complaint Nerger passed on through the store's national customer service line by apologizing and offering her a $15 gift card. Nerger said she rejected the offer because she doesn't plan on shopping at Kroger again.
What she wants, she said, is an apology directly from the manager, whom she also believes should be demoted from his job and trained how to treat customers properly.
She stopped short of saying the man should lose his job.
"I didn't want anybody to be in the food stamp line with me," she said.
Nanoengineers from UC San Diego have developed nanosponges that soak up a dangerous pore-forming toxin produced by MRSA, and have shown that their nanosponge vaccine was safe and more effective than toxoid vaccines made from heat-treated staph toxin.
Nanosponges that soak up a dangerous pore-forming toxin produced by MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) could serve as a safe and effective vaccine against this toxin. This “nanosponge vaccine” enabled the immune systems of mice to block the adverse effects of the alpha-haemolysin toxin from MRSA—both within the bloodstream and on the skin. Nanoengineers from the University of California, San Diego described the safety and efficacy of this nanosponge vaccine in the December 1 issue of Nature Nanotechnology.
The nanosponges at the foundation of the experimental “toxoid vaccine” platform are bio-compatible particles made of a polymer core wrapped in a red-blood-cell membrane. Each nanosponge's red-blood-cell membrane seizes and detains the Staphylococcus aureus (staph) toxin alpha-haemolysin without compromising the toxin's structural integrity through heating or chemical processing. These toxin-studded nanosponges served as vaccines capable of triggering neutralizing antibodies and fighting off otherwise lethal doses of the toxin in mice.
Toxoid vaccines protect against a toxin or set of toxins, rather than the organism that produces the toxin(s). As the problem of antibiotic resistance worsens, toxoid vaccines offer a promising approach to fight infections without reliance on antibiotics.
“With our toxoid vaccine, we don't have to worry about antibiotic resistance. We directly target the alpha-haemolysin toxin,” said Liangfang Zhang, a nanoengineering professor at UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering and the senior author on the paper. Targeting the alpha-haemolysin toxin directly has another perk. “These toxins create a toxic environment that serves as a defense mechanism which makes it harder for the immune system to fight Staph bacteria,” explained Zhang.
Beyond MRSA and other staph infections, the nanosponge vaccine approach could be used to create vaccines that protect against a wide range of toxins, including those produced by E. coli and H. pylori.
This work from Zhang's Nanomaterials and Nanomedicine Laboratory at the UC San Diego included nanoengineering post-doctoral researcher Che-Ming “Jack” Hu, nanoengineering graduate student Ronnie Fang, and bioengineering graduate student Brian Luk.
The researchers found that their nanosponge vaccine was safe and more effective than toxoid vaccines made from heat-treated staph toxin. After one injection, just 10 percent of staph-infected mice treated with the heated version survived, compared to 50 percent for those who received the nanosponge vaccine. With two more booster shots, survival rates with the nanosponge vaccine were up to 100 percent, compared to 90 percent with the heat-treated toxin.
“The nanosponge vaccine was also able to completely prevent the toxin's damages in the skin, where MRSA infections frequently take place,” said Zhang, who is also affiliated with the Moores Cancer Center at UC San Diego.
Fighting Pore-Forming Toxins
This work is a twist on a project the UC San Diego nanoengineers presented earlier this year: a nanosponge that can sop up a variety of pore-forming toxins—from bacterial proteins to snake venom—in the body.
Pore-forming toxins work by punching holes in a cell's membrane and letting the cell essentially leak to death. But when toxins attack the red blood cell membrane draped over the nanoparticle, “nothing will happen. It just locks the toxin there,” Zhang explained.
The nanoengineers wondered what would happen if they loaded one of their nanosponges with staph toxin in this way, and presented the whole package to an essential part of the immune system called dendritic cells. Could the loaded particles trigger an immune response and work as a toxoid vaccine?
Staph toxin is so powerful that it kills immune cells in its unaltered form. Most vaccine candidates, therefore, use a heat or chemically processed version of the toxin that unravels some of its proteins and makes it a little weaker. But this process also makes the immune response to the toxin a little weaker.
“The more you heat it, the safer the toxin is, but the more you heat it, the more you damage the structure of the protein,” Zhang explained. “And this structure is what the immune cell recognizes, and builds its antibodies against.”
The nanosponge toxoid vaccine gets around this problem by detaining—but not changing—the staph toxin. Like a dangerous but handcuffed prisoner, the staph toxin can be led to the dendritic cells of the immune system without causing any harm.
Before this, “there was no way you could deliver a native toxin to the immune cells without damaging the cells,” Zhang said. “But this technology allows us to do this.”
Each vaccine particle is approximately 85 nanometers in diameter; for comparison, about 1000 of them would fit across the width of a single human hair. They are cleared from the body after injection in about two weeks, the researchers found.
Staphylococcus aureus
Staph bacteria are one of the most common causes of skin infections, and can cause blood poisoning and surgical infections as well as pneumonia. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 80,000 Americans suffer from invasive MRSA infections each year, and over 11,000 of those individuals die. At the moment, there are no vaccines approved to protect humans against the toxins associated with staph infections, including those caused by MRSA strains.
The idea for a staph vaccine came about when the researchers considered the success of their nanosponge. If the particle was so good at collecting toxins, they wondered, what were the potential uses of a particle full of toxin? “To be honest, we never thought about the vaccine use from the beginning,” Zhang noted. “But when we do research, we always want to look at a problem in reverse.”
In a way, the toxoid vaccine hearkens back to their first use for the particles, as a cancer drug delivery device, Zhang noted.
The particles “work so beautifully,” Zhang said, that it might be possible to detain several toxins at once on them, creating “one vaccine against many types of pore-forming toxins,” from staph to snake venom.
The research was funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health (award no. R01DK095168) and by the National Science Foundation (grant DMR-1216461).

The long-simmering feud and legal battle between guitarist Frank Zappa's children boiled over again after last week's announcement from the Zappa Family Trust of a forthcoming Frank Zappa – Back On The Road: The Hologram Tour. When the ZFT revealed plans for the tour, they mentioned the possible participation of Dweezil Zappa which did not sit well with DZ. Dweezil wrote a blog post about his legal battle, the ZFT responded and now Dweezil has shared another blog post detailing a proposal to end the stalemate that his lawyer sent to the ZFT.
The Zappa Family Trust is run by Frank and Gail Zappa's children Ahmet Zappa and Diva Zappa. Dweezil and his sister Moon Zappa were given smaller portions of the ZFT following Gail's death and are not involved in the day-to-day operations of the estate. In Dweezil's first blog post he took particular offense to Ahmet's claim to Rolling Stone that the ZFT attempts to stop the guitarist from using his own name were “1 million percent false.”
Diva Zappa, on behalf of the ZFT, responded to Dweezil's blog post with a tweet featuring a legal document submitted on September 25 stating the Zappa Family Trust is not trying to prevent Dweezil from using his given name:
https://twitter.com/divazappa/status/912507358231719936
“In it, they altered their position just slightly for appearances and have attempted to then disingenuously pass it off as having been their position the whole time,” Dweezil claims in a blog post published today. Dweezil's most recent blog post includes a note the guitarist's lawyer sent to the ZFT looking to settle the trademark issue and enter into a “coexistence agreement”:
I have reviewed Applicant's Second Supplemental Response to Opposer's First Set of Interrogatories dated September 25, 2017 (yesterday), which adds this new statement to your previous response: “The Zappa Family Trust has no issue with Dweezil Zappa using his full name to identify or describe himself as a musician.” We view your newly announced position as an opportunity for Dweezil to once again propose a path to resolution of the opposition action. Dweezil is willing to dismiss the opposition action if the ZFT is willing to enter into a coexistence agreement that provides that ZFT consents to Dweezil's use and registration of the trademark DWEEZIL ZAPPA in connection with various goods and services, including in the music and entertainment field. Please let me know if your client would like to explore entering into a coexistence agreement and resolving this opposition.
French police on Monday dismantled a network sending jihadist fighters to Syria in a series of dawn raids that saw them nab 10 suspects across the country, said Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.
Elite and anti-terror police units descended on around a dozen targets, mostly in the southern region of Toulouse, but also around Paris and in the northern region of Normandy.
"Dismantling organised jihadist networks is a top priority for police, in perfect coordination with judicial authorities," Cazeneuve said in a statement highlighting government's determination to "relentlessly fight terrorism."
In recent months France, which has Europe's largest Muslim population, has been facing the fact that hundreds of its citizens have openly joined jihadist groups in Iraq and Syria and have even called for attacks on their homeland.
The new reality was driven home in a video from the Islamic State group released in mid-November, showing three Kalashnikov-wielding Frenchmen burning their passports and calling on Muslims to join them or stage attacks in France.
A grisly execution video released around the same time featured at least one French citizen who hailed from a small village in Normandy and converted to Islam in his teens.
Almost 1,000 French nationals from a wide range of backgrounds are estimated to have left to join jihadists in Iraq and Syria, including some 400 thought to be currently fighting on the ground and almost 50 who were killed.
According to figures published in the Le Monde newspaper in November, about a quarter of those who left to join the jihadists were converts to Islam, with many coming from everyday French backgrounds.

“Where Do You Get ‘It' From?”
Author: Publius*
Most patients don't get asked where they get their medicine. That's because everyone knows people get their medicine from a pharmacy. But I have to get my medicine otherwise. I have to safeguard my “source” because my medicine is cannabinoid based – and that makes it almost illegal. – But not today. Today I can answer the source question openly because it is my local pharmacy – with drive-thru service and open to dispense medicine 24 hours a day. I drive up and push a big, yellow smiley-faced button to gain access – a soft automated voice comes over the speaker to verify that I am in the right place in order to pick up my prescription. Next, the typical professional looking person – white coat with badge – slides open the window asking my name and what I need.
“I'm picking up a prescription for Publius.”
They return with a baggie and bottle containing 30 synthetic cannabinoid capsules dosed at 5mg each – that's right, legal cannabinoids!
What are cannabinoids? Well, here is where things get interesting. As one learns in biology, the human body has many systems – the circulatory, respiratory, digestive, and nervous systems to name a few. Each system has parts: for example, the nervous system is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. By the late 1980s, science identified a new human system – the endocannabinoid system (ECS) – also referred to as the cannabinoid system. There is a cannabinoid system present in all mammals – to include humans and 15,000 other species. A mammal is any vertebrate animal distinguished by self-regulating body temperature, hair, and milk-producing females – as mammal means “breast” or of the breast.
The ECS has two main parts: cannabinoids, which are chemical neurotransmitters, and two receptors called “CB1” and “CB2.” Cannabinoids activate receptors found throughout the body – in all organs, for example. In fact, all systems in our bodies are modulated by the cannabinoid system. This means that as a body system changes, it uses the ECS to do so.
Science and popular search sites like Wikipedia use three classifications of cannabinoids: 1. Endogenous cannabinoids (also referred to as endocannabinoids), which are produced by the human body 2. Herbal cannabinoids, the kind found in the cannabis sativa plant 3. Synthetic cannabinoids, produced and distributed by pharmaceutical companies
The third kind is what I am picking up from the pharmacy – 30 Marinol (Dronabinol) capsules. Marinol is a prescribed cannabinoid from my doctor – and I am going to test it against the herbal cannabinoids I have been baking into my brownies for five years now.
The pharmacist hands me a white paper bag containing the Marinol prescribed for my Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Stapled to the top is a typical handout with cautionary medical information. The small amount (150mg) of the synthetic cannabinoid THC costs $370 – or more than $69,000 per ounce!
I sign my name on a distribution sheet and pay my $3 Medicare co-pay. The government, meaning our tax dollars, pays the other $367 for my medicine. Now I am ready to go – but not before my ‘synthetic cannabinoid' dealer informs me of possible side effects. She warns me to be on the lookout for – “dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, feeling ‘high,' an exaggerated sense of well-being, lightheadedness, headache, red eyes, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, clumsiness, or unsteadiness.”
Geez – sounds like a lot of potential adversity on my chemically sensitive body. From personal experience, I know that the herbal cannabinoids do not cause these side effects in my body. The pharmacist did mention one noticeable side effect that I have had with eating cannabis brownies: dry mouth – which is hardly a problem when considering the overall benefits of the medicine.
When I get home I open the bag to take a look at the Marinol. The pills are a deep maroon color and perfectly round. They remind me of Boston Baked Beans – as they look exactly like those candies. One thing is for sure: synthetic cannabinoids do not look anything like herbal cannabinoids – the ones from the plant itself. The distinct medical difference of popping pills versus the variations and qualities of consuming natural cannabis cannot be understated – and surely won't be by me. After a week of taking one pill a night before bed, as the doctor prescribed, I do not notice any positive effects from the Marinol. It makes me hungry – but that was never a problem in the first place. However, it is my first legal cannabinoid and that is what counts, right? – Not whether it works, just whether it is legal, right?
Wrong.
Here is what I know. I have been self-medicating with herbal cannabinoids for five years to provide relief from MS, which I have had for 23 years. During that time I went through the long list of prescribed pharmaceuticals. The relief was minimal. The problem was (and is) the side effects, which became unbearable over time. I felt like a slave, dependent on a cycle of pharmaceutical use which abused my body and left me in the most depressed, hopeless, and flattened state.
I finally said enough of the pharma-tinkering with my body and the MS and tried baking herbal cannabinoids into brownies. In doing so, my alternative treatment made me a criminal. I began to eat a small cube of cannabis brownie three times a day. Within the first month my insomnia disappeared, my bladder issues calmed, nerve tingles of the arms, legs, and feet stilled. I was no longer breaking out in upper body tremors after being out in the world of loud noises, traffic, and the everyday racing of life. The MS was quieter. I found I wasn't contemplating suicide and I felt hopeful about my life again – but realized I had become a chronic criminal.
Cannabinoids are clearly medicinal to our bodies. But there is a strange distinction between which cannabinoids are effective and which ones are legal. In the case of my MS, appetite stimulation has not been a problem – which is what the Marinol is usually prescribed for. Marinol simply did not work for me. There are other pharmaceutical cannabinoids – such as Nabilone and Sativex – available in other countries, but they remain expensive and less effective than herbal cannabinoids. Nature created cannabis and the mammalian ECS, not you or me – and it was through the use of herbal cannabinoids that I was able to wean myself from a life of pharma-cocktails and move toward a healthier life. – Just as nature designed.

Germany's plans for a radical expansion in offshore wind power generation are at risk of failure because of delays in hooking the wind farms up to the power grid, German power company E.on warned on Tuesday.
Mike Winkel, head of the company's Climate & Renewables division, told the Berliner Zeitung newspaper that E.on and other power companies will stop investing in offshore power if the grid operators don't speed up their construction of power lines to transport the power generated by the wind farms.
"The situation is disastrous," Winkel told the newspaper. "The grid operators aren't keeping up." He said grid operator Tennet was 15 months behind with work on linking the Amrumbank offshore wind farm, operated by E.on, to the grid.
"The grid operators overestimated themselves and underestimated the problems," Winkel said. "Secondly, they don't have sufficient financial incentives," he added, explaining that the regulatory authority doesn't pay an especially high return on their investments. Another problem, he explained, is that the suppliers aren't managing to manufacture the required cables. "Finally, authorities are causing major confusion over who is responsible for what, and they're not coordinating among each other."
Pessimistic Outlook
The German government plans to increase the share of green power to 35 percent of power consumption by 2020 from 20 percent at present. A decisive part of that increase is to come from offshore wind farms, seen as particularly suitable because the wind blows constantly at sea, which makes it a more reliable source of power than solar energy or wind turbines on land.
"We have a very big problem," said Winkel. "I'm pessimistic for the time after 2015 if nothing changes. No one will go on investing if the grid link is as uncertain as it is now, neither E.on nor others."
He said E.on plans two other major projects after Amrumbank, one in the North Sea and one in the Baltic. "But given the uncertain grid link, we can't make an investment decision at present." He said the problem with the link "poses an acute threat to Germany's energy revolution."
There has been growing criticism of delays in building wind farms in the North Sea and Baltic. In January, the German Transport Ministry provided figures which outline the scale of the task Germany faces. The plan is to have 10,000 wind turbines in operation off Germany's coasts by 2030. It currently only has 27. The aim is for the windfarms to produce 25,000 megawatts of power -- so far, it's just 135 megawatts. Energy company RWE has also complained about delays in power line construction.
In an effort to raise awareness and financial support for continued hurricane relief efforts, the Creighton and Omaha men's basketball programs will play a charity exhibition game on Thursday, Oct. 26 at 7 p.m. on First National Bank Court at CenturyLink Center Omaha."We're honored to play in such an important event with Creighton and to help so many people in need after the devastation brought on by the recent hurricanes in the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands," Omaha head coachsaid. "We're grateful to Coach McDermott for the invitation to support such a great cause. He and I have participated in other philanthropic events together over the years, and this is another example of how our two institutions and basketball programs can impact others at a national level."All seats will be reserved with the cost $10 per ticket (adult or youth) and will go on sale to the general public at 10 a.m. on Friday, Oct. 20. Fans can purchase tickets online at Ticketmaster.com, by phone via Ticketmaster at 800-745-3000 or in person at the CenturyLink Center Box Office (open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Friday). The Creighton Ticket Office inside the Ryan Athletic Center will also be open on Friday from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. On Saturday, Oct. 21 during the Home Show, the convention center box office at CenturyLink Center will be open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.The exhibition between the Bluejays and Mavericks will be broadcast live locally on 1620 AM, but it will not be televised or streamed online.The schools requested a waiver, with the support of both athletic directors, from the NCAA for an additional exhibition game provided 100 percent of the net profits assisted with hurricane relief efforts across the country. The two universities have partnered with the American Red Cross Hurricane Relief Fund. Per NCAA rules, public exhibitions are normally only permitted against non-NCAA Division I four-year institutions.Omaha and Creighton have not met since an exhibition on Nov. 8, 2009.
Carolina Panthers safety Mike Mitchell made an appearance on the FnA podcast from FOX Sports L.A. and had some interesting comments. Particularly about New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees and the hit he received from San Francisco 49ers linebacker Ahmad Brooks.
“The thing that I hated about the play, the whole thing, and this is what these offensive guys are doing, they're kind of running with it,” Mitchell said. “Drew Brees is throwing a fit in the post-game interview saying how he got hit in the chin and he was dazed, and all this other stuff. And it's like, dude, the replay clearly shows he did not even touch you in the chin.
“Stop being soft, get up off the ground,” Mitchell said. “You fumbled the football, that's why the only reason you were acting like you were hurt, is so you could draw a flag.”
Mitchell thinks this will lead to others copying Brees and flopping around to draw flags.
“You saw the play with Drew Brees,” Mitchell said. “He did not get hit in the chin. He got hit hard, which he should have got hit hard because we are playing full speed tackle football. And he fumbled the football. And I think that's really was the reason he was down so long. He was really trying to sell that and trying to get a flag. And obviously it worked, and their team was able to steal a win because of that play.”
No Single-Family Homes Fixed With Build It Back Funds Since Sandy View Full Caption
NEW YORK CITY — Nearly a year and a half after Hurricane Sandy decimated large swaths of the city's waterfront, not a single one-family home has been rebuilt or repaired with the nearly $700 million earmarked for recovery.
Build It Back, created to help storm victims who were displaced, had nearly 20,000 single-family home applicants for relief funds. Just 171 of those have been awarded money out of the $306 million pot as of Feb. 20.
None of these projects has started construction, though an official said, as of Thursday, 47 homes were in "varying stages of design consultations/pre-construction activities."
This has led some applicants to the program — which, according to the most recent statistics, has started only three multi-family construction projects from among the more than 1,000 applicants — to say it is mismanaged, misleading and mired in miscommunication.
Build It Back has already cycled through two directors — Brad Gair, the original boss, stepped down in November and its current director Kathryn Mallon left on Tuesday, as DNAinfo New York first reported.
The federally-funded program was announced in June as the city's next step after Rapid Repairs, which used federal dollars to help restore utilities in damaged homes.
Build It Back was designed to provide cash for repairs and reimbursement funds for single-family and multi-family homeowners, resiliency projects for public housing and rental assistance for those impacted by the storm and the city has so far allocated $648 million in federal funds to the program.
Starting in July, when registration opened, through the Oct. 31, 2013 deadline, thousands registered for assistance.
Last October, former Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced the first Build It Back project, which distributed $2.5 million for three buildings in the city — Knickerbocker Village in Manhattan and two buildings in Rockaway.
Those buildings are being fixed up through the multi-family assistance program, which helps residential buildings that have five or more families.
Build It Back officials pointed to an uptick in meetings with applicants in an email to DNAinfo, as well as a jump in awards selections — which increased 52 percent, from 110 to 171, from Jan. 28 to Feb. 20.
City officials, including Mayor Bill de Blasio at a press conference on Thursday, have said that the complicated, document-heavy process for receiving funds from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development has slowed the release of funds.
But the state's New York Rising program, by comparison, has already cut checks to thousands of homeowners totaling more than $84 million. That program, while structured differently, is funded by the same federal dollars.
Several emails to the mayor's office, which is handling comment requests for the Build It Back programs, were not returned.
Applicants have been divvied up into three priority levels, determined by household income and a damage assessment.
According to the city, 50 percent of applicants are Priority 1, which includes homeowners with significant damage and an income lower than the city's median.
Thirty percent are Priority 2 and 20 percent are Priority 3, according to the city.
So far, the city has said it can only guarantee funds for those listed as Priority 1, and says it will only be able to help some applicants in Priority 2 and Priority 3. The exact timing for the assistance is unknown.
Carmen Coward, 42, a special education teacher from Canarsie, said she's been placed in Priority 2 — without much help in sight for her basement, where her son lives and which was gutted by flood waters.
She depleted her savings to fix her roof, despite $10,000 in FEMA aid, and make minor repairs to her home, she said.
After applying to Build It Back, inspectors came to take a look at the house on Dec. 14, but Coward has not heard from them since.
"What's the solution for a homeowner?" she said. "What did they do with all this money that was given to them? Who is benefiting from this, really?"
Joseph Courtney, 39, tore down his family's one-story bungalow in Neponsit in Rockaway last May after the storm's surge knocked it off its foundation.
He drained his savings and borrowed money from family to start working on the rebuilding process, and applied to Build It Back with the hopes of receiving some reimbursement.
His experience with the program has been problematic. He said it was disorganized and the hired "specialists" rarely had any information.
"Just give me an answer," the married father of four said.
He dealt with lost paperwork, rescheduled meetings and, as of last week, was told his priority had changed from a 1 to a 2 — which he was later told was a glitch in the computer system. He's now returned to a Priority 1, but without much information.
"If I never get anything from Build It Back, no problem. But if they're doling out money, I think that my family should be in the conversation," he said.
For residents in multi-family homes, the process hasn't been much easier.
Matthew Villetto, 31, who lives in The Beach House, a 43-unit oceanfront condo in Rockaway Beach, said his experience with the program has been chaotic.
“It's awful,” he said. “The program is underfunded, it's mismanaged.”
Villetto, a father of two and a senior project manager working at Douglas Elliman Real Estate, said the building had been placed as a Priority 2.
In an email sent by his caseworker, he was told “as of right now, I do not have a timeline on when we will begin funding priority 2 projects.”
His building experienced more than $1 million in damage after the boardwalk smashed into it during the storm.
“They have no timeline, no idea if or when we'll receive any funding,” he said.
Councilman Eric Ulrich hopes to discuss Build It Back at a City Council hearing in March.
"Clearly it's broken, it's not working the way it was initially intended," he said.
"But we have to move forward now, we have to make this work. And if it's not working, we have to find a way to make it work."
The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better six months after the launch event. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing just how consistently incompetent Google seems to be at keeping a reasonable inventory of phones available for purchase. But setting that aside, as one of the Pixel's most ardent evangelists, I think there's something it's probably time for me to come clean on: Even if you could buy a Pixel today, I really think you shouldn't.
The Pixel is a product with generation-one product issues. The Bluetooth performance is horrid. It's not waterproof. The bezels really are due for a shrink. I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a particularly high quality. The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news. And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers.
There are other flaws I could point to, and while none of them are too terrible, they do speak to the slightly-rushed development cycle this phone seems to have been subjected to. Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience. In fact, I think the Pixel is easily the best Android smartphone ever for these strengths, at least if we're talking about me personally as a user (your mileage, obviously, may vary). But for all the great, smooth, fast, clean, pure, simple, natural, and various other adjective-members singing in the Pixel-praise cavalcade, this phone is not the one to buy right now.
For starters, Google continues to ask what is an increasingly laughable amount of money for the model most of us want - the 128GB XL - at a staggering $870. Sure, Apple charges the same for an iPhone 7 Plus 128GB, but I'm under no illusion that this comparison in any way favors Google. The iPhone comes with Apple customer service (with actual stores), a longer software support period going forward, and runs no real risk of poor resale value. The Pixel? Google's online support is iffy at best, we know the phone will be unsupported by October 2018, and I have a strong feeling generation-one Pixel resale values will drop like a rock once the new phones are announced.
And that really is why, if you haven't pulled the trigger on a Pixel yet, you should just wait. It's overpriced, under-supported, and competing phones like the Galaxy S8 offer a whole lot more technology for your money. The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL, and I would argue it is far and away the better smartphone value. That amazing display, brand-new Snapdragon 835 processor, jaw-dropping design and packaging, and the full support of all our American carriers' latest LTE advancements could each be a reason on its own to put the Galaxy S8 above Google's smartphone. Do I still prefer using the Pixel over the S8? Sure. But I wouldn't buy a 128GB Pixel XL over a Galaxy S8+ today. That would be, frankly, a bit silly. If Google was asking $670 and not $870, the discussion would probably change, but they aren't. You've got to pay full price, and there's no way I could recommend anyone do that.
If you're still on the fence about the Pixel, let me try to push you over: wait for the next generation. I realize that this sort of thinking can devolve into a rationale that encourages you to never upgrade anything because something newer, faster, and better is constantly on the horizon. But in this case, I think it's a consideration that is worth weighing more seriously than usual.
Many of the Pixel's biggest flaws relate to Google's inexperience producing a smartphone. Issues that only come up as you try to mass-produce and distribute a product with a real marketing campaign that creates real demand, and the phone gets into the hands of "real" users who aren't part of the now-derailed Nexus phone hypetrain. Inside Google, expectations were no doubt managed, realities realized, and priorities accordingly re-calibrated after this first launch. (Side note: if the Bluetooth performance on the next Pixel is as bad as the first one, I may scream, Google.)
Meanwhile, the things that make the Pixel great aren't going anywhere. The next Pixel will be fast, it will take great photos, and it will offer a wonderfully unfettered Android experience. Those that make it less than great? Google is no doubt drilling down through the worst of them in order to ensure the Pixel 2 - or whatever it's called - won't make the same mistakes that the original did (waterproofing, please).
And one of the primary reasons to try the Pixel in the first place - to be on the very bleeding edge - really only remains true from a software standpoint. Older phones like the Nexus 5X and 6P don't even let the Pixel have an advantage there, as they're on the same update track until around the time the next Pixel phones launch.
If you absolutely need a smartphone soon and the Pixel is tempting you, ask yourself this: Can you deal with a Moto G5 Plus for six months if it means having a better Pixel down the road? While as a reviewer I have the admitted luxury of not needing to consider such things, were I in such a position, I'd have little in the way of a counterargument to offer. Sure, you'll take a resale hit on anything you buy now, but the Pixel is going to face a much, much steeper devaluation curve in that time than any budget phone.
Buying a Pixel right now just doesn't make sense. I love my Pixel XL, but I'm officially done recommending the phone to friends and relatives. Instead, I'll tell them to wait, or to get the Galaxy S8 they were probably going to buy anyway.

As it turns out, there's a way to turn 50 cents into $100 without going to Vegas and betting on the Browns to win the Super Bowl.
Bengals tight end Jermaine Gresham discloses via Twitter that a homeless man put 50 cents into a parking meter to help Gresham avoid what would have been a $55 parking ticket. (When you know the specific amount of the ticket, it means that you've had a few.)
Gresham says that he rewarded the man for his gesture.
S/O to the homeless man that paid 50 cents in the parking meter so we wouldn't get a 55$ ticket. Had to give that man a 100 for that. —
Jermaine Gresham (@JGresham84) July 07, 2012
And so now whenever Gresham goes to his car, he'll be swarmed by panhandlers who claim they saved him from a parking ticket.
It's actually a better strategy than holding the time-honored “will work for food” sign.

Reno Police continue to investigate a case in which five people were treated for minor injuries after being hit by a pickup driver during a confrontation in downtown Reno. It happened the evening of October 10, 2016, during a Columbus Day protest put on by the American Indian Movement of Northern Nevada (AIMNN).
Police say a group of about 40 protesters, with no protest permit, was standing in the crosswalk blocking traffic at the Reno arch. Some of the protesters were from the American Indian Movement of Northern Nevada. The driver of a pickup drove southbound on Virginia Street and stopped in front of the protest, at which point, police say, several of the protesters approached the truck. There was a confrontation between the occupants of the truck and the protesters that went on for about a minute. At some point during the confrontation with the protesters, the driver of the truck drove forward through the crowd before leaving the scene.
There are witness accounts, still being investigated, that the truck was seen multiple times in the area before the incident.
According to REMSA, one person was taken to a hospital with minor trauma injuries. Four other patients refused transportation to a hospital; two of those were the truck driver and passenger; two were protesters.
Reno Police say the driver of the pickup stopped several blocks away and called police to provide his account of the events. He and his passenger were interviewed and are cooperating with the ongoing investigation. No one has been charged and no names have been released.
According to Lorayn Walser, Secretary of AIMNN, the organization was having a peaceful protest downtown. It wants Columbus Day to be changed to Indigenous People's Day in Nevada.
The private planes have already been dispatched, the tours planned, the sales pitches made daily — even hourly — to Mike Babcock. The eventual coronation can't possibly be far away.
All of this is happening while Ken Hitchcock waits for a telephone call or meeting to learn of his coaching future.
“Amazing,” said a long-time NHL general manager, who didn't want his name involved. “You have one coach with one playoff series win in four years that everybody wants to hire, and one coach with exactly the same record, one playoff win in four years, that everybody wants to fire.”
Hitchcock has coached the St. Louis Blues for almost four seasons. He has won one Stanley Cup in his career, albeit not with the Blues. Babcock has won one, also — in Detroit. Hitchcock also lost a Stanley Cup in Dallas. Babcock lost two — one in Anaheim, one in Detroit.
Babcock has coached two gold-medal winning Olympic teams for Canada. Hitchcock was an associate on both of those teams, and was also part of Pat Quinn's gold medal-winning group in 2002. If coaches were given IOC gold medals, which they're not, Hitchcock would have three to Babcock's two.
The Blues have been something of a playoff disaster under Hitchcock — that is the why his job is on the line — winning only 10 of 27 post-season games in his time in St. Louis and getting eliminated three times in a row in the first round.
The much-coveted Babcock, who will be paid more money than any coach in NHL history when he signs his new deal, has coached 31 playoff games in the same period: His Red Wings have won 12 of them.
The not-necessarily coveted Hitchcock, whom sources indicate will likely return to the Blues once the playoff disappointment has quieted, has little bargaining power, unless he chooses to walk away.
Babcock hasn't chosen anything yet but to play the field. And what a field it is. The Red Wings have given him permission to do what's never really been done before. He is everybody's favourite right now. Line up and make an offer.
The Maple Leafs, without a general manager, have already taken a run at him. The Buffalo Sabres, soon to be home to Jack Eichel, have made their pitch. The Edmonton Oilers, having elevated Bob Nicholson, hired Peter Chiarelli as general manager and soon to be landing Connor McDavid, kicked tires on Babcock, but are heading in another direction. Philadelphia and New Jersey will soon get involved as the Babcock chase grows.
Meanwhile, the coach who grew up in Edmonton — Hitchcock — sits still, not certain of his next move, not even in the position as everybody's second choice. Todd McLellan, now of Team Canada, ex of the San Jose Sharks, former Babcock staffer, seems to be that guy. The list of next-best available coach behind him not named Hitchcock includes former Babcock assistant Paul MacLean, Peter DeBoer and Randy Carlyle, with AHL coach Jeff Blashill playing the role of this year's new hot guy. (See Jon Cooper or Dallas Eakins to indicate the difficulty of such a choice.)
There are six official coaching openings right now in the NHL and possibly as many as nine if Boston, St. Louis and Detroit don't retain their current coaches. But everything starts with Babcock and where he will end up. Then the game of musical chairs will follow: There are more openings than there are front-line coaches to fill them. It is clearly a seller's market, with a twist. How quickly will Babcock have a new job and how quickly does the market explode in hirings after that?
Assuming McLellan is heading to Edmonton — which is now being talked about — the intensity of the market grows that much more frantic.
And, still, the juxtaposition of Babcock and Hitchcock, old friends and old rivals, remains — two demanding, successful, smart coaches of similar records and varying ways, but dissimilar outward perception.
One is the flavour of the month. The other appears to be an acquired taste. The truth likely is somewhere in between.
Babcock is thought of as a winner. Hitchcock is thought of as a regular-season winner. The facts don't exactly back up those notions.
In three of his four seasons in St. Louis, Hitchcock's teams scored more goals, allowed fewer goals against, won more games than Babcock's Red Wings managed. In four years, Hitchcock's teams won 185 games — including playoffs — while Babcock's teams won 166 games.
So why, the general manager and others want to know, does everyone want a piece of Babcock while Hitchcock waits and wonders? Good question.
It's a case of perception being the reality here — with no real answer.

The United States officially confirmed its first Zika virus death on Friday. According to CDC reports, an elderly Puerto Rican man recently died of complications from a bout with Zika. While Puerto Rico is currently experiencing massive outbreaks of the virus, health officials state the man's death occurred as a result of severe internal bleeding stemming from Zika infection.
Earlier this year, a World Health Organization spokesperson declared that in 2016, 4 million cases of Zika virus could be expected in the Americas alone. Due to potentially crippling birth defects, this mosquito-borne illness is most dreaded among pregnant women.
[Photo by Ian Waldie/Getty Images] Though in adults, Zika's prevalent symptoms include fever, skin rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis, the consequences of Zika upon infants can be far more devastating. Infants born with Zika virus often suffer from microcephaly. This defective condition results in abnormally small head size and brain damage.
Other severe birth defects caused by microcephaly can include seizure, developmental milestone delay, intellectual disability, problems with movement and balance, difficulty swallowing, along with hearing and vision impairment.
While 707 cases of Zika virus have been reported in the United States territory, 90 of those are attributed to pregnant women. In light of the dangers associated with Zika virus, health officials staunchly stated a warning.
“Residents of and travelers to Puerto Rico should continue to employ mosquito bite avoidance behaviors, take precautions to reduce the risk for sexual transmission, and seek medical care for any acute illness with rash or fever. Clinicians who suspect Zika virus disease in patients who reside in or have recently returned from areas with ongoing Zika virus transmission should report cases to public health officials.”
Adding to the dangers faced in Puerto Rico, experts predict a staggering 2 billion people worldwide may eventually be affected by Zika virus. Consequently, it was also concluded that upwards of 5 million newborn babies are now at risk for microcephaly. Concerning the growing number of Zika miscarriages, Dr. Oluwatosin Goje, an Infectious Disease OB/GYN at the Cleveland Clinic, told CBS News the following.
“With infections in general during pregnancy, there's a risk of miscarriage. Other infections that can cause miscarriage include toxoplasmosis, rubella, and cytomegalovirus, and many times depending on how early the infection is contracted, some people may have a miscarriage. One of the things that researchers are studying is the suspicion that having contracted the Zika virus in the first trimester may be more detrimental compared to the second or third trimester, so that might explain the miscarriages in some people.”
Dr. Goje's comments came after two U.S. women had miscarried from Zika infection while traveling abroad. Unfortunately, Zika virus cases are on the rise in the continental United States as well. States most likely to incur a Zika outbreak include warmer-weathered southeastern areas, including Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida.
[Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images] While chances of contracting the Zika virus are highest during spring and summer, a few universal tips people can employ to greatly reduce becoming infected include applying insect repellent often, eliminating standing water, and wearing long sleeved shirts and turtlenecks when insect repellent is not available.

About six years ago, comedian Jesse Joyce — a man who, I can tell you from personal experience, could talk intelligently about politics, polish off six pints of ale at a fairly rapid clip, and continue making his articulate points as if he had simply downed a glass of cherry cola — decided that maybe this sort of drinking wasn't healthy, and gave it up.
Around the same time, another comedian with a tendency for overindulgence, veteran comic and former attorney Greg Giraldo, made a similar decision for himself. The pair shared a manager, and that manager suggested that the two comics work together, since they could theoretically help each other navigate this new road of sobriety.
The two became fast friends, and for the next five years, Joyce came to regard Giraldo as an older brother, becoming his opener on the road, and his writing partner on the Comedy Central roasts that would greatly increase Giraldo's public profile. The two would speak virtually every day, except on days when Giraldo was otherwise occupied. Because while Joyce remained sober, Giraldo did not.
“I was always disappointed after we'd have, like, a month where everything was great,” says Joyce. “I always knew, because he would cut off contact with me for a couple of days. We would talk every day, and then there'd be a period of a couple of days when he wouldn't get back to me, and I would just know. I'd have this little sinking feeling, and then it got less and less disappointing because it would happen so many times. Then it was just like, well, that's probably what's happening again.”
Sadly, Joyce says he was not surprised when Greg Giraldo died this past September, at the age of 44.
The much-beloved comedian left behind three sons, and such was the admiration for Giraldo that some of the top names in comedy — including Jerry Seinfeld, Lewis Black, Dave Attell, Colin Quinn, Jim Norton, Judy Gold, and Ted Alexandro — will gather at the Beacon Theater for a benefit for his boys on Wednesday, February 9.
The cause of Giraldo's death was an accidental overdose of prescription drugs after a gig at a comedy club in New Jersey called the Stress Factory, but Giraldo had been spiraling for years. While there's no way to know what goes on inside someone else's mind — possibly more so for addicts — when it comes to Greg Giraldo, Joyce, who'll also perform at the benefit, has his theories.
The word “brilliant” isn't thrown around the comedy scene too often, but it may have applied more than most to Giraldo. He was a Columbia and Harvard Law School graduate who waded into the world of law, but just couldn't make himself care about legal minutiae and corporate profits, taking refuge instead in the world of jokes, where his natural combination of brains and street smarts manifested in comedy that was, at times, an unusual blend of cerebral and populist.
In his 2009 CD and DVD, the now ironically-titled Midlife Vices, Giraldo touched on his two divorces and his drinking and drug use. In one routine about how the drinking age should be forty because that's when you really need to be drunk, he casually mentioned his alcoholism and how his life at the time was so much harder than it had been in his teens, and how now, he wanted to be fucked up all the time. But in addition to his personal candor, he examined the state of our world in hilarious fashion, including a remarkably nuanced and yet never hectoring segment on the folly of ethanol — into which he managed a firmly-in-context “pussy waxing” reference — and comedic treatises on the manipulation of race in the 2008 election, our nation's plunge into obesity, the importance of stem cell research, the loss of the U.S. manufacturing sector to China, and a dual rip on the pathetic trend of theme restaurant employees singing “Happy Birthday” to adults and the nonsensical aspects of certain anti-immigration arguments.
Comedian Jim Norton knew Giraldo for about fourteen years, including several where they worked together on Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn. Norton says that whether on that show or in the no-holds-barred behind-the-scenes world of Greenwich Village's Comedy Cellar, where comics who've known each other for years wait for their sets at the restaurant upstairs, joking and bantering and brutally ripping on each other in a sort of cruder, more feral Algonquin Round Table, Giraldo's intellectual superiority was always apparent.
“He was a very fierce opponent,” says Norton. “You would never realize that Greg was as hard-hitting as he was unless you fucked with him. He had a very, very fast mind, which meant he was very hard to argue with, because on top of being funny, his mind would adjust very quickly. We used to always talk politics at the Cellar, and in a political discussion he always knew what he was talking about. If you had a good point, he always had something just as smart or smarter to counter you with. He was a really brilliant guy.”
“Outside of being a comic, he was a genius as a person,” says Joyce. “He went to Columbia and Harvard at the top of his classes. That dude could explain to you the root cause of the Boer War for forty-five minutes. He just knew everything.”
What made Giraldo's comedy so hard-hitting and relatable, though, was not just his smarts, but a fearlessness that evolved over time, allowing him to confront head-on the worst of what he saw both in himself, and in the world around him.
“There are a lot of really smart guys that are afraid of offending,” says Norton, “and a lot of ballsy guys that are just dopes. But he had a brilliant comic mind, and he was completely unafraid on stage. That's what I loved about watching him. I knew that I was never gonna hear anything sold softly.”
“He was so confident on stage, such a master of words and so naturally funny, that he could take anything he wanted to talk about and make it funny even if you disagreed with his politics on it. At the end of the bit, it was flawless logic,” says Joyce. “You could disagree with the concept of gay marriage, but he would [talk about this] in Texas, or in the South. We'd work together in Georgia, and he would start the bit with some version of, ‘if you think gay people choose to be gay, you're an asshole.' He would confront people aggressively to say, what you believe is wrong. But by the end of the bit, not only would he get an applause break, but everybody would be like, ‘Huh. I see your point.” He could take anything he believed in, and make it funny to people who disagreed with him.”
But intelligence that pronounced can be its own burden, and Joyce believes it was this very gift that made Giraldo's struggle with addiction so perilous.
“My theory is, he was too smart for his own good,” he says. “Because he was so brilliant, he could outthink everything. He thought it was enough to know everything about a thing without actually living it.”
Joyce says that Giraldo knew the theories and practices of sobriety possibly better than anyone, but allowed himself to believe that with knowledge that great, he could forgo the actual practice.
“He could always out-argue his own mind, especially since he was a lawyer,” says Joyce. “He could easily come up with thirty reasons to stay sober tonight, or thirty reasons to get ripped drunk and ruin a bunch of things. He could talk himself into either.”
This gave the “older brother” aspect of their relationship a unique tilt, as in addition to learning great things from Giraldo about comedy and life, Joyce learned just as much about what not to do.
“I was on my way to getting married,” says Joyce, “and he gave the greatest advice of anybody I've ever met that he could never apply to himself. Now I'm married, but at the time she was my girlfriend, and we'd get into a fight on the phone. I'd go bitching to Greg about it, and he had this perfect insight, like, ‘she's doing that because of this, and here's what you gotta do,' and he'd be dead on. I'd be like, ‘you're totally right.' And then I'd go, ‘Wait a minute. Aren't you twice divorced? What the fuck do you know about it?' He had the most disastrous relationships, and he gave the greatest advice ever. That's the paradox that was so fascinating. He gave the greatest advice about women, and he just had a string of crazy relationships. And he could give great sobriety advice, yet couldn't stay sober.”
Once Giraldo became a hit on the Comedy Central roasts, the natural drive of an addict and Giraldo's rationalizations began to mix with the perils of fame. On the road, he not only found the party — and the alcohol and drugs that came with it — every time, but danger began to seek him out.
“I remember [when I was drinking], I would do this all the time,” says Joyce. “I would go, ‘man, there are a lot of drunks' wherever I was, Birmingham, AL or wherever. ‘There's a ton of drunks here.' And it was like, no. There are no more here than there were anywhere else. But I sought those people out. I kind of had this sign around my neck, and we gravitated toward each other. And that's what would happen to Greg. We'd go on the road, and some sketchy blow dealer with a nickname like R2-D2 would come to the show. And he would immediately come over, because he got the vibe that this was the guy to talk to. I feel like the business at large enabled him in that way.”
Joyce says that the two would seek out ways to stay busy in their mutual battle for sobriety, but that surrounded by constant temptation, Giraldo found it harder and harder to fight.
“People were just offering it all the time,” says Joyce. “The irony is that for those people, for the guy in Tulsa, OK, he goes out and drinks an entire bottle of Jack, but he does that once. Then, for the rest of the year, he goes, ‘I got super ripped with this comic who was in town!' For a lot of those people, that's like the strip club DJ's one experience doing blow with a celebrity. But for Greg, he'd find that guy in every town.”
In time, finding wild parties became something of a badge of honor for Giraldo as well.
“He structured so much around that persona that maybe he was afraid of, is anybody gonna think I'm cool and worth seeing if I'm not kind of a badass. That was the number one argument we would always have,” says Joyce. “We were very like-minded in this way. I really liked waking up in a hotel with a half-lit cigarette in my mouth in the morning, drinking a bottle of Jack. I like that lifestyle. I'm that guy. But it was killing me, and I found a way to kind of trick myself in sobriety, by [thinking], I used to be that guy, and that's actually more badass. I did all that. I wear it like a badge of courage that I ruined a lot of shit and drunk-drove across four states in a blackout, but I'm very proud of the fact that that's who I used to be. So I would always say to Greg, ‘why can't you rest on that? Why can't you be thrilled that you used to get blasted with Pantera in the woods?' We went to some party in a mansion in the side of a mountain way out somewhere in Arizona, where it was all strippers and Ketamine, just craziness, and it was like, why can't you be excited that you have those stories? Why do you need to keep making more? Because the number of awesome stories you have is, these days, really being outweighed by the number of shitty stories you have. Because that's what always ends up happening. You have these rose-colored glasses about how great it is, but it gets less and less great, and you have to drink and do more and more substances to try to recreate the good times on the road.”
For people in the comedy world as well as many of Giraldo's fans, his struggles were no secret, and his openness about it is part of what made him great as a comic.
But this knowledge of Giraldo's struggles also meant that those around him lived with a sad sense of helplessness, watching a friend spiral downward while powerless to prevent it.
“We knew he had his troubles and that he was struggling with certain things, and it was kinda hard to watch,” says Norton. “In the last three years or so, it became more and more apparent that he was struggling. I would say to him, ‘hey man, did you relapse?' We would talk about sobriety, and when he wanted to talk to me about it I felt he would. But I didn't know at any given moment if he was just sad in general, or using. I just knew that he was hurting.”
“What's so insidious about addiction,” says Joyce, “is that it tricks you — and everyone around you — into thinking that this is the way it is for now, but that it's gonna get better. Because we would have these periods of time where it was all fine and great, and I would get lulled into the idea that maybe this time it'll stick. For me, I know I always have that option. I can always go out and get drunk tomorrow if I want and see where that takes me, get back on that elevator and ride it down a few more floors, but my life has improved enough for me to know that that was the problem. I don't think Greg ever gave it enough time. He would get inklings of it. He'd start getting up earlier in the morning and read the paper. He would do proactive, productive things, and be on time for flights and stuff. And he'd go, ‘yeah, this is great.' But I don't think he ever gave it enough time to really reap the benefits of sobriety.”
It would be wonderful if there was some lesson to be taken from the loss of Greg Giraldo — don't do drugs, kids — but the realities of addiction are far too complex. So instead of a lesson, we have a legacy: his material, and the enjoyment we got — and still can get — from watching Greg Giraldo do the one thing it seems that he was put on this planet to do: be really fucking funny.
Trying to figure out anything else is just folly.
“[Greg's death was] simultaneously the most and least surprising thing I've ever experienced,” says Joyce. “I knew it was gonna happen. I just didn't know it was gonna be that weekend. That's what surprised me. Like, really? At the fucking Stress Factory? He and I had done the Stress Factory a dozen times. I remember vividly the last time we were there, like, I [would have] wanted to turn to him in the car and said, ‘that's it. That's where you're going out in a blaze of glory. The Stress Factory.' The point being, given the rock star lifestyle, how underwhelming that wound up being. If he told me that he was going on tour with Korn or something like that, and they were gonna be traveling around Amsterdam, that, to me, would have been like, ‘oh, OK. That's probably where he'll die.' But that's the reality of addiction. It happens on a Tuesday.”

Former All Blacks winger Jonah Lomu has said he needs a new kidney transplant and has lost 30kg since September.
Lomu, who scored 37 tries in 63 Tests for New Zealand between 1994 and 2002, had a first organ transplant in 2004 but the kidney stopped functioning in October 2011.
For me, the important thing is to ask 'can you look in the mirror and say you've done everything to enjoy life?' Jonah Lomu
The 36-year-old has recently been having dialysis for 21 hours each week.
"Nothing has made any difference - the next step is to try to find a donor," he told New Zealand Woman's Weekly.
"I know I was fortunate to get the first transplant but there are more difficulties this time around.
"The match will be harder and the process of finding a suitable donor is difficult. The chances of my body rejecting this kidney are higher too.
"I'm really lucky - I've already lived more in one lifetime than many would in six or seven lifetimes. The thing about being human is that everybody has to die sometime.
"For me, the important thing is to ask 'can you look in the mirror and say you done everything to enjoy life?"'
Lomu was diagnosed with the kidney disorder nephrotic syndrome in 1995.
The new movie Big Hero 6 represents the first-ever partnership between Marvel and Disney, two entities known for constructing fantastical universes. So it's not surprising that bringing the story to film also required building an entire city of the future: a blend of Tokyo and San Francisco named San Fransokyo.
When encouraged to develop a Disney film that drew from Marvel's universe (which Disney purchased in 2009) directors Don Hall and Chris Williams dove deep into the Marvel archives, selecting an obscure comic—"Perhaps the most obscure Marvel comic," quips Hall—about 14-year-old robotics whiz Hiro Himada and his puffy sidekick, a compassionate caregiving robot named Baymax.
The original comic took place in Tokyo, but to make it their own, Hall and Williams decided to set the story in a brand new yet familiar city, melding the original locale with a near-future San Francisco. "It's a very high-tech city that blends Eastern and Western culture, so we wanted it to be a mashup, just like the movie is a mashup between Disney and Marvel," says Hall.

The resulting animated metropolis—which truly is its own character in the film, although people say that a lot—is a celebration of futuristic urban life and the high-tech culture that drives its residents. And it's brought to life thanks to several new animation technologies developed in-house by Disney itself.
A two metropolis mashup

Geographically, San Fransokyo is San Francisco. In fact, it's pretty much an exact representation: The animators used detailed property data from the city's Assessor-Recorder's office—available thanks to the city's progressive open data program—to get detailed information about the city's 83,000 buildings and the nearly exact number and location of elements like streetlights and street trees. "We don't claim you can find your house" says Big Hero 6's technical supervisor Hank Driskill. "But if you go to where your house is, you'll find the right building of the right size."
The visual effects team recreated 23 separate districts, each of which has its own hybridized Pacific Rim architectural style. Even though the overall result immediately registers as San Francisco, the specific details in the streetscape are less recognizable. Almost all the signage is in Japanese (and there's a lot of advertising). Even the Golden Gate Bridge has its own Tokyo twist.

The filmmakers took some dramatic license with the city's geography, of course. The famously steep hills are twice as high, for example, turning the streets into rollercoaster-esque cable car routes. And the skyscrapers are twice as tall, too. Many neighborhoods still incorporate the city's iconic Victorians, but the Financial District, for example, is far more Shibuya than San Francisco.
In previous Disney films, the city in the background would likely have been a matte painting, the details purposely vague and predetermined by storyboarding. Here, the level of accuracy in this digital model allows a completely new way for the directors to pick their shots and center the action. What Disney's dubbed "digital scouting" gives the filmmakers an almost completely generated universe to use for camera capture. "You're not just building the set that you need, you can put the camera anywhere and something would be there," says Williams.
The effect is dramatic, and unlike anything you've seen in an animated film before. In one key scene for the film, Hiro and Baymax are flying over the highly stylized city, zooming over the Bay and weaving between the sparkling skyscrapers. You can see satellite dishes on rooftops, and clearly read the posters plastered to the side of buildings. Look closely: The filmmakers say there are more Easter eggs in this film than any other Disney movie.

Lighting and populating the city
Every animation project for Disney is city-building, essentially, says Disney Animation Studios CTO Andy Hendrickson. "Our job is to build a compelling world that you want to live in that supports that story." But Big Hero 6 required a whole different level of complexity: There are more objects in the film than in the last three Disney animated films, combined. "How do you go about handling that level of geometry? How do you light it?"

Disney employed brand-new technologies to solve these issues: Hyperion, which would help them naturally illuminate the urban landscape and accentuate the detailed angles of the structures they'd built; and Denizen, a character-generating system that populated the city with hundreds of thousands of realistic residents.
Accurate lighting is a challenge for any animated feature, but especially when creating a city, where light reflects off billions of shiny surfaces in any given shot. Hyperion is a new rendering technique that uses global illumination to reorganize these rays and bundle them in a way that allows the light to bounce around more naturally. It algorithmically imbues every shot with real-world lighting, which can then be tweaked by the filmmakers in a composite system.

It also required Disney to build new supercomputers just to manage the renders that Hyperion was generating, jobs that would sometimes take weeks. So Disney built a brand-new render farm that could handle up to a million renders a night—a system so big that it had to be geographically located in four different places, with three farms in LA and one in San Francisco.
The next task was populating San Fransokyo. "Early on, when we started talking about the movie, it wasn't just that we wanted to make a city, we wanted it to feel like an urban environment," says Driskill. When Disney had worked to create cities before, as in the movie Bolt, filmmakers were limited in their ability to create the hundreds of people needed for a busy street scene. "We crafted the New York City scenes to try to aim cameras just so to create the illusion that it was New York City, but we couldn't really reproduce New York City," he says.

Using Denizen, which was created by character rigging supervisor John Kahwaty, the team could rapidly generate a wide variety of characters who fit the style of the film (including avatars of all the crew). The filmmakers created 750,000 people total, about the actual population of San Francisco. Just in the opening shot alone, there are 6,000 crowd characters—each of them completely unique.

Creating a San Francisco-Tokyo mashup also allowed the filmmakers to blend the cultures of two likeminded cities which are serving as incubators for real-world technological solutions, like the film's caregiving robot. "San Francisco is the home of Silicon Valley, it's the hub of technology, and Tokyo is like that, too," says Hall. From a scene at a university science fair that could have been filmed on the Google campus, to the fact that the main characters all have 3D printers in their home studios, Big Hero 6 shines a light on these cities of makers and hackers.
In fact, it was very important to Hall and Wiliams that all the technology featured in the film was real—or at least rooted in reality. The filmmakers toured robotics labs at MIT and Carnegie Mellon looking for specific projects that might be entering the consumer world in five to ten years. "It has to be grounded in a believable world, and that led to all the cool technology that the team in the movie has," says Hall. In this way, it might be the first Disney movie built around science, not, say, magic. "The movie does celebrate science and technology in a way that we really haven't done before."
Yet the futuristic tech couldn't outshine the film's star: The inflatable Baymax still had to be the most amazing technological advancement found in San Fransokyo. "The big question for us was how should people react to him?" says Williams. "He was amazing enough that people would be mouth agape, drop what they're holding. But it's a society that's a little more advanced than ours in the sense that seeing a robot walking down the street isn't quite as far-fetched as it would be in our world."

Deciding on that benchmark for technology in San Fransokyo's society also drove specific urban planning decisions. There are no flying cars here; instead, there are new elevated freeways filled with vehicles (which are not autonomous yet; traffic is apparently still a problem). The cable cars are still there, although there are many more of them, in a variety of styles, and also a kind of elevated BART that laces through the downtown. Yet in one of the most beautiful and aspirational tech details for the city, colorful airborne wind turbines spin high above the towers, generating clean energy for the residents below. "To me, that's a very hopeful technology," says Hall.
We so rarely get to see a San Francisco of the future (maybe the new Star Trek is a good example?), and this peek of a pan-Pacific mashup is probably the most accurate depiction of the way the city is already evolving. Like the film Her helped envision a denser Los Angeles, Big Hero 6 celebrates San Francisco's high-tech culture while nudging it gently towards one possible future for a taller, faster, flashier city. From my seat in the theater, it was a pretty beautiful vision.

Obama rejects Keystone XL pipeline The long-awaited decision is a huge loss for the oil industry, the Canadian government and Republicans in Congress.
President Barack Obama rejected a permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline on Friday, handing a major victory to green activists in the defining environmental controversy of his tenure, arguing that approving the project would undercut the United States' status as a leader in fighting climate change.
The pipeline “would not make a meaningful contribution to our economy,” Obama said, dismissing claims that the pipeline would boost job creation. If Congress is serious about creating jobs, lawmakers should pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan “that in the short term could create more than 30 times as many jobs per year as the pipeline would,” Obama said.

Obama also said Keystone would not lower gas prices for American consumers, since the average price of gas has fallen about 77 cents over a year ago, or ensure future energy supplies.
"Shipping dirtier crude oil into our country would not increase America's energy security,'' Obama said. "What has increased America's energy security is our strategy over the past several years to reduce our reliance on dirty fossil fuels from unstable parts of the world.”
“America is now a global leader when it comes to taking serious action to fight climate change,” Obama said. “And frankly, approving this project would have undercut that global leadership.”
The long-awaited decision is a huge loss for the oil industry, the Canadian government and Republicans in Congress, although GOP lawmakers have vowed to continue trying to force approval of Keystone using must-pass legislation. Obama acted just days after his administration rejected developer TransCanada's request for a pause in its review of the project, a move that could have pushed the decision into the next presidency.
In a statement, newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government was disappointed by the rejection, though he played down the dispute that had soured the cross-border relationship under his predecessor, Stephen Harper.
“The Canada-U.S. relationship is much bigger than any one project and I look forward to a fresh start with President Obama to strengthen our remarkable ties in a spirit of friendship and co-operation," he said.
Obama's decision promises to put new pressure on Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton . Her long-delayed declaration just two months ago that she too opposes the $8 billion, 1,179-mile project has inspired her more left-leaning primary opponents to accuse her of flip-flopping.
The Republican presidential candidates quickly pounced on Obama's announcement. Sen. Marco Rubio denounced it at a “huge mistake,” while former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush described it as a ”self-inflicted attack on the U.S. economy and jobs." Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal accused Obama of “bowing to radical environmentalists and snubbing thousands of high quality, high paying energy sector jobs,” and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said the president “has lost his mind.”
Whether Keystone remains a political albatross on Capitol Hill depends partly on factors outside Obama's control, including the historic plunge in global oil prices that has diminished the U.S. oil industry's appetite for Canadian crude. The seven-plus years it has taken for the administration to weigh the fate of the project succeeded in shunting the pipeline's day of reckoning past a series of political landmines, including Obama's reelection, last fall's midterms and last month's electoral defeat of Canada's Harper.
Still, the verdict from Obama puts to rest years of tea-leaf-reading and dropped hints about the president's leanings on the Canada-to-Texas pipeline. It arrived nine months after Obama vetoed a GOP-backed bill that would have approved the pipeline by congressional fiat, and followed repeated comments in which he scoffed at supporters' predictions that the pipeline would be a major job-creator.
Even the timing of the administration's verdict remained a mystery this summer and fall as the State Department became consumed by a historic nuclear pact with Iran. That deal's sensitivity suggested to Keystone's friends and foes alike that Obama would wait to decide on the pipeline until later in the year, when Clinton's White House run would be in full swing.
Both sides in the prolonged pipeline battle have vowed to press their case in court if they fell short, but the legal jockeying over the Keystone decision may prove short-lived. The 2004 executive order that gives the White House ultimate sway over cross-border energy projects like Keystone allows Obama significant discretion to determine whether any project is in the “national interest,” a test that includes the pipeline's economic and geopolitical ramifications as well as environmental effects.
Yet it is Keystone's climate impact that propelled the once-obscure pipeline to international prominence as environmental activists turned the Canadian oil sands into an emblem of “dirty” energy unfit for a president determined to craft a global deal on global warming this December.
The nuances of Keystone's climate symbolism have put every Democrat involved into a political bind at one point or another — from Obama to Kerry to Clinton to billionaire donor Tom Steyer, who opposes the pipeline but has sometimes steered money to Democratic candidates who refused to take a stand.
Steyer praised Obama's move, telling POLITICO that he thought "the president, always, in his heart was here."
And Bill McKibben, the 350.org co-founder who led climate activists' fight against the pipeline, said the Keystone rejection gives Obama "new stature as an environmental leader."
Greens are "well aware that the next president could undo all this, but this is a day of celebration," he added in a statement.
Republicans face their own conundrum in the wake of the decision: how to keep using Keystone as a pressure point against a president whom they have long accused of exaggerating his support for oil and natural gas — and, by extension, against Clinton's bid to succeed him. Now that Obama is set to kill the pipeline, the GOP must decide whether to return Keystone to a central role in Republican energy messaging or spend its political capital on other high-stakes debates, such as offshore drilling or fossil-fuel exports.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested that the GOP could again take up the pro-Keystone XL banner in the wake of Obama's rejection of the pipeline.
"Given this project's importance to North American energy independence, the question still remains not if when Keystone will be built," McConnell said in a statement.
The administration's rejection is likely to inspire at least some Republicans to reinvigorate their legislative push to force the pipeline through anyway, but few in the party have any appetite to revert to previous internal debates over tying Keystone to government funding or an increase in the debt limit. And last month's bipartisan budget deal took those weapons off the table anyway.
At the height of Republicans' frustration over the delays, they often noted that the pipeline's federal review had lasted longer than American involvement in World War II. Advocacy and influence spending by both sides of the Keystone debate reached into tens of millions of dollars even before Obama made Congress' latest Keystone bill the subject of only the third veto of his presidency.
Pipeline supporter Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.) harkened back to the measure that defeat earlier this year, and he called on "four more of our colleagues in the Senate to join the 63 that already support the Keystone so that we can override the president's veto and approve the project congressionally."
Keystone also generated a steady stream of dramatic gestures from environmentalists seeking to win public attention for their seemingly long-shot cause, including last year's horseback-mounted protest on the National Mall and the 2011 White House sit-ins that launched the anti-pipeline campaign with more than 1,000 arrests. The industry's advocacy for the pipeline has been no less fervent despite its more straitlaced style. During the peak of Keystone battling in 2012, groups from the Quakers to tractor manufacturers to pro-pipeline labor unions were spending to push Washington on the pipeline.
And Friday's decision may yet do little to cool that fire. If Republicans renew their campaign to make Keystone a reality despite Obama's denial, oil and gas interests are poised to lend their firepower to the effort.
“Obama has put extreme ideology over American opportunity,” American Petroleum Institute President Jack Gerard said. “We're going to continue to raise our voices on this extreme position that was solely based on politics and not sound science.”
North America's Building Trades Unions President Sean McGarvey echoed that sentiment, saying there is “disappointment … frustration [and] confusion” over the rejection. “We just do not quite understand why it took seven years to come to this decision,” he said.
Similar pressure from the left preceded Clinton's rejection of Keystone this fall, following years of pressure from industry and activists, with the stakes particularly high among liberal voters attracted to longtime Keystone opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). After taking heat for telling reporters that she would not "second-guess" Obama, Clinton's campaign openly acknowledged that the decision-making process on the pipeline had taken so long that she felt compelled to speak out.
Keystone is "a distraction from important work we have to do on climate change," Clinton said during a September campaign stop in Iowa. All of her prospective GOP rivals support the pipeline, setting the stage for a fresh argument over the pipeline's economic impact as November 2016 approaches.
For now, however, lawmakers, aides, lobbyists and activists who have worked in Keystone's shadow for more than seven years are also taking the time to mark the conclusion of a debate that at times felt never-ending.

KB Home ex-CEO Bruce Karatz accused of stock option fraud
A federal grand jury indictment alleges that Karatz, who resigned under fire in 2006, orchestrated the backdating of options to his own benefit.
"We are disappointed that during this economic collapse the government chooses to waste its resources on backdated options, an issue that has long ago been fixed at KB Home and generally in the corporate world," attorney John Keker said in a prepared statement.
Karatz's lawyer said his client did nothing wrong and was being unfairly prosecuted.
"This investigation painted a picture of avarice and dishonesty at its core," said Salvador Hernandez, who heads the FBI office in Los Angeles.
Karatz, 63, served as chairman and chief executive of Westwood-based KB Home from 1986 to 2006, when he resigned under fire. Over a three-year period ending in 2005, Karatz garnered more than $232 million in compensation.
Bruce Karatz, who rode the housing boom to become one of the highest-paid executives in the country, was indicted by a federal grand jury Thursday on charges of manipulating stock options -- becoming one of the few executives to face criminal charges in the nation's options backdating scandal.
Karatz, who has already been forced to pay $20 million to the company and the federal government in connection with the case, faces up to 415 years in prison if convicted on all 20 counts of the indictment, which includes charges of fraud and making false statements.
The indictment said Karatz orchestrated the backdating of stock options from 1999 to 2006. Stock options typically are granted to employees with an exercise price tied to the date of the grant. Companies can legally backdate stock options to a date when the stock price was lower -- insuring an immediate paper gain -- but they must account for it properly, pay taxes accordingly and report the backdating to shareholders.
In the KB Home case, the backdating was not disclosed until nearly a decade after it began. The company was forced to adjust its financial statements by $70 million when the backdating of options held by Karatz and other shareholders was finally disclosed in 2008.
In Karatz's case, the backdating made his stock options worth $1.63 to $4.56 more per share, according to the indictment -- a fact that should have been disclosed to other shareholders, it said.
The indictment does not say exactly how much Karatz gained as a result, but KB Home required Karatz to pay back $13 million in backdating gains when he left the company in 2006. And the SEC agreed to a settlement of $7.2 million with Karatz in 2008 to cover what it reckoned were his gains.
Karatz has long been a target of shareholder activists and labor unions, who accused him of taking more than his fair share of company profit. In 2005, the year before he stepped down, Karatz had take-home pay of $6.3 million, but he received an additional $150 million, mostly from exercising stock options.
"For the whole backdating scandal, he was one of the biggest poster CEOs," said Patrick McGurn, a special counsel for New York-based Risk Metrics Group who specializes in executive compensation. "He had to hand back more of his gains than almost anyone else."
The indictment accuses Karatz of concealing the practice from KB's board of directors and compensation committee as well as from shareholders.
It alleges that when KB undertook an internal investigation into the stock-option grants in May 2006, Karatz falsely denied his orchestration of the backdating scheme and caused a false report of KB's options practices to be submitted to the company's auditors, resulting in improper disclosures in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The SEC and other agencies have investigated more than 250 companies for backdating improprieties since 2005, and there have been some large settlements. In December 2007, United Healthcare CEO William W. McGuire agreed to pay $458 million to settle a civil case with the SEC over backdating.
EDITORIAL: Jeddah floods a reminder of why we need the anti-corruption drive
It has happened again. The roads, streets and many underpasses in Jeddah were flooded with rainwater on Tuesday. Many areas were turned into lakes because of the heavy, though forecast, downpour. In some areas, water was knee-deep while in others it was chest-deep. People were stuck in their vehicles and many were seen pushing their vehicles to the side of the roads with great difficulty. In low-lying areas, citizens struggled to remove their belongings from flooded houses.For the residents of Jeddah, rain has, more often than not, brought trouble and devastation. Whenever the skies open up, thoughts go back to that “Black Wednesday” of November 25, 2009, when more than 100 people lost their lives and property worth billions of riyals was destroyed. An investigation was opened into the disaster and some of the guilty were taken to court and tried; some of the small fry were even jailed. As has been the case in the past, the mighty arm of the law could barely touch those at the top who enjoyed immunity from prosecution.And so it was business as usual until the rain began to wreak havoc again, reminding us that the laws of nature take their course and that hiding your head in the sand does not chase the clouds away.Having said that, it must be admitted that, yes, lessons were learned. A disaster management team was set up. The weather forecast department became active in issuing alerts. In fact, Tuesday could have been far worse had it not been for the timely alert from the Presidency of Meteorology and Environment (PME) and a prompt decision by the Ministry of Education to suspend classes, schools and universities in and around Jeddah. That helped in keeping people and vehicles off the streets. At noon on Tuesday, it looked as if the city were under some kind of curfew.The questions that are on everyone's minds right now are: Why is it that rain renders the city helpless and immobile at this time every year? Why have efforts to create effective rainwater drainage systems not borne fruit despite pumping billions of riyals into new projects such as dams and canals? Why is it that the authorities are found wanting whenever heavy rain occurs? More importantly, what is the solution?Here is the answer. These floods are a stark reminder of why the current drive against corruption is so essential. It is required in order to instill the fear of law into high-ranking officials and heads of construction companies and civic bodies who have failed in their responsibilities. Those who have cut corners and have pocketed public money, those who have not delivered on the projects and who have provided substandard services must pay for their sins of omission.This is exactly what is happening. No one is above the law. The guilty, whoever they are, however high up they are, will have to pay — and they are. In this new era of transparency and accountability — initiated by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman — word has gone down from top to bottom that no one is immune. If you are guilty you will be punished. Those responsible for the havoc of the floods on Tuesday will have no rest either.

(CBS/AP) LONDON - Missing girl Madeleine McCann, who vanished while on a family vacation in Portugal five years ago may be alive, UK police said Wednesday.
London's Metropolitan Police said they are still investigating the disappearance of the girl, who vanished shortly before her fourth birthday in May 2007 from a condo at a resort while her parents ate at a restaurant nearby.
UK police have released a new image of the girl created in cooperation with the family that shows how Madeleine might look at age 9. .
Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood said he is leading a team of more than 30 police officers who are focusing on the case.
Portugal police closed their investigation in 2008, but Scotland Yard says it wants the case reopened. An investigative review formed in May 2011, and has been going through case details.
In a rare press conference on the case, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood said he is leading a team of 37 police officers reviewing some 40,000 pieces of evidence gathered so far. The team has identified some 195 possible leads to be followed up on, he said.
He acknowledged that police have to consider that McCann may be dead despite hopes that she is alive.
"Our drive on both scenarios is of equal measure," he said, choosing his words carefully. Authorities said the investigation is split equally -- one team assuming that Madeleine is dead, the other that she is alive.
"We would like the case to be reopened; our case is clear," Redwood told reporters Wednesday. "I should stress quite clearly that the decision is in Portugal."
He said forensic evidence of the sequence of events around her disappearance shows that there are moments when she could have been snatched by criminals.
There has been no reliable indication of what might have happened to the girl despite numerous reported sightings from around the world. Last year, a report of a girl bearing a resemblance to the child created a social media frenzy.
Her disappearance has drawn global media attention, partly because her parents were at one point questioned as suspects by the Portuguese police. They were later cleared of any part in the disappearance.
Kate and Gerry McCann have since headed a campaign to keep the case in the public eye, publishing a book and appearing on the "Oprah Winfrey Show" to tell their story.
UK police said the investigation has cost 2 million pounds ($3.2 million) so far.

The firm said from 1 March some of its services, such as Google Docs, would not work “properly” with the browser. It recommended individuals and firms upgrade “as soon as possible”.
Included below is an e-mail that was forwarded to us as part of this news submission by user chrisfriberg.
Dear Google Apps admin,â€‹ In order to continue to improve our products and deliver more sophisticated features and performance, we are harnessing some of the latest improvements in web browser technology. This includes faster JavaScript processing and new standards like HTML5. As a result, over the course of 2010, we will be phasing out support for Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 as well as other older browsers that are not supported by their own manufacturers. We plan to begin phasing out support of these older browsers on the Google Docs suite and the Google Sites editor on March 1, 2010. After that point, certain functionality within these applications may have higher latency and may not work correctly in these older browsers. Later in 2010, we will start to phase out support for these browsers for Google Mail and Google Calendar. Google Apps will continue to support Internet Explorer 7.0 and above, Firefox 3.0 and above, Google Chrome 4.0 and above, and Safari 3.0 and above. Starting next week, users on these older browsers will see a message in Google Docs and the Google Sites editor explaining this change and asking them to upgrade their browser. We will also alert you again closer to March 1 to remind you of this change. In 2009, the Google Apps team delivered more than 100 improvements to enhance your product experience.

I think it was safe to say that the attack on Google, woke Google up to the threat of IE on their own systems and they must have done (or are in the process of) an internal review of it's use. I had not expected them to react publicly so quickly though.
I think this is a good thing. Increasing internal complaints from corporate desktop users should increase the pressure on backwards and incompetent companies to update.
Of course, they'll want users to upgrade to a browser like Chrome, and it'll be interesting to see come March and onwards if browser trends see a noticeable uptick, just like Mozilla saw when the German and French governments recommended to users to not use IE6.
Of course, moving users on is good for their security, but will this move developers on too? That remains to be seen.
× Hunter spotted missing family 2 days after van got stuck on remote logging road
NEAR SHELTON, Wash. — Authorities say a hunter spotted a family walking down a remote road two days after their van broke down leaving them stranded.
According to the Grays Harbor County Sheriff's Office, the family — Jason McAlister, 33, and Melissa McAlister, 27, and their two youngest girls, Lauren and Nadie — was found safe Thursday morning near Matlock.
Deputies say the family left their Montesano home Tuesday morning to go sightseeing. As they were driving down a logging road in Mason County they noticed a tree down and stopped. As they tried to drive around it, their van got stuck.
The family had enough water and shelter to get through the night. On Wednesday, they started to walk out but became turned around and decided to return to the van for another night.
The father spoke to Q13 News reporter Adam Mertz late Thursday morning:
Deputies say on Wednesday morning, they decided to try to seek help again. As they were walking down the road, a hunter spotted the family, called 911, picked them up and took them to a store in Matlock.
Medics checked out the couple and their two young children, 8 months and 2 years old, and said they were in good health.
The family said their spirits were lifted because they heard coverage about the search on the radio.
The hunter said he was aware of media reports of the missing family and knew exactly who the McAlisters were when he saw them.
The family was expected to return home on Tuesday in time to pick up their two other children, ages 5 and 7. When nobody picked them up from a nearby school bus stop on Tuesday, loved ones called police to report the rest of the family missing.
Sheriff's deputies in both Mason and Grays Harbor counties had been scouring logging roads since Tuesday night looking for the family.
Advertisement Hamilton Co. receives former military APC free for SWAT team Surplus carrier provided by government program Share Shares Copy Link Copy
A big new tool has been added to the storage shed of the Hamilton County SWAT team.A 48,000-pound armored vehicle arrived Tuesday afternoon to virtually no fanfare but high interest on the part of law enforcement commanders.Watch this story | View photos of the new carrierIt is capable of withstanding improvised explosive devices and small-arms fire.The vehicle was used in Iraq and Afghanistan in recent years to move soldiers from one point to another in the war theater.It will be utilized in Hamilton County in a variety of ways, but moving SWAT officers into position will undoubtedly be much safer as a result of its addition to the safety fleet."If this never comes out, I'm OK with that," Forest Park Police Chief Phil Cannon said. "But we've got it if we need it."Need is a trigger word for intense national debate lately about the militarized aspects of police departments.In the roiling aftermath of rioting in Ferguson, Missouri, the push to grant police access to unused military vehicles and equipment has been called into question nationwide.Cannon, who heads the Hamilton County Police Association, was concerned about the image presented by the new addition.But after five months of paperwork and process, he's glad the delivery was made.The vehicle arrived by way of Fort Bliss, Texas."We just felt that it was something that we needed to continue on with," Cannon said.The vehicle is officially called a Caiman MRAP, which stands for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected.It is capable of seating 10 and will be stored at the Sheriff Department's Road Patrol facility.Scenarios for use include active-shooter situations, armed barricade standoffs, civil unrest and any instance that the Special Weapons and Tactics team deems necessary."It's coming out for a reason," Cannon emphasized. "It's coming out for the safety of those in those neighborhoods it's coming through. It's coming out because somebody has called us for help."It would also be used for weather emergencies and/or natural disasters.In fact, along with the SWAT logo, it will be branded a rescue vehicle.The current transport vehicles SWAT uses were surplus bank armored cars. The ballistic protection they have is rated for up to .38 caliber ammunition.So the additional protection could be vital in an instance where SWAT officers might be vulnerable on the perimeter of a school shooting or hostage situation. The vehicle could be backed right up to a door, permitting trained personnel to enter with minimal risk or making it much safer to carry out evacuations.The Hamilton County Police Association requested the vehicle after learning it was available at zero cost.HG Logistics handled the cost of transporting the vehicle from Texas to Hamilton County.Several other similar vehicles were provided to other police agencies around Ohio.That's likely to be fodder for critics of a program that allows government excess property to be given to departments.But Sheriff Jim Neil counters that people cannot totally separate law enforcement from the military.Neil just returned from Redstone Arsenal Base in Huntsville, Alabama, where he was recertified by the Army as a civilian bomb technician.He believes it's important for people to understand that law enforcement is paramilitary, with generally the same rank structure.First thing the police association is going to do is paint the tan-colored vehicle Army green.
McCain wants to keep US troops in permanent bases in Iraq for 'hundreds of years'. He concedes that an Iraqi insurgency will likely continue for 'go on for years and years and years', possibly 10,000 years.

“They used to call it ‘Man of the Year,' but they can't do that anymore — they want to be politically correct. That's OK," he said.
The magazine had called the award the “Man of the Year” since it launched in 1927. It changed to “Person of the Year” in 1999.
Last year, German Chancellor Angela Merkel became only the fourth woman to hold the title and cover alone, according to the magazine.
"To be on the cover of Time magazine as the 'Person of the Year' is a tremendous honor," Trump told NBC's "Today Show."
The president-elect had previously predicted he would never win the title.
After a days-long manhunt, police on Tuesday arrested Rahmael Sal Holt on charges of killing New Kensington Police Officer Brian Shaw during a traffic stop Friday.
Holt, 29, was arrested in the Hazelwood section of Pittsburgh early Tuesday morning along with several members of his family accused of hindering his apprehension.

Squidward doesn't wear pants because his penis is on his face. Let's face it, everything that we thought about our childhood cartoons being innocent, clean fun is out the window.
These animators didn't know it, but eventually, we'd all grow up to understand exactly what we were staring at on those TVs.
Whether we were watching an after-school episode of "SpongeBob SquarePants" or a commercial for an episode of "Care Bears," all of these shows had some kind of inappropriate hidden agenda.
Thanks to the Internet, we can all go back and recap exactly how absurd some of these cartoons actually were. Would you want your little sister, brother or child watching these kinds of things?
After all, "a child's brain is like a sponge," right? Check out the photos below, you won't believe your eyes.
Why couldn't Nickelodeon just show Angelica actually brushing her teeth?
Why did a giant fish have to squirt on the "Magic School Bus"?
Is it appropriate to make Jerry swim up Tom's butt?
Seriously? You animators aren't even trying to be discreet here.
Miley Cyrus isn't to blame for the existence of twerking. Our childhood cartoons are.
How was this type of stuff even allowed to be on TV?
Let's just say that whenever the Angry Beavers decided to "wrestle" each other, they didn't "wrestle" at all.
She was positioned way too low to be kissing his mouth.
How do you ruin "Tom & Jerry"? Like this:
Everything was perverted back in the 90s. This is just proof.
Yeah, let's just expose kids to masturbating cartoons. That seems like a great idea.
Here's how you ruin "Toy Story" for everyone:
When innocent cartoons weren't being sexualized, they were being racist:
SpongeBob SquarePants blew up condoms to form Squidward and you didn't even realize it. Shocked?
Technically, Rocko was a sex worker.
This is self-explanatory. Thanks Cinderella!
The Powerpuff Girls figured out the male species before anyone did.
Wow. Just wow.
Eh, Helga was always a bit weird. Are you surprised?
Explain this though, Donald!
That awkward moment when you realize Timon and Pumbaa were narrating a sex scene.
If you didn't realize the Teletubbies were PBS' version of softcore porn, you were incredibly oblivious.
That time Buzz Lightyear got a boner without getting a boner.
Oh, "Harry Potter," how innocent... Wait, these are awkwardly placed footsteps. What were they really doing?!
Before you knew what "accidents" were...
Nick At Nite, where the teachers' names are sexual innuendos.
Louis Pickles used to watch fantasy porn. There, I said it.
Here's Donald Duck getting pummeled.
What's the giant puddle of white stuff, Daffy?
Those aren't wings.
Wow, the Care Bears must really care about each other.
I bet you didn't even notice that was a crane.
There you have it. Childhood ruined.
Is Germany a Currency Manipulator?
Peter Navarro, the head of the Trump administration's newly created National Trade Council, touched off a controversy on January 31 by telling the Financial Times that Germany is using a “grossly undervalued” euro to “exploit” the United States and its European Union partners. At one level, Mr. Navarro merely repeated a position laid out in greater detail in his September 2016 commentary on the Trump economic plan. Furthermore, his central economic assertion—that “while the euro freely floats in international currency markets, this system deflates the German currency from where it would be if the German Deutschmark were still in existence”—is uncontroversial. If Germany were to leave the euro area, German exports would become more expensive and German imports cheaper, reducing the German current account surplus—although the surplus also derives from deep structural reasons, including demographics.
But Mr. Navarro's comments are worrisome because of two other assertions in his September 2016 piece, both of which seem to underpin the thinking behind his criticism of Germany. First, that freely floating currencies would eliminate trade imbalances—and by extension, that trade imbalances are a manifestation of “currency manipulation.” Second, that Germany's euro membership, as a policy choice that keeps Germany's exchange rate undervalued, is an act of currency manipulation. Both these assertions are incorrect.
Freely floating currencies are consistent with large, persistent deviations from trade and current account balance. The reason is that freely floating exchange rates are shaped not only by demand for and supply of currency associated with trade but also with the demand for currency associated with investment flows. The recent behavior of the US dollar, which floats freely vis-à-vis the euro, is a case in point. Following President Trump's election, the euro depreciated by about 6 cents (it fell from $1.10 per euro to $1.04 per euro, before recovering slightly) because of fiscal expansion and corporate tax cuts expected from the Trump administration. This strengthening of the dollar will further increase the German bilateral current account balance vis-à-vis the United States. In this sense, the economic policies expected from President Trump have, over the last few months, done more to raise German competitiveness than any action of the European Central Bank (ECB) or the German government.
Germany chose to adopt the euro more than 20 years ago. Its motive was not to enhance German competitiveness but to strengthen European economic and political integration. Like all other euro members, Germany entered the currency union at the—unmanipulated—market exchange rates prevailing at the time. In fact, the initial consequence of euro membership was not to make Germany more competitive. Quite the reverse: Because of north-south capital flows and faster productivity growth in the poorer euro member countries, Germany quickly became overvalued within the euro area, triggering a recession in 2003. The euro's undervaluation today is largely a consequence of the euro crisis. So the assertion that German euro membership constitutes currency manipulation is baseless for two reasons: Euro membership did not reflect any decision, on behalf of the German government, to steer its exchange rate in any particular direction. Nor is Germany's competitiveness a structural feature of euro membership. Euro membership merely implies that the real exchange rate—Germany's price level relative to others, expressed in a common currency—takes longer to adjust to shocks and crises than would be the case in a floating system.
The new administration's economic policies toward Europe are not yet clear. As in many other areas, however, the administration has doubled down on a statement that many observers would have put into the category of pre-election hyperbole. As a result, the chances that the US Treasury will label Germany a currency manipulator have increased. But as my colleague Fred Bergsten pointed out in a recent podcast, labeling any country that way does not compel the administration to take any specific measures.
If the diagnosis is that euro membership constitutes currency manipulation, will the administration call for Germany's exit from the euro? Such an exit would disrupt Europe economically and politically, and wreak havoc on the world economy. Any export gains that the United States might expect from a stronger German currency would be more than offset by the collapse of purchasing power in Europe. Or will Washington impose a tariff specifically on Germany? Doing so would be even more reckless. Not only would it be illegal under World Trade Organization rules but also the European Union would almost surely close ranks and retaliate. The result would be a major trade war.
There is, conceivably, a more hopeful outcome. The United States has complained about the German current account surplus for years, and so has the European Commission. The result of these complaints has been a set of policy recommendations directed at Germany: raising public investment, especially in infrastructure and education at the municipal level; increasing competition in business services; increasing incentives for later retirement; and reducing disincentives to work for second earners. Most of these policies make sense. They would reduce the current account surplus and stimulate growth in Germany and the euro area. Yet, the German government has refused to implement them, partly because of the Ministry of Finance's obsession with balanced budgets, and partly because these reforms are politically difficult, even—and especially—in Germany. If the Trump administration were to throw its political and economic weight behind these reforms, it would be good for Germany, Europe, and the United States.
Jeromin Zettelmeyer, senior fellow at PIIE, is a former director-general for economic policy at the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy.
So it's been a strange day on Capitol Hill, as the power went out at a congressional hearing for the new CIA director just as the lead Democrat was criticizing Russia, while C-SPAN's TV feed got mysteriously replaced by the Russian propaganda network, RT, this afternoon.
First, the Senate confirmation hearing for Trump's nominee to head the CIA. The power went out conveniently when the top Democrat on the panel, Sen. Mark Warner, was about to speak.
Adding to the mystery, Warner was talking about Russia's hacking of our election when the power went out, just as he was about to say the word “Russia.” (I am not making this up.) Here is what Warner was going to Russia — right before “Russia,” boom no lights:
“Chairman Burr and I have committed to conduct a review of the intelligence supporting the intelligence community's assessment that Russia, at the direction of President Vladimir Putin, sought to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election in order to undermine public faith in our democratic process,” Mr. Warner was saying.
They had to move the hearing to another room.
Then, on the House side, C-SPAN got mysteriously replaced for ten minutes by the feed from Russian government propaganda network RT (aka Russia Today).
Again, I'm not making this up.
Here's the moment Russia Today took over the C-SPAN1 feed. Unclear what happened. RT aired for about ten minutes before C-SPAN1 came back. pic.twitter.com/mhWVgCoFxF — Timothy Burke (@bubbaprog) January 12, 2017
That's one heck of a coincidence, both “glitches” have to deal with Russia.
C-SPAN just put out a statement saying they're hoping this was simply some crossed wires on their end, but while RT is claiming C-Span has exonerated them, it most certainly has not. C-Span simply offered a possible explanation, even though they haven't yet figured out what happened.
Here's C-SPAN's statement:
And here are the Russians lying about C-SPAN's statement:
The mysterious Russia-related happenings on the Hill happened not one day after Donald Trump loudly complained about a bombshell memo accusing the Russians of having gathered compromising information about the incoming American president, and accusing his staff of secretly collaborating with the Russians during the campaign.
As I said, that's one heck of a coincidence.
With the election of Donald Trump, AMERICAblog's independent journalism and activism is more needed than ever.

As seen on TV, the Sea Shepherd Society is once again readying their boat in order to thwart the efforts of Japanese whalers
[social_buttons]
Just earlier this week the Japanese whaling ship called the Nisshin Maru left port to begin hunting and slaughtering an expected 1,000 whales. Luckily enough, the Sea Shepherd Society has the whales' backs…er, fins? It's an annual confrontation between the society and the whalers, one that I'm enormously grateful for!
It's been estimated that last year the tactics of the Sea Shepherd saved around half of the whales targeted by the Japenese fleet, approximating in a $70-million dollar loss. It wasn't easy Watson says, as he was shot during one of the forays. “I was wearing a bullet-proof vest, ” he told an Australian newspaper, “but the bullet hit my badge (an anti-poaching badge) so I had this bullet and I jokingly gave it to the guy who played Grissom in CSI (actor William Petersen) – he's one of our supporters – and said ‘Hey, take a look at this because no one else will.'
I admit, I've been blessed with the opportunity to interact with whales off the coast of Baja. That's me petting one in the picture above. I'm far from religious but the experience is like that of seeing God. It's beautiful and utterly unreal. If only the Japanese were Mexican.
Let me give a shout out to my motley crew of whale watchers. We're a gang of engineers, a Brit, a Sea World veterinarian, and some Asian guy – none of us really know what John does. We're just a movie star short of being a Gilligan's Island spin off. It's the perfect blend.
But make no mistake, it's not my interaction with these creatures that fuels my interest in their plight. I find them majestic, yes, but the actions of the Japanese are inexcusable and just plain lame. Luckily, I believe in karma and that there is a special version of Hell just for whalers.
In the meantime, we have Daryl Hannah. Yup, Daryl Hannah — actress, activist, and part-time mermaid — is joining the Sea Shepherd crew this time around, headed by Captain Paul Watson. The crew itself is made up of over 40 volunteers and a Animal Planet film crew. Animal Planet will document the adventures for their hit television series Whale Wars.
The boat — the Steve Irwin — leaves port from Australia on December 1st. Wish them luck.

Real Vanilla Isn't Plain. It Depends On (Dare We Say It) Terroir
Banish the phrase "plain vanilla" from your lexicon.
Why? Because vanilla is one of the most complex spices around, boasting at least 250 different flavor and aroma compounds, only one of which is vanillin, the stuff that can be made artificially in a lab (and is used in a lot of processed foods).
And as we discovered in a round-the-world tasting tour of single-origin vanilla beans — the real stuff — the plant has evolved distinctions in flavor and, dare we say it, terroir, at each stage of its turbulent, globetrotting history.
You've likely heard of Madagascar Bourbon vanilla. It's the classic, deep, rich "real" vanilla the world has come to know and love. It helps that Madagascar is the world's biggest producer of vanilla bean, harvesting 1,000 to 1,500 tons per year.
But what about Tahitian vanilla, with its strong notes of cherry, or spicy, nutmeg-y Mexican vanilla? They're pretty amazing, too, thanks to those countries' own rich soils, curing techniques and vanilla-friendly climates.

To compare them, we drafted our colleague Marc Silver, who's always up for a taste test, into service.
The three of us selected beans sold by Nielsen-Massey, an Illinois company that's one of the largest suppliers of pure vanilla in the world, from Tahiti, Mexico and Madagascar, and made three vanilla ice creams with them. We used the same simple recipe and the same ice cream makers to turn out almost identical-looking snowy mounds speckled with black. And then we set them up side by side for an unscientific tasting at NPR headquarters.
In an experiment like this, you're not likely to get much in the way of criticism. Because who doesn't like vanilla ice cream?
But several tasters preferred the exotic cherry and floral — even "smoky marshmallow" — notes in the Tahitian vanilla ice cream. A few sided with the tried-and-true Madagascar, and a couple went for the more subtle, woodsy Mexican variety.
Increasingly, says Craig Nielsen, CEO of Nielsen-Massey, consumers are learning to appreciate these differences, much like coffee. "That's why we label our products by source so that people are aware of what area of the world the product is coming from, the different flavor profiles and how they can be used." (The Nielsen-Massey website offers recipes for inspiration: tropical fruit flan with Tahitian vanilla, and whipped cream with Mexican vanilla, for example.)
Nielsen says he tends to go for Madagascar, if forced to choose. "To me, it's a great, all-purpose vanilla," he says. "I use it in anything," including tomato sauce, salmon marinades and chili. "It's a great enhancer of other flavors, and can bring out sweetness without sugar."
Vanilla is one of the most labor-intensive crops in the world, but humans find it so intoxicating, we have come to rely on it for everything from ice cream to meat to air fresheners.
"If cacao was the food of the gods, vanilla was definitely the nectar that accompanied it," writes Patricia Rain, a cultural anthropologist, in her book Vanilla: The Cultural History of the World's Favorite Flavor and Fragrance.

The "pure, natural" vanilla spice is really the seeds from dried pods of an orchid whose flowers bloom and die within a day. The vanilla vine originated in the wild jungles of ancient Mexico, growing upward and wrapping itself around stronger plants. It was revered by the Aztecs, but once European explorers had a taste, they realized it had great potential as a commercial spice, and eventually smuggled it to the Bourbon islands around Madagascar for domestication.
Then it took a wild side trip through the Philippines, where it was crossbred with another subspecies in the early 1800s. From there, it landed in Tahiti, where it was further crossbred and became a different species altogether (Vanilla tahitensis Moore), according to Rain. It's since moved into production in Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and India, says Nielsen, who also buys from those countries.
Orchids are fussy plants that typically do not self-pollinate. And there are only a couple of pollinators that do a good job, which means wild-pollinated vanilla in Mexico was a hit-or-miss proposition.
After much human trial and error in cultivation, vanilla plants are now hand-pollinated, to ensure the kinds of quantities the world demands. In Mexico, the plants are watched over by boys with rocks who shoo pesky chachalaca birds away who would otherwise eat their way through the precious flowers, Rain says.
Then there's the labor-intensive process of cooking, sweating, drying and curing the bean pods. They must be transformed from looking like oversized green beans into the dark brown, wrinkly, oily and shrunken pods with a powerful fragrance. In Mexico, they cure in adobe ovens, while in Madagascar and Tahiti, they cure in the sun, for a few hours a day, for up to six months.
In fact, the progression from pollination to processed bean takes about a year and a half, Rain notes.

Presidential nominees Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have agreed to participate in a live primetime forum to discuss Commander-in-Chief issues issues on September 7, simulcast by NBC and MSNBC, but hosted by Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.
This is not a debate; the candidates will appear back to back during the one-hour event. They will take questions on national security, military affairs and veterans issues, from NBC News and an audience comprised mainly of military veterans and active service members.
IAVA founder and CEO Paul Rieckhoff said that on the “cusp” of the 9/11 attacks, New York was the fitting stage for this event, which he said would “give voice to American veterans and service members that are all too often shut out of our political debate” which is somewhat surprising, given that veterans have been a big topic of conversation this election cycle.
Three basics people all around the world have in their kitchens.
Three staples always in stock in groceries and supermarkets for any home cook looking to rustle up a family meal, pancakes or a quick, nutritious drink.
But in Venezuela, you can get these products only if you're lucky or have the connections and the cash. A lot of cash.
There's hardly ever fresh milk on the shelves. The same for powdered milk, which can sell on the black market for 100 times its official price. We found milk being sold for 7,000 bolivares -- more than $700 at the official currency exchange rate, though if you have U.S. dollars you can exchange them on the black market at vastly more favorable rates, perhaps getting 1,000 bolivares to the dollar.
It's the same story for the maize flour that's the key constituent of arepas, traditional unleavened Venezuelan bread that is stuffed with any number of fillings. If it's ever available in a government supermarket it should cost 190 bolivares for a 1 kg (2.2-pound) bag, and not too much more at a privately run grocery. But on the black market, it can be about 15 times as expensive.
Supplies are so limited that CNN recently found a 1 kg bag of dried pasta selling for an astronomical 200 times its official price in Caracas.
Getting the food on the black market is illegal and can be dangerous. And it is just too expensive for so many people in Venezuela. Just buying these three staples -- one bag each of flour, pasta and milk powder -- could swallow up almost an entire month's pay for those on minimum wage, about 15,000 to 20,000 bolivares.
And that's why, of course, so many people have no option but to go to the public supermarket for their subsidized food. There are stringent rules. They wait for the day of the week when it is specified that they may shop according to their identity card, they try to work out which store may have what they need, then stand in line for hours upon hours, and still they may come out with next to nothing.
"I've been waiting in line since 3 a.m. and have only managed to get two tubes of toothpaste, so, I guess I'm going to have to eat toothpaste tonight," said Monica Savaleta, a 19-year-old dancer.
For her, going to the black market sellers known pejoratively as "bachaqueros" or profiteers, is not feasible. "I make between 12,000 and 15,000 bolivares a month. If I buy from the bachaqueros, my whole salary is blown on three kilos of rice."
Wilfredo Cardona, 25, makes considerably more as a construction worker -- about 40,000 bolivares a month. But often that doesn't help. "I came to buy flour, rice and sugar and haven't been able to find anything," he said. "All I find is soap and I can't eat soap."
"Best case scenario, I can get a kilo of chicken, a kilo of meat and one bag of rice and one of corn flour on my salary. That's it."
It's the same for Wilmer Gomez, a janitor who is 48. He goes from store to store, neighborhood to neighborhood looking to eke out his 24,000 bolivares monthly salary.
"I stand in line waiting for the regulated products and by the time my number is up there is nothing left."
"I've been looking for food all day today. This morning I found four bottles of oil in one place, bar of soap in another and laundry detergent in another. Hoping to find some corn flour now."
Watch John Legend Croon Gordon Ramsay's Most Vicious Insults Such sweet music from such foul words
Gordon Ramsay fatigue is a very real thing. If you've watched his TV programs with any frequency over the last 15 years, there's a good chance that you might be getting bored with his whole hot-headed kitchen tyrant schtick. Perhaps sensing that his act was getting stale, the chef has recently started poking fun at himself on TV and social media, and the results are awesome.
Back in January, Ramsay made the brilliant decision to start critiquing photos from amateur cooks on Twitter. In February, the chef participated in a swear jar challenge on The Tonight Show, as well as a hilarious Cool Ranch Dorito mystery ingredient taste-off. And last Friday, Gordon capped off his hosting stint on UK series The Nightly Show with a delightful sketch wherein John Legend croons Ramsay's greatest insults, including “How the fuck did you burn ice cream?” and “You put so much oil in this, the U.S. wanted to invade the fucking plate.” Ramsay himself joins Legend at the end, to back him up on a musical rendition of the chef's eternal classic, “Why did the chicken cross the road? ‘Cause you didn't fucking cook it.”
Ramsay jumped into the world of viral entertainment a few months after an old clip of the chef shouting for “lamb sauce” on Hell's Kitchen became an internet obsession. Gordon had nothing to do with that original dank meme, but its popularity might have inspired the chef's recent decision to embrace his viral potential.

I know what it was that set me off today. A random article, out of the blue, I shouldn't even have read it. It referred to great food cooked with rendered fat as “early-grave food heaven.” Why do people say stupid things like this?
Because the media bombards us with the simplistic message that Fat Is Bad For You, and it pisses me off.
Why? Because it's not true. Fat is good for you. Fat is good for your body. I've said it before and I'll say it again. Fat doesn't make you fat, EATING TOO MUCH MAKES YOU FAT! Eating every morsel of your mile high Cheesecake Factory plate is what makes you fat. Eating a whole bag of Doritos is what makes you fat. Eating when you're not hungry makes you fat!
To argue that fat is bad for you is akin to arguing that homemade chocolate chip cookies or apple pie is bad for you. Is ice cream bad for you? Of course not. Putting away a couple of pints of Rocky Road every night, that probably is. Obviously too much ice cream and too much fat is bad for you. If all you ate was lettuce, lettuce would be bad for you.
When was last time you heard a nutritionist warning you about the dangers of lettuce? Well, I'm here to make you wise. If lettuce is the only thing you eat, you will get sick, you're going to have serious health issues. It can lead to dangerous malnutrition, grave weight loss, and in women, infertility.
Fat is dangerous only insofar as it's good, because it's so much more fun to eat than lettuce and we want to eat lots and lots of it. Yes, it's calorie dense and yes, for some people, eating a lot of fat can raise their blood cholesterol—not me apparently, thank you mom and dad, grandpa and grandma—which is linked to some serious stuff, heart attacks and strokes.
But good health is not about being fat-free! It's about BALANCE! Lots of vegetables, plenty of exercise, moderate consumption of meat, dairy and grains, cooked—and this is really really important—cooked by you or by someone you know, preferably where you or they live.
Please, let's stop repeating the thoughtless mantra that fat is bad. Because fat is good. And don't get me started on the fat-free labels processed food companies put on their packages that imply, everywhere we look, the falsehood that fat is bad.
You see food in the grocery store labeled fat-free? My advice is gone in the opposite direction. Because they've either done something to it to make up for the fat, like putting sugars in “fat-free” half-and-half, or it's a product that is naturally fat-free, like Kraft granola bars—there's not supposed to be fat in them (it's the sugar overload that's bad)! Which means the company is pulling one over on you. Don't let them.
Fat isn't bad, stupid is bad.
Think for yourself. Use your common sense.
God this shit drives me crazy.
That does it, next up: Fried chicken. That's right. DEEP FRIED CHICKEN! Who wants to talk about DEEP-FRIED CHICKEN?!

The team over at Terrafugia, the company developing the Transition Roadable Aircraft (aka the Flying Car) has been given permission to gain some extra pounds. The company has been working hard to overcome the persistent issue of how to build a safe enough car, that can still be light enough to compete with the other aircraft in its class. But the ambitious design still came in too heavy to qualify as a Light Sport Aircraft.
The Federal Aviation Administration provided a little help to the company by issuing a maximum takeoff weight exemption specifically for the new design. Now Terrafugia can add some automotive safety features such as airbags, crumple zones and a safety cage, and still qualify as a Light Sport Aircraft. The LSA designation is important because it opens the market up to a wider swath of potential customers thanks the simplified requirements needed to receive an LSA pilot's license.
Terrafugia says the exemption will allow them to be in compliance with the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, something most of its LSA competitors don't have to worry about. The FAA has granted the company an extra 110 pounds to the LSA limit of 1,320 pounds maximum takeoff weight. Terrafugia says this will allow the extra safety equipment and a still allow the airplane to compete with other LSA aircraft in terms of range and the amount of payload it can carry.
The company successfully completed flight and drive testing of the proof of concept version of its roadable aircraft last year. The innovative design has foldable wings that allow the owner to drive to the airport, and in less than a minute, convert the car into an airplane. Flying cars are nothing new, but the Transition is easily the most practical version of the idea so far. The company claims the airplane will cruise at a speed of 115 miles per hour and a range of more than 450 miles. On the road, the two place, front-wheel drive vehicle achieves a respectable 30 miles per gallon.
Terrafugia says it will unveil the design of the production version of the Transition in Oshkosh in late July. It still hopes to deliver the first customer versions in late 2011.

MOSCOW — Russia's state nuclear energy corporation is expected to switch off a nuclear reactor on Sunday in a closed city in Siberia. The reactor has been producing weapons-grade plutonium for four decades, a senior American nonproliferation official said Saturday.
The reactor, ADE-4, is one of two in the city of Seversk that have been extraneous remnants of the Soviet Union's nuclear weapons program since the cold war. For 15 years, they produced plutonium that the Kremlin neither needed nor wanted.
Opened in secret in the 1960s to feed the arms race, the reactors have continued to operate because of their peculiar construction as defense-industry suppliers.
The Defense Ministry stopped purchasing plutonium in 1993, rendering the reactors' primary purpose obsolete. But the reactors could not be closed, and plutonium was still produced, because the reactors were also a primary source of heat and power to the bitterly cold regions along the Tomsk River, where no equivalent utility sources had been built.

Russian energy officials said switching off the bomb-fuel reactors, which are powered by uranium and produce plutonium as a byproduct, would have meant cutting off a large fraction of the utilities for the cities of Seversk and Tomsk. The cities have a combined population of about 600,000.
A veteran ESPN announcer sued the sports network Monday for firing him during the Australian Open over accusations that he had used an ethnic slur against tennis superstar Venus Williams.
Doug Adler, who began working for ESPN in 2008 covering the world's biggest tennis matches, came under fire for a comment on Jan. 18 when he said Williams used “the guerrilla effect.” The comment went viral because it was pushed along by the New York Times on Twitter labeling it as the “appalling” term “gorilla,” which “ignited the flames of anger and hatred” against Adler, the lawsuit said.
Adler was fired two days later.
He claims he was using a well-known term to describe aggressive play yet ESPN has destroyed his career.
“By the way ESPN chose to handle this non-issue, they effectively branded me, my character and my reputation for the rest of my life,” Adler told FoxNews.com.
Adler “has lost future opportunities in the sporting and business worlds because no one will hire a ‘racist,'” the lawsuit said. “He has suffered serious emotional distress and harm because he has been falsely accused of being the worst thing imaginable, and something he clearly isn't and never has been, all over the use of the word ‘guerilla,' a word that is commonly used in tennis.”
In addition to wrongful termination, Adler is also claiming intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress and economic hardship. The suit also names ESPN Senior Vice President Mark Gross and Vice President Jamie Reynolds. It seeks unspecified damages.
Williams' publicist did not respond to requests for comment. ESPN spokesperson Dave Nagle said, “We have not been served and we are declining further comment.”
Adler claims that ESPN and its executives knew that he used the word “guerilla” and not “gorilla,” but fired him anyway. He had finished work without a word from his managers following the incident and returned the next day.
“I was eating in the lounge area when the boss showed up out of the blue,” Adler said. “He was bowing to pressure because it was all over twitter.”
Adler was told to apologize on air and he complied. But instead of resuming his broadcasting, he was pulled from the show and fired the next day. He was “told he was done working tennis at ESPN,” the complaint said.
Apparently the world “guerilla” has been used for decades in the tennis world. The complaint mentions “Guerilla Tennis,” the name of a famous 1995 Nike television ad campaign featuring superstars Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras setting up an impromptu tennis match in the middle of a busy city intersection. The ad ran during the US Open and was profiled again in a 2015 Vanity Fair article after the tennis stars reunited for a similar rematch in the streets of New York.
The term is also used as the name of a Twitter account called Guerilla Tennis started in 2014 by a tennis enthusiast.
“The irony is that Adler called everything correctly and in a professional manner, whereas ESPN did not – they recklessly made the wrong call,” said Adler's attorney, David Ring, in a statement. “It was not only political correctness gone overboard, but also a cowardly move that ruined a good man's career.”
Generation Zero or, as I've come to fondly call them, the Murder Kids, have been a team that has had an on and off focus in the Valiant Universe since they debuted in “Harbinger Wars”. Between “Death of a Renegade” and “Armor Hunters” they have been stepping more and more out of the shadows. Now, they are finally ready to take center stage in their own ongoing series. We spoke with series writer, Fred Van Lente, about what is to come for these teen soldiers and the weirdness in the world they'll encounter.
In addition, after the interview, scroll down for an exclusive first look at the series' first three pages of line art from series artist Francis Portela.
“Generation Zero” has been a group in Valiant I've been waiting to see get a book. But for those not in the know & curious: What is Generation Zero and –more importantly- what is Generation Zero to you?
Fred Van Lente: Generation Zero is a mysterious group of human weapons raised by a military contractor. Upon reaching their teenage years, they escaped captivity and are now roaming the countryside helping fellow teens out of their problems, mostly with explosions and attitude. They are teenage delinquent superheroes without adult supervision, or scruples.
As you discussed at the Valiant Summit, the book is taking place in a town called Rook, Michigan. What can you tell us about this location and its impact going forward?
FVL: Rook is a town in Michigan that is sort of modeled after a place like Flint, which after struggling for some time, had then been taken over by an emergency manager from the state. Miraculously, it turned into a high-tech hub overnight. A young girl named Keisha Sherman wants to know why, particularly because it seems to have resulted in the death of her beloved boyfriend. So she's brought in Generation Zero to solve the case, but their methods are … shall we say … unpredictable?
Generation Zero has always been a large group, but you're going to be more focused. What can you tell us about the members you're focusing on and how you see them?
FVL: I'm introducing a lot of new characters along with Rook, so that necessitated me pairing down the Gen Zero roster a bit. You still have the group's driven leader, Cronus, and his no-nonsense lieutenant, Telic. Animalia, who considers herself the Wolverine of the group even though her power is transforming into adorable cartoon animals, remains a fan favorite. Cloud, a kind of dreamy telepath, is their communications specialist — she rounds out the core group. The creepy Zygos Twins are still with us, knowing more than anyone really has a right to about everything.
But the new member, Gamete the Super Fetus, will be the breakout character find of 2016, I think. She is a psychic fetus. She's not inclined to leave her sadly brain-dead mother, whom she controls with her mind. Gamete's mom is the token adult in the group.
For me, ever since Generation Zero was introduced in “Harbinger Wars”, there has always been an underlying thread talking about abuse and PTSD since these kids were so manipulated by Project Rising Spirit. How would you say such treatment will impact the story going forward?
FVL: What you'll see in this book is that. Kind of like the hyper-militarization of the police force in America, these kids are hyper-militarized super-powered teens who want to apply a military solution to everything. Which you know, isn't always the way to go, and it results in big smoking craters. Keisha, who brought them in, may be the one to help them see that maybe blowing things up and killing lots of people shouldn't, you know, be the go-to situation 100% of the time.
It is no secret that representation on the page has become more important than it has ever been. This is especially true in light of the harrowing events in Orlando. Young adulthood has always been a time of discovering who your true self is, especially in the LGBQT+ community. Basically, my question is, how much do you take this into consideration when crafting the story?
Continued below
FVL: A lot. I think that what makes the teenage experience unique is that you're on the precipice of leaving your parents' home and making your own way in the world, and you may not have a fully formed self yet with which do that yet. It's kind of like jumping out an airplane and realizing you forgot the chute. That's where a lot of fear and excitement, and the drama of the high school experience, comes from. That's kind of part of the meaning of the subtitle of the first arc, WE ARE THE FUTURE. All time, the future is both simultaneously rushing right at us and over us before we know it. It's that kind of insanity of hyper-reality I'm really looking for in this book.
You're joining forces with a long-time cohort, Francis Portela on art duties (him having just come off the recent “Faith” mini-series) with Andrew Dalhouse on coloring. How has the collaboration process work been between you three in creating some of the tech and weirdness we'll see in Rook?
FVL: I'm so excited to work with Francis, paired with Andrew, to create a whole new world for this book, which he's doing with such talent and gusto. It's really quite amazing, as I hope you'll see in the art with this interview. I really hope this book catapults him to super-star status: It's what he deserves.
“Generation Zero” seems to be a very different book from “Archer & Armstrong” and “Ivar, Timewalker” and even “Legends of the Geomancer”. What is the kind of tone you set out for as you write?
FVL: Archie meets The Authority. That's my tagline, and I'm stickin' too it!
Any other teasers you may want to give out for our readers?
FVL: Beware the Cornermen. Hang blankets over any ninety-degree angles in your room. You'll see what I mean when you read the issue…
“Generation Zero” #1 will be on sale August 24th.

Dismissed by right-wing commentators as a communist relic early in the campaign, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is staging something of a comeback and winning support in a country still struggling with austerity.
Corbyn's left-wing message appeared to be resonating among some of the residents of Basildon, a middle-class town near London that voted 68.6 percent in favour of Brexit in last year's referendum.
“I think he comes up with good plans,” said 22-year-old unemployed Christopher McDonagh, near to where Corbyn was speaking at a leisure centre on a campaign stop before next week's election.
“They need to help people. There are a lot of homeless, kids on drugs… I trust Corbyn to do that more,” said McDonagh, whose social welfare payments have been capped by the ruling Conservatives.
Labour was lagging behind the Conservatives by a double-digit margin at the start of the campaign.
But that has narrowed in recent polls to just a few points, although the Conservatives are still ahead.
Dan Kattal said he had voted for leaving the European Union but voiced support for Corbyn, who had campaigned for a vote to stay in the bloc.
“I think that he's quite honest. At the end of the day, honesty is the best policy,” he said.
Kattal said the issue of Brexit was not important for the election campaign in Basildon: “To be honest, it's all about distribution of wealth, if there's distribution of wealth everybody is happy”.
– ‘Need to think about people' –
Sarah Dowling, a 57-year-old teacher, said she would be voting Labour despite reservations about Corbyn.
“I still can't quite see him as prime minister. I am still going to vote for him, because in my heart I vote Labour, as my parents did before and my grandparents,” she said.
Of Prime Minister Theresa May she added: “I don't really trust her, I don't like her manners”.
“Basildon used to be a Labour stronghold but it seems to have gone the other way… I hope that we can go back to a Labour MP in Basildon,” she said.
Basildon, a town of 180,000 people in the county of Essex, is held by Conservative MP John Baron who won it from Labour in 2010.
Since 1974, it has always voted for the party that ended up winning the national election.
At the Corbyn event, the Labour leader said he was ready to begin the Brexit negotiations if his party won the election.
He said Labour would be seeking a deal with the EU that would “transform Britain into a country with the strongest rights and protections”.
“We will confirm to the other member states that Britain is leaving the European Union. That issue is not in doubt,” he said.
But he also said that Labour would reject May's option of leaving the European Union even if there was no deal in place.
“No deal is in fact a bad deal. It is the worst of all deals,” he said.
Betty Jeffrey, a 77-year-old disabled pensioner at the Corbyn event said: “We can't just think about Brexit. It's going to happen.
“We still need to think about people. Honestly, things are going from bad to worse,” she said.
Emergency Pet Rescue Window Decals
Please purchase a 4″x4″ “Rescue Our Pets Please” window cling decal to support our animal rescue of the month! 50 percent of your purchase goes to help animals. You can purchase below via Paypal for $6 each, including s&h. THANK YOU! XO.
*******
One of my staff's biggest fears about going out of town and leaving us is what happens if the house catches fire? This is probably a big concern of yours too!
Pugsley are I are not dumb. If the house caught fire, we would call 911. DUH. (They just don't give us enough credit, do they?)
But, if for some reason we could not get to the phone, it would be nice to know that when the Fire Department does come, they would know we were inside!
So, we've added Emergency Pet Rescue Window Decals to our Rescue Store.
Before we did this, though, we did some research to see if they are really worthwhile. Some people say that Firefighters rarely pay attention to this but there are so many stories of rescues made because the Firefighters knew there were furry friends inside.
So I asked a couple of real Firefighters to tell me what they thought of the window stickers and both of them agreed that they were very helpful so they knew to be on the lookout for pets. Whew!
As a side note, some departments even have pet-sized oxygen masks to help once the pets are rescued. Here is a nice story about Michigan businessman, Harold Bruns of Invisible Fence of Southwest Michigan, who donated oxygen masks to his area fire stations. What a nice, caring man.
So if you don't have one of these window stickers or need a new one, check them out! Proceeds go to the rescue organization of the month so it goes to helping your pets and helping many other pets in need!
Thanks to everyone who has purchased magnets and stickers so far. We are so excited to have this additional fundraising channel for the FURPOWER organizations. Let us know if you have any ideas for other Rescue Store items.
Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin made his fortune in the country's real estate market -- and now he's warning that it's spiraling out of control.
It's the "biggest bubble in history," he told CNNMoney in an exclusive interview Wednesday.
Bubble is a sensitive word in China after the dramatic rise and spectacular crash in the country's stock market last year, which wiped out the savings of millions of small investors who thought Beijing wouldn't allow the market to drop.
After struggling to contain the fallout from the stock market debacle, China's leaders could face a similar headache in the real estate sector.
Related: IMF tells China to fix its debt problem now
The big problem, according to Wang, is that prices keep rising in major Chinese metropolises like Shanghai but are falling in thousands of smaller cities where huge numbers of properties lie empty.
"I don't see a good solution to this problem," he said. "The government has come up with all sorts of measures -- limiting purchase or credit -- but none have worked."
It's a serious worry in China, where the economy is slowing at the same time as high debt levels continue to increase rapidly. There are massive sums at stake in the real estate market: direct loans to the sector stood at roughly 24 trillion yuan ($3.6 trillion) at the end of June, according to Capital Economics.

"The problem is the economy hasn't bottomed out," Wang said. "If we remove leverage too fast, the economy may suffer further. So we'll have to wait until the economy is back on the track of rebounding -- that's when we gradually reduce leverage and debts."
He says, though, that he's not worried about the prospect of a "hard landing" -- a sudden and catastrophic collapse in economic growth.
Wang's comments carry weight. He is the richest man in China, according to Forbes and Hurun Report data from 2015, and his real estate and entertainment empire brought in revenue of about $44 billion last year.
Wang has been warning of trouble in the Chinese property market for a while. His Dalian Wanda Group, which has developed huge malls and office complexes across China, has been gradually cutting back on its real estate business.

Instead, it's pouring resources into entertainment, sports and tourism -- areas where it sees potential for growth.
Wang has been on an overseas shopping spree lately, with a particular focus on the U.S. movie industry. And he's on the hunt for more juicy targets.
In January, he bought the Hollywood studio Legendary Entertainment, which made blockbuster movies like "Jurassic World" and "Godzilla." Less than two months later, his movie theater business AMC snapped up Carmike Cinemas, forming the biggest cinema chain in the world. And Wanda's in talks to buy Dick Clark Productions, which produces shows like the American Music Awards and the Golden Globe awards.
But the major prize he's seeking is control of one of Hollywood's "Big Six" movie studios: 20th Century Fox, Columbia, Paramount, Universal Pictures, Warner Brothers and Walt Disney.
Related: Disney CEO says China is tough but a 'great opportunity'
"We are waiting for the opportunity," he said. "It could come in a year or two, or longer, but we have patience."
His relations with Disney (DIS) came into the spotlight in May when he said the U.S. company "really shouldn't have come to China" with its giant new Shanghai resort. Wanda is also investing heavily in theme parks in the country.
Wang said Wednesday that his beef with the House of Mouse was "not personal."
"When it comes to movies, Disney is our biggest partner," he said. "But when it comes to entertainment tourism, we are archrivals. So of course we want to smash them."

Rescue workers look down a shaft partially filled with water to help a dog trapped Oct. 11, 2016, at an abandoned nuclear plant in Surgoinsville, Tenn.

SURGOINSVILLE, Tenn. — A construction worker helping to install solar panels Tuesday in a field beside an abandoned nuclear reactor heard a dog barking as if it were in distress.
So Matt Mountie of Charlotte, N.C., found a hole in the security fence and found the dog stuck in a 30-foot hole in the floor of the reactor building at Phipps Bend Industrial Park in this town of about 2,000 residents 20 miles west of Kingsport, Tenn., in the northeast corner of the state.
The hole was about the diameter of a manhole, and its bottom was filled with water. Only the dog's head could be seen above the water.
Mountie called Hawkins County Central Dispatch, which then called the Hawkins County Humane Society.
The humane society's first thought: Ask two rappellers to go down the hole and retrieve the dog
Assistant Chief Curtis Winegar of the Kingsport Lifesaving Crew was the first rescuer to arrive, and he recognized this was going to be a job for professionals. By the time the rescue was over, five county agencies were at the site where the Tennessee Valley Authority once began building a nuclear power plant in the 1980s but scrapped its plans.

Meanwhile, humane society Manager Sandy Behnke and Assistant Manager Julie Baker tried to encourage the dog and keep his energy level up. Baker nicknamed him Timmy after the boy in the Lassie TV series that pop culture incorrectly says fell down a well.
Winegar intended to set up a tripod and pulley system over the hole to lower someone down about 30 feet to get Timmy. However, as he waited for the equipment to arrive, Timmy seemed to be succumbing to exhaustion.
His head was beginning to dip below the waterline. Baker knelt at the edge trying to encourage Timmy to hang on.
But Timmy was fading fast, and Winegar knew he had to act.
"We had initially contemplated using a rope and a noose to lift the dog out — kind of hook the dog with the noose and pull him out of the hole — but we were afraid that we would cause injury to the dog," Winegar said.
"Over the last 30 minutes, the condition of the dog deteriorated quite a bit," the assistant chief said. "We were all in agreement that we didn't have time to rig a confined-space rescue, so we went to the backup plan and noosed the dog out. He was uninjured."
Shortly before 4 p.m. ET, about an hour after the first rescuers began arriving, Timmy was pulled out of the hole without suffering further injury.
Humane society personnel whisked Timmy away to a veterinarian's office for treatment.
As of 5 p.m. Tuesday, Timmy was doing OK.

When TVA abandoned its plans for a nuclear plant, it gave its property to Hawkins County and Kingsport for development of an industrial park. But the federal agency also left a dangerous concrete labyrinth behind with the half-finished reactor building that has been a temptation to curious explorers for the past three decades.
On Tuesday, authorities discovered that a hole had been cut in the security fencing on the east side of the reactor building facing the remains of what would have been the cooling tower.
Fresh graffiti adorned the walls of a long corridor leading to a large room where Timmy was trapped. That room also had fresh graffiti and broken beer bottles.
That evidence had some rescuers wondering if Timmy fell into the hole on his own or was tossed in.
Director Gary Murrell of the Hawkins County Emergency Management Agency said steps will be taken to better secure the extremely dangerous structure.
"I know one thing for sure," Murrell said. "If we hadn't gotten him out when we did, I don't think he was going to last much longer. We're just lucky someone heard him barking from the construction site because he was in a pretty bad predicament."

BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel came under intense pressure for her handling of the refugee crisis on Wednesday, with her Bavarian allies warning of a full-blown coalition crisis unless she takes immediate action to limit a record influx of migrants.

The Christian Social Union (CSU), sister party to Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), have been outspoken in their criticism of her “open doors” policy towards asylum seekers, in part because their home state of Bavaria is the entry point for virtually all of the migrants arriving in Germany.
Bavarian Premier Horst Seehofer has issued a series of ultimatums to Merkel in recent weeks, including a threat to take the government to court over its refugee policies, only to back down at the last minute.
But the rhetoric reached new heights on Wednesday, with one senior Bavarian official saying relations between the longtime allies had reached their lowest point in nearly four decades and a German newspaper reporting that Seehofer was considering pulling CSU ministers out of Merkel's cabinet in protest.
“We are in the midst of a real coalition crisis,” Bavarian Finance Minister Markus Soeder told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
“The relationship between the CDU and CSU is more difficult than at any time since 1976,” he added, referring to a major fight between former party leaders Helmut Kohl and Franz-Josef Strauss which nearly led to a split.
Although the CSU's bark has proved worse than its bite, the sharper tone underscored how serious tensions within the German government have become as hundreds of thousands of migrants, mainly from Syria and Afghanistan, stream into Germany.
Berlin expects between 800,000 and a million migrants to arrive in Germany this year, twice as many as in any prior year.
Seehofer is due to meet Merkel on Saturday to discuss refugee policy and the two will then hold talks with Sigmar Gabriel, who leads the other party in her “grand coalition”, the Social Democrats (SPD).
Merkel has resisted calls to set a ceiling, arguing that the crisis can only be solved by tackling its root causes: the war in Syria and poor conditions for refugees in countries such as Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey.
“OUT OF ORDER”
But in the face of rising criticism and declining poll numbers, some of her leading ministers appear keen to contain further political damage by adopting far tougher rhetoric.
Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere, acknowledging at a news conference in Berlin that the influx of migrants had accelerated strongly in recent days, vowed to radically increase deportations of those who have no chance of winning asylum.
He described a sharp rise in the number of migrants coming from Afghanistan as “unacceptable” and said talks had been held with the government in Kabul to put a halt to it, saying Afghans should “stay in their country”.
However de Maiziere's most pointed rhetoric was reserved for neighboring Austria, whose recent handling of refugees he called “out of order”.
“We observed that refugees, without warning and after dark, were being driven to the German border without any provisions or forethought. There were intensive contacts. Austria agreed yesterday to return to an orderly process. I expect this to occur immediately,” de Maiziere said.
Austria on Wednesday outlined plans to build barriers including a fence at a busy crossing on its southern border with Slovenia to slow the influx of transiting migrants.
In a positive sign for Merkel, the SPD signaled that it might be ready to drop its opposition to so-called “transit zones” along the border, which would allow German authorities to register and deport migrants more quickly.
Although Merkel's conservatives have been sinking in the polls, the center-left SPD has failed to benefit much. Still, the SPD sees the crisis as a political opportunity because it has damaged Merkel, who until recently had seemed destined to cruise to a fourth term in 2017.
In a sign of their newfound confidence, SPD leader Gabriel, who serves as economy minister and vice chancellor in Merkel's government, told Stern magazine on Wednesday that he had set his sights on becoming chancellor himself.
A new poll from Forsa showed Merkel's conservatives dipping two points to 36 percent, their lowest level in three years but still well ahead of the SPD on 24 percent. However 46 percent of those surveyed said they preferred Merkel as chancellor, compared to just 16 percent who supported Gabriel.
Is it hot in here, or is it me?
Crispy-skinned, pan-seared, or crusted of any kind—when a menu description brings to mind a deeply browned, so-crispy-it's-noisy piece of skin or seared meat, chances are I'm ordering it. It's that crunch, and the hopefully juicy, soft flesh that lies beneath it (vegetarians: substitute fried potatoes in your fantasy), is a large part of why I eat out in the first place.
The chefs behind those perfect proteins don't have a magic wand or a secret ingredient. So what is the key to this seductive outer crust? Just a big spoon, a limber wrist, and fat.
Basting is a technique with a number of applications. Loosely, it's a means of moistening, flavoring, and adding texture to foods by spooning melted fat, sauce or cooking juices over them while they cook. While it has a number of applications—it can be used when roasting, cooking in a rotisserie, broiling, grilling, and pan-frying foods—the one familiar to most is the Thanksgiving turkey baste.
You know the scene: The lucky host will use a brush or basting bulb (yep, those squeezy tools that look like oversized eyedroppers) to run the pan juices back over the bird while it cooks. Although, today, we're going to focus on pan-basting, all basting usually serves the same purpose.
Reasons We Baste
1. Moisture. Especially during dry-heat cooking (such as roasting), basting guarantees the food will have more contact with hot fat, juices or other liquid while it cooks. This will ultimately help prevent its surface from drying out.
2. Flavoring. Whether you're basting with hot melted butter or a seasoned sauce (think of a pan sauce seasoned with garlic or shallots), dousing the food with more of the seasonings it might miss were it sitting under a broiler or one-side-down in a pan.
3. Cutting cooking time. Imaging pan-basting as cooking with an invisible (albeit lopsided) panini press: While the bottom of the meat or fish sears against the high heat of the pan, the top will get it's fair share of cooking accomplished thanks to the hot liquids you're pouring over it. While the two sides won't cook at the same speed, it'll take less time once you flip the meat or fish, or place it in the oven to finish.
4. Creating a crust. Basting may be the agent here, or just the abettor. For one, the hot liquid or fat will help cook and, if given the time, brown the exposed side of the meat or fish in the pan (again, refer to the video—you can actually see the color of the fish change). But it'll also allow you to skip flipping the meat or fish altogether, so you can concentrate more crust-forming high heat on the side that's face-down in the pan. (Usually this is the skin side in poultry or fish, and the one that will be plated upwards later.)
5. Correcting random error. Let's say you had a bacon-crusted porkchop in the pan (drool), and you flip it over only to notice some areas of the bacon didn't crisp as much as others. In this case, you can concentrate your basting fluids onto certain parts of the dish, spooning the liquid into little crevices the pan may have neglected. This also works for crisping the sides of thick meats such as steaks and chops that may never have direct contact with the pan.
Granted, most full-time chefs would probably dominate us in the wrist Olympics involved. (You'll see in the video above.) After all, they crank out dozens of pan-cooked proteins a night.
Basting Pointers
1. Add extra fat or liquid if needed. The more your spoon is able to lap up, the more surface of the meat you'll cover per baste.
2. Keep the flame high. Since you'll need to cock the pan toward you slightly in order to pool the liquid, you'll want to be sure the pan is good and hot to begin with, and that it's still feeling the heat even if it's slightly off the burner.
3. Set yourself up for success. Position the protein away from you, in the upper half of the pan, so it won't interfere with your spooning. Then follow it's natural shape while you drizzle. If the meat is longer horizontally in the pan, spoon the juices from one side to the next. If it's longer vertically, release the juices over the top of the protein, and let them drip down over the rest of it.
Check out the video to see it all go down. With a little practice, you'll be elevating your own chicken to crispy and fish skin to phenomenal.
Splatter Warning
Be forewarned: this process may cause a mess, and you could get hot fat splashed on your hands. Home cooks should consider wearing a rubber glove on the basting hand, and a pot holder or side towel to hold the pan. Burnt fingers, and hot oil splashing is no fun!

The last two years have been nothing short of life changing, both professionally and personally. Many lessons have been learned and others are still on the horizon. And now, here I am making a big step forward in my writing career. I am going from an apprentice to a journeyman, the contract term is a “Writer Employed in Additional Capacities”. On the credits it will say: Story Editor.
It's a bitter-sweet victory. To take this plunge I leave a place that has always felt like home, ABC Studios. The place that gave me my first entrance into this career, and I don't mean just the first writing job, I mean way back when I was an associate getting coffee and answering phones. The Disney Lot in Burbank has grown to a BS a place of great comfort to me. Having never graduated from a University, I can only imagine this is perhaps what it might feel like to leave a callow ground that has educated you. Knowing that I make this move with the full support of the people who have helped me to this point is a great reward unto itself. Writing on American Crime is a once in a lifetime experience, I'm one hundred percent aware that I may never find a room like that again in this town. It's unique in its makeup, its leadership, execution, and trust. John Ridley looked out to all of us on day one of the first season (a room mostly made of women and people of color, yes you heard me, more than just one woman in a writers room…) and said his sincere hope was to see all of us rise to be Showrunners one day.
It is because of John Ridley and EP Michael McDonald's empowerment that I am even in the position that I am in today. Because of ABC Studios and American Crime I am able to take a leap forward and work up the chain. I began as an Associate at ABC, after a long road was selected as a Writer Fellow, and was asked back to be a Staff Writer. Because of that and the trust that John and Michael had in me to write episodes for the show, I'm in the machine now, I'm a working writer, hireable, I am able to diversify my credits. I'm not one of those “diversity hires” that gets bounced around like a bargain basement fire sale to round out a room, I am just a writer doing his thing. And knowing that American Crime is going to continue excites me to see what brilliant stories will come out of that genius factory for next season. I move forward knowing that I leave a place open for another young voice to come show their skills and prove that we are here, the inclusive talented storytellers are here, just invite us in. Taking a job as a Story Editor for a show with a full season order is another step towards that ultimate goal, that challenge John himself put upon on all of us: be a Showrunner some day.
The next step begins Monday, and I am excited to the umpteenth degree. I am going from writing about our real world monstrosities to a show about brothers who fight monsters in the real world. Horror and Sci-Fi are the two things that brought me to the written word in the first place. It's in my blood, I'm literally born on Halloween. To tap into this other side of my creative self and plunge head first into a different kind of show feels like the first day of school all over again. Considering I was kicked out of four High Schools, that might not be the best analogy…but I think you can see my drift. Right now from the way I see things it is all gravy. To have the privilege to do what you love as a career, it is a huge blessing and I am forever grateful to anyone involved with me being able to do that.
It's all a dream come true. To make things even more fantastic, I could not have asked for a better second job in television.

When in court it is the job of the defense lawyer to cast doubt on the credibility of the prosecution's case. Finding and highlighting those details which show the defendant to be misleading or unreliable can be the make and break of a case. Unfortunately for ACS:Law's Andrew Crossley, that is a knife that cuts both ways as yet again he is shown to have misled a reporter.
When ACS:Law burst onto the file-sharing litigation business scene in mid-2009, the similarities between their modus operandi and that of Davenport Lyons, the company that had pioneered the ‘pay-up-or-else' scheme, were clear.
Since we were interested in his work, TorrentFreak gave ACS:Law owner Andrew Crossley an opportunity to tell everyone about his business. Our very first question was this: “What is your connection with Davenport Lyons?”
The answer from Crossley was plain and straightforward.
“None,” he told us via email on 8th May 2009.
Having followed these cases for some time, we immediately suspected that we were being misled. At the time, however, we had no hard evidence to prove it.
But now, as confirmed by these previously unpublished excerpts from the Solicitors Regulation Authority report into Crossley's activities, it is clear that four days after he spoke with us he was telling the SRA investigation a completely different story.
During a telephone conversation between Mr Roberts [of the SRA] and Mr Crossley on 12 May 2009, Mr Crossley confirmed that all of the non-contentious work in relation to each of Davenport Lyons' remaining four clients had been transferred to ACS:Law.
Furthermore, Crossley also employed two staff members directly from Davenport Lyons to carry on the file-sharing settlement work. The best known recruit was Terence Tsang and as confirmed by another extract from the SRA investigation report, the second was Adam Glenn.
During the Davenport Lyons investigation, the Investigation Officers interviewed the supervisor of the P2P file sharing department, Adam Glenn. Mr Glenn joined ACS:Law as a senior supervisor in May 2009 and it is understood carries out broadly the same duties at ACS:Law as he had undertaken whilst employed by Davenport Lyons.
As if Crossley's reputation hadn't already taken a big enough battering from the recently leaked emails, an article published this week in The Telegraph illustrated yet again that at times this man has difficulty playing a straight ball.
The article, ‘ACS Law: Are you a middle-class pirate? This lawyer would like a word with you…' details an extended personal interview conducted with Crossley just a week before his company emails were spilled out onto the Internet.
“When we spoke he [Crossley] had portrayed himself as a pauper, telling me that ‘less than a month ago' he had been wandering around an air show with no money in his pocket and not a ‘penny to my name',” wrote Telegraph reporter Paul Kendall a short way into the article.
Sadly for Crossley, the leaked emails painted a different picture.
“….[Crossley] had just bought a Bentley Arnage, was considering buying a Ferrari F430 Spider ‘in a couple of months' and was hoping to move into a new home with ‘five double bedrooms, three bathrooms and four reception rooms',” noted Kendall, quoting from the leaked emails.
It's worth bearing in mind that Crossley admitted he could go bankrupt without the file-sharing work, so there's little doubt where this money was coming from.
Of course, at the time when Crossley made his ‘pauper' comments he would've had no idea that the leaked emails would later show that he had been misleading a reporter from a national newspaper. However, at some point Crossley changed his mind about his position before The Telegraph published their article, and then made an unsuccessful attempt at censoring it.
“Hi Paul,” wrote Crossley in an email to Kendall. “One thing I wanted to scratch from the interview was I said I had no money recently. That was not an accurate reflection of the position.”
“Accurate reflection”? I think we're starting to get the hang of this “legal jargon”….
The Telegraph article raises some other interesting issues, particularly where one thing is being said by ACS in public but differing conclusions and other motivations are being discussed in private. They weren't detailed in the piece, but we're happy to help.
When Kendall visited ACS:Law's offices he saw two rows of crates carrying documents labeled ‘First Bare Denial', ‘Second Bare Denial', ‘Admissions and Settlements', ‘Drop Claims', and ‘Complex and Sensitive'.
“I make a mental note to ask Crossley about the latter, but before I get the chance, I'm distracted by one of the paralegals on the phone,” wrote Kendall. “For most of the time I've been in the room he's been taking a steady flow of payments, but this time I hear him tell the caller that their case has been dropped.”
Kendall asked Crossley why they took this action.
“The woman I was talking to had just come off chemotherapy,” said Crossley. “She's on disability allowance and says she can't afford to pay.”
What's this? Compassion from ACS:Law? Hardly. Maybe this internal email describes their motivations a little more clearly.
Date: Mon, 30 Nov 2009 17:30:56 -0000 Fellow Paralegals, From now on, if you find a response to a third party letter, do not send a security letter. Instead, please move the letter into the ABANDON HOPE folder in General Paras. This is because Andrew and Adam will be drafting a new letter so we can drop a couple of hundred cases over the next couple of weeks, putting pressure on those who we do not drop to settle. If you find someone who is blind, one legged and dying, and you think they are not worth pursuing due to the possibility of bad PR, please also put them in there. However, the majority of cases will be continued.
Those following ACS:Law closely will remember Crossley making rather a big thing about dropping cases, even announcing that he was doing so on his now defunct website. We now have an insight into why, but Crossley doesn't miss an opportunity for some good PR.
“We drop many cases,” Crossley told Kendall. “I've dropped cases where people have sent money in. To give you just one example, a chap wrote in. He said: ‘I don't know what this is about, but, unfortunately, your letter arrived a week after my wife died. I'm in no fit state to deal with this so I'm just paying it.'”
“I sent the cheque straight back. I said: ‘We're not here to pursue people who aren't in a position to consider it properly.'”
But people who were in a position to “consider it properly” were still hounded by the company. One accused individual wrote back to ACS:Law with the following defenses which were logged in company files as follows:
Defence 1: CATEGORICALLY DENIED Defence 2: HAS NOT INFRINGED COPYRIGHT OR AUTHORISED ANYONE TO DO SO Defence 3: NO UK LAW WE CAN USE TO PROSECUTE HIM
In reference to item 3, the letter recipient resides in Scotland (London Patent County Court used by ACS only has jurisdiction to hear cases from England and Wales). Coupled with items 1 and 2, that should have been the end of the case. Instead, the following email was written in response:
Date: Wed, 2 Jun 2010 16:25:38 +0100 Dear Leyla, I have drafted a final warning for this infringer as he resides in Scotland. He sent an internet template letter in response to our letter of claim.
Other emails reveal that other Scottish cases are also given special treatment. In one case it was felt that sending a ‘Final Warning Letter' might not be appropriate, not because the letter recipient's claims of innocence had been accepted, but because they had engaged the assistance of the Citizens Advice Bureau. The defenses lodged by the accused and listed by ACS:Law were as follows:
Defence 1: Responded with template letter
Defence 2: Categorically denies infringement
Defence 3: No UK law we can prosecute her with
So with the one-legged, dying, disabled and Scottish out of the way, what about children? The Telegraph raised this with Crossley.
“Later, when I suggest that parents can't be held responsible for everything their children do online, [Crossley] seems to change his position on this, arguing that the children themselves – ‘after the age of 10 or 11' – should be sued, but I suspect this is just blustered,” wrote Kendall.
Bluster indeed. Yet again, this seems to be a case of Crossley saying one thing in public, but his expert Adam Glenn advising him differently in private.

Subject: RE: SCTR_30001607 – BORRIE – JMM
Date: Tue, 8 Dec 2009 21:53:08 -0000 […]Section 97 provides for the damages in an infringement action. In determining damages s97(1) provides an effective mens rea component to the infringing act. This means that it is not the equivalent of a strict liability offence. The Act asks if the defendant knew if copyright subsisted in the work at the time and whether they had reason to believe that it subsisted in the work. If it can be shown that that knowledge and belief did not exist then the rights-holder “is not entitled to damage”. The question is therefore whether the child, aged 14, had such knowledge or belief. On the basis of settled law, using either criminal and tortious precedents as a guide, I would submit that it is likely that the courts would make a decision on the basis of the capability of the child and any expectation of whether a child of that age would have such knowledge or belief. I would caution that that would be a difficult presumption for us to sustain on current case law. Thus if we cannot show, on the balance of probabilities, that the daughter had knowledge and belief then, under the act, we are not able to claim damages.[…]
But this is probably moot since ACS:Law would never pursue a case against a child in court, because if the letter recipient refused to pay, the case would almost certainly be filed in the ‘Drop Claims' or ‘Complex and Sensitive' crate.
Finally, we'll just touch on the confidence ACS:Law have in the evidence they use to prise settlement from individuals.
“Our evidence is pretty compelling,” Crossley told Kendall. “Everybody says it's not, but it really is.”
“Every time an application is submitted to court for disclosure from ISPs, there is an independent expert's report analysing and reviewing the integrity and accuracy of the data that's being captured,” he later added.
Independent expert? That does indeed sound quite compelling. ACS:Law must be very happy and completely convinced that their “expert” knows what he's talking about? As it turns out, they aren't at all.
In an email dated August 24th 2010, Adam Glenn runs the idea past Crossley of getting an “Alternate Expert Witness”. It contains a line which suggests serious concerns exist with their current ‘expert witness'.
You know my view on the quality of Clem Vogler's expert witness statement and what I perceive as the opportunity it provides to serious challenge.
The Telegraph interview took place before the hugely damaging email leaks and a number of publications have been trying very hard hard to get a comment out of ACS:Law ever since. They got one line.
“It's business as usual at ACS:Law,” Crossley told the media at the end of September.
These were the last public words of ACS:Law, either through the press or via their now defunct website. Both ACS:Law domain names are currently parked.
The company sent out a flood of letters warning recipients that they have 14 days to pay up or see their papers filed out court. Some papers have indeed been filed at court, but that means little and is being seen as a last throw of the dice to get people to pay up. There is no indication of mass panic setting in among the accused.
While ACS:Law and Andrew Crossley have made many questionable statements in the course of their settlement letter business, there is one big one that still hasn't come to fruition. Time and again they promised to bring a case to court – a full, proper, bona fide contested case against one of the dozens of innocents they have wrongfully accused.
It's sad that they didn't do that and we maintain today, as we have done all along, that it will never happen. We'll also go out on a limb with an even bigger prediction. The ACS:Law settlement business is over.
“Business as usual?”
Sure.
Share. Just under two weeks remain in the crowdfunding campaign for a new River City Ransom. Just under two weeks remain in the crowdfunding campaign for a new River City Ransom.
The Kickstarter campaign for an officially licensed sequel to River City Ransom is approaching the $100,000 mark. In order to be funded, it must raise about an additional $75,000 during its final two weeks on Kickstarter.
The crowdfunding campaign for River City Ransom: Underground began on September 9. The project is being put together by Conatus Creative, a small studio that has already licensed the rights to create an official River City Ransom game. That process involved turning to the IP's owner, A Million Co., a company founded by former employees of Technos, the defunct developer of games like River City Ransom, Super Dodgeball, and Double Dragon.
With those rights in hand as of this past April, pre-production was able to begin on Underground. The game is described as a "2.5D open world beat'em up with RPG elements" and is to feature support for four-player local and online co-op. It's being developed for PC with a tentative release date of September 2014, but if the Kickstarter is able to reach $280,000 CAD (about $271,587 USD), work will also begin on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita versions. Those two were chosen "because of Sony's obvious commitment to indie game development, and because we felt a console is the natural place for a platforming beat'em up RPG," though other platforms haven't been ruled out as possible future destinations.
Underground's Kickstarter has steadily made its way towards its current total of $102,919 CAD (about $99,816 USD) from 2,401 backers. In order for the project's developers to receive any of the money, the campaign will have to reach $180,000 CAD (about $174,584 USD) by October 9; if that total isn't reached, Conatus gets nothing. As outlined in the project's pitch, this money is intended to cover the developer's living expenses, as well as QA and localization work that will have to be done.
This is not the first attempt in recent years to revive the Kunio-kun series, of which games like River City Ransom and Super Dodgeball are a part. A sequel to River City Ransom developed by Miracle Kidz for WiiWare and PC was announced in 2011, but the project never panned out.

Leaders Wolves survived a scare against Colchester to go four points clear at the top of League One.
The hosts led inside two minutes when Michael Jacobs' cross found the net, before David Edwards seized on a loose backpass and James Henry tapped in.
But Colchester fought back, with Alex Gilbey's header and David Wright's volley setting up a tense finish.
Freddie Sears hit a post for the visitors before Wolves sub Nouha Dicko rounded goalkeeper Sam Walker to score.
Wolves back on course? After seeing their club record nine-match winning run come to an end in their last home game against Shrewsbury Town, Wolves then lost at Crawley. But they have now clocked up successive victories again.
Wolves dominated possession from the start of a one-sided first half, leading 3-0 at the break.
Leon Clarke three times went close to his first goal at Molineux since returning to the club from Coventry.
Clarke had a header saved by Walker and another fly narrowly wide. And, when Walker turned his effort into Henry's path just before the break, the winger netted the rebound.
Jacobs and Edwards both missed excellent chances at the start of the second half before Colchester's stirring fightback.
Kenny Jackett's side had to endure a nervous finale until Dicko sealed a 14th home league win of the season with virtually the last kick.
Wolves' victory - combined with Brentford's 3-0 defeat at Rotherham - strengthens their title aspirations.
Colchester, meanwhile, are now just four points clear of the League One drop zone.
Wolves boss Kenny Jackett told BBC WM:
Media playback is not supported on this device Post-match: Wolves boss Kenny Jackett
"You see a lot of comebacks in football and Colchester have a lot of spirit.
"They changed their system, went went to a diamond and caused us problems.
"Things weren't perfect. You can't just expect it happen. But four goals at home is a big positive and overall I felt we deserved to win.
"With us winning and Brentford losing, it's been a good night for us."
Colchester United manager Joe Dunne told BBC Essex:
Media playback is not supported on this device Post-match: Colchester boss Dunne
"I thought the second half we were excellent. We made some substitutions, tactically changed the shape, and had a great response.
"Freddie Sears hits the post, could make it 3-3. We were going for it at the end and left ourselves open a bit at the back.
"In the end 4-2 looks harsh. I know they had a lot of chances, but that's not my fault they missed them.
"I have to pay great credit to the players, in the second half they really dug in deep and showed great character again."
Fellow Big Ten fan Anthony Ventura and I decided to team up and tackle the East together, which is by far the better of the two divisions in the Big Ten. It is a division whose competitiveness is obvious, since the winner is usually decided within the last two weeks of the season. The division has sent a team to the College Football Playoff each of the last three years, and it doesn't seem like that will change this year, thanks to the leadership of elite coaches like Urban Meyer, Jim Harbaugh and James Franklin. This is the Big Ten East and how it will break down this season with predicted records.
1. Ohio State Buckeyes 12-0 (9-0)
The Buckeyes will bring back star quarterback J.T. Barrett, who is 1 touchdown away from breaking Drew Brees' Big Ten touchdown record. They bring back stud running back Mike Weber, while also looking to rotate snaps to freshman J.K. Dobbins, who has been impressing coaches in camp. To block for J.T. and Mike, the Buckeyes return 4 of 5 offensive linemen, although they are a unit that must improve if they hope to raise the trophy this year. They bring back a defensive line with 5 defensive ends who can rotate in and cause havoc anytime, and a few big defensive tackles to plug up the middle.
The defensive unit loses a lot in the secondary, but they have a lot of blue-chip recruits to come in and play. Also, remember: they lost a lot after 2015 and came back last year with one of the best secondaries in the country. They must replace almost all production from receivers, and after a terrible passing season in 2016, that is worrying for Buckeye fans going into the season. After a horrendous offensive season, the Buckeyes lost both of their OC's, but they were replaced with one of the greatest offensive minds in college football, Kevin Wilson. As OC on an Oklahoma team that averaged over 50 ppg, Wilson hopes to revitalize the Buckeye attack and put them back on top.
2. Penn State Nittany Lions 10-2 (7-2)
The Nittany Lions have nine starters returning from an offense that finished 14th in the nation in passing efficiency and was magical time and again in the fourth quarter. In other words, the attack should be unstoppable. Can't forget about Trace McSorley, who might have been a bit erratic at times, and sometimes needed a few quarters to warm up, but managed to throw for over 3,600 yards with 29 touchdown passes and in an All-Big Ten season. As good as the passing game should be, the offense works around Saquon Barkley, one of the nation's top do-it-all backs who exploded when healthy, but only hit the 100-yard mark five times. Their defense is solid and their offense is explosive. Look for Penn State to be deadly next year.
3. Michigan Wolverines 10-2 (7-2)
The Wolverines rebound to dominance will be led by returning quarterback Wilton Speight, who will need to look for new weapons. He lost FB Khalid Hill, who scored against Ohio State last year, RB De'Veon Smith, stud TE Jake Butt and top 2 WR's Amara Darboh and Jehu Chesson. Michigan will need to find a way to get new guys integrated into the system, and fast since they open their season against the Florida Gators.
On defense, they must replace their entire defensive line except for Rashan Gary, who rotated in as a freshman last year and looks to be one of the best d-linemen in the country this year. They lose star LBs Ben Gedeon and Jabrill Peppers and the best CB combo in the country in Jourdan Lewis and Channing Stribling.
Without a doubt, Michigan must replace a lot on both sides of the ball, but with a coach like Jim Harbaugh and defensive wizard Don Brown, anything is possible for the Wolverines this year.
4. Michigan State Spartans 6-6 (4-5)
The Spartans get back offensive line stud Brian Allen in the interior, but lose three starters from a group that was pretty solid in all aspects of blocking. With the three-headed monster of L.J. Scott, Gerald Holmes, and Madre London pounding away, as long as the line is okay, the Spartans will run well. The quarterback is still a question mark, but Brian Lewerke is a mobile young player with great upside, while Damion Terry is a decent veteran, also with a bright upside; they just need to find receivers to throw to.
This year's defense is loaded with veterans, though, with all four starters back up front. The question mark is the positions behind the line. The Spartans couldn't get to the quarterback, generating just 11 sacks on the season with five of them coming in the first three games. If the Spartans look to have anything other than a bounce back season then they need to pick it up on defense.
5. Maryland Terrapins 6-6 (4-5)
Can the Terps finally find a steady quarterback who can take the job by the horns? There might be a few options, but everything is on hold until their superstar recruit at the position, Kasim Hill, can show what he can do. Regardless of who it is, the O-line needs to give the QB some time if they hope to get better as a team considering they surrendered 49 sacks last year.
A fantastic running back situation features Ty Johnson and Lorenzo Harrison as a dangerous tandem, combining to average close to eight yards per pop. Receiver D.J. Moore is a good target who needs to be fantastic in order for the rebuilding receiving corps to succeed.
It's a loaded defense, at least in terms of experience, with ten players back who could be counted as returning starters. Eight of the top 11 are back along with a bulk of the pass rushing production and a stellar linebacker core.
6. Indiana Hoosiers 5-7 (2-7)
It all starts with QB Richard Lagow, who was able push the ball down the field for big gain after big gain last season. But, he threw 17 picks along the way. As long as he can cut down on the errors, he should be among the Big Ten's most productive passers. With the return of receiver Simmie Cobbs Jr. from injury, along with top target Nick Westbrook, the passing production won't slow down after a season with 274 yards cranked out per game.
Nine starters return on defense, and that doesn't even include T.J. Simmons, who was injured last season, but was one of the team's leading linebackers for two years. Now he joins Tegray Scales, who should be in the hunt for All-America honors no matter where he plays. Great against the run and in the backfield, he's the superstar, but the Hoosiers have other playmakers, too. The secondary that did a good job last season is loaded, with Richard Fant, one of the Big Ten's top corners, leading the group of four returning starters. Now, they need help from the pass rush. As long as the tackles hold up against the run, the Hoosier D won't slip a bit, but still look for another poor season.
7. Rutgers Scarlet Knights 2-10 (0-9)
What is there to say about the Scarlet Knights? They bring back their top 2 passing players, top rusher Robert Martin, and their top receiver, but lose the number 2 and 3 receivers. They bring back their top 2 total tacklers from last year, but lose their top sacks guy. Also, off the 5 guys who had interceptions for them last year, they return 4 of them.
Overall, Rutgers is sure to be in some trouble this year (as always). Nobody expects them to cause a stir, either in the conference or nationally. They are a young team still, so their main goal for the season will be improvement. Chris Ash is a young coach, still building up what is his first head job. I don't expect to see Rutgers in a bowl game this year but it sure is fun as hell to root for the underdogs and to watch Ash and the young team progress together.

One of the great things about open source is that you're free to modify and redistribute it in whichever way you like. This is real creative freedom that I support. All of my apps and games are open source. A while back, I helped fund the opening of some game music and art assets to the public. Being in the public domain (or having a Creative Commons license, as these art assets now do) allows for public remixing and free use of the content. Gotta love that.
Fast forward to this week. I was relaxing on a short staycation, playing games and watching TV, and I began to think to myself, "Why not remix one of my games with some of this new creative commons content?" So that's what I set out to do. You can grab the latest source code from the GitHub page. Here's how it's looking right now: (Note: any ghosting or slowdown you see is an artifact from screen capture).
I started by copying the base of my last game: Pop Them Balloons. The source is heavily commented and uses my high-level abstraction libraries to make basic game design a very straightforward task. Title/credits screens are one-liners in code. This allows me to concentrate on the base gameplay mechanics and refine the core experience without worrying about scrolling end credits text or background music, etc.
The concept for my new game, "Can't Stop The Rock," is quite simple. It's a casual game flipped on its head. You play "the level," dropping balloons that quickly scroll left toward "the rock." The rock rolls around the screen dispatching your balloons. I'll add weapon upgrades and various mechanics from my previous action games for the rock to execute while you drop balloons. The goal, if there is one, is to get balloons past the rock. I want the game to be fast and slick—60+fps at all times—and I'm going to do it without resorting to native code or OpenGL.
First, it was time to upgrade the audio. Pop Them Balloons had three main songs: a title theme, a credits theme, and a game theme. I'm going to upgrade that to five songs for "Can't Stop": a title theme, a credits theme, and three game themes. I updated the code to change the game theme depending on the difficulty selected. That way, you can have a more casual experience on more casual game modes.
And here I ran into my first creative editing situation: I felt the game over theme from "HalyconFalconX" would make for a great title theme on "Can't Stop The Rock," except for the inclusion of “Fail!” at the end of the song. Not to worry, I opened up Audacity (my favorite open source MP3 editor) and clipped it out of the waveform. That's the sort of thing you can do with open content.
I wanted the action to be fast and furious, so I went with high-BPM tracks and removed some graphical flourishes for now.
From here, I updated the background to pulsate through a known list of pleasant colors and updated the little rock hero to actually pop some balloons as it crossed them. The gameplay is very fast paced, so much so that my video encoder gives me ghosting when screen capturing on my aging Nook tablet.
I think some of the best casual gameplay comes around the use of sound and audio to immerse the player in the experience. With that in mind, I set out to add some musical fun to the game. My first thought was to include midi playback, but there's too much baggage. I ended up heading over to freesound.org and downloading a set of guitar chords, then arranging the play screen into note quadrants, making for some interesting music opportunities.
As you can see, as each balloon is placed onto the screen, it is painted with a note. This is the note that plays if it gets popped. Right now it doesn't seem much like most games, and it doesn't play like most instruments. Pretty fun stuff, and a lot of cool directions to take this in the near future. Next time, perhaps I'll play with the mechanics of color and sound, or add an RPG stat system to our hero. The sky's the limit.
Objectives: The polyphenol resveratrol has shown regulatory effects on hippocampal neurogenesis, which according to the neurovascular niche hypothesis, is likely to involve stimulation of angiogenesis. In rodents, global cerebral ischemia leads to selective CA1 neuronal damage, spatial memory impairments, lasting changes in corticosterone (CORT) secretion, and increased neurogenesis. This study examined dose-related effects of 21-day RSV treatment on markers associated with neurogenesis (DCX, PSA-NCAM) and angiogenesis (CD31) in the hippocampus at short (7-day) and long-term (85-day) intervals following global ischemia. In parallel, post-ischemic and stress-induced CORT levels and spatial memory in the Morris water maze were determined.
Methods: Five groups of male Wistar rats were included: sham/saline, ischemia/saline, ischemia/1 mg/kg RSV, ischemia/10 mg/kg RSV, and sham/10 mg/kg RSV. Changes in expression of plasticity markers were paralleled by assessment of basal- and stress-induced CORT secretions, and spatial memory performance.
Results: Our findings revealed a significant attenuation of ischemia-induced DCX/PSA-NCAM expression in RSV-treated rats, whereas RSV treatment increased angiogenesis in the injured CA1 region. RSV attenuated CORT levels 3 days post-ischemia and a trend toward attenuating CORT secretion in response to 15 minutes restraint stress. Increased swimming latencies in the target quadrant during the MWM probe trial in RSV-treated ischemic rats support beneficial effects of RSV on spatial memory retention.
Discussion: Our findings uncover time- and dose-related effects of RSV and global ischemia on the regulation of hippocampal plasticity. Changes in neuro- and angiogenesis are consistent with RSV neuroprotective effects, but appear independent of RSV regulatory effects on corticosterone secretion.
A few days ago, a rumour appeared on Reddit that Valve Anti-Cheat, the software Valve use to crush aimbots and wallhacks across their games, was spying on people's DNS cache and sending that information home. In other words, the Seattle game developer was watching every website you ever visited. It was only a rumour, and an unlikely one, but Gabe Newell appeared on Reddit last night to explain the situation. It's a typically interesting look into Valve's mindset and their approach to cheating.
There's something poetic at the core of all this: cheat creators struggle to get users to pay for their cheats, and so put DRM inside their cheats. They put software to stop cheats inside their cheat software. “These cheats phone home to a DRM server that confirms that a cheater has actually paid to use the cheat,” according to Newell. That's why Valve went looking inside your DNS cache. If they found evidence of phoning home, they knew a person was cheating and were able to ban them.
Newell makes clear that he wouldn't normally reveal this kind of detail, but is doing so in this instance because the method of detection no longer works. “The cheat providers have worked around it by manipulating the DNS cache of their customers' client machines.”
Ultimately, Newell argues this all comes down to an issue of trust. “Trust is a critical part of a multiplayer game community – trust in the developer, trust in the system, and trust in the other players. Cheats are a negative sum game, where a minority benefits less than the majority is harmed,” writes Newell. “There are a bunch of different ways to attack a trust-based system including writing a bunch of code (hacks), or through social engineering (for example convincing people that the system isn't as trustworthy as they thought it was).”
Valve take cheating seriously because it erodes people's trust in the system. That's certainly true; Counter-Strike servers were paranoid places for years, in which any demonstration of skill was met with an accusation of cheating. It took a long for trust among players to return, far longer than it took to erode, and I still see more accusations of cheating in Counter-Strike than I ever did in Team Fortress or, really, any other modern multiplayer game.
Newell also suggests that some of the rumour-spreading might have been caused by cheat developers – that “social engineering” bit above. “VAC is inherently a scary looking piece of software, because it is trying to be obscure, it is going after code that is trying to attack it, and it is sneaky,” writes Newell. “For most cheat developers, social engineering might be a cheaper way to attack the system than continuing the code arms race, which means that there will be more Reddit posts trying to cast VAC in a sinister light.”
Valve are essentially fighting back with a little bit of social engineering of their own. They know that if they open up, and do so directly to the Reddit community, then they'll win a lot of people over to their side. “Our response is to make it clear what we were actually doing and why with enough transparency that people can make their own judgements as to whether or not we are trustworthy,” as Newell puts it.
Somehow this post has come out longer than the original statement, so go read the full post through on Reddit.
For decades, a culture of silence has surrounded priest abuse in Italy, where surveys show the church is considered one of the country's most respected institutions.
So there I was sitting in front of my computer, coffee in hand, looking forward to enjoying a nice quiet Sunday morning catching up with the atheist blogosphere. I clicked on a link left in a comment by pelican666, and my calm was shattered. The priest abuse scandal in Italy commands attention but is receiving virtually none in the U.S. media. There are plenty of things in this world that piss me off, but I am finding that few has more power to do so than what this article characterizes as the "culture of silence" around sexual abuse by Catholic clergy.I know that sexual abuse is often an uncomfortable topic. I also know that the pedestal on which many Western cultures place religion inevitably leads to greater discomfort and avoidance of discussing abuse committed by members of the clergy. Unfortunately, this means that the burden of raising awareness of these crimes tends to fall disproportionately on two groups: victims' advocates and atheists.I have known a great many victims' advocates who work tirelessly to raise awareness about the prevalence and dire consequences of child sexual abuse. But they need our help. Many are in positions where it is difficult for them to call out religious institutions or point to the unique manner in which religious belief protects pedophile priests and allows the churches to perpetuate such abuse . Frankly, they should be expected to do this because their primary role is one of providing assistance to the victims.Perhaps atheist activists can increasingly take on the role of raising public awareness of how religious belief facilitates child sexual abuse. Whenever I see one of these stories, I experience what can only be described as rage. "How dare these sick Christians do this to children!" But at least an equal source of outrage involves the growing realization that the rest of us allow this to continue. The institutions which have been proven to perpetuate these atrocities need to be dismantled be damned!Maybe I should feel relieved that such news is reported at all. But when I see how quickly these stories are buried and hear Bill Donahue claiming that those of us wanting to protect children are somehow anti-Catholic bigots, whatever relief I might have felt evaporates.What can we do? For starters, I think we need to do a better job of covering these stories and demonstrating how religious belief facilitates these crimes. We need to overcome our hesitancy about confronting these crimes. I also think that it is important for us to spread the word about organizations such as the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP). Those who are victimized need to know where to go for help. It is clear that the Catholic power structure remains determined to sweep these crimes under the rug. We must not allow that to happen.
A wearable device that stimulates the sense of balance with electric “noise” could help Parkinson's disease patients, according to Swedish scientists. (Photo: Getty Images)
Scientists from the University of Gothenburg's Sahlgrenska Academy have developed a portable pocket-sized vestibular, or balance, stimulation device in a bid to improve the lives of Parkinson's sufferers.
The research was led by Associate Professor Filip Bergquist, who said the simple device was similar to the TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) therapy which is used for pain relief, for example in child birth.
"So this is really not a very complicated device. It is a current device which is very similar to the ones that people use for pain relief with electrical stimulation of muscles and nerves, what's called TENS. The difference is that we use a particular current profile which you can stimulate the balance organs with without creating a balance disturbance. So you do not get the impression that the world is moving or that you are moving, you actually do not feel anything," Bergquist explained.

The device operates by providing stimulation via patches attached to the patient's head behind the ears, where the vestibular system is located.
Parkinson's disease is characterized by reduced levels in the brain of the hormone dopamine, a neurotransmitter that allows different regions of the brain to communicate with one another. Symptoms of advanced Parkinson's disease include an impaired sense of balance, as well as tremors, poor mobility, slowness and stiffness.
Nearly all patients diagnosed with the disease are treated with levodopa, a drug that stimulates the production of dopamine in the brain. The effectiveness of oral levodopa reduces as Parkinson's disease progresses in the patient and can lead to involuntary movements, or dyskinesia.
In earlier experiments on rats, researchers at Sahlgrenska showed that noisy electric stimulation of the balance organs could be used to change the activity of the brain, thereby balancing the effects of dopamine shortage and improving the animals' motor skills and balance.
The researchers have also tested the method on ten Swedish Parkinson's patients, in both medicated and unmedicated states. According to Sahlgrenska, on one day the patients received an active noise stimulation and on another day inactive treatment, not knowing which day the current was active. According to the research institute, the experiments showed that the active noise stimulation improved both the patients' balance and the combined symptoms.
Parkinson's sufferer Staffan Lindblom said he did not expect any great advances, but would be thankful for anything that would make living with the disease easier.

"I have become hardened in the sense that I do not have too great expectations. But I still believe that something will be found at some point which could be useful. There is extensive research in this field and I hope that it eventually will come up with a result. Not a significant result but a few steps forward would really be appreciated," he said.
Unfortunately this particular treatment did not work on Lindblom, with Bergquist suspecting there could also be other causes to Lindblom's balance problems.
Bergquist said he hoped the device could treat patients for whom the Levodopa drug, which turns into dopamine in the body and increases levels of the chemical, was not enough.
He also said they were working on the hypothesis that other diseases which affect the dopamine system, such as ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), could also benefit from this kind of treatment.
"What we are hoping for with this device is to find a treatment for movement disorders where Levodopa, Parkinson's disease where Levodopa is not enough. And in particular in patients with Parkinson's disease where there is problem with gait and balance. But this may not be restricted to Parkinson's disease, so there may be other conditions with poor balance where you could use electrical stimulation of the vestibular organs, the balance organs to improve balance and gait," he said.
The plan is now for the device to be tested in a longer-term study, where patients will be using it at home. If those trials prove successful, the developers hope the device could be available to the public within five years.
Up Next: The Number One Health Risk for Successful Women
Over the last 30 years, China's economy has grown at an average annualized rate of nearly 10%. While this statistic alone is jaw-dropping, what is more impressive is the extent to which the nominally Communist country's economy has become intertwined in the global economy. China now exerts enormous influence over the economies of virtually every country in the world, and a slight change in its domestic economic policy has the potential to send shockwaves rippling throughout the world. Nowhere is this more apparent-and frightening-then in China's economic relationship with the United States, which is very much at the mercy of China when it comes to prices, wages, interest rates, most importantly, the value of the Dollar.
The precariousness of this relationship is already the subject of significant publicity, redolent of the Japanaphobia of the 1980's that saw American economists scare-mongering about Japanese control of the US economy. [Of course this later turned out to be unfounded, but that is beyond the scope of our discussion.] With regard to China, most of the analysis is focused on its growing foreign exchange reserves, the majority of which are held in Dollar-denominated assets. This article will go beyond forex reserves and discuss several other facets of China's economy. From US house prices to global commodity prices, from interest rates to inflation rates, we will explore how China could cripple the US economy, both willfully and unintentionally, if so desired.
Forex Reserve Diversification
Let's begin with an examination of China's forex reserves, which is probably China's biggest bargaining chip in its economic relationship with the US. Up until two years ago, China's currency, the RMB or Yuan, was pegged to the Dollar. As with any peg, there often develops a discrepancy between the fixed value of the currency and the value that the market would assign if the currency were permitted to float. As China's economy surged ahead, especially over the last five to ten years, tremendous pressure began to build under the RMB. In order to maintain the peg and hold down the value of the RMB, China began accumulating foreign exchange reserves by withdrawing foreign currency from circulation. Today, China's foreign exchange reserves are massive, at $1.4 trillion as of September 2007.
In the eyes of American policy-makers, this presents a problem because the majority of these reserves are held in Dollar-denominated assets, namely in the form of US Treasury securities. The US government theoretically could not be happier that foreign Central Banks are willing to finance its perennial budget deficits. However, this borrowing has reached a point where foreigners now control over 40% of the US national debt. Moreover, long-term US interest rates are market-driven, based on the buying and selling of US government bonds. In other words, the US has gradually ceded control of its long-term interest rates to foreign Central Banks, namely China and Japan.
As the Dollar has depreciated over the last five years, many Central Banks have begun “diversifying” their forex reserves, by switching from Dollar assets to assets denominated in other currencies. This is problematic for the Dollar for two reasons. First, switching from US assets to European assets, for example, directly causes the Dollar to depreciate. Second, the bulk sale of US treasury securities (whether or not they are replaced with other US-assets) causes US bond prices to decline and hence, yields to increase. Thus, if China suddenly decided to diversify its reserves, for economic and/or political reasons, it could potentially crash the Dollar and send US long-term interest rates skyward. Since mortgage rates are tied directly to government bond yields, a rise in interest rates would probably also affect US real estate prices. Higher interest rates would make borrowing for a home more difficult, which would lower the demand for houses and thus, the value of American real estate.
In fact, China recently created the China Investment Co. Ltd., capitalized with almost $300 Billion, charged with investing its vast forex reserves in higher-yielding assets. However, the company's inaugural investment was a stock purchase in the Blackstone group, an American private equity firm. Thus, while it seems likely that China will gradually discard some of its stock of US Treasury Securities, the affect on the value of the Dollar will be minimal. Besides, while China would certainly punish US businesses and consumers by unloading US Treasuries on the market, it would punish itself even more, since the value of the government bonds that it didn't sell would decline. In short, it seems China will probably hold off on exercising its “nuclear option” for the time being.
Currency Manipulation
The second aspect of the China-US economic relationship which China could wield to its advantage is the RMB, itself. American public officials enjoy criticizing China for failing to allow its currency to appreciate more quickly. In fact, there is a bill that has been lying dormant in the US Congress, which threatens to slap a massive across-the-board tariff on all Chinese imports if China fails to allow the RMB to appreciate adequately against the Dollar. What policymakers don't realize is that a rapid appreciation in the RMB would actually harm the US economy.
Coupled with its growing role as the world's factory, China's cheap currency has made Americans wealthier, by increasing their purchasing power. As production of labor-intensive goods was outsourced to China over the last decade, prices for finished products began to fall both in real terms and in nominal terms. While the effect on US employment trends is debatable, its effect on prices has been unambiguous. Thus, even while the American economy boomed, inflation remained relatively modest by historical standards. This allowed the Federal Reserve Board to hold interest rates down and foment economic growth.
As the RMB appreciates, Chinese producers will become ever-more forced to pass along some of the price increase to consumers. Now, if China was to suddenly revalue its currency by the 25%-30% that western policy-makers are demanding, prices on a whole host of Chinese products would jump up overnight. This would adversely affect American purchasing power and limit consumption to such an extent that the US would be in danger of slipping into recession. While the trade deficit that is the bane of American politicians' existence might decrease in the long-term, it would skyrocket in the short-term. Besides, as many analysts have been quick to point out, there is not much overlap between Chinese and American production. Thus, a more expensive Yuan would send production to other parts of Asia, rather than back to America. While the US-China trade deficit might narrow, it would be offset by increased imbalance with the rest of Asia. Just like with the case of its foreign exchange reserves, however, China is unlikely to exercise this option because it would deal equal harm to itself. China's ruling Communist party derives most of its legitimacy from the strength of its economy, and especially exports. If a more expensive Yuan forced producers to relocate to other parts of Asia, it would certainly spell trouble for the CCP!
Direct Competition with US Exporters
A more potent (and plausible) weapon would be to compete more directly with US exporters, by expanding into high-technology products. Currently, China specializes in manufacturing labor-intensive products, which have long since been manufactured outside of the United States. As previously stated, a revaluation of the Chinese Yuan would surely not return production to the US. However, if China were to expand into capital-intensive and/or high-technology products, it could easily steal marketshare and jobs from the US.
Limiting the Importation of US Products
Of course, there is also the imports side of the trade equation. China is quickly becoming one of the United States' largest export markets; limiting the importation of US goods and services would certainly be felt in the US. In fact, China already requires multinational companies in many industries to form joint ventures with Chinese companies in order to produce and/or sell their wares in China. Other anti-competitive measures include tariffs, import taxes, quotas, or a simple ban on the importation of certain types of products. Each would have a devastating impact on the US trade deficit with China and would probably result in retaliatory sanctions by the US.
Wage Pressure
Next, there is the impact that China has exerted on global wages. When Deng XiaoPing's famous tour of the South in 1979 ignited three decades of dizzying growth, hundreds of millions of Chinese were added to the global labor pool overnight. Yet, the majority of China's population remains concentrated in rural areas. In fact, there are perhaps 500 million Chinese peasants that have yet to join the modern labor force, which means the full effect of China's economic explosion has yet to be fully realized by the rest of the world. Already, there is no hope of unskilled work that has already been outsourced returning to the US. If/when China begins to expand into the production of high-technology goods and more complex services, it will encroach on the territory of American businesses. Unfortunately for the US, China will likely make these undercapitalized sectors of its economy more of a priority in its next five year plan.
One popular method for estimating GDP is the income approach, which as its name suggests, represents a summation of the reported incomes of a given country's domestic population. Logic dictates that downward pressure on the wages of skilled American workers would negatively impact US GDP, and at the very least, would curtail the purchasing power of American consumers. This would also limit US exports to China, since Chinese would have homegrown alternatives to choose from.
Raw Material Pricing
In addition, there is the impact that China's economic growth has exerted on global raw material prices. It has been said that 25% of the world's construction cranes are currently located in China, to support the country's building boom. These massive development and infrastructure projects require proportionally massive quantities of raw materials, namely cement and steel. Unfortunately, China is especially inefficient at converting raw materials into finished products. Combined with the CCP's emphasis on the near-term (which inherently prioritizes low cost over efficiency), this is placing a tremendous strain on global energy supplies, driving prices skyward.
Competition for Energy
The global prices for oil and coal are already at record highs and China only consumes 1/15 the amount of per-capita energy as the US! Chinese energy companies are becoming increasingly visible, scouring the globe for stable supplies of energy and often coming head-to-head with American energy companies. Conveniently, China does not recognize the ethical issues which arise from purchasing energy from dictatorships and corrupt regimes, whereas US companies are limited from doing business in these places. From Sudan to Myanmar to Kazakhstan, Chinese companies have set up join ventures where US companies could not. While energy prices have certainly risen in the US, they have not kept pace with global energy prices. In this way, China is able to ensure that its citizens and its businesses have the oil, coal, and natural gas that they require, while their American counterparts may be forced to conserve.
Two years ago, the Chinese National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC) attempted to purchase an American energy company, Unocal, for over $18 Billion. However, the deal was blocked by the US Congress, which feared Unocal's energy reserves would be supplied to China at the expense of Americans. It did not help CNOOC's case that 70% of the Company was effectively owned by the CCP. Needless to say, Chinese government officials were not happy with the outcome; (Unocal was ultimately sold to Chevron for a lower price). China has already shown its willingness to use extreme tactics to secure an adequate energy supply. It seems reasonable to expect its energy policy will continue to oppose and inconvenience the US.
Conclusion
In short, China has several economic “weapons” at its disposal for countering the US, ranging from the manipulation of its currency to the diversification of its burgeoning stock of forex reserves. It also has several less blunt options to choose from, such as enabling Chinese companies to compete more directly and effectively with US companies, and opposing the US in securing a domestic energy supply. On all of these fronts, the US is essentially being held hostage, since it has become so dependent on China as the world's factory. Ultimately, it seems unlikely that China will deliberately butt heads with the US unless it is first provoked, but America should nonetheless be on its guard, since its economy hangs in the balance.
Most Greeks are afraid to leave the euro and the European Union. An economy that has shrunk by 25 percent, a large number of pensioners and unemployed, and a declining population suggest that the country would not survive outside of a larger economic unit. “Ever closer union” is the only way, goes the thinking, and reforms that our partners demand in exchange for support make us stronger.
In Britain, on the other hand, those in favor of exiting the European Union present this as a declaration of national sovereignty. As Michael Gove, the justice secretary and a leading Brexit campaigner, put it in a recent speech: “If we vote to stay, British taxpayers will inevitably be paying ever-higher bills for years to come as the E.U. uses its growing and unchecked power to transfer resources to subsidize failure. If we vote to stay, we are not settling for the status quo — we are voting to be a hostage, locked in the boot of a car driven by others to a place and at a pace that we have no control over. In stark contrast, if we vote to leave, we take back control.”
Greeks know about being powerless. Long periods of our history have resembled Mr. Gove's nightmarish scenario, with foreign powers and military dictators controlling our fate.
European Union membership put an end to that — no matter how much we bridle at Brussels' mismanagement and alleged “democratic deficit.” For us, European values helped entrench the rule of law and political institutions as never before (albeit without strengthening them to the point where we could have averted bankruptcy). Britain, on the other hand, already had a long and proud tradition of liberal democracy, economic dynamism, social stability and the rule of law, which attracts investors, students, academics and professionals from across the globe (many Greeks among them). European Union membership is in line with these values and it is not true that Britain is powerless to influence events.
At the heart of the British referendum is a fundamental paradox. Prime Minister David Cameron campaigned for reform in the European Union, and when he got most of what he wanted, backed the campaign to stay. If, however, his compatriots vote for leaving, the reforms will be irrelevant to Britain, which will suddenly be looking for a new modus vivendi with its former partners. Britain will not only lose its ability to influence developments but will also be a catalyst for further change in the bloc. Whether this will be toward further union or fragmentation, Britain will be powerless to act — like being in the trunk of Mr. Gove's proverbial car.
Despite being a relatively rare breed, African-American Republicans are diverse in their political thinking and reasons for being part of the GOP, according to a Stanford sociologist.
Corey D. Fields (Image credit: L.A. Cicero)
Public opinion surveys generally find that about 7 to 10 percent of blacks identify themselves as Republicans. In addition, only 2 percent of Republicans identified themselves as black in a 2012 nationally representative survey done by the Pew Research Center.
Identity is often thought to drive political behavior. For example, an LGBT activist is likely to vote for liberal policies and a National Rifle Association member will probably stand for more conservative ideas.
But research by Corey D. Fields, an assistant professor of sociology, suggests that political demands also shape the way individuals think about their identities.
Fields, who is a faculty affiliate at the Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity at Stanford, interviewed about 50 black Republican activists for his recently published book, Black Elephants in the Room: The Unexpected Politics of African American Republicans.
The Stanford News Service interviewed Fields about his research.
How and why did you start working on this project?
The research began about seven years ago with my interest in unexpectedness, which is when someone is doing something that someone “like them” isn't supposed to do.
I've always been drawn to people who defy expectations. As a researcher, I believe it's important to look at people who don't fit the mold. Doing that sometimes tells you more about the people who do fit the mold. African-American Republicans are a compelling illustration of this phenomenon.
The Republican Party started out with abolition at its creation. How and why did the number of black Republicans eventually decline to a point of them becoming the odd “black elephants”?
African-Americans' departure from the Republican Party coincided with the rise of President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal in the 1930s. But it wasn't until the GOP incorporated opposition to civil rights that black support for the party became virtually nonexistent. Many historians identify the Barry Goldwater candidacy in 1964 and deployment of what became known as the “Southern Strategy” as signature moments where the Republican Party lost the support of African-American voters. Current polling trends suggest that's not going to change anytime soon. However, demographic trends suggest the Republican Party will have to find a way of incorporating racial minorities if it wants to be successful in presidential elections.
What is it like for African-American Republicans today and how do they vary according to your research?
The central challenge for African-American Republicans is everyone expects a black person to be a Democrat. Frequently, they face pressure from two audiences: other African-Americans and white Republicans. Both groups believe “black” and “Republican” don't necessarily go together. As a result, African-American Republicans often feel isolated and marginalized.
African-American Republicans vary in how much they see issues of race and racism as being a problem in America. While they all recognize that racial discrimination is unacceptable, the group I call “race-blind” think that many of the challenges facing the black community are self-inflicted. They talk about conservative policies in more abstract, ideological ways.
In contrast, African-American Republicans I classify as “race-conscious” understand racism as being a defining feature of the black experience in America. This latter approach calls for black power through conservative principles. Unfortunately for the latter group, important gatekeepers within the party are much more interested in hearing from African-American Republicans who sidestep a racially conscious message and suggest that racial discrimination is less important to the black condition than things like personal responsibility.
What surprised you during the research on this project?
I was surprised how little thought white Republican Party leaders gave to the experiences of black Republicans and other minority groups inside the party. There was an expressed commitment to diversify the party, but I noticed a lot of heavy lifting hasn't been done. Not many party leaders could tell me why African-Americans join the party or what black Republicans within the party think about more famous black Republicans, like Herman Cain and Ben Carson, whom the party selected for the national stage.
The GOP has been vocal in calling for increased diversity among both the leadership and the rank and file of the party, but those efforts haven't been very successful. Why is that?
GOP leaders often promote representatives who are appealing and palatable to people already supporting the party. The party takes an inward-looking approach to inclusion. They are enthusiastic about including more racial diversity in the party but only want representatives who toe the current party line. Put glibly, the party is eager to have racial minorities to come to them, but there has been less work invested in taking the Republican Party to minority communities.
What do you believe is the biggest takeaway from your research?
Not all African-American Republicans are the same. They vary in regards to the meaning and importance of race in their political thinking. This variation structures their political differences. But African-American Republican behavior is embedded within the broader context and demands of Republican politics.
The black Republicans who gain the support of the party don't reflect the complexity behind the scenes.

Liverpool owner John Henry says fan protests against ticket prices are causing the club to reassess plans to further redevelop Anfield.
Henry's Fenway Sports Group apologized to fans earlier this year and reversed planned rises in ticket prices after a walkout during a game.
But having funded the redevelopment of Liverpool's main stand over the last year, the next phase of the expansion program might not make economic sense if the club can't recoup the construction cost. The Anfield Road stand had been next in line for rebuilding at the 54,000-capacity Anfield.
"I don't know if there is a next step because ticket prices are an issue in England," Henry said. "That may foreclose further expansion. We'll have to see."
Henry was speaking Tuesday at Yankee Stadium where his baseball team, the Boston Red Sox, was playing the New York Yankees.
Liverpool has opened its first full season with Juergen Klopp in charge by winning four of its six Premier League games. The German signed a contract extension in July through 2022.
"He was a perfect fit for Liverpool, for the culture of the club, for the supporters, for the kind of team that we were trying to build," Henry said. "We couldn't have asked for a better fit."
With no European matches this season, Liverpool is chasing a top-four finish to return to the Champions League.
From the 2018-19 season, entry into the Champions League group stage is easier for English clubs with the Premier League's fourth-place team no longer having to go through a playoff.
The "market pool" system, which steers UEFA prize money to clubs in England, Germany, and Italy, where the broadcasting deals are bigger, will be changed to reward better historical results in the competition. That should help Liverpool as a five-time European champion but see income drop for Manchester City, which has never won the continent's top prize.
The Champions League changes were agreed by a small number of club officials and UEFA, with the rest of Europe not knowing the outcome until the announcement in August.
Henry said he was aware of other teams in England "obviously not happy with the UEFA deal."
"The changes weren't really discussed with us, they were implemented essentially. They unilaterally made changes to the market pool and there should have been I think more discussion. But I can tell you that the (Premier League) owners were not happy ... at least among the clubs that I speak with."

“Dana White's Tuesday Night Contender Series” will bring five fights per week to UFC Fight Pass beginning on July 11.According to a release, the weekly series will feature five live fights per episode “showcasing up-and-coming talent as well as athletes striving to revive their professional mixed martial arts careers.” Contender Series bouts are open to both male and female athletes from all weight classes and will be regulated by the Nevada Athletic Commission. The presence of the NAC means that the contests will count toward the fighters' records.“This sport continues to get bigger all over the world, and the more fights we can put on, the more talent we can find, the better the events will be for the fans,” UFC President Dana White said in a release. “I love looking for up-and-coming talent. This show's going to give us another opportunity to bring in young fighters who we think have potential to make it in the UFC or maybe even one day become world champions. It'll also give some fighters who might be in a slump or on their way out of the organization an opportunity for that last shot.“I truly can't watch enough fights and I think our fans will love this new Fight Pass show.”White will scout the fights along with matchmakers Sean Shelby and Mick Maynard. The bouts will be filmed at “The Ultimate Fighter” gym in Las Vegas in front of a closed studio audience. According to the release, the Contender Series “will serve as the ultimate vehicle to identify top prospects and the next generation of UFC stars.”

Washington — In a striking example of how 3-D printers could customize medical care, doctors turned powdered plastic into tiny devices that saved the lives of three baby boys by holding open defective airways so they could breathe — and the implants even expanded as the tots grew.
These experimental airway splints actually change shape over time, adding what researchers call a fourth dimension that is key for growing children as the implants first expand and later, when no longer needed, harmlessly dissolve.
“We are using laser light to transform dust into medical devices that change how the body develops,” said lead researcher Dr. Glenn Green, a pediatric ear, nose and throat specialist at the University of Michigan. “It is a concept that would have been inconceivable” not too many years ago.
Green's team made headlines in 2013 with initial success in treating the first baby, Kaiba Gionfriddo.
On Wednesday, the researchers published promising results with two other youngsters, plus long-term tests showing that Kaiba, now a thriving 3-year-old, seems cured as the splint that once helped him breathe is dissolving right on time.
Next the team is working with the Food and Drug Administration to begin a clinical trial testing the 3-D printed devices in 30 children with a similar problem.
Independent experts called the work exciting.
“Fascinating,” said Duke University's Dr. Piers Barker, who leads research in 3-D printing for pediatric cardiology.
“The promise of 3-D printing is you can really begin to personalize potentially almost every medical intervention,” Barker said. But “this approach to a structure that permits growth — this is the first time I've seen anything like this.”
Beyond all the consumer gadgets from the 3-D printing revolution, doctors increasingly are turning to the technology.
They already have tried printing custom-sized artificial bones, replacement ears and models of deformed hearts so that surgeons can practice a fix before cutting someone open. Some scientists even are attempting to print organs, pumping out a mixture of biodegradable scaffolding and human cells instead of ink. Such work will take many more years of research.
The airway splints mark a different approach, not replacing a body part but helping it grow with a made-to-order therapy.
About 1 in 2,000 babies is born with weakened airways, called bronchi, that can suddenly collapse and block breathing. Most outgrow the condition by age 3, because airways get stronger as they get larger. But severe cases can be life-threatening.
All three boys in the Michigan study had undergone tracheostomies, to attach them to ventilators, and yet repeatedly had to be resuscitated.
“He was basically suffocating,” Meghan Orbich said of her son Ian.
At just 5 months old, Ian had spent weeks in intensive care, his breathing repeatedly stopping. Frustrated specialists in his hometown of Pittsburgh didn't know what else to try. Orbich saw a news article about the Michigan research and tracked down Green.
Previous attempts at propping open airways from the inside hadn't worked very well. So Green and biomedical engineer Scott Hollister designed a splint to be stitched to the outside, holding open the airway much like a pole holds up a tent.
Using measurements from each patient's CT scans, in a single day the laser printers churned out tubes the right shape and size for each child, with an opening down one side. The splints are made of thin layers of plastic known to start degrading in about three years, just the right time.
Surgeons sterilized the splint and placed it over each patient's weakened airway. As that airway eventually doubled in size, it pressed on the splint and widened the opening, Hollister explained.
The surgeries required emergency permission from the FDA, which says new 3-D implants must meet required performance standards just like traditionally manufactured medical devices. Green said the materials for a splint cost about $10, and despite surgery fees the approach promises to save money by getting kids out of the hospital sooner. He and Hollister have filed a patent application for the device.
On Wednesday, the researchers reported that all three boys are improving dramatically, living normally at home. Ian is the last remaining on a ventilator because of additional problems.
But a year after the implant, “he is doing amazing,” his mother said. “It was a blessing.”

NEW DELHI: Escalating its attack on the Congress over the National Herald case, the BJP has brought out a booklet titled 'Family Greed and National Blackmail' that aims to "inform" its party leaders about the issue.The party will distribute the booklet, which is a compilation of a number of write-ups on the issue, among its MPs and leaders across the country to "inform" them on the issue and give them "talking points", BJP parliamentary party office secretary Balasubrahmanyam Kamarsu said."It will give our leaders basic information about the issue and help them in explaining the stand of party as well the government. It will also give our spokespersons and leaders various talking points so that they could highlight them in debates and discussion," he said.The BJP has resorted to bringing out booklets on almost every major issue since it came to power in May 2014.The Congress had accused the Central government of practising "vendetta politics" and has alleged that the National Herald case against Sonia and Rahul Gandhi is part of the conspiracy.The party has brought out booklets on a host of issues, including Land Acquisition Bill, intolerance debate and the recent debate on Constitution.
DEAR MISS MANNERS: I received a wedding invitation from a girl I was close friends with in junior high. My issue is that I'm transgender, and they know this, but they addressed the invitation to my former name.
For this wedding, you are supposed to RSVP online. I don't want to be rude by not responding, but I simply cannot select my old name on their website, not only in terms of the emotional cost, but in principle as well because I have come too far to take that step backward.
We live in a small town, so we occasionally run into each other or family members, but it's been years since we've been close, so I don't have her contact information anymore to reach out in person and let her know I won't be able to attend.
Should I just forget about it, or try to contact her through a family member? I won't feel too guilty, since she was the one impolite enough to use a name that doesn't belong to me anymore, but still, I'd rather take the high road. I just don't know which way that is.
GENTLE READER: Do try to procure her contact information. Write her a short, kind note saying that you appreciate the invitation, but that you are unable to attend. And sign your current name.
While your friend may be aware of the change and should have respected it, it is possible that she also just did not know how to reconcile your new life with the friend she knew in junior high. Or that she had an old list. Anyone who changes a name, or even just tries to drop a childhood nickname, finds that it takes time.
So give her the benefit of the doubt and, as you said, take the high road. While it may be tedious to presume misguided, rather than purposeful, ignorance, it will likely do much more to educate this girl and her family than not. Miss Manners feels certain that if the girl cannot figure out from whom the note came, she will quickly take pains to do so -- and likely not make the mistake of using the wrong name again.
(Please send your questions to Miss Manners at her website, www.missmanners.com; to her email, dearmissmanners@gmail.com; or through postal mail to Miss Manners, Andrews McMeel Syndication, 1130 Walnut St., Kansas City, MO 64106.)
Super Rugby has closed a judicial loophole that had previously counted bye rounds as part of a player's suspension.
From this season, the system will be adjusted to ensure guilty players serve the proper length of bans they are issued, as part of a raft of changes to Super Rugby's judicial process unveiled on Thursday by SANZAAR.
Queensland Reds prop Sef Fa'agase and NSW Waratahs hooker Tolu Latu both effectively served phantom suspensions last year after copping one-week bans the week before their teams had a bye.
Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share
The pair were officially considered to have been suspended that week from club rugby matches.
The inconsistency existed because, unlike most other sports, sanctions in rugby are given in weeks, not matches.
SANZAAR has also introduced a three-person foul-play review committee, which will scrutinise all red-card incidents, citing commissioner referrals and misconduct charges.
The panel is headed by senior judicial officer Nigel Hampton QC (New Zealand) and also includes former international players John Langford (Australia) and Stefan Terblanche (South Africa).
Other changes include a new warning for offences that do not quite meet the red-card threshold, as well as permission for incidents to be referred back to the citing commissioner for review if new evidence comes to light outside the existing judicial time frame.
“SANZAAR believes Super Rugby has unique challenges across six territories and 15 time zones and the enhanced Super Rugby judicial process will deliver a more streamlined and effective system for teams and a more consistent outcome for players and fans to identify with,” chief executive Andy Marinos said.

The Commissioners of Irish Light (Irish: Coimisinéirí Soilse na hÉireann ) is the body that serves as the General Lighthouse Authority for the island of Ireland plus its adjacent seas and islands. As the Irish Lighthouse Authority it oversees the coastal lights and navigation marks provided by the local lighthouse authorities; the county councils and port authorities.
It is funded by light dues paid by ships calling at ports in the Republic of Ireland, pooled with dues raised similarly in the United Kingdom. This recognises that a large volume of shipping, typically transatlantic, relies on the lights provided by the Irish Lights.
History [ edit ]
Signal fires to guide shipping have long existed. Hook Head has the oldest nearly continuous light in Ireland, originally a signal fire or beacon tended by the monk Dubhán in the fifth century.[1] Monks continued to maintain the light until the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in 1641.
King Charles II re-established the lighthouse in 1667. He granted a patent for the erection of six lighthouses to Robert Reading, some replacing older lighthouses,[2] at Hook Head, Baily Lighthouse at Howth Head, Howth sand-bar, Old Head of Kinsale, Barry Oge's castle (now Charlesfort, near Kinsale), and the Isle of Magee.
In 1704 Queen Anne transferred the lighthouses around the Irish coast to the Revenue Commissioners.
The Commissioners of Irish Light, or "CIL", were established under an Act of the Parliament of Ireland passed in 1786 and entitled An Act for Promoting the Trade of Dublin, by rendering its Port and Harbour more commodious (26 Geo. III, c. xix). Lighthouses were not included until the 1810 Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. These Acts, as confirmed by the Irish Lights Commissioners (Adaptation) Order, 1935, remain the legislative basis for the CIL.[3]
Irish Lights has moved its headquarters from Dublin to a purpose-built new building in Harbour Road, Dún Laoghaire.
Finance [ edit ]
The services provided by the Commissioners are financed from the General Lighthouse Fund. The income of the General Lighthouse Fund is mainly derived from light dues charged on commercial shipping at ports in Ireland and the United Kingdom, (i.e. user pays) supplemented by an annual contribution from the Irish Government towards the cost of the service provided by the Commissioners in Ireland.[4]
The General Lighthouse Fund is administered by the UK Department for Transport. It also finances:
The accounts of the Commissioners of Irish Lights are consolidated with those of Trinity House Lighthouse Service and the Northern Lighthouse Board to form part of the General Lighthouse Fund annual accounts which are published in London by HMSO.
Ships [ edit ]
Granuaile III [ edit ]
The Commissioners currently have only one light tender[5] in service named ILV Granuaile. The hull was built at Galaţi shipyard, Romania, in 2000 and fitted out at Damen Shipyards in the Netherlands.[6] She is registered in Dublin and has a 2,625 gross tonnage (GT), has a length overall of 79.6 m and a beam of 15.99 m. She is the third vessel named Granuaile to have served the Commissioners. Granuaile II was in service between 1970 and 2000, and she was preceded by the first Granuaile from 1948 to 1970. Because of the automation of lighthouses, and the extensive use of helicopters by the Commissioners, CIL now need only one tender in service. The ship has diesel electric propulsion and is extremely manoeuvrable, and is therefore ideal for her role in maintaining the automatic navigation buoys in Irish waters. In 2003 she was involved in the recovery of the fishing boat Pisces, which sank off Fethard, County Wexford, in July 2002.

Middletown, NY — In a case that sounds like the makings of a Hollywood film, a retired crooked cop has been arrested after authorities discovered the bodies of four missing men on buried on his property.
Nick Tartaglione, of Otisville, recently retired from the Briarcliff Manor police department and now stands accused of murdering four men at a bar in Chester, New York, called the Likquid Lounge, according to court documents.
Tartaglione was arrested Monday on murder charges and for his role in a massive cocaine trade, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara said in a press release.
“While all murders tear at the fabric of our communities, when the alleged perpetrator of a gangland-style, quadruple homicide is a former police officer, that strikes at the heart of civilized society,” Bharara said in a statement. “As alleged, Nicholas Tartaglione, a former Briarcliff Manor police officer, participated in the senseless murder of four people in a bar in Chester, New York.
“These four men had not been seen or heard from since the day of their alleged murder. We hope that today's arrest brings some measure of comfort to the victims' families and loved ones,” Bharara said.
According to authorities, two of the murdered men were involved in the cocaine deal that went south while the other two men happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Martin Luna, Urbano Santiago, Miguel Luna and Hector Gutierrez, who were last seen in Chester, New York, were reported missing in April. Their whereabouts have now been sadly confirmed.
https://youtu.be/WAZO8jAg3XU
Tartaglione's history as a cop is less than stellar as he's been fired, sued, accused of beating journalists, and was an obvious candidate for suspected steroid use.
In 1999, Tartaglione was arrested on perjury charges after being accused lying about a drunk driving arrest he made. However, because of his blue privilege status, in 2003, he was given his job back, plus back pay.
Tartaglione was also involved in the harassment and assault of a local cable TV host, Clay Tiffany. According to court documents, Tiffany was paid $1 million from Briarcliff Manor to settle his lawsuit for being beaten by Tartaglione.
In spite of his horrendous record as a cop, Tartaglione was allowed to retire amid controversy and is receiving a tax-free $64,000 annual pension for the rest of his life.
Being an enforcer in the war on drugs, Tartaglione, like so many cops in his position, seemingly gave in to the easy opportunity to make money from corruption. It is highly unlikely that this cop waited until after he retired to start dealing cocaine as his position as a drug cop gave him easy access to dealers, stolen cash, and lots of confiscated drugs.
The drug addicted Tartaglione is now sitting in jail where he's being given court order suboxone to ween him from pain pills. If convicted, Tartaglione could face the death penalty. However, that is unlikely as his defense will use his ‘honorable career as a law enforcement officer' as a means of obtaining a sweet plea deal or a lesser sentence.
“The despicable acts of murder are more egregious in this case because the alleged murderer, a former police officer, once swore to serve and protect people from harm,” FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. said in a statement. “The FBI Hudson Valley Safe Streets Task Force works day after day to battle the crimes that accompany the drug trade to keep criminals and their illegal actions from impacting innocent people. We hope the victims' families and community find some solace in an arrest being made.”
The 23-year-old Kingery batted .304 with 29 doubles, eight triples, 26 home runs, 65 RBI, 41 walks, 29 stolen bases, 103 runs scored and an .889 OPS in 132 games between double-A Reading and triple-A Lehigh Valley. He hit safely in 55 of his 63 games with Lehigh Valley, reaching base safely in 58 of them. Kingery was tied for fourth among all minor league players in runs scored and tied for ninth in extra-base hits, and his 23-game hitting streak from Aug. 2-25 was tied for the fifth-longest in the minors while leading the International League. No player in the minor leagues with at least 25 home runs had as many stolen bases as Kingery, and only one of those players came within 15 steals of him. He finished the season 29-for-34 in steal attempts. Defensively, the Phoenix, Ariz., native posted a .989 fielding percentage between both levels, turning 76 double plays and finishing the season with a 47-game errorless streak.
The Phillies have selected second baseman Scott Kingery and right-handed pitcher Tom Eshelman as the recipients of the 2017 Paul Owens Award, presented annually to the organization's top minor league player and pitcher.

Kingery represented the Phillies on the U.S. Team in the All-Star Futures Game in July and was named the Eastern League Player of the Month in May. He was selected by the Phillies in the second round of the June 2015 draft.
"Scott showed the ability to be an impactful everyday player on both sides of the ball, and that is the most exciting thing," said Joe Jordan, the Phillies Director of Player Development. "The power showed up this season, and he wins as many games on the defensive side as the offensive side. That, and his energetic style of play, makes him an exciting young player with a very bright future with the Phillies."
Eshelman, 23, made 23 starts between double-A Reading and triple-A Lehigh Valley, going 13-3 with a 2.40 ERA, 0.97 WHIP, .233 opponents' batting average and 102 strikeouts to just 18 walks in 150.0 innings pitched. He finished first among all Phillies minor league pitchers with at least 100.0 innings pitched in both walks-per-nine innings ratio (1.08) and strikeout-to-walk ratio (5.67), walking either one or none in each of his 23 starts. Of the 49 other minor league pitchers with as many innings pitched as Eshelman, only two issued fewer walks. After being promoted to Lehigh Valley in May, the 6-foot-3 right-hander allowed one earned run or none in 10 of his 18 starts with the IronPigs, including six scoreless starts. He led the International League in WHIP (0.94) and was second in ERA (2.23) and complete games (3). Eshelman was an IL midseason All-Star, as well as the league's May Player of the Month. He was acquired on Dec. 12, 2015, from Houston along with four others in the trade that sent Ken Giles to the Astros.
"Tom was a model of consistency for the entire 2017 season," Jordan said. "His ability to execute pitches is truly special and his ability to command the baseball is going to allow him to be a meaningful rotation piece for our major league club going forward."
The Paul Owens Award was instituted in 1986, and is named for the late Paul Owens, who spent 48 years in the Phillies organization as a scout, farm director, general manager, manager and senior advisor. The players will receive their awards on the field on Sept. 19, prior to the Phillies' 7:05 p.m. game against the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Indeterminacy of Translation is an idea by Quine, which says that direct, uniquely correct translations of a foreign language, even theoretically, are impossible. For Quine, knowledge was holistic, so in order to understand even simple sentence from a foreign culture, you would have to understand everything about the culture. For example, if you visit a tribe, and they point out a rabbit and say "tzqqa", you might assume the word refers to the rabbit. But if the tribe believes in some sort of idealism, they might be referring to merely the representation of those sensations, or if the tribe only thinks of objects as what they aren't, they might be pointing out everything in the universe but the rabbit. This kind of questions are undecidable from the language alone, no matter how much you try.
I'm planning to spend the weekend climbing in the spectacular Acadia National Park–Hopefully I'll have a good story to tell when I get back (but not the broken bones kind of good). Until then, I've decided to write a retrospective post about a hike I did a few years ago in Colorado. I figured I should see if a post about a perfect hike has the same draw as my disastrous one through the 100 Mile Wilderness.
My summer in Colorado was coming to an end. With only a few days left in the state, I'd soon be leaving for grad school in North Carolina. It had been an unbelievable summer so far, spent exploring some of the most beautiful places I'd ever seen. In Colorado, you get views even from the highways that put the east's most stunning vistas to shame. But I had no idea my best adventure was yet to come.
It was a warm evening spent sitting on my porch swing with a cup of tea, savoring the summer air, reflecting on the wonderful last few months of my life. I was soon joined on the porch by my roommate Matt. I hadn't gotten to know him as well as I would have liked, but he had been the perfect roommate so far.
I had come to Colorado under strange circumstances. Reeling in the wake of devastating family tragedy, I decided I needed to escape Utica, the small, rusty, soul sucking city I had spent my entire life in. Three weeks after the idea to leave New York entered my head, I had quit my stable job, donated nearly everything I owned, packed everything I had left into my tiny Chevy Aveo, and was on my way alone to Denver. I knew no one there, but I had found three strangers in need of a roommate on Craigslist (a detail I conveniently left out when I explained my plan to my parents). I had talked to one of them on the phone, but that was all the assurance I had that they weren't crazy murderers or con-artists. I had no idea what the house was like, who the people were, or even if this place really existed, but it didn't matter. I was finally escaping. If it didn't work out there, I'd figure something else out.
Amazingly, it seemed the forces of the universe had conspired to make my great escape succeed beyond what I could have possibly hoped for. After a three day drive across the country, I arrived in Denver to find a room waiting for me in a beautiful house in a lovely part of town with three of the cooler people I've met. I was, at that point in my life, still incredibly, painfully shy, but they made me feel welcome. Some of the greatest hikes of my life were with my roommate Jeff and his girlfriend Liz, and some of my best evenings were spent sitting on the porch swing with Matt, talking about life, the universe, and everything.
But now, only four months later, after accidentally being accepted to the best graduate school for my program (which is a story for another day), I was moving on. Joining me on the porch, Matt began talking about all the things I would be missing out on by skipping town so soon.
“And you still haven't climbed Longs,” he said, referring to his favorite of Colorado's fourteeners.
“Maybe I still will,” I answered, but we both knew I wasn't going to do it by myself when I had so little time left in the area.
He offered to climb it with me, but we couldn't find a day when we would both be free.
“Unless you want to do it tomorrow,” he joked. It was already ten-o-clock at night. In order to get up the peak and back below tree line before the afternoon lightning storms rolled in, we would have to start hiking by about 4am. That meant leaving Denver by 2am. It wasn't really feasible. It looked like I wouldn't be climbing Longs after all.
A little while later, when Matt had already gone in and gotten into bed, it struck me that I was giving up an opportunity to do something amazing, just for a few more hours of sleep. A little nervously, I went in and tapped on Matt's bedroom door.
“Hey, would you really go tomorrow?” I asked.
He sighed and got back out of bed to start packing. We would be leaving in three hours.
Too excited to sleep, I researched a little about what I'd be climbing. The fifteen mile route up and down 5,000 vertical feet at high altitude was not going to be easy. I read this description from the National Park Service's website:
The Keyhole Route is not a hike. It is a climb that crosses enormous sheer vertical rock faces, often with falling rocks, requiring scrambling, where an unroped fall would likely be fatal. The route has narrow ledges, loose rock, and steep cliffs… Disregard for the mountain environment any time of year has meant danger, injury and even death.
I also read about a man who had been killed just two days before, when a gust of wind swept him off the mountain. I tried to reassure myself with math; the odds of two people dying on the same mountain within 48 hours of one another were extremely unlikely. Matt and I would be fine, right? I packed my gear and went to bed.
After about an hour of fitful sleep, it was time to leave. It was only two in the morning, but soon I would be embarking on the most difficult, dangerous hike of my life to that point.
The first two miles of our route meandered through forest, switch backing up a steady incline. We moved quietly through the dark trees, with only the feeble illumination of our headlamps to light the way. In my sleep deprived state it didn't feel real. After what seemed like only a short time, we broke through the tree line and continued on as the sun crested over the nearby peaks. While most people were still fast asleep, I was watching the sun rise, already miles into my day.
As we continued up a steady grade for the next few miles, the peak we were climbing came into view. Longs is definitely one of the most beautiful mountains to look at and, as we drew closer, instead of feeling intimidated, I felt empowered. Soon, if it let me, I would be standing at the top of that beautiful peak, looking down on the world.
The hike continued for a few more stunning miles until we reached the infamous Boulder Field. It looked as though a dump truck as big as the moon just backed up right there and spewed hundreds of thousands of giant boulders down the side of the mountain. We would have to scramble over those boulders to reach the area known as the Keyhole, the entrance to the next segment of our journey.
Matt hopped lightly from boulder to boulder, but with my shorter leg span and less sure-footedness, I struggled across them. He easily beat me to the top, but I made it eventually, pausing for a moment to rest before stepping through the Keyhole and onto the other side of the ridge.
What I saw when I passed through put the breathtaking views I had been enjoying all morning to shame. It was like stepping through a portal into another world. It was late July, but snow still adorned the peaks, the early morning sun lighting the stunning valleys below. Clouds hovered over the landscape in places, creating the illusion that we were looking out over the ocean. Pictures cannot begin to do this view justice, but I snapped a few anyway.
For a variety of reasons, the Keyhole is where the majority of people abandon their trek up the mountain. Sometimes strong winds or unexpected weather forces them to turn around rather than be swept of the treacherous crossing that follows. Other times, getting to this point has taken too long and they're forced to leave before the very predictable afternoon storm rolls in, putting them at a high risk of being struck by lightning. But often they've just underestimated the difficulty of the mountain, and they don't have the will to continue. Because now would begin the most difficult section of our journey. Only about a mile and a half remained to the summit, but the terrain wouldn't be easy. First, we were to cross what is known as the Ledges. Here we would need to carefully traverse a narrow ridge, sometimes barely a shoulder width wide, careful not to lose our footing and topple down the side of the mountain.
Before setting out from this point, we took stock of ourselves and the weather, making sure going on was the right decision. Physically, I thought I was still ok. It had been difficult to this point, but nothing I couldn't handle. The weather was the more pressing concern. Apart from the danger of lightning strikes, if a storm did start before we had time to reach the summit and return to this point, we'd be stuck going over terrain that was dangerous at any time and near impossible when wet. So far, we were only facing threat from a few innocent looking white, fluffy clouds. But in Colorado, clear blue skies could turn to violent storms in a matter of minutes. Still, we had been lucky with the weather to this point, and everything looked fine to proceed.
I spent the traverse trying hard to keep my eyes on my feet and their precarious placement, rather than the spectacular views. But soon, with the Ledges behind us, we reached the Trough, also known as the Bowling Alley. While climbing this very steep ascent over loose rock, hikers above would accidently kick down rocks on top of us, possibly leading to a fall that would likely be fatal. Climbing up this endless face was by far the most exhausting part of the hike. After only a few minutes of climbing, I was reduced to taking only two steps before pausing to regain my breath, then two more before stopping again. But somehow I pushed through, silently cursing Matt for making it look easy as he bounded up the mountain, seemingly without effort.
Now we came to the Narrows, an even more treacherous version of the Ledges. The path over this section was barely wide enough to cross, with sheer vertical drop-off to the right. One wrong step would almost certainly lead to death. Looking back on pictures of this traverse, I can see that it should have been terrifying. But at the time, it didn't feel like it. Maybe I was just detached from what I was doing: Between the lack of sleep and the high altitude, I was feeling a little like I was floating through a dream.
We saw some people wearing helmets and others even using ropes to traverse this section. Although these precautions didn't really seem necessary, it did serve to show how different this mountain was from anything else I had climbed to that point. It was just about as hard as a mountain could be before technical climbing skills became necessary.
Finally, we reached the last of our obstacles, the Homestretch: a 300 foot, class 3 slabs of sheer rock leading to the summit. Knowing how close the summit was only made finishing this section more difficult. Exhausted from the 7.5 miles of difficult hiking on so little sleep, and from struggling for breath at an elevation over 14,000 feet, every step up this steep climb required incredible effort.
But finally, we made it. The summit of Longs Peaks was under foot and I felt like I had conquered the world. I had done something only a small portion of even those few who attempt actually complete, something truly incredible. And it was only 9am.
But it wasn't just the mountain I had conquered. Four months ago, I had been a meek little girl sitting in an office, too afraid to step out of her comfort zone. But now, rather than taking the path of the least resistance, I had said goodbye to everything I knew and struck out on my own; I had arrived in a strange city alone with barely a plan and let it show me what it had to offer, take me wherever it wanted. And I had survived. I had done more than survive, I had thrived. And just like the mountain I now stood upon, it hadn't even been that hard. I had learned that I was capable of more than I could have imagined. If I could do this, if I could see a difficult path and embrace the challenge rather than turn around and give up, whether it be climbing Longs Peak or starting a new life in Colorado, if I could do those things, I could do anything.
Our hike was only half over, and we still had the long and difficult descent ahead of us, but I knew we would be fine. And soon I'd again be heading to a new town full of strangers, but I'd be fine there too. I had stood on my own version of the top of the earth, and now the rest of the world was mine to enjoy.
Here are some more photos from the trip. I strongly encourage you to Google your own, since mine were taken distractedly and with an inferior camera. The views on Longs are truly awe inspiring.

“Stuff wise, I think he was okay, but it wasn't anything special.”
I don't know what game A's designated hitter Josh Donaldson was watching, but it certainly couldn't have been the one Collin McHugh was.
The sequel to McHugh's first start in an Astros uniform was even better than anyone could have hoped. After shutting out the Mariners for 6.2 innings while striking out 12 five days ago, McHugh took the mound in Houston for the first time in his career and tossed another dandy: 8.2 IP, 2 H, ER, 3 BB, 7 SO on 114 pitches.
Carlos Corporan started in place of Jason Castro due to the lefthander on the mound for the A's.
“We used all his pitches – changeups, curveballs, cutters – up, down, changed eye levels,” Corporan said. “Everything. It was unbelievable. That was exciting.”
McHugh, who was claimed off of waivers from the Rockies this offseason, went 15.1 innings without allowing a run before a two-out single in the ninth snapped his streak. The 15.1 inning scoreless streak was the third longest in Astros history for a starting pitcher to begin a season.
Dexter Fowler, also acquired from Colorado, drove in the first run of the game in the bottom of the third inning with an RBI groundout plating Jonathan Villar.
A's starter Tommy Milone cruised right along with McHugh, matching zero for zero until trouble struck in the seventh inning. With two outs and runners on first and second, Milone left a change-up up in the zone for Villar, who grooved it into left-center for a two-run stand up triple to give the Astros a 3-0 lead.
A's manager Bob Melvin brought in reliever Dan Otero who promptly watched Jose Altuve deposit the first pitch he saw into the Crawford Boxes — his first home run of the year.
After 104 pitches, Bo Porter allowed McHugh to take the mound in the ninth inning looking for the shutout. After two flyouts, McHugh was one batter away from just the 19th one-hitter in Astros history. An 0-1 pitch from him was originally ruled a ball, but after a replay review, it was ruled that Brandon Moss was hit in the foot by the pitch. That snapped a streak of 19 consecutive batters sat down by McHugh.
Moss would then steal second and score on an Alberto Callaspo bloop single into left field. Porter made the call for LHP Raul Valdes to come in and get the final out.
Porter now has a decision to make come the next turn in the rotation. Before the game he said that Scott Feldman (elbow tendinits) will come off the 15-day DL as scheduled and start either Saturday or Sunday.
“I don't think he put us in a tough spot; I think he put himself in a really good spot,” Porter said. “Performance pretty much speaks for itself. This guy has earned the right to get the ball the next turn.”
Fowler, who struggled after being hospitalized earlier in the season, has now hit safely in eight straight games.
The win gives Houston a split of the series with Oakland after dropping the first two games before bouncing back to win 7-6 Saturday.
“It feels great,” McHugh said. “First of all, it feels good to get a win. Another one against the A's. They are a good team. To be able to take two from them, especially here at home to end the series. It builds momentum. It's huge.”
The Astros (9-17) continue this nine-game homestand Tuesday with the first of a 2-game series against the Washington Nationals.
Jose Vega was born in Puerto Rico and raised in a strict Pentecostal home. He and his family went to church three, sometimes four days a week. His family moved to Gainesville and at 17 years of age Vega told his pastor he was gay, a disclosure that resulted in five years of conversion therapy.
“Being gay would have never been accepted in my house. My family was very devout — we went to church three to four times a week,” Vega said. ”We didn't socialize outside of the church; that was it”
Conversion therapy, often called reparative therapy, is the attempt to “fix” someone's sexual orientation or gender identity through the use of a number of therapeutic methods. Many organizations, including the American Psychological Association have denounced the practice and many cities in South Florida and states across the US have banned licensed professionals from practicing the therapy on minors.
Those bans do not affect unlicensed and religious practitioners, however — leaving children in a situation like Vega's unprotected.
“I went to therapy from my church, [a ban] wouldn't have helped me,” Vega said. “I think conversion therapy is a very damaging practice but I feel that a lot of people don't understand what the practice is, how damaging it can be, and that it is happening here in Gainesville, right now.”
Vega spent his childhood in church and could never escape the homophobic sentiment. It was in his home and in all of his social circles. Being gay was a taboo in his congregation — in a religion that considers all sins as “equal,” homosexuality seemed to be especially unforgivable.
“I genuinely believed that God would be enough,” Vega said. “I hated being gay. They equated it to being alcoholic … as long as you weren't near or consume alcohol you're fine, it's a temptation. So as long as you never accept the fact that you're gay you'll be fine.”
Vega said he has put in hundreds of hours of praying, reading the bible, weekend retreats meant to cleanse him, and even multiple exorcism attempts.
After a mix of therapy from a religious therapist and a licensed professional — to whom he paid $100 an hour to “fix” him — Vega and his then-fiancè were finally assured that he was cured of his homosexuality. Vega was married for ten years and had two children before he finally came to terms with his sexuality and decided to come out of the closet.
“I just carried so much shame this entire life,” Vega said. “I'm not going to live like that anymore. How am I going to teach my kids to love themselves, to live their dreams, if I can't even love myself.”
For Vega, the song ‘Flawless' by Beyonce brought him to tears. “I woke up like this. This Jose is good enough, right now. It took me years to finally admit that. I looked myself in the mirror and said, ‘you don't have to change, you're good enough.'”
Rachel Needle, a licensed psychologist and member of the Palm Beach County Human Rights Council, said that conversion therapy can take a number of forms and has been found to lead to a number of damages in minors including depression, issues with intimacy, drug and alcohol abuse, and suicide.
“Any ethical mental health practitioner should not attempt to cure or repair gender identity or sexual orientation through these scientifically invalid techniques,” Needle said. “Attempting to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity can have a devastating impact on a minor.”
For Vega, finally coming out after years of therapy and marriage was not a switched that he just turned on. It has been an arduous process, one that he said has led him through the lowest points in his life.
“When I separated from my ex-wife I went through a huge depression,” He said. “I hated myself and was ashamed of who I was. I didn't feel worthy of love. If God can only love me if I changed, and I couldn't change, then God wouldn't love me.”
Vega continued, “It got to a point where I wanted to kill myself. The only reason, the only reason I did not commit suicide is because of my two kids. It was not fair to them.”
Vega is now working with community leaders in Gainesville to enact a ban on conversion therapy for minors in the city. He said that when he was 17 he was easily impressionable: when his pastor told him he could be cured of his homosexuality, he believed him. Now that he is in his 30's he said he would be much more skeptical.
But he doesn't believe a ban for licensed professionals is enough. When parents who truly believe that homosexuality or gender identity is an affliction that can be cured they will find someone who is offering a cure, even if they are initially turned down. Vega believes more should be done to educate the public, and more safe spaces need to be established for the kids who feel isolated.
“Parents want what is best for their kids, but they need to be aware of what these practices are having, what their implications are,” Vega said.
He continued, “The amount of conversion therapy going on around here would astound people. There are so many churches who do not accept that being gay is ok and they are constantly reasserting those negative messages. That in itself is a form of conversion therapy, constant exposure to those messages can have an effect on people.”
Vega, along with the Human Rights Council of North Central Florida and other community leaders, is working to enact the ban in Gainesville, and Vega is devoting himself to a platform of advocacy. He said that every day is a struggle for him, but each time he shares his story he feels freer — he is shedding light and exposing the lies he has been telling himself.
“In the beginning, I was reluctant to share, but at the end of the day that's the only way to bring change,” He said. “I hope this [ban] transcends into more than just minors in licensed offices. I went to therapy from my church, this wouldn't have helped me. But if we educate parents and the community on what this practice actually is, that is a conversation we need to have.”
Charles Krauthammer told Tucker Carlson that coverage of President Trump and Comey has "sen[t] people over the edge, to the point where they think there really are no journalistic limits or journalistic restraints."
Krauthammer advised the "overwhelmingly liberal" press to accept that Trump is president: "You got to accept it, stop whining about it because it's not going to change.
The trained psychiatrist theorized conservatives go and start a business while liberals get into social work and go into journalism.
"People seem to have a particular animus," the columnist said Thursday night. "I say that as somebody who wasn't a fan of the Trump, wasn't a supporter, but he's the president and he deserves some respect. If you're an American you want your country to succeed. And he's the president, constitutionally elected, and you want him to succeed."
Krauthammer said some of the press has been driven "off the edge" in their claim that there is a constitutional crisis:
KRAUTHAMMER: There is a particular edge to the [Comey] coverage... but for God's sake, it's not a constitutional crisis. [It] has sort of sent people over the edge to the point where they think there really are no journalistic limits or journalistic restraints, elementary ones like don't roll your eyes in the middle of an interview, ought to be observed.
The current guidance, the only official material teachers use to plan lessons on sex and relationships, was last published in 2000, practically predating the internet. The document has failed to be updated since, and ignores the rise of online porn, the pressure for young people to document their lives and relationships online, the growth of ‘sexting' and unregulated chat rooms.
In a letter to The Daily Telegraph , the 69 experts, including Reg Bailey, David Cameron's adviser on family issues and chief executive of The Mothers' Union, Chris Keates, the head of teaching union NASUWT, and Simon Blake, chief executive of Brook, the sexual health charity, said teachers lack the right tools to help young people navigate the distorted and inaccurate information they see about sex and relationships online.
“As a new term begins, we note that many schools are no better equipped to teach sex and relationships education (SRE) to a good standard than in previous years. Ofsted inspections have found that SRE needs improving in a third of schools. Schools have out-of-date guidance, which was published 13 years ago.”
Mr Bailey, who penned a government report about the commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood, described the current sex education guidance as being in the “dark ages”.
“Children are learning about sex and relationships from the internet, instead of from safe and reliable sources – which includes both teachers and parents,” he said.
“We need politicians to realise how important this update is, prioritise it and understand that children must be taught how to navigate this new digital landscape – while learning about loving relationships.”
The experts voiced concern that current SRE guidance predated a wave of equality laws which teach young people about non-violent, respectful relationships. “The Government SRE guidance is also behind the times on technology and safeguarding, with no reference to addressing on-line safety, 'sexting' or pornography in SRE,” they said.
Teachers felt “anxious” about which topics to include when teaching sex and relationships and would welcome an update to the guidance so they have a better steer on how to approach sensitive subjects with teenagers.
Research commissioned by Telegraph Wonder Women, carried out by the NSPCC, showed seven in 10 pupils think porn should be taught in sex education classes, while one in three pupils believe porn dictates how young people have to behave in a relationship. The NSPCC said girls were having to act "like porn stars" in order to be liked by boys.
The letter published in the Telegraph today, also signed by Jane Less, chair of the Sex Education Forum, Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Headteachers, and Hilary Emery, chief executive of the National Children's Bureau, comes as telegraph.co.uk launches a campaign for better sex education.
Yesterday children's charity NSPCC and Clare Perry MP, Mr Cameron's adviser on children, called on the Government to update the guidance to make it fit for purpose in the digital era.
The Government has said its ambition is for “all children and young people to receive good-quality SRE” but has not outlined how that will be achieved, the letter added.
“Parents want SRE to be taught in schools but need to know what to expect schools to teach their children at different ages. Teachers would welcome this too when planning the curriculum; they are often anxious about which topics they can include.”
In spite of this large support to update the sex education guidance, the Department for Education has not changed its position. A spokesman said: “Our recent PSHE review found that the existing guidance offers a sound framework for sex and relationship education in school.”
The telegraph.co.uk petition to improve better sex education had attracted over 10,000 signatures at the time of writing.
Telegraph Wonder Women is campaigning for better sex education, urging David Cameron to bring sex and relationships education into the 21st century. Sign our petition at change.org/bettersexeducation or email us at bettersexeducation@telegraph.co.uk. Follow the campaign on Twitter: #bettersexeducation, @TeleWonderWomen.

A Gold Dwarf fighter working to establish new Dwarven territories on the frontier. Fardar is a father of two sets of twin children that he left, along with his wife, in their great home city when he set out as an adventurer. He wouldn't have left them except for the overcrowding, but due to the rapidly growing Dwarf population some volunteer adventurers are necessary to expand their homeland. He hopes to someday be reunited with his family after helping to secure the borders and build a new colony. He carries a heavily engraved runic battle ax of fine craftsmanship and his body is similarly tattooed; he's depicted here setting out on a routine patrol where he'll first be expected to defend those working the nearby ore and lumber from potential attacks, and then rotate-in to do his share of the labor before retiring to the inner-camp.

Newsflash Hemingway & Fitzgerald & Kerouac fans: being a bloated alcoholic isn't as fun as you'd think (I mean, look at how those three wound up in the end, eh?). I should know: in the past two-ish years, I've lost seventy pounds, or roughly 9% the weight of Jonathan Franzen's ego. My secret (beyond not drinking like Grace Metalious)? Running.
Along with hitting the trails, I've been hitting the books. Books about running have increased in popularity since the publication of Christopher McDougall's Born to Run in 2009. Some are good, a few are great, many have covers that use Born To Run's color scheme of blue and yellow, and many are poorly written, as much fun to read as a sneaker manual… if sneakers came with manuals (PAGE 1: LACING).
Does running writing have to be uninteresting incantations of the pattern left foot, right foot, left again? Hells to the no. When done right, non-fiction about the act of bipedal locomotion can be engaging, enlightening, motivating, and enthralling.
Here are 5 non-fiction books that will keep you on your couch but also make you want to get up and run a 5k:
Meb For Mortals: How To Run, Think, and Eat Like a Champion Marathoner by Meb Keflezighi. Born in the African country of Eritrea (southeast of Sudan, north of Ethiopia), Meb became an American after his family escaped the 30-year Eritrean War for Independence. His first book, Run to Overcome, told his life story; this book is an instruction manual on how to kick ass (almost) as hard as he does. Go Youtube search “Meb Running”- it's not an exaggeration to say he runs beautifully.
Finding Ultra: Rejecting Middle Age, Becoming One of the World's Fittest Men, and Discovering Myself by Rich Roll. Many fat alcoholics choose to celebrate turning another year older by keeping up the steady march towards death. Rich Roll decided that sucked, so he got sober, became a vegan, and completed five Ironman-sized triathlons in Hawaii in a week. Dude has a body like Lady Cassandra wrapped around a Dyson vacuum cleaner, but moreover, he's got an interesting story to tell: how to go from a Raymond Carver character to a superman.
Running With the Kenyans: Passion, Adventure, and the Secrets of the Fastest People on Earth by Adharanand Finn. Finn wanted to know why Kenyans were such good runners, so he moved his family to the African Rift Valley. Part scientific analysis of the benefits of living at high elevation and running everywhere instead of motoring, part non-“cringey with colonialism in a good light gloss” travelogue from a European adapting to Africa, all in all a well-written story of a writer who takes his running obsession to a whole ‘nother level.
Running Like a Girl by Alexandra Heminsley. I spend too much time formulating running playlists, so it was encouraging to see I'm not alone in this procrastination. Most running books are written by elites (not a sociological slur in the running world, but a fact), so it's nice to read a book by a 5-ish hour marathon runner (the world record for women currently stands at 2 hours, 15 minutes). What matters with this book isn't the data, but the story. Heminsley uses the sport of left foot, right, left, to deal with being a thirty-something with a few issues to work out.
What I Talk About When I Talk About Running by Haruki Murakami. The grandaddy (despite being only 7 years old) of modern running books. Murakami makes running as magical as a sunset on Mars, as desirable to participate in as a lightsaber battle where everyone walks away happy and unharmed. Murakami proves Tolkein right in that not all who wander are lost: much of this book doesn't directly deal with running, but the emotional coloring that comes when you've gotten a few kilometers away from your beginning. “I'll be happy if running and I can grow old together,” Murakami writes at one point, and with how he writes, you can see Running waiting at the door for its pal Haruki to step away from the keyboard and go out for a few more miles.
Honorable mention I haven't read but I love the title: Never Wipe Your Ass With a Squirrel by Jason Robillard.

WINNIPEG – Justin Trudeau's news conference at a Winnipeg daycare was interrupted by a protester who called the prime minister a scumbag.
Staff from the Prime Minister's Office say the man gained entry to the event claiming to be a member of the “world alternative media.”
He carried a camcorder as he heckled Trudeau about the carbon tax while the prime minister answered other questions.
He also railed against what he called Trudeau's “globalist counterparts.”
Security eventually led the man out of the room without incident.
Trudeau was in Winnipeg to tout child-care investments his government announced in last week's budget.
“Shame on you and your globalist counterparts,” the man said as security kept a close eye on him. “You're scumbags. You are an absolute scumbag.”

A 54-year-old is expected to appear at Paisley Sheriff Court on Wednesday.
Neil Lennon: Police received complaints about Hibs manager's behaviour at Ibrox. SNS Group
A man has been arrested over alleged offensive and threatening comments made against Hibs manager Neil Lennon.
It follows an investigation into an online post made in the wake of Hibs' 3-2 victory over Rangers on Saturday.
Officers arrested a 54-year-old man over the alleged offensive comments on Tuesday.
He is expected to appear at Paisley Sheriff Court on Wednesday.
Earlier, Police Scotland confirmed they will take no action against Lennon following complaints over his behaviour during the match at Ibrox.
The Northern Irishman was criticised by some Rangers fans for what they perceived as "inflammatory" actions during the match.
Lennon appeared to cup his ears and make a gesture as he celebrated an early goal during his side's victory in Glasgow.
A force spokeswoman said: "Following complaints received, we have reviewed the events at the match and, after discussion with the procurator fiscal, established that no criminality took place. Therefore no further action will be taken."

“You slapped a fiiiish. Why would you do that?”
“I wanted some seafood.”
At nearly 16,000,000 views at the time of this writing, this “bad lip-synching” of Edward and Bella is objectively hilarious. Funny lip-synching videos litter the Internet, putting ridiculous words in the mouths of everyone from Mitt Romney to Bane. A shared love of making fun of people seems to dictate that these videos are funny, and that's that. But why? The best “bad lip-synchs” take advantage of how our brains process speech.
Not Just What We Hear
Speech recognition is a concatenation of many diverse internal pattern seeking programs, all looking for minute changes in everything from the tone and volume of speech to the physical motion of a person's mouth. So it's not just what you hear, but also what you see.
Even though speech is primarily auditory, we prioritize the kind of information we are getting depending on the context (both consciously and unconsciously). For example, during a particularly lengthy foreign film, we learn to ignore both the visual (i.e., the mouth movements) and the auditory aspect of speech to focus solely on the words on-screen. This isn't speech as we typically recognize it, but anyone who has suffered through a badly-dubbed film knows that the more difficult it is to link those words on screen to the person speaking, the more aware you become of your aching backside. Our brains seek to synch even disembodied words to their owners.
Likewise, imagine that you see a friend across the room at a crowded “End of the World” party. They are barely audible above the din of “Play Gangnam Style!” requests, so you focus intensely on their mouth movements. Add the minimal auditory input to the “enhanced” visual input, and you can just make out that they want another beer.
Because diminishing either what we see or what we hear during speech diminishes the whole, this points to the fact that speech perception is an aggregation of more than just one sense like hearing. It is multimodal.
But the interpretation of speech is not the only case where our brain crosses multiple wires, so to speak. The taste of something is another multimodal perception. For example, when water spouting from a bubbler with iron piping tastes like iron you are in reality smelling the iron, which is then combined in your brain into the “irony” taste of the water (as the tongue has no “iron” taste receptors).
As another example of how strong this connection can be, just think about eating a green French fry or yellow steak. Even if the food were perfectly normal, I'd bet you would hesitate to bite into it. Or consider the sad case of Crystal Pepsi. In 1992 Pepsi decided to change the color of their soda from brown to clear, while maintaining the same flavoring and ingredients. The sale of the soda plummeted. It was pulled from the shelves in 1993.
Just as what you smell and what you perceive on your tongue can together make up what we taste, what we see and what we hear when people are speaking combine to form our perception of what someone is saying.
The McGurk Effect
There is perhaps nothing that makes us question how we actually sense the world more than illusions. Not only do they amaze us, they offer clues into how the brain processes sensory information. One of the most common optical illusions, the “Necker Cube” is so mystifying with its shifting depths because our brains have competing 3D models of what the cube should look like. As it arbitrarily flips between them (somewhat driven by attention to certain details), our pattern-seeking minds reveal their software. There are also speech illusions.
The McGurk Effect is a phenomenon where the auditory component of one sound is combined with the visual component of a second sound, resulting in a perceived third sound. To do this illusion effectively, you need a dubbed video. In it you have a speaker mouth the syllables “va/va/va” while playing the sounds of “ba/ba/ba” over the video. What you see then overrides what you hear, changing the played sound of “ba/ba/ba” to “va/va/va” in your mind, even though the audio never changes. You can watch this BBC video if you want to have your mind sufficiently blown by this illusion. The really amazing part is that, during the illusion, if you close your eyes and therefore shut off the visual part of your speech recognition, the illusion immediately dissipates! (The video linked to above does a great job in pointing this out.) The on/off switch to this illusion couldn't make it any clearer: speech perception is much more than what we hear.
This of course brings us back to Twilight.
Making Fun of Sparkling, Pasty Vampires
To successfully mess with our speech perception, the words substituted in the “bad lip-synching” Twilight video need to have accompanying mouth movements that, when spoken, mimic the original lines in the movie. The humor then emerges from this tip-toeing on a tightrope of plausibility—a lip-synching that is close enough to confuse us yet far enough away from perfect is hilarious. It gets funnier as the words synch up with the mouth movements more squarely (and a good impression of each character helps, as in the case of this uncanny Bane impression). Combine all of this with the fact that you are watching Bella scold Edward for punching a fish and you get a viral video.
It's not that you are seeing incorrect speech in these videos; you are in fact seeing a different speech. Just as coloring a French fry green can make it taste repulsive, a vampire talking about eating cake with the seemingly correct mouth movements is LOL-inducing because we tentatively perceive it as the genuine article.
Watch one of the videos again and notice how you are inevitably drawn to studying the mouths of the speakers to see just how close the match is, to examine if it is “real.” Even when the synching is not perfect, because we are looking to be entertained, we give leeway to the inevitable shoehorning of ridiculous words and phrases into the video; the asinine become the authentic.
And when we don't have a mouth to examine, words can shape what we recognize as speech. Case in point, this video shows how easy (and hilarious) it is to mistake the classical composition “O Fortuna” for a song about men liking cheese. Combine both lip-synching and text put to what we hear, you get an elf who is sick of Barack Obama.
I think it all comes down to believability. Right off the bat we do not believe that Edward asked whether or not mice have “wee-wees.” But if the impression is decent, if the mouth movements synch-up, we suspend our disbelief and revel in a reality where teen-dream vampires ask such questions. Likewise, many of us know that most music videos are actually lip-synched, but we have gotten so good at synching them that nobody seems to mind. Bottom line for prospective video makers: take advantage of our multimodal speech perception well enough, and you can make a ventriloquists' dummy out of anyone.
A particularly tight synching garners the immediate “It looks like that is what they are actually saying!” response. In a way it is, and it's damn funny.
Further Watching: More “bad lip-synching” videos
José Mourinho turned on his Manchester United players after watching them go down to a shock 2-1 defeat at Huddersfield Town and said he could not remember another match since he joined the club where the attitude of his team had been so poor.
Huddersfield send Manchester United crashing to first Premier League defeat Read more
United's first league defeat of the season – and their first at Huddersfield since 1952 – leaves them five points behind Manchester City at the top of the Premier League and Mourinho was as critical of his players as at any time since taking over from Louis van Gaal.
“I don't even remember a friendly match where our attitude was so poor,” he said. “When I lose matches, I like to lose because the opponent was better and had more quality. But when you lose because of attitude, that is really bad. I heard Ander Herrera in his flash [television] interview saying the attitude and desire was poor. Oh my God, when a player says that, or a player feels that, I think they should all go to the press conference and explain why – because I cannot explain that. It concerns me because if it happened today why can't it happen tomorrow?”
A dismal afternoon for United was compounded by the first-half injury that forced off Phil Jones shortly before Aaron Mooy and Laurent Depoitre scored within five minutes of one another to give Huddersfield a 2-0 lead. Victor Lindelof, Jones's replacement, had a torrid game, badly at fault for the second goal, but Mourinho's anger was directed towards the entire team on a day when Juan Mata and Anthony Martial were both substituted at half-time.
“The mistakes – him [Lindelof] for the second goal and Mata for the first goal – are mistakes that belong in the context. If you play an amazing game and lose to an individual mistake, yes, you point the finger. But that was not the case here. In the first half I was waiting for it. It was Mata and Victor but it could have been another player because the attitude was really poor.
“I feel really disappointed and if I was a Manchester United supporter – not a manager but a traditional supporter – I would be really disappointed. You can play and lose a football match because the opponent had more quality than you. But you cannot lose because the opponent had a better attitude than you, so I am really disappointed.
“They [Huddersfield] played how I like. They played with everything they have, how I like, and like it has to be. They played with everything: aggression, desire, motivation, sacrifice. They played with everything and we didn't. So the team that deserved to win – simple.”
Marcus Rashford's 78th-minute goal set up a tense finish but Huddersfield's manager, David Wagner, agreed with Mourinho that it was a deserved victory, describing it as “one of the top three moments I have had, personally, as manager of this club”.
Wagner added: “This is a very proud moment. We all know how huge it is that we have beaten Man United. We have to make totally clear so everyone understands what is extraordinary and what is ordinary. Today was extraordinary. I live in Huddersfield so I know how huge this is for this town, the supporters, the chairman, the board. This is a very special moment.”
Former University of Nevada, Reno, president Joe Crowley died Tuesday after being hospitalized for pneumonia since early this month. He was 84-years-old.
Crowley served as president of UNR from 1978-2001, the longest tenure of any university president in the school's history. He briefly returned to the role as interim president in 2006 before leaving the post once more.
The Joe Crowley Student Union on the university's campus is named after the former president.
Crowley is survived by his wife, four children and seven grandchildren.
“I'm drinking gin and crying tonight,” his son Tim Crowley told the RGJ.
A full retrospective on the life and achievements of Joe Crowley will be published next week in The Nevada Sagebrush.

Ex-Blackhawks goalie Darling says former teammates convinced him Carolina was good fit
hello

When the Blackhawks traded Scott Darling to Carolina just over a week ago, there were plenty of pundits who thought the 28-year-old unrestricted free agent would hold out until July 1 rather than sign with the Hurricanes.
But once Darling spoke with former Hawks Bryan Bickell and Joakim Nordstrom, he knew he was heading east.
"They had nothing but great things to say about living there," Darling said Saturday, one day after signing a four-year, $16.6 million deal with Carolina. "It's a big commitment to hopefully be somewhere for four years. They said everything's first class, it's a great way of life and they love living in Carolina. So that kind of put my mind at ease."
Carolina general manager Ron Francis took a calculated risk when he gave the Hawks a third-round pick for the rights to negotiate with the 6-foot-6, 232-pound goaltender.
He felt it was one worth taking.
"I like the fact that he's big and he's competitive as hell," Francis said. "We feel that he's ready for that opportunity and we think he's capable of succeeding once he gets that chance.
"I'm glad that he saw it the way we did -- that this is a good fit for him and a good opportunity for him, and he was willing to jump on board (now) rather than wait until July 1."
Goalies Cam Ward ($3.1 million) and Eddie Lack ($3.0 million) are both under contract for one more season with the Hurricanes. Ward started 61 games last season and went 26-22-12 with a .905 save percentage and a 2.69 goals-against average.
The Hurricanes have missed the playoffs for eight straight seasons and finished in sixth, seventh or eighth (last) place in their division the past four seasons.
During his three years with the Hawks, Darling compiled a 39-17-9 record with a .923 save percentage and a 2.37 goals-against average in 75 games (64 starts).
However, Darling hasn't had more than 27 starts in a season. His longest stretches of consecutive starts were an 11-game run in the 2015-16 season and a 10-game run last season as Corey Crawford recovered from an appendectomy.
So what makes the Lemont native so confident he can succeed as a starter?
"I'm confident because I'm excited about it," Darling said. "I'm going to do everything in my power to learn how to be the best starter I can be. I have a good network of goalie friends. I'm going to be picking their brains and asking them for help."
Darling credits Crawford for helping him learn the mental side of the game and said he'll never forget his first game as a Hawk -- a 2-1 victory over Ottawa at the United Center in which he made 32 saves on Oct. 26, 2014.
"I'm so proud to have played for the Blackhawks," Darling said. "I've loved the team since I was a little kid. … For somebody like me it was such an honor, and I'm just thrilled that I got to experience it."
As for the Hawks, not one of their goalies behind Crawford has NHL experience. Their options for next year include 31-year-old journeyman Jeff Glass, 25-year-old Mac Carruth, and 29-year-old Lars Johansson. They may look to sign a veteran to an inexpensive deal in the off-season.

This is the story of how we are building Grid , the Guardian's new image management system, working very closely with our editorial colleagues and using a modern technology stack. Oh, and it's all Open Source.
For about a year, a small dedicated team has been building the Guardian's new image management service.
From the beginning, the vision was to provide a universal and fast experience accessing media that is well organised and using it in an affordable way to produce high-quality content.
To deliver it, the team relied on a pragmatic Agile approach, working directly with users to quickly develop a product that fits their needs and expectations. The new service is now integrated with our print workflow and used for almost half of the images published in our digital content.
It's called Grid and today we are open sourcing it.

Modern editorial tools
As the wider Editorial Tools teams worked on building a modern suite of editorial products, from content authoring and workflow management to editing of front and section pages, the need for a rich source of media became increasingly pressing.
Unfortunately, the incumbent system was nearing end-of-life, having been around for over 15 years. Old and crippled by a poor and incomplete API, the need for a replacement wasn't controversial.
We set out to buy a commercial image management system that met all our requirements:
Ingest and index all our images past, present and future
Very fast and powerful search
User upload, metadata editing, cropping, publishing of optimised assets
Rights management, historical usage records
Collaboration workflows
In-browser experience from anywhere
Integration with all our internal tools (Composer CMS, fronts editing tool, InDesign for print, etc)
Deployable to the AWS cloud
Build vs buy is often a difficult decision, and while there were systems that we could have bought in, they were typically expensive, a poor fit with our existing technology, or not yet shipping. On top of that, they would all have required various levels of customisations to fit our needs, at the risk of complicating future software upgrades.
When we spoke to our colleagues in other publishers, we found they had all encountered the same challenges.
Ultimately, we believe the quality of our editorial tools directly influences the journalism we are able to produce at the Guardian. Having a flexible solution completely tailored to our needs and which we can continue to build on was much more important to us than betting on a proven but more constrained off-the-shelf solution.
Collaborative development
The work started with a single developer working on a proof-of-concept for 4 months, at the end of which we had a basic but functional prototype, proving the feasibility of the project.
After a short period of due diligence and official project sign-off, the project was officially started. Over the last 11 months, the team has grown from 1 to 4 developers, along with a group product manager and a UX architect.
From the beginning, the philosophy of the team was to move fast and iterate quickly. The first images were used in production after less than 3 months, with usage steadily growing to around 45% of the images in our digital content today. It also provides most images for our front and section pages, as well as our membership site. And, last but not least, it's also used every day to put images into the newspaper.
It's worth noting that the migration has been on a purely voluntary basis: nobody was forced to move to the new system, users chose to adopt Grid on their own because it worked better for them.
We are closely tracking the rate of adoption using our KPI dashboard, with the goal to fully transition to Grid as the sole source of imagery for all Guardian products in the coming few months.

We attribute much of the success and speed of this project to the development methodology we adopted.
Borrowing both from the developer anarchy approach and previous experiments in development processes at the Guardian, all members of the Grid team work directly with users, picture and sub-editors, imaging and rights experts, as well as with the other teams consuming images.
Maintaining this constant dialogue allows us to form a clear sense of priorities: what are the main blockers, what is the next most important thing, how many people struggle with a feature, etc. By confronting the engineers with the reality of the problems, they are able to identify quick wins and, more generally, the technical opportunities to find the simplest solution.
By developing personal relationships with many of our users, rather than abstracting them away behind story cards and layers of management, we also get to empathise with their needs and frustrations. Conversely, users also learn about the human beings behind the products they use, which helps dispel resentment driven by management barrier (“they never do what we ask for”) and replace it with more polite and constructive conversations. In the best case, power users feel they are part of the development team – which they are.
Finally, this process empowers both developers and users to make a difference on a day-to-day basis. There is nothing more satisfying for everyone than being able to go back to a user within less than an hour to show her that her niggle has been fixed.
It's so fast – really makes a difference that it's so quick to search Joanna Ruck, picture editor on the news desk
One of the reason traditional management structures don't encourage such direct interactions is the fear that they would distract the team from working on the less obvious but more important challenges. We have found that having a clear product vision as well as committing to medium term high-level objectives and a longer term roadmap is enough to keep the work focused. They are also extremely valuable resources to share with users to help them put the product and their demands in perspective.
This way of working has proven very successful for us to deliver value quickly and at a very low expense.
Technical innovation
The architecture of Grid draws from the best practices developed by various teams across the department. We tried to stay pragmatic, by delivering value at the highest cost/benefit ratio, while also constantly allowing ourselves to experiment and innovate where we see an opportunity.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Architecture diagram of the services forming the Grid image system. Illustration: The Guardian
The overall system follows the principles of a microservice architecture, with server-side components written in Scala (Play framework) and communicating asynchronously via SNS/SQS as much as possible to improve the overall resilience to failures.
The fast search is built on top of an Elasticsearch cluster which indexes all the images and their metadata, while other AWS services are leveraged to store files (S3) and metadata edits (DynamoDB). Horizontal scaling enables us to comfortably support our archive of over 3 million images (8 TB), with around 20,000 new images ingested every day.
All our services are implemented as hypermedia APIs using our standard argo media-type. Relying on expressive REST APIs allows us to expose business logic, conditional actions (eg subject to permissions or business rules), and links to other resources declaratively in the API responses themselves, rather than hardcoding them in the clients (for more details, see my Hypermedia: APIs of the Web talk). The theseus JavaScript client library provides a simple interface for argo APIs.
The main user interface is implemented as an AngularJS application, written in ES 2015 (aka ES6) with the excellent JSPM/SystemJS combo as package manager and module loader. Some advanced UI features, such as the smooth infinite scrolling of search results, make heavy use of reactive programming (see Infinite Scrolling with Angular and RxJS).
We have found that these generic self-documenting APIs made integration by other teams very quick and easy. They also enabled us to externalise non-key features into separate small web applications. One example is the grid-inspector, a utilitarian metadata explorer, which we used as an opportunity to experiment with a new approach to build interactive applications using reactive programming and Virtual DOM (see The Reactive Loop).
And, like a lot of the software we develop, we have released it as Open Source. Openness is in line with the Scott Trust's values and we believe in giving back to the community we get so much from.
It's all there in the Grid project on GitHub, for you all to see and borrow from.
Don't like the movie shoot that has taken over your street, ma'am? Take a hike, ma'am, and don't come back until we leave. In a city brimming with abundance, one of the greatest gifts bestowed on the little people is film production. It puts Toronto on the map and adds pizzazz to our humdrum existence.
A cyclist rides past trucks for a movie shoot, parked in a cycling lane on Queens Quay, near Parliament St. We're often told that film production is good for the city, but when people are treated as interlopers in their own neighbourhood, the benefits are questionable. ( RENE JOHNSTON / TORONTO STAR FILE PHOTO )
Hey, you might just catch a glimpse of a B-list actor whose name is right there on the tip of your tongue. Or maybe recognize a Toronto street in the background while watching a late-night rerun. Those are the main benefits of film shoots to the hoi polloi. But Toronto's film office says they “add a sense of vitality, vibrancy and excitement to Toronto streets.” All that vibrancy may be lost on Karen Newton, who sent us a marvellous note outlining her encounter with a film crew on the Esplanade, which was filming on a nearby basketball court in her neighbourhood.
Article Continued Below
Newton walked to the TTC stop on Tuesday at the Esplanade and Hahn Pl. to catch a bus and took a seat inside the shelter. She says she was “accosted by a film person who told me, ‘Ma'am, you can't sit here. Ma'am, you have to stand at the side of the bus shelter.'” So she left the shelter and stood beside it, noting “there was no sign on the shelter saying we couldn't use it.” She also wondered why a fancy BMW was parked in front of the shelter, where it was in the path of oncoming traffic. Newton said she was soon approached by another “aggressive” film staffer, “who also could not say two words without ma'am-ing me. “He told me, ‘you can't stand there, ma'am.' He said ‘ma'am, the bus is not going to be stopping at that stop, ma'am.' “I told him the other person just told me to stand beside the bus shelter. He insisted I could not stand and wait there, ma'am. “At that same time, someone I know was going to cross the street to get to work. She's been doing that for years. He told her she cannot cross the street. She told him off and rightly so. They were not filming in the street.
“Then the ma'am-er asked where I was going. I asked him, who's asking? He then said, ‘ma'am can cross the street if ma'am wants to.' I told him I've felt free to cross the street my whole life, it has nothing to do with him. “He was angry and telling me I can't wait at the bus stop, even though I was hidden behind the shelter as I was told to. He said I have to walk halfway to Sherbourne,” to another TTC stop. “Stupidly, I believed him.”

Newton said she's been stewing about it ever since she returned home later and noticed that buses were indeed stopping at the TTC stop she was told she couldn't use. “Is it acceptable for film crews to block bus stops with cars for an entire day? I guarantee you they were not using that car for filming, just to block the stop. “And is it acceptable for them to tell us we can't sit in the bus shelter, then be told we can't use that shelter at all and have to find another one? We need to use the bus stop. We need to cross the street. We need to get to work.” STATUS: We passed along Newton's note to the city and got the following reply from spokesperson Shane Gerard: “The Toronto film office has been in contact with the production company to determine why this occurred and how it can be remedied for the future. The City of Toronto takes these concerns very seriously and immediately engages with production companies who have had concerns expressed by residents. We encourage people to notify us at 416-338-FILM (3456) or filmtoronto@toronto.ca with any individual or community concerns. The City also knows that improving production and community relations is an ongoing process, and this area has been identified in the City's five-point plan (http://ow.ly/8xoY3088p8D) for enhancing Toronto's screen-based infrastructure, customer service and labour force development that was endorsed by City Council in June 2016.” If you've had an experience — good or bad — with a film shoot, let us know about it. What's broken in your neighbourhood? Wherever you are in Greater Toronto, we want to know. Send an email to jlakey@thestar.ca . Report problems and follow us on Twitter @TOStarFixer.
ALLIES of global hacker group Anonymous have put on their masks and picked up litter in a Tokyo park as a protest against tough illegal download laws.
The 80-strong collective said yesterday's busy bee was a protest against Japan's tougher laws against illegal downloads.
In light rain, they took part in an "anonymous cleaning service" for one hour in a park and on pavements in the shopping and entertainment hub of Shibuya, a change from the group's trademark website attacks.
They were dressed in black and wore masks of Guy Fawkes, the central figure in England's 1605 Gunpowder Plot to blow up parliament, which have become a symbol of protests by the loosely linked alliance around the world.
Last month, Japan's parliament enacted new copyright laws that could mean jail for anyone illegally downloading copyrighted music and movies.
On June 26, websites of the Japanese finance ministry, the Supreme Court and other public offices were defaced or brought down after an Anonymous online statement denounced the new laws.
The statement claimed Japan's recording industry and other content providers were now pushing internet service providers to implement surveillance technology that will spy on every single Internet user in Japan.
The group, which assembled for the clean-up service in Tokyo, attributed the cyberattacks to other Anonymous elements around the world.
"We prefer constructive and productive solutions," the group said in a statement. "We want to make our fellow citizens aware of the problem with a productive message."
"In IRC (Internet relay chat), somebody proposed cleaning as a means of protest as we didn't want to follow the style of mass anti-nuclear rallies which are getting too much," said a spokesman for the assembly.
"I guess this is the first time that a Japanese-led Anonymous group stages an outside operation," said the man who said he works as an engineer in the computer industry.
"The cleaning service has amused overseas Anonymous allies as something unique to the Japanese," said another spokesman. "We want to continue stating our case on the net."

We've all heard the numbers quantifying the horror of Haiti's 2010 earthquake: more than 300,000 dead, a million left homeless. Now a report is calling those figures into question.
The unpublished survey, commissioned by the US Agency for International Development, puts the death toll between 46,000 and 85,000. It also says there are 375,000 people still living in tent camps, whereas the International Organization for Migration, which does a lot of work with the displaced in Haiti, says there's 680,000. The Haitian government is standing by the higher numbers. A State Department spokeswoman says the report still has some inconsistencies. USAID's Haiti mission director says the commission that did the report isn't really qualified to settle the dispute. When I was in Haiti the first time, I heard some local businessmen laughing about how there was no way the death toll and the homelessness rate could possibly be as high as their government was claiming.
Now, I loooove me some fact-checking, but I'm having trouble getting worked up about this dispute. I understand it's important for the sake of, like, history. Also, analysts say the lower numbers might affect the plan to pump billions of dollars into the country for aid and reconstruction. I think it's a game-changer when a report concludes that, say, the war in Iraq killed 100,000 Iraqis in the first 18 months, rather than a widely reported 19,000. But whether 400,000 Haitians are displaced instead of 800,000 doesn't really change the overall fuckedness of the situation for me in this case. Either way, huge pieces of the entire country still need to be rebuilt. Either way, lots and lots of promised help still hasn't arrived. And honestly those displacement camps are so impossibly awful that nine people still living in them a year and a half after the quake would be cause for concern. Whichever way the dispute settles, hopefully it won't further impede the abysmal progress in the country's reconstruction.
Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam wants her administration to embrace new technologies and to set up a training academy for the city's civil servants to keep up with the times.
On the second day of her two-day visit yesterday, Mrs Lam said she looks forward to more exchanges and collaboration with Singapore, her first overseas destination since taking office last month.
She said Hong Kong's 170,000 civil servants deserve a well- resourced training facility similar to Singapore's Civil Service College.
"I visited the Civil Service College five years ago. The reason why I came again is... to explore in Hong Kong a dedicated civil service academy or college in order to provide more training for our civil servants, especially in several areas such as leadership, public participation and also in terms of the application and use of technology," she told reporters.
Mrs Lam, who has nearly 37 years of experience in the civil service, was chief secretary, the city's No. 2 official, before she became Hong Kong's first female chief executive. Yesterday, she said she hoped the new training college would be set up within her five-year term of office, which is due to end in 2022.
She said the plan is still at "a very preliminary, conceptual stage", and that the Secretary for the Civil Service, Mr Law Chi Kong, will visit Singapore for more discussions.
During her meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean yesterday, they exchanged views on civil service training and reform, tertiary and vocational education, and research and development.
Mrs Lam, 60, also visited the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and GovTech Hive, an innovation lab for digital services under the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech).
Singapore and Hong Kong leaders reaffirm close ties between both cities
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam reaffirmed the close relations between Singapore and Hong Kong, and noted that the two cities share many similarities and challenges, Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. Mr Lee and Mrs Lam discussed deepening Singapore-Hong Kong and Asean-Hong Kong cooperation in wide-ranging areas, including trade and investment, finance, civil aviation, and exploring potential collaboration on the Belt and Road Initiative. They welcomed the conclusion of the Asean-Hong Kong Free Trade Agreement negotiations on Monday, and looked forward to its signing and early implementation. Mr Lee congratulated Mrs Lam on the 20th anniversary of the return of Hong Kong to the mainland this year, and noted that both sides have an interest in the success of "one country, two systems", said the statement. He hosted a dinner for Mrs Lam at the Istana last night. Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean hosted a lunch for her at the Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise in the National University of Singapore's University Town. Mrs Lam also called on Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong at the Istana yesterday. They discussed ways to enhance cooperation between the two cities, such as in transportation, civil aviation, culture, human resource development and civil service exchanges.
"I have picked these three points of visit because of my own vision for what I want to do back in Hong Kong," she told reporters.
At a briefing session held at GovTech Hive by Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information, and Education, and Mr Chan Cheow Hoe, deputy chief executive of Gov Tech, Mrs Lam was interested in finding out how data and technology can be used in the provision and delivery of public services, and how institutional inertia towards new technology can be overcome.
She was briefed on new initiatives such as the OneService app, which makes it easier for residents to report town council issues, and the Singapore Civil Defence Force's myResponder app. She said the Hong Kong government had found it hard to overcome difficulties it encountered in using new technologies and data-sharing to come up with solutions that benefit the people.
At a media doorstop afterwards, she made clear she was not criticising her civil service colleagues. But as it would be for "any institution that has been well-established for many years and doing things in the same manner for many years", it is not easy to think out of the box and to try new ways, she said.
"So we do need some sort of disruption... to stimulate my colleagues to really think in a more innovative way," she said. There needs to be "a wider application of technology" if Hong Kong wants to stay competitive and become a smart city, she added.
At the URA, Mrs Lam was briefed on Singapore's developmental plans for the second Central Business District in the Jurong Lake District. She left for Thailand last night.
In a Facebook post on Friday (July 4) morning, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the two leaders had a "good discussion" on co-operation in trade and investment and the Belt and Road Initiative, and also welcomed the free trade agreement between ASEAN and Hong Kong.
He also wrote: "On a lighter note, Mrs Lam recently started her Facebook Page so we got the chance to swap Facebook tips!"
Calley (Photo: John L. Russell / AP)
Lansing — Lt. Gov. Brian Calley's surprise decision to scrap thousands of signatures and restart his part-time legislature petition drive this week has frustrated the signature gatherers as well as critics who said he has unfairly pinned his own problems on the “Lansing establishment.”
Calley's Clean Michigan committee said Monday it has revised its petition seeking to make the state Legislature a part-time body, strengthening the language to protect against legal challenges but forcing it to toss out signatures it started collecting more than a month ago.
The move came two weeks after several young Republicans initially hired to be circulators complained they were abruptly fired.
The developments raise additional concerns about the viability of the petition drive and ability of Calley's group to collect the 315,000 valid signatures needed to get the measure on the 2018 ballot.
The unexpected reset prompted harsh criticism from some Republicans, including longtime campaign consultant Stu Sandler, who argued Calley has run the petition drive like a “clown car.”
“He's lashed out at people trying to help him and wasted a ton of resources and time in the process,” Sandler said. “It's a shame, because it's a good issue and a lot of people want to help him.”
Matthew Dobler of the Clean Michigan committee fired back, suggesting it is not surprising “that someone who is paid as a legislative consultant is opposed to cutting legislator pay.”
Sandler is a consultant for the campaign arm of state House Republicans, where House Speaker Tom Leonard, R-DeWitt, has endorsed the idea of a part-time legislature. Sandler also noted that Dobler asked him late last year about a job in the Legislature.
“The bottom line is these guys didn't do their homework at all,” Sandler said of Calley's group.
In announcing the petition drive reset, the second-term lieutenant governor and former state legislator told supporters the establishment is putting up “roadblocks” in an effort to maintain the status quo. Calley suggested changes were made after opponents tried to find “legal technicalities” with the petition.
Patrick Anderson, an East Lansing-based conservative consultant who had raised constitutional concerns over the petition language, called Calley's characterization “absurd.”
“This is a rich, rich irony that the state's second-highest elected official is calling a private citizen a member of the Lansing establishment,” Anderson said, noting he personally helped write language for the state's term-limits amendment and a separate law to repeal the Single Business Tax.
‘Norm did him (a) favor'
In a June 16 letter to the Michigan Bureau of Elections, Anderson warned that Calley's part-time proposal could weaken the constitutional power of the Legislature in at least two significant ways not mentioned in the petition, as required.
The petition would have nullified the ability of the Legislature to override a veto by the governor, said Anderson, founder of the Anderson Economic Group. He contends it also would have limited the constitutional option for the Legislature to adopt or reject bills sent to Lansing by petition drive.
Norm Shinkle, one of two Republicans on the Board of State Canvassers, had also voiced concerns about the petition language. Calley pulled his petition from the board on June 21, suggesting Shinkle had a potential conflict of interest because he did consult work for a group opposed to the part-time proposal.
Calley “owes Norm Shinkle an apology,” Sandler said, suggesting the canvasser had pointed out a “devastating constitutional flaw” in the proposal. “Norm did him an absolute favor.”
Anderson raised other issues in a June 8 letter addressed to “citizens interested in the integrity” of the state constitution.
“I think it was embarrassing but the right move to stop circulating a doomed petition,” he said Wednesday.
The revised petition would require the Legislature to adjourn each year by April 15 — as opposed to the original plan to limit the body to meeting 90 consecutive days — unless the governor called a special session. It specifies that nothing in the proposal would “diminish the legislature's power” under other sections of the constitution.
Committee attorney John Pirich said Monday he stands by the original petition language and called the revisions “clarifying and technical in nature.”
The new version, like the old, would roughly halve legislator pay by tying their compensation to the average earnings of Michigan teachers, pro-rated based on number of days served.
‘Caught me off-guard'
Norm Kammeraad, a conservative activist who organized the failed 2014 petition drive, said Wednesday he remains confident Calley's group will put the issue before voters in 2018 despite this week's setback.
“This time this thing is going to happen,” Kammeraad said. “They're going to actually get the signatures to file. Once that happens, there's going to be challenges coming all over Lansing from special interests. They're just making sure that once they do that, they are going to be able to survive those challenges.”
Kammeraad's group, which included former Republican National Committeeman Dave Agema, last month endorsed the petition drive.
But some activists argue Calley used the part-time Legislature issue to burnish his conservative credentials ahead of a possible run for governor, where he could face stiff competition in the 2018 GOP primary. He has supported a part-time legislature before.
Calley launched the petition drive May 30 on Mackinac Island after running a series of online ads that talked about himself, his family and his political accomplishments, fueling speculation he would announce a gubernatorial campaign.
Shelly Gregoire, who heads up the Young Americans for Liberty chapter at Kellogg Community College in Battle Creek, said she signed up as a paid circulator for the petition drive but quit after one week because she felt the effort was mostly about Calley.
She knew Calley would announce the effort when she joined him at Mackinac Island but said she did not know his name would be on their T-shirts, on their literature and in the questions they were supposed to ask voters, including which gubernatorial candidate they would support in 2018.
“It was something that really caught me off guard,” Gregoire said. “I'm not going to get data for a politician that I don't even want to get behind. It was offensive. It felt like we were lied to about the whole thing.”
Gregoire is now volunteering for the gubernatorial campaign of state Sen. Patrick Colbeck, R-Canton, but said she is “livid” that Calley scrapped signatures she and her friends had helped collect.
‘Sign the petition again'
James Millius, a member of Young Americans for Liberty at Hillsdale College, said he worked on the petition drive until late June, when he was offering advice to other circulators who had been fired in a mass purge. He estimates he had been collecting 30-40 signatures a day.
“I think it's kind of ridiculous that Calley or the campaign hadn't worked out all these kinks before starting the initiative,” Millius said. “… At the end of the day, I don't think this was about the initiative. I think it was just about testing the waters for Calley.”
Dobler said Wednesday the young people who worked on the campaign “had a vital role in spreading the message on the importance of a part-time legislature and the need to clean up Lansing.”
Clean Michigan is relaunching its petition drive with a combination of professional circulators, volunteers and grassroots activists, along with online and digital strategies to collect signatures, he said.
Restarting the petition drive will give the committee an “advantage” as it seeks to combat opposition arguments, Dobler added. The work of initial circulators “will ultimately prove very useful in allowing voters to have a say on this important reform.”
In his Monday email to Clean Michigan supporters, Calley thanked them for signing the petition.
“I know you put a lot of energy into collecting signatures and that effort has made a difference,” he wrote. “I'm asking you to sign the petition again, and have your friends and family sign it too.”

The food space experienced a monumental shift in 2016. This year, global market research firm, Mintel, identified plant-based meat and dairy products as one of the 12 key trends set to impact the global food and beverage market – oh, and did it ever. More individuals are growing aware of how our food choices impact the planet and their health and as a result, vegan food has seen a steady rise in popularity. In the past two years, we saw the plant-based food sector reach $3.5 billion with an 8.7 percent growth. Plant-based food is no longer part of a fringe food trend: it's here to stay.
2015 was a great year for plant-based food but if you ask us, 2016 topped that. Here are the greatest victories.

Yes, 2016 was the year that every dairy-free ice cream-lovin' individual's wildest dreams came true: Ben & Jerry's finally released vegan ice cream! While we've been treated to decadent (and dairy-free) ice cream through the likes of So Delicious, Coconut Bliss, Almond Dream, and more, let's face it: Ben & Jerry's does things with flavors like no other brand out there. It's no wonder why the ice cream giant wanted to hop aboard the dairy-free ice cream train: in 2016 the dairy-free ice cream market surged 43.7 percent to $75.2 million. It goes without saying that when the Vermont-based ice cream company announced that they were releasing a line of flavors made from almond milk, we were over the moon. 2016 officially made the days of wistfully staring at those pints of Chunky Monkey a thing of the past.
2. Hellmann's Makes Vegan Mayo

The story of Hellmann's making vegan mayo is an epic tale that will forever remain in the hearts and minds of all vegan mayonnaise enthusiasts. The drama all started a couple of years back when Unilever filed a lawsuit against Hampton Creek, the maker of Just Mayo, on the grounds that mayonnaise must contain eggs. It was very short-lived and they dropped the lawsuit soon after. Earlier this year, it was announced that Hellmann's very own vegan mayonnaise, Carefully Crafted Dressing and Sandwich Spread, would be hitting store shelves nationwide. Whether you're on Team Just Mayo or Team Carefully Crafted Dressing and Sandwich Spread, you can find both in stores like Walmart and Target, which is a true sign of the times. Plant-based food is here to stay.

3. Vegan Burgers Go Head-to-Head With Meat
We've been able to find veggie burgers in the frozen food aisle of just about any grocery store for years but, no burger could truly stand up to the taste, texture, and protein of a meat-based patty. 2016 changed that. Beyond Meat released the Beyond Burger, a soy-free, gluten-free burger that boasts a whopping 20 grams of protein per patty, changes from pink to brown like ground meat when cooked, and is even sold next to meat at the grocery store. 2016 also brought about the launch of the Impossible Burger, also known as “the burger that bleeds,” which, in its production, uses 99 percent less land, 85 percent less water, and emits 89 percent fewer greenhouse gasses than traditional beef production. Veggie burgers aren't just for vegans or vegetarians anymore, even meat-eaters want a taste.

4. Plant-Based Milks Take Over the Dairy Aisle

In the past five years, we saw a 250 percent surge in the popularity of almond milk, adding up to $894.6 million in sales. In contrast, the dairy industry fell by seven percent in the past year. So that explains why dairy giants like WhiteWave Foods acquired So Delicious, a maker of dairy-free milks, ice creams, and yogurts. This isn't all so recent — since the mid-1970s, the dairy industry has been steadily declining by 25 percent per capita — but now, dairy is starting to feel threatened to the point of trying to argue that plant-based milks cannot legally be sold as “milk.” What is new is the amount of options now readily available to use in practically any grocery store. It's no longer a choice between soy milk or almond milk from a couple of different brands. Now, many grocery stores carry their own generic brand of plant-based milks along with a wealth of other brands carrying everything from macadamia milk to milk made from pea protein.
5. Meat Industry Embraces Plant Protein
Beyond Meat
We've seen dairy companies like WhiteWave Foods buy plant-based products, but one thing that none of us would have guessed that Tyson Foods, the world's largest producer of meat, announced their plans to invest in Beyond Meat. Not long after that, they pulled another curveball when they revealed that in addition to their investments in Beyond Meat, they would be launching Tyson New Ventures LLC, a $150 million venture capital fund to “complement its existing investments and [will] focus on companies that are developing ‘breakthrough' technology and business models.” It's clear that Tyson knows that the future of protein is plant-based.

6. Veggie Grill Announces Nationwide Expansion
Veggie Grill
If you haven't heard of Veggie Grill, it's is an all-vegan chain that specializes in providing healthy fast-casual food to hungry customers — most of whom do not identify as vegetarian or vegan. The “Fork & Knife BBQ Mushroom Sandwich” you see above is just one of its many drool-worthy creations. Sadly, it's based on the West Coast … but not for very much longer. Thanks to its loyal customer base, this chain received a total of $22 million from its investors for a nationwide expansion. Due to various concerns over sustainability, health, and animal welfare, one-third of Americans identify as flexitarian (choosing to leave meat and dairy off their plates more frequently) and one in ten millennials identify as vegetarian or vegan, so no wonder this plant-based chain has gained so much traction. We certainly can't wait to have Veggie Grill right around the corner.
We'd love to hear which of these big food wins you were most excited about. Tell us all about it in the comments!

Drug counsellor jailed for marijuana crop
Posted
A public servant who worked with ACT Health's alcohol and drugs services has been sentenced to two-and-a-half years jail for growing marijuana.
Mark Vincent Blattman, 51, was arrested in June after police found 75 marijuana plants on his property in Sutton, north-east of the ACT.
Police say the plants were valued at $150,000.
Blattman pleaded guilty to cultivation of cannabis and other charges.
He told the Queanbeyan District Court he grew the plants to help his wife who suffers from chronic migraines.
Blattman worked as a drug and alcohol counsellor with ACT Health before his arrest.
Today District Court Judge James Bennett SC sentenced Blattman to two-and-a-half years' jail, with eligibility for release in June next year.

This morning, TV Line reports that, during a conference call with reporters, Fox CEO and chairman Dana Walden said that she believes that Gillian Anderson, David Duchovny, and creator Chris Carter are “on board” for The X-Files Season 11. She made it clear that there have been conversations with all three of them and the tone was seemingly positive, if far from conclusive.
This is one of those good news-bad news situations. Since the shoe premiered in the 1990s, I've been a die-hard fan of The X-Files, the type who will put on any episode of the series' first five seasons at any given moment, even if its just background noise. I'm not enthralled by seasons six through nine but there are enough gems hidden throughout the detritus for me to give them a pass on the whole. I cannot, however, forgive the tenth season of the show. It's just not in me, folks, and though there are some moments, even full episodes, that I didn't hate, the overall feeling was that of one of those bad remakes that tries to be hip and modern while attempting to recapture the essential charms of the original.
In other words, it was like watching the Rollerball remake, except somehow even more disappointing because of my history with the series. That being said, I can't help but be excited for another season. I'm hoping that Carter will stop writing and directing episodes and continue on strictly as a producer with this next batch, as his involvement felt like the most toxic element of the noxious 10th season. The episode where Mulder takes psychotropic mushrooms and talks about “mother love” alone made me want to burn my “I Want to Believe” poster, which, yes, I still have. If the next season can once again find the mystery, strangeness, and essential wonder of the show, I'm all in, but if they're going to be hunting terrorists and working with Alex Jones level conspiracy nuts, count me out.
Israeli press reported this evening that French gunman Mohamed Merah had been on a trip to Israel in the past.
According to the report, Merah's passport had Israeli stamps in it. The purpose of his visit is unknown. Israeli analysts suspect he was either trying to visit the Palestinian territories or preparing for a terror attack.
However, I won't rule out the possibility that Merah was actually trained by Israeli forces. Marah may have conducted a false flag operation. By way of deception is, after all, the Mossad's motto.
Read the story of Naeim Giladi, an Israeli agent operating in Iraq in the late 1940's.
“On May 10, at 3 a.m., a grenade was tossed in the direction of the display window of the Jewish-owned Beit-Lawi Automobile Company, destroying part of the building. No casualties were reported.
On June 3, 1950, another grenade was tossed from a speeding car in the El-Batawin area of Baghdad where most rich Jews and middle class Iraqis lived. No one was hurt, but following the explosion Zionist activists sent telegrams to Israel requesting that the quota for immigration from Iraq be increased.
On June 5, at 2:30 a.m., a bomb exploded next to the Jewish-owned Stanley Shashua building on El-Rashid street, resulting in property damage but no casualties.
On January 14, 1951, at 7 p.m., a grenade was thrown at a group of Jews outside the Masouda Shem-Tov Synagogue. The explosive struck a high-voltage cable, electrocuting three Jews, one a young boy, Itzhak Elmacher, and wounding over 30 others. Following the attack, the exodus of Jews jumped to between 600-700 per day.
Zionist propagandists still maintain that the bombs in Iraq were set off by anti-Jewish Iraqis who wanted Jews out of their country. The terrible truth is that the grenades that killed and maimed Iraqi Jews and damaged their property were thrown by Zionist Jews.”

After Jonathan Edward "Ed" Browning had his 1929 rifle dropped form US military testing, he took the design back to his shop in Utah and kept working on it. By 1938 he had made enough improvements that he was ready to present the gun to Winchester, hoping they would be interested in purchasing the design. Specifically, he redesigned the receiver to move much of the bolt travel into the wrist of the stock, shortening the action. He also replaced the short recoil action with an annular gas piston. He made two sample rifles, one in military configuration and one in sporting configuration.
Winchester was looking for a self-loading rifle to market at the time, because they could see that war in Europe appeared to be imminent. They had been caught without a military rifle of their own during World War One, and did not want to be in that situation again. They thought that Ed Browning's design showed merit, so they agreed to purchase it, and brought Browning onboard to help continue development.
With Winchester's resources, it was possible to make the guns more professionally. Winchester designated the rifle the G30, and we have one of the examples made by Winchester in the video as well.
The tilting bolt mechanism took inspiration from John Moses Browning's 1911 pistol, and the trigger housing bears an interesting resemblance to that of the French Berthier rifles (which may or may not be coincidental). The rifles appear to have worked reasonably well, although the annular gas piston was a hindrance which Browning apparently was unwilling to abandon. With his death in 1939, the project moved on to a new phase with David Marshall Williams taking on the job of improving it.
Supertyphoon Haiyan may have killed as many as 10,000 people in the central Philippines. A storm of near strength, Cyclone Phailin, hit India's east coast last month and was expected to cause massive death and destruction. It didn't. About 50 people died, and while nearly a quarter-million houses and over 860,000 hectares of cropland were destroyed, the damage amounted to about $150 million. Yet, in 1999, a cyclone that struck the same region resulted in more than 10,000 deaths and almost $4.5 billion in damage.
India's Phailin experience may not be fully relevant to the Philippines — Haiyan was bigger and created an unanticipated, deadly 6-m storm surge that acted like a killer tsunami, and the central Philippines was still recovering from an earlier 7.2-magnitude earthquake. But, in preparing for Phailin, the Indian authorities did what they hadn't before. They evacuated nearly a million people, some forcefully, to hundreds of new cyclone shelters and some 10,000 sturdy schools and government buildings. Disaster-management personnel were deployed by the hundreds, and the armed forces were put on standby, as were more than 40 aid agencies and charities to help with postdisaster relief. All major officials in the relevant districts were provided with satellite phones to prevent a breakdown in communications.
At the local level, officials in the coastal states of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, which were in Phailin's path, combined with NGOs to conduct drills for residents to lock up homes, herd cattle to safe places, and carry important documents and sufficient clothing to shelters when disaster alerts were issued. India has also invested in technology — satellites and Doppler radar — to provide early warning. Shelters were built and food and water stored five days ahead of Phailin's landfall. “Satellite applications combined with good governance can be a very powerful cocktail,” says Susmita Mohanty, CEO of Indian aerospace company Earth2Orbit.
The World Bank praised India for how it dealt with Phailin and the lessons the country has learned from past natural disasters. “Successfully evacuating a million people is not a small task,” it noted in a report. “This has taken years of planning, construction of disaster risk mitigation infrastructure, setting up of evacuation protocols, identification of potential safe buildings to house communities and most importantly, working with communities and community-based local organizations in setting up volunteer teams and local champions who all knew exactly what needed to be done.”
While netizens and League of Legends (LoL) players wonder why an anime of the game has not been made due to the quality of a recently released animation short, Tencent, the owner of Riot Games (makers of LoL), is planning an anime about pro gaming.
The anime will be based on a Chinese internet novel “The King's Avatar,” which follows the story of professional gamer Ye Xui as he reenters the game “Glory” and fights to the top of the leaderboards.

The overall aesthetics of the PV is reminiscent of the style employed by Japanese animation studio ufotable, whose notable works include Kara no Kyoukai as well as Fate/Zero and Fate/Unlimited Blade Works. If the quality of the PV is any indicator, anime lovers may want to check it out.
The show also tackles a less tapped genre which is professional gaming as opposed to the overly used tropes of people being magically transported to a virtual gaming world.

Two teen boys in rural Tennessee are dead after apparently drinking a blend of racing fuel and Mountain Dew last week—something others have since admitted to drinking as well.
Logan Stephenson, 16, was pronounced dead at his home in Greenbrier on Thursday morning, and the police chief tells WZTV that others told him "the color of his skin had changed and he started having a seizure. His hands started drawing up." Logan's best friend, JD Byram, was rushed to a nearby medical center in a coma, and died Monday afternoon.
"Our hearts are heavy today as we have learned that a second young man has died from the incident last week," says the Robertson County sheriff, per WATE.
"We ask that everyone continue to pray for both of these families as they go through this tragic time." A friend of the family has set up a GoFundMe page with a $10,000 target, to be donated to Greenbrier High School for an alcohol and drug abuse program.
The police chief says two other boys have now come forward admitting to having consumed the same toxic blend; they were treated at the emergency room and released.
"Ask your children," he says in a plea for more information. "Get them to be open and honest with you. Nobody is going to be in any trouble." Candles and roses now fill the parking space where Logan, who'd recently gotten his license, parked at school.
(This teen died on his first day at work.)

We all know Hull's Spiders nightclub is a Hull institution. Down the years, it has helped shape generations of people from the city.
For many, it hosted their rites of passage moment, visiting a club for the first time and, for the students who have come to Hull, from far and wide, it holds a special place in their hearts – even after they leave.
When I told my former editor in Bristol that I was moving to Hull, he said ‘well, you'll be in Spiders most weeks'.
And, belatedly, last weekend I paid my first visit to the iconic venue with my colleagues from the Mail. I'll admit, my memory of the night is a little sketchy, so I've requested the newsroom's help to produce a guide to surviving Spiders - and the things you'll always notice at the awesome club.
The Spiders checklist
So, these are the things you'll encounter at Spiders which have become the norm over the last few decades:
1. Let's get this out the way from the off: You will get lost in there, it is as simple as that – just embrace it.
2. There's no point trying to ring your friends as the phone signal is non-existent. Just head to the bar.
3. There's some weird and wonderful concoctions at the bar. Make sure you know which drinks to go for though – an Pangalatic Gargle Blaster will not be your friend the following day.
4. Every weekend is Halloween and you'll see some very gothic outfits. There will always be some outrageous ones too. Anything goes. From a woman wearing just a top and thong to a man in a bustier, you really can wear whatever you like.
5. You might get told to ‘f*** off' by the DJ if you're in there looking for cheesy pop music.
6. But there's music for everyone. Yes, some rooms might be a bit too rocky for some tastes but, don't despair, you'll soon stumble across indie and Motown elsewhere.
7. This will lead you to scream ‘Oh my god I love this song' frequently.
8. Those who have been more often than you truly insist you'll form friendships with strangers you'll only ever see in Spiders. And they will last for years.
9. They will be saved in your phone as ‘someone from Spiders'.
10. Again, one of the regulars assures me this is the case: Spotting that one guy who is there in a PVC thong every single week.
11. Trying to write down your requests for the upstairs DJ and instead just writing an inane squiggle that will never be legible.
12. But you'll later tell your friends, during a random song, ‘I requested this'.

13. You'll have passive aggressive battles with your friends and strangers as to who can remember the most lyrics to Bloodhound Gang when The Bad Touch comes on.
14. Getting the bus home when you're worse for wear is a horrible experience. So, book a taxi in advance - it makes a lot more sense.
15. But before you go, make sure to grab some cheesy chips from the takeaway van. They even take card payments these days – dreamland!
16. Have a recovery plan in place for Sunday morning. Parcetamol, a Maccies breakfast and a duvet day watching films.
17. Once you've made your first trip, you are sure to be hooked and you'll discover their Halloween is something to savour.
Spiders nightclub opens every Saturday from 9.30pm until the early hours of Sunday morning.
• France Under-21 winger arrived on Tyneside on Tuesday • Rémy Cabella set to join Marseille on loan as part of the deal
Florian Thauvin's move to Newcastle has moved a step closer after the France Under-21 winger arrived on Tyneside on Tuesday evening.
The 22-year-old is set for a medical on Wednesday in readiness a £12m move for Marseille, with Rémy Cabella likely to move the other way as part of the deal. Cabella, who only moved to Newcastle last summer on a six-year deal, is already in Marseille and was reported to have passed his medical before a season-long loan with a view to permanent transfer.
Thauvin has been reluctant to leave the Stade Vélodrome but has apparently been unsettled by the coach Marcelo Bielsa's departure.
In a way or another, pretty much everyone has used Bootstrap at least once. Millions of websites, prototypes, and themes for well-known CMSs (such as WordPress) are based on Bootstrap. The framework is simple to install, easy to use, and incredibly time-saving. It's built on high quality HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows you to create good-looking designs with a minimal effort.
Thanks to CSS media queries, it efficiently scales websites and applications with a single code base, ensuring a pleasant users' experience regardless of the device they are using (phones, tablets or laptops). It features components that can be easily implemented: modals, galleries, tooltips, collapsible tab systems, dropdown menus, buttons, and much more.
The goal of this article is to describe and demo what's coming in Bootstrap 4. Being still in an alpha release, Bootstrap 4 is obviously incomplete and not completely stable. In addition, some features might change, so it shouldn't be used in production yet. However, a detailed description of the improvements made until now will help you have a good idea of the new cool things the framework will include and you'll be able to employ in your future works.
Before I start introducing the new features of Bootstrap 4, let's have a quick recap of the latest updates.
A brief recent history of Bootstrap
On the 19th of August 2015, on the occasion of Bootstrap's fourth birthday and after a year of development, the dev team has delivered the first alpha release of Bootstrap 4. The most important change compared to Bootstrap 3 was the definitive dropping of Internet Explorer 8 and the subsequent possibility of using better CSS3 techniques without being forced to rely on CSS hacks or fallbacks.
Since then, four minor releases have followed: Bootstrap 4 alpha 2 on the 8th of December, 2015, Bootstrap 4 alpha 3 on the 27th of July, 2016, and Bootstrap 4 alpha 4 on the 19th of October, 2016. The current stable version (Bootstrap 3.3.7) was officially released on July 25th, 2016.
Thanks to these updates (and to the surprising help of Bootstrap's huge community), hundreds of improvements, bug fixes, and documentation enhancements have been proposed and included.
What's new in Bootstrap 4?
Bootstrap 4 is built on these standards: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and Sass. During recent years, front-end developers have shown a preference for Sass instead of Less, widely adopting it in their projects. In all the previously released versions, Bootstrap used Less than its preprocessor.
As of version 3, a Sass port of Bootstrap was created and maintained. Bootstrap 4 now uses it by default and uses Libsass, a C/C++ implementation of a Sass compiler, to compile really fast. If you are curious and want to know something more about the "competition" between Less and Sass and explore the reasons behind the dev team's recent choice of changing the codebase, I suggest you to have a look at the opinion article titled "Why Bootstrap 4 Means Sass Has Won" by Ed Charbeneau.
Now, let's find out what Bootstrap 4 has to offer.
Cards
The .panel , thumbnail , and .well classes have been replaced by .card in Bootstrap 4. Modifier classes for cards offer similar functionality to those components. A card is:
A flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options.
Cards can be singular, grouped together or having equal height. To give you a better idea of how card s will replace the components mentioned before, I have set up an example that demonstrates the same visual component created using thumbnail for Bootstrap 3 and card for Bootstrap 4.
The code developed using Bootstrap 3 is shown below:
<div class="thumbnail"> <img src="https://placehold.it/350x150" alt=""> <div class="caption"> <h3>Bootstrap 4</h3> <p>The new version of Bootstrap is incredible. You should definitely try it!</p> <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary" role="button">Download</a> </div> </div>
This results in:
The code created with Bootstrap 4 is the following:
<div class="card"> <img class="card-img-top" src="https://placehold.it/350x150" alt=""> <div class="card-block"> <h3 class="card-title">Bootstrap 4</h3> <p class="card-text">The new version of Bootstrap is incredible. You should definitely try it!</p> <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary" role="button">Download</a> </div> </div>
The Bootstrap 4 code will result in:
As you can see, the markup to achieve the result wanted is almost identical. The card component requires the use of a couple of additional classes but this is due to its flexibility. Moreover, as you can see from the screenshots, in Bootstrap 3 the image is centered by default.
New buttons style
Buttons have a brand-new style. They definitely went "flat" and removed gradients. Moreover, .btn-outline-* classes have been introduced.
You can see how their look has changed over time and spot the differences in the example below. Given the following HTML:
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button> <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-primary">Primary</button> <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary btn-lg">Large button</button> <a href="#" class="btn btn-secondary btn-lg active" role="button" aria-pressed="true">Link</a> <button type="button" class="btn btn-lg btn-primary" disabled>Primary button</button>
This is how the buttons look in Bootstrap 3:
And this is their new look in Bootstrap 4:
Changes in typography
In Bootstrap 4, 16px is the new default font size (it was 14px previously), which means that the size of the text is bigger and more visible.
Moreover, in this new version everything is intended to be more dynamic thanks to an important enhancement: the font sizing and the grid system are now based on rem s. Be aware that, if you prefer, you can still use pixels, ems, or points for typography. However, Bootstrap 4 font sizing is completely based on the rem unit and the reason behind this change is rem s make easier for mobile devices to scale up or down.
And talking about fonts, it's important to remember that Bootstrap 4 drops the Glyphicons icon font. If you need icons, the dev team suggests the following options:
The upstream version of Glyphicons
Octicons
Font Awesome
The use of rem s applies to the grid system as well, that now has max-width set in rem s.
Display headings
The use of rem s has been employed also to introduce a new typographic component: display heading. Bootstrap 3 already supported classes like h1 , h2 , and so on to display elements as if they were headings. Bootstrap 4 increases the possibility for developers by implementing this new component, which should be used when you need a heading to stand out of the page.
Bootstrap 4 supports four different sizes for display heading (class display-* ). The following example shows how to use them:
<h1 class="display-1">Heading 1</h1> <h1 class="display-2">Heading 2</h1> <h1 class="display-3">Heading 3</h1> <h1 class="display-4">Heading 4</h1>
This is how they look:
Flexbox
One of the greatest innovations in this version of Bootstrap is the support for Flexbox, which provides simpler and more flexible layout options in CSS. As stated in Bootstrap's official guide,
More specifically, [Flexbox] provides: Easy vertical alignment of content within a parent element.
Easy reordering of content across devices and screen resolutions with the help of media queries.
Easy CSS-only equal height columns for your grid-based layouts. All these things are possible outside flexbox, but typically require extra hacks and workarounds to do right.
If you want to know more about this topic and activate it within your Bootstrap grid components, I suggest you to read the article "Using Bootstrap 4 Flexbox".
Other changes
New Spacing Utility Classes have been introduced, allowing you to have better control of horizontal and vertical space. You can now add some space in any direction using a utility class (with margins or paddings).
The code is simple:
<div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-6 m-t-md"> <!-- column-small-50%, margin-top-medium --> </div> </div>
Everything is extremely intuitive: m stands for margin, p for padding. In regards to directions: t is for top, r for right, l for left, x for left and right, y for top and bottom and a for all. Finally, for sizes: 0 is for zero, auto for auto, md for medium and lg for large. Leave blank for default.
As a side note, it's worth mentioning that every plugin has been rewritten in ES6 to take advantage of the newest JavaScript enhancements and all the documentation has been recompiled in Markdown.

What's changed in Bootstrap 4 as compared to Bootstrap 3?
Among the components that were already in action in Bootstrap 3 but have relevant edits in version 4, I want to mention two important changes. Firstly, a new grid breakpoint with the col-xl-* classes has been introduced. The 4 tier grid system Bootstrap 3 was based on has turned into being a 5 tier grid system including a new breakpoint to support all typical portrait and landscape screen widths.
Now the 5 tiers are:
Extra-small ( <544 px ) Small ( ≥544 px ) Medium ( ≥768 px ) Large ( ≥992 px ) Extra-large ( ≥1200 px )
The XL breakpoint is for >1200px screen widths, while the XS breakpoint allows us to target screens smaller than 544px, providing better support for typical smaller device widths.
The col-xs-* tier in version 3 supported screen widths under 768px, while the new tier supports screen widths under 544px. As a consequence, this change improves support for portrait views on mobile devices (smartphones).
Secondly, Bootstrap 3 does not support custom forms, which have been introduced in version 4. These are completely customizable elements that replace the browser defaults. The same applies to inverse tables that have been added in Bootstrap 4 after the introduction of .table-inverse class . This CodePen example shows how you can implement this new feature.
This should give you enough insights about the differences between version 3 and 4 but if you want to know literally everything, I suggest this detailed list. Keep in mind that this list will be reviewed as development progresses.
Conclusion
This article was aimed at doing a quick overview of what's new in Bootstrap 4 and what will change with the official passage from version 3 to version 4. It is not meant to be all-encompassing, and the best advice if you want to know more about Bootstrap 4 is to read the documentation available on the official website carefully and follow the complete Bootstrap 4 Migration Guide for the latest changes.
The release date for Bootstrap 4 is currently unknown but if you want to have a more detailed idea of the other features the working group will focus its attention onto and see how their work-in-progress is going, you can take a look at the GitHub page of the project. Feel free to join the community if you want to help! The dev team has an ambitious development plan and a long list of to-dos, so I'm sure that your collaboration would be appreciated.

Kreshnik B., who is Muslim, happily wore the blue jersey of the team, despite it being decorated with Hebraic lettering and the Star of David. "He was proud to take the field with the star," club leader Alon Meyer recalls.
Not even three years after playing for the team, Kreshnik swapped the football field for the battlefield. In the name of Allah, he allegedly joined the radical Islamist organization Islamic State in its fight to set up an Islamic caliphate in the Middle East. "Jihad these days is an individual's duty," he wrote his sister from the Middle East and asked her to pray that he might fall as a martyr. "I'm chillin', fighting, doing my job for Allah. I take my Kalashnikov and bismillah," he rhymed.
The five months that Kreshnik B., now 20, spent in Syria fighting for Islamic State are now the subject of a case which began in Frankfurt on Monday. He stands accused of membership in a terrorist organization and of "preparing a serious act of violent subversion."
His trial marks the first time that a presumed Islamic State fighter has appeared in front of a German court. It won't be the last. The number of jihadists who have left the country for Syria along with the number of Islamic State's supporters in Germany is already much higher than it ever was during the Afghanistan conflict. Currently, there are around 140 investigations under way in Germany against Islamic State fighters or their supporters. And the number is climbing. Federal state prosecutors have taken on 33 cases involving more than 60 suspects, but the flood of cases has begun clogging up dockets across the country.
Politicians have also begun considering ways to stop the jihadists and their increasingly bold propaganda promoting the "holy war." Last Friday, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière made any form of support for Islamic State illegal and an association of state working groups under the leadership of the Hesse Interior Ministry is currently looking into ways of preventing young Muslims from sliding into the militant Islamist scene in the first place. The aim is to combat the consistently rising number of young Muslims joining the jihad.
'Tell Mom She Shouldn't Be Frightened'
In many ways, Kreshnik B., the son of refugees from Kosovo, is a typical representative of jihad Made in Germany. The indictment claims that he boarded an Istanbul-bound bus in Frankfurt with six others in 2013. From there, they continued on to Syria.
"I really don't care which group I end up fighting for," Kreshnik wrote to his sister during the journey. "The most important thing is that I fight for Sharia and that I can do many deeds to serve God." As fate would have it, he ended up joining Islamic State near the Syrian city of Aleppo.
Other extremist groups refused to accept the inexperienced men from the West, most of whom were unable to speak Arabic. But Islamic State took almost all of them, as cannon fodder, suicide bombers or, should it become necessary, hostages for ransom money.
Kreshnik B. went through a weapons training program, performed guard duties and fought. Back in Germany, his parents went to the police and were apparently ready to travel to Syria to convince their son to come home. "Tell mom that she shouldn't be frightened, because I have my weapon with me," Kreshnik wrote to his sister.
But the fun of jihad didn't last long. Soon, Kreshnik began complaining to his sister of harassment from his commander, and of arguments and boring guard shifts. On one day, he reported, "three or four people" from his group died. We "shot tanks and tried everything, but nothing worked."
Then, the head of the group came and said: "I need four people to go in who won't come out alive." The German jihadist wasn't prepared for such a mission after all and traveled back to Frankfurt on Dec. 12, 2013, where he was arrested.
Part of the Salafist Scene
Exactly what pushed young people like Kreshnik B. to risk their lives in faraway wars was long a mystery to German authorities. But security officials recently assembled an 18-page report examining the radicalization process. It has provided some initial answers, and its findings, in some cases, are surprising.
The report notes that, of the 378 people who had headed for Syria with "Islamist motivations" by the end of June, more than 40 were women. Sixteen of them were minors, with the youngest having just turned 15. Almost two-thirds were born in Germany and roughly half of them left with the intention of joining the jihad. The overwhelming majority, 84 percent, are believed by authorities to be part of the Salafist scene.
In no way were all of Germany's radicalized Muslims on the fringes of society or people without a future. More than 100 of them had received their diplomas by the time they left, with 41 of them having completed the Abitur, Germany's college-prep diploma. Forty-three were enrolled in universities.
The "most important factor for radicalization" were friends, the study found. In 114 cases, they had a significant effect on those who headed off to join the jihad. Indeed, a jihadist's circle of friends was found to be more important than the work of recruiters or radical preachers in Salafist mosques. In two-thirds of the cases, the Internet played a role in the radicalization process.
The report, which was commissioned by the Interior Ministry, conspicuously lacks ideas for how to address the growing number of fanatical Islamists. The fact that it took more than a year for the vast majority to become radicalized -- theoretically providing sufficient time to intervene -- offers a glimmer of hope. But family members, non-Islamist friends, teachers or social workers only rarely notice the subtle changes occurring in those close to them as they become more radical.
'I Love Allah More'
Ismail I. marks something of an exception -- his transformation took place extremely rapidly. He will likely become the next German to answer before a court for allegedly having joined the jihad in Syria. The trial is set to begin in Stuttgart at the end of October.
The Lebanese-born 24-year-old hasn't had much success in his life. He was able to receive his high school diploma, albeit at a lower-tier Realschule, but was unable to find a traineeship afterwards. Drugs and truancy led to his expulsion from a vocational college, after which he worked for short stints at a bakery and at a KFC in Stuttgart. His marriage only lasted a few months.
Ismail I. then became acquainted with several significant figures in the German Salafist scene, including the preacher Sven Lau, who recently made headlines by sending a "Sharia Police" out on patrol in Wuppertal. After taking part in a pilgrimage with Lau, Ismail I. is thought to have flown from Düsseldorf to the Turkish city of Gaziantep on Aug. 22, 2013. From there, he took a bus to the Syrian border. He left a letter behind for his family reading: "I love you, but I love Allah more."
In Syria, he allegedly joined Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar, a Chechen-dominated group of Islamist fighters that merged into Islamic State over the course of last year.
In the autumn of 2013, Ismail I. apparently flew back to Stuttgart at the group's behest. There, he went on a shopping spree for the war, buying large amounts of camouflage clothing, night-vision devices, scalpels and Celox, a drug which slows bleeding. For 850, he also purchased an old station wagon that he and a helper planned to use to drive his purchases back to Syria. But they didn't get very far. They were arrested on Nov. 13 at an Autobahn rest area between Stuttgart and Ulm.
The case of Ismail I. illustrates the challenge facing the German judiciary as it addresses the muddled Syrian civil war 3,000 kilometers away. Several different groups, subgroups and sub-subgroups are involved in the fight there and it isn't easy to tell which ones are affiliated with Islamic State.
Federal prosecutors, who charged Ismail I. in May, must conduct precise investigations. They are responsible for all cases having to do with crimes committed in connection with membership in or support of a foreign terror organization.
'Unique Challenges'
History has shown that many such trials last more than a year. Officially, the federal prosecutor's office describes them as "unique challenges for criminal investigations." Unofficially, federal prosecutors recently sounded the alarm in the Justice Ministry -- if the number of such cases continue to rise, the office will sooner or later be overwhelmed.
In Kreshnik B.'s case, a deal is in the works which could provide some relief to all involved. The court this week indicated that Kreshnik B. may be given a lighter sentence should he provide a comprehensive confession. Ahead of the trial, his defense attorney and prosecutors reportedly met with the judge to pave the way for just such a deal. Either way, given the possibility that Kreshnik B. would be convicted under juvenile law, his sentence isn't likely to be severe. The defendant's attorney, Mutlu Günal, told SPIEGEL that he would be open to a plea bargain.
But policymakers face an even more difficult challenge than jurists when it comes to jihad tourists. Officials believe that 120 people have returned to Germany from Syria thus far, but in many cases it isn't clear what the person in question was doing in Syria -- whether they fought and, if so, for whom. Most importantly, it isn't clear in all cases whether they represent a threat now that they have returned home. The report compiled by security officials notes that only two dozen of those who have returned are "being cooperative with authorities." The others are refusing to talk -- and refusing to answer the question as to whether they intend to bring Islamic State's fight to Germany.
Domestic policymakers have recently spoken of "banning" Islamic State in Germany. But in order to do so, it has to be proven that the group has built up club-like structures here -- which it hasn't yet. Last Thursday, domestic intelligence officials from across the country held a telephone conference to discuss what rules could be put in place instead. The next day, Interior Minister de Maizière announced that all acts in support of Islamic State were banned.
Whether the ban will be effective in the fight against Islamic State activists remains to be seen. The edict will certainly be helpful in locking away individual Islamic State supporters for up to two years should they display the group's flag, use its symbols or spread its propaganda videos in the Internet. But banning Islamic State as a group isn't yet possible because the group as such doesn't exist yet in Germany. As such, de Maizière is operating in a legal gray area. "We want to nip the establishment of organized terror structures in the bud," he said last week.
'Deterrent Effect'
Another problem is the need to draw a clear line between Islamic State logos and normal symbols of Muslim belief. In individual cases, that might be tricky, one reason that the ban remained under consideration for so long. "We wanted to be sure that we wouldn't offend the religious sensibilities of Muslims," de Maizière said. He hopes the edict now issues will have a "deterrent effect."
Other proposals have gone much further. One which is particularly popular among members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats would see a provision added to the criminal code that was once used to combat Germany's left-wing terror group Rote Armee Fraktion (RAF).
"We have to once again make it criminal to solicit sympathy for terror organizations," says CDU domestic policy expert Armin Schuster. "That would likely hit Islamic State supporters in Germany the hardest."
The opposition in Berlin, however, continues to reject a further tightening of anti-terror laws. There are already "sufficient levers available to impose bans and limitations" on terrorists and their supporters, says Green Party domestic policy expert Irene Mihalic. "They just have to be forcefully applied."

Sensors originally designed to alert pilots of single-engine planes to the location of nearby aircraft are instead finding a military role locating unseen battle threats as far away as 40 kilometers.
The basic technology—the single hot-wire anemometer—has been around for decades, measuring heat dissipated by air (or fluid) movement. A new technology from Dutch acoustics firm Microflown Technologies, BV, uses two far smaller heated wires to measure individual air particles affected by sound waves. About the size of matchsticks, the devices are called acoustic vector sensors. They passively glean information about the source of a sound—including its location, what made it, and its movement, if any. Sounds picked up can emanate from howitzers, helicopters, sniper fire or even conversations.
The sensors' small size and relative simplicity have militaries worldwide, including those in the U.S., India, Singapore and the Netherlands, testing or deploying them. "I was flabbergasted when I first saw this system" in 2011, says Col. Harold Jacobs of the Royal Netherlands Army. “I was really surprised about the simplicity, the amazing accuracy, the size and all the possibilities,” he says.
Microflown says they can be mounted on drones, helicopters and other aircraft as well as on vehicles, buildings or even soldiers' epaulets. On drones, the sensors would augment what Jacobs calls the "deaf camera" onboard. When an acoustic vector sensor detects a disturbance in the air, it could signal the camera to rotate quickly and capture images of a nearby mortar crew, for instance, that has just fired a round. In such a scenario, that initial mortar round, detected by an acoustic vector sensor, could be used to gather enough data to accurately direct return fire before the enemy relocates or even reloads.
The sensor's probe is one millimeter wide, two millimeters long and 300 micrometers thick. It consists of two resistive platinum strips, each 200 nanometers thick by 10 micrometers wide, stretched parallel across a gap and heated to 200 degrees Celsius when operating. Air particles flow through the gap causing temperature variations in the strips, enabling the system to do two things: First, it counts the air particles to measure sound intensity. Second, without the need for two other sensors to triangulate, it records particle movement, which reveals the x, y and z coordinates of the sound's source. Researchers have measured its precision at less than 0.1 degree C within one kilometer. A garden-variety PC running Microflown's sound-filtering software—which eliminates engine, propeller and environmental sounds—performs real-time calculations, says Hans-Elias de Bree, co-founder of Microflown and inventor of the sensors.
Engineers have used heated, single-wire anemometers to study airflow for at least 50 years, says Rich Lueptow, a Northwestern University mechanical engineering professor. Microflown seems to be the first to have seen the promise of a miniaturized, double-wire probe, he says.
Andi Petculescu, an associate professor of physics at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, says he considered buying one of Microflown's sensors, but found it too expensive. Petculescu, who studies topics including quantitative acoustic gas sensing, says he wonders if Microflown would need an ungainly database of sounds against which to compare noise in the field.
De Bree, however, says, "We analyze certain classes of sound and distill the properties, which are sets of statistical features." Classes include the shock wave of supersonic bullets, muzzle blasts, propeller-driven aircraft and so on. "A shock wave has a set of 10 properties," assigned to it in the system, for example, de Bree says. The system has a sharp memory, too. It identifies a sound source's unique signature after hearing it once. This information could be used, for example, to create a profile on an elusive sniper by plotting when and where attacks happen.
A sound's loudness has the greatest impact on maximum accurate detection range, although ground cover, weather and other factors do affect sensor capabilities to a small extent, de Bree says. The sensors can pinpoint:
A 155-millimeter howitzer—at 175 decibels—from up to 40 kilometers away
An 81-millimeter mortar—at 180 decibels—from 25 kilometers away
5.56-millimeter small arms fire—at 155 decibels—from five kilometers away
A normal, 60-decibel conversation from up to 50 meters away
Those figures hold regardless of whether a sensor is airborne or on the ground, de Bree says. And although effective individually, networking multiple systems mounted on drones, tanks and soldiers would extend their range to create more-robust battlefield views.
Military representatives from the U.S. and U.K. as well as Russia and Israel stood on a Royal Netherlands Army (RNA) mortar range in 2012 watching a demonstration of the sensor's abilities, Jacobs says. The Microflown sensors that day were integrated with a new Royal Netherlands Navy radar. Jacobs says they were astonished by the system's accuracy.
The mortar-range sensor project, which cost about $1.3 million over two years, spurred an RNA "development roadmap" that includes sensor-equipped drones, helicopters and ground vehicles, Jacobs says. De Bree confirmed that the RNA has ongoing trials putting sensors on air and ground assets. It has purchased four systems that it uses daily in training and safety roles, he added. Two of them are at firing ranges, measuring mortar-crew accuracy.
Acoustics scientist Subramaniam Sadasivan had been working within India's Ministry of Defense on ways to passively learn about nearby aircraft when he saw a research paper referencing Microflown. In short order Sadasivan's project—called Environmental Acoustics Remote Sensing Station—had a Microflown sensor on a ship recording the sound of a drone overhead. He was impressed by Microflown's technology and, now retired, continues to champion the firm's sensors in unmanned aerial vehicles.
This is not an academic exercise for Jacobs. "In my time as an observer in the Bosnian War I was shot at, but didn't know at first where it came from. I needed a couple of weeks [of harrowing experience] to know where the bullet was coming from," he adds. Microflown's device "can save lives."
Assuming the technology matches early sentiments, it could find new markets outside battlefields. Rich Christiansen, head of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics' unmanned aerial vehicle program committee, says it would also be useful for law enforcement when trying to locate shooters.
Will the Mets resort to a throwback bullpen?
Until their starting pitchers can produce longer outings, the Mets might return to a bygone era by asking their relievers to throw multiple innings.
Closer Addison Reed had a six-out save against the Pirates on Saturday night, and the next day, general manager Sandy Alderson told an audience of season-ticket holders: “I don't think that's the last time you're going to see that. Our starters don't go long enough in games for us to use a guy for a third of an inning, two-thirds of an inning, even an inning in some cases.”
Citing injuries and underperformance, he said, “Our pitching has changed. We don't have the dominant pitching we once had.''
Told of those remarks, Reed responded, “Fine with me. I have no problem with it. It's why you play the game. You want to be out there, you want to be pitching. I'm fine going two innings, I have nothing against it. I'll throw in the fourth and fifth inning if I have to.''
Yankees Hall of Fame reliever Rich Gossage averaged nearly 2 1⁄3 innings per outing in 63 games in 1978. Gossage had 310 career saves. According to the Society for American Baseball Research, he had four or five outs in 68 of those saves, six to eight outs in 101 and at least nine outs in 24 more.
“I don't see an issue with any of our guys going multiple innings,'' Reed said. “I'm all for it if it's going to help us win games. If that's what they have to do, I'm ready to go.''
Jerry Blevins has functioned as the Mets' lefty specialist but said he has no issue pitching to more than a couple of batters.

“I'll do what they ask me to do to get people out,'' he said. “No matter what the situation is, right or lefthanded, whatever they want me to do, I do it. Just give me a heads-up.”
Not leaving Las Vegas
Alderson was asked why the Mets have their Triple-A team in Las Vegas, which can make it difficult to quickly call up players. The affiliate was in Buffalo through the 2012 season. “It's a very simple explanation. Buffalo didn't want us,'' Alderson said. “They decided they were better off with an affiliation with Toronto. Obviously, Toronto is close, sort of joint fan base. Until we find something else, we're there this year and next year.''
Straight answer to shifty question
When a fan asked Alderson why the Mets don't try to break defensive shifts by bunting to the opposite side of the field, he said, “We don't have any guys that can bunt very well.”
See Me if You Can! Art and the Limits of Neuroscience
New ways of thinking about the nature of visual consciousness allow us to reconsider art and its place in our lives. In this talk, Alva Noë, a leading figure in cognitive science, argued that art is philosophical and philosophy is aesthetic. Against this background, there are new possibilities for understanding what it is to be a person, asking if our experience of the world stems from the firing of neurons in our brains or from our interactions with our surroundings.
Noë is a writer and a philosopher who works on the nature of mind and human experience. He is the author of Action in Perception (MIT Press, 2004) and Varieties of Presence (Harvard University Press, 2012). Noë is a professor of philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley, where he is also a member of the Institute for Cognitive and Brain Sciences and the Center for New Media. Noë is a 2012 recipient of a Guggenheim fellowship, and is a weekly contributor to National Public Radio's science blog 13.7: Cosmos and Culture.
Observer Effects offered a dialogue between the fields of art and science. The title was derived from the principle in physics that the act of observation transforms the observed, an idea that has been influential in philosophy, aesthetics, psychology, and politics.
The other day, a question popped up on a Facebook thread I was commenting on: “Where is Victoria Nuland?” The short answer, of course, is that she is still holding down her position as assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs.
But a related question begs for a more expansive response: Where will Victoria Nuland be after January? Nuland is one of Hillary Clinton's protégés at the State Department, and she is also greatly admired by hardline Republicans. This suggests she would be easily approved by Congress as secretary of state or maybe even national-security adviser—which in turn suggests that her foreign-policy views deserve a closer look.
Nuland comes from what might be called the First Family of Military Interventionists. Her husband, Robert Kagan, is a leading neoconservative who co-founded the Project for the New American Century in 1998 around a demand for “regime change” in Iraq. He is currently a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, an author, and a regular contributor to the op-ed pages of a number of national newspapers. He has already declared that he will be voting for Hillary Clinton in November, a shift away from the GOP that many have seen as a clever career-enhancing move for both him and his wife.
Robert's brother, Fred, is with the hawkish American Enterprise Institute, and his sister-in-law, Kimberly, is the head of the Institute for the Study of War, which is largely funded by defense contractors. The Kagans work to encourage military action, both through their positions in government and by influencing the public debate through think-tank reports and op-eds. It is a family enterprise that mirrors the military-industrial complex as a whole, with think tanks coming up with reasons to increase military spending and providing “expert” support for the government officials who actually promote and implement the policies. Defense contractors, meanwhile, benefit from the largesse and kick back some money to the think tanks, which then develop new reasons to spend still more on military procurement.

The Kagans' underlying belief is that the United States has both the power and the obligation to replace governments that are considered either uncooperative with Washington (the “Leader of the Free World”) or hostile to American interests. American interests are, of course, mutable, and they include values like democracy and the rule of law as well as practical considerations such as economic and political competition. Given the elasticity of the interests, many countries can be and are considered potential targets for Washington's tender ministrations.
For what it's worth, President Obama is reportedly an admirer of Robert Kagan's books, which argue that the U.S. must maintain its military power to accommodate its “global responsibilities.” The persistence of neoconservative foreign-policy views in the Obama administration has often been remarked upon, though Democrats and Republicans embrace military interventionism for different reasons. The GOP sees it as an international leadership imperative driven by American “exceptionalism,” while the Dems romanticize “liberal intervention” as a sometimes-necessary evil undertaken most often for humanitarian reasons. But the result is the same, as no administration wants to be seen as weak when dealing with the outside world. George W. Bush's catastrophic failures in Afghanistan and Iraq continue to bear fruit under a Democratic administration, while Obama has added a string of additional “boots on the ground” interventions in Libya, Syria, Yemen, the Philippines, and Somalia.
And Nuland herself, many will recall, was the driving force behind efforts to destabilize the Ukrainian government of President Viktor Yanukovych in 2013-14. Yanukovych, admittedly a corrupt autocrat, nevertheless assumed office after a free election. In spite of the fact that Washington and Kiev ostensibly had friendly relations, Nuland provided open support for the Maidan Square demonstrators opposed to Yanukovych's government, passing out cookies to protesters on the square and holding photo ops with a beaming Sen. John McCain.
Nuland started her rapid rise as an adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney. Subsequently, she was serially promoted by secretaries of state Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, attaining her current position in September 2013. But it was her behavior in Ukraine that made her a media figure. It is hard to imagine that any U.S. administration would tolerate a similar attempt by a foreign nation to interfere in domestic politics, particularly if it were backed by a $5 billion budget, but Washington has long adhered to a double standard when evaluating its own behavior.
Nuland is most famous for using foul language when referring to the potential European role in managing the unrest in Ukraine that she and the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) had helped create. She even discussed with U.S. Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt who the new leader of Ukraine ought to be. “Yats is the guy” she said (referring to Arseniy Yatsenyuk), while pondering how she would “glue this thing” as Pyatt simultaneously considered how to “midwife” it. Their insecure phone call was intercepted and leaked, possibly by the Russian intelligence service, though anyone equipped with a scanner could have done the job.
The inevitable replacement of the government in Kiev, actually a coup but sold to the media as a triumph for “democracy,” was only the prelude to a sharp break—and escalating conflict—with Moscow over Russia's attempts to protect its own interests in Ukraine. The new regime in Kiev, as corrupt as its predecessor and supported by neo-Nazis and ultra-nationalists, was consistently whitewashed in the Western media, and the conflict was depicted as “pro-democracy” forces resisting unprovoked “Russian aggression.”
Indeed, the real objective of interfering in Ukraine was, right from the start, to install a regime hostile to Moscow. Carl Gershman, the head of the taxpayer-funded NED, called Ukraine “the biggest prize” in the effort to topple Russian President Vladimir Putin, who “may find himself on the losing end not just in the near abroad but within Russia itself.” But Gershman and Nuland were playing with fire in their assessment, as Russia had vital interests at stake and is the only nation with the military capability to destroy the U.S.
And make no mistake about Nuland's clear intention to expand the conflict and directly confront Moscow. In Senate testimony in May of 2014, she noted how the Obama administration was “providing support to other frontline states like Moldova and Georgia.”
Nuland and her neoconservative allies celebrated their “regime change” in Kiev oblivious to the fact that Putin would recognize the strategic threat to his own country and would react, particularly to protect the historic Russian naval base at Sevastopol in Crimea. Barack Obama responded predictably, initiating what soon became something like a new Cold War against Russia, risking escalation into a possible nuclear confrontation. It was a crisis that would not have existed but for Nuland and her allies.
Though there was no evidence that Putin had initiated the Ukraine crisis and much evidence to the contrary, the U.S. government propaganda machine rolled into action, claiming that Russia's measures in Ukraine would be the first step in an invasion of Eastern Europe. Former Secretary of State Clinton dutifully compared Putin to Adolf Hitler. And Robert Kagan provided the argument for more intervention, producing a lengthy essay in The New Republic entitled “Superpowers Don't Get to Retire,” in which he criticized President Obama for failing to maintain American dominance in the world. The New York Times revealed that the essay was apparently part of a joint project in which Nuland regularly edited her husband's articles, even though this particular piece attacked the administration she worked for.
As the situation in Ukraine continued to deteriorate in 2014, Nuland exerted herself to scuttle several European attempts to arrange a ceasefire. When NATO Commander Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove was cited as being in favor of sending more weapons to the Ukrainian government to “raise the battlefield cost for Putin,” Nuland commented, “I'd strongly urge you to use the phrase ‘defensive systems' that we would deliver to oppose Putin's ‘offensive systems.'”
To return to the initial question of where Victoria Nuland is, the long answer would be that while she is not much in the news, she is continuing to provide support for policies that the White House apparently approves of. Late last month, she was again in Kiev. She criticized Russia for its lack of press freedom and its “puppets” in the Donbas region while telling a Ukrainian audience about a “strong U.S. commitment to stand with Ukraine as it stays on the path of a clean, democratic, European future. … We remain committed to retaining sanctions that apply to the situation in Crimea until Crimea is returned to Ukraine.” Before that, she was in Cyprus and France discussing “a range of regional and global issues with senior government officials.”
But one has to suspect that, at this point, she is mainly waiting to see what happens in November. And wondering where she might be going in January.

Roscommon farmer turns up at waste collection with enough cyanide to 'wipe out' the county BelfastTelegraph.co.uk A farmer in Roscommon turned up at a hazardous waste disposal site with enough cyanide to 'wipe out' the county. https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/republic-of-ireland/roscommon-farmer-turns-up-at-waste-collection-with-enough-cyanide-to-wipe-out-the-county-35236740.html https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/news/article35236738.ece/aabdc/AUTOCROP/h342/farming.JPG

A farmer in Roscommon turned up at a hazardous waste disposal site with enough cyanide to 'wipe out' the county.
The farmer had the hazardous waste on his farm for the past 45 years and told officials he had originally bought it to get rid of rabbits on his farm.
Suzanne Dempsey, Environmental Officer with Roscommon County Council told Shannonside radio that the 4kg of cyanide was handed over by an elderly farmer. She said he had used it in the past to kill rabbits on his farm.
"That would have been common practice. The farmer had it in his shed for 45 years and had previously sought advice on how to dispose of it safetly.
"The toxic expert on the day said the amount was enough to wipe out most of the county."
She also said the farmer had the chemical well secured in containers.
Other waste products that farmers arrived with included one of the main ingredients in Agent Orange, a chemical weapon used in the Vietnam war.
The Environmental Protection Agency is currently running a series of hazardous waste disposal collection events where people can take any dangerous or hazardous waste they have have and dispose of it safetly.
Richard Ellis Sligh (August 18, 1944 – December 23, 2008) was an American collegiate and professional American football player who played for the American Football League's Oakland Raiders.
Sligh graduated from Newberry High School in Newberry, South Carolina and played college football at North Carolina Central University, where he was on Dean's List, for high academic achievement, as well as having a Biology Major and Chemistry Minor from 1962 to 1966.[1]
He was chosen in the 10th round of the 1967 NFL/AFL Draft as a defensive tackle.
During his time in the league he played in a total of eight games. Sligh was a reserve for the Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl II, when the Raiders fell to the Green Bay Packers.[1][4] In 1968, he was chosen by the expansion Cincinnati Bengals in the AFL Allocation Draft, but he was waived prior to the regular season.[5]
Height [ edit ]
At 7 feet tall, Sligh is the tallest player in professional football history.[6] The next tallest are Morris Stroud and Dan Skipper at 6-10 and Ed "Too Tall" Jones at 6-9.[7]

The Gliese 581 system has been making headlines recently for the most newly announced planet that may lie in the habitable zone. Hopes were somewhat dashed when we were reminded that the certainty level of its discovery was only 3 sigma (95%, whereas most astronomical discoveries are at or above the 99% confidence level before major announcements), but the Gliese 581 system may yet have more surprises. When the second planet, Gliese 581d, was first discovered, it was placed outside of the expected habitable zone. But in 2009, reanalysis of the data refined the orbital parameters and moved the planet in, just to the edge of the habitable zone. Several authors have suggested that, with sufficient greenhouse gasses, this may push Gliese 581d into the habitable zone. A new paper to be published in an upcoming issue of Astronomy & Astrophysics simulates a wide range of conditions to explore just what characteristics would be required.
The team, led by Robin Wordsworth at the University of Paris, varied properties of the planet including surface gravity, albedo, and the composition of potential atmospheres. Additionally, the simulations were also run for a planet in a similar orbit around the sun (Gliese 581 is an M dwarf) to understand how the different distribution of energy could effect the atmosphere. The team discovered that, for atmospheres comprised primarily of CO 2 , the redder stars would warm the planet more than a solar type star due to the CO 2 not being able to scatter the redder light as well, thus allowing more to reach the ground.
One of the potential roadblocks to warming the team considered was the formation of clouds. The team first considered CO 2 clouds which would be likely towards the outer edges of the habitable zone and form on Mars. Since clouds tend to be reflective, they would counteract warming effects from incoming starlight and cool the planet. Again, due to the nature of the star, the redder light would mitigate this somewhat allowing more to penetrate a potential cloud deck.
Should some H 2 O be present its effects are mixed. While clouds and ice are both very reflective, which would decrease the amount of energy captured by a planet, water also absorbs well in the infrared region. As such, clouds of water vapor can trap heat radiating from the surface back into space, trapping it and resulting in an overall increase. The problem is getting clouds to form in the first place.
The inclusion of nitrogen gas (common in the atmospheres of planets in the solar system) had little effect on the simulations. The primary reason was the lack of absorption of redder light. In general, the inclusion only slightly changed the specific heat of the atmosphere and a broadening of the absorption lines of other gasses, allowing for a very minor ability to trap more heat. Given the team was looking for conservative estimates, they ultimately discounted nitrogen from their final considerations.
With the combination of all these considerations, the team found that even given the most unfavorable conditions of most variables, should the atmospheric pressure be sufficiently high, this would allow for the presence of liquid water on the surface of the planet, a key requirement for what scientists maintain is critical for abiogenesis. The favorable merging of characteristics other than pressure were also able to produce liquid water with pressures as low as 5 bars. The team also notes that other greenhouse gasses, such as methane, were excluded due to their rarity, but should to exist, the ability for liquid water would be improved further.
Ultimately, the simulation was only done as a one dimensional model which essentially considered a thin column of the atmosphere on the day side of the planet. The team suggests that, for a better understanding, three dimensional models would need to be created. In the future, they plan to use just such modeling which would allow for a better understanding of what was happening elsewhere on the planet. For example, should temperatures fall too quickly on the night side, this could lead to the condensation of the gasses necessary and put the atmosphere in an unstable state. Additionally, as we discover more transiting exoplanets and determine their atmospheric properties from transmission spectra, astronomers will better be able to constrain what typical atmospheres really look like.
(AP) Senate candidate and former Florida House Speaker Marco Rubio released a torrid letter Wednesday accusing Gov. Charlie Crist's campaign of leaking Rubio's state Republican Party American Express statements showing nearly $110,000 in charges over 25 months.
Rubio also justifies the charges as legitimate travel to promote the Republican Party of Florida, help Republican candidates and participate in county party fundraisers around the state.
"It is clear these internal documents were taken from the RPOF by former Chairman Jim Greer, or someone working for him, and were leaked to the media by the Crist Campaign," Rubio wrote to newly elected Chairman John Thrasher.
Greer resigned from the party under pressure after reports of lavish spending on jet planes and extravagant meals and entertaining. Greer's executive director, Delmar Johnson, was given a secret contract that pumped his compensation up to $408,000.
"As a point of reference, during this time period, the charges on my card amounted to approximately 3 percent of the Party's total American Express expenditures. In fact, I had fewer expenses in two years than my opponent's hand-picked RPOF Executive Director spent in just one month," Rubio wrote.
The Miami Herald and the St. Petersburg Times, which obtained the records, listed several personal items found on the statements, including grocery bills and wine bought from a store near his Miami home. Rubio said he personally paid American Express $16,052.50 for nonparty expenses.
"To the greatest extent possible, I made sure the Party never paid for any personal charges," Rubio told Thrasher.
Sharon Day, the state party's national committeewoman, defended Rubio and said she was angry someone would try to use the credit card statements against him.
"I'm not upset with Marco Rubio at all," she said. "If you can raise $12 million on $110,000, we all should be that good."
Day said Greer told her and other party leaders in a private meeting that if he went down, he would take others down with him. Greer didn't immediately return a call seeking comment.
"It's very convenient that the only one that gets released (is Rubio's)," she said. "This is silly. They want to talk about $110,000 in 25 months when Delmar spent $130,000 in one month."
Reached at home, Thrasher, who replaced Greer last Saturday, said he had no idea who had access to the statements.
"It's unfortunate they were leaked. They're internal documents of the party," Thrasher said. "We're taking steps to make sure it doesn't happen again."
Rubio pointed out only top party officials had access to the statements and noted Greer was picked by Crist to run the party. Crist, who says he never carried a party charge card, has previously said the statements should be released.
"These actions are an appalling act of political desperation. The idea that the former chairman of the RPOF, or those working for the Governor, would selectively leak internal RPOF documents is disturbing. But sadly it is not surprising because these are the very men who put the party in the mess it is in today," Rubio said. "The Florida GOP under Jeb Bush was never run with this sort of arrogance, mismanagement, lack of integrity and lack of leadership."
The Crist campaign didn't immediately return a phone call and e-mails seeking comment.
Rubio said 89 percent of his expenses were for travel, lodging, and meals related to official party work.
‘True' Homeownership in Rural America By Lance George
Homeownership rates have traditionally been higher in rural and small town areas than in the nation as a whole. But, homeownership doesn't mean the same thing for every homeowner. Rural owners are more likely to have mortgage-free homes than their suburban or urban counterparts.
Share This:
The United States is largely a nation of homeowners.
Owning a home has traditionally been a foundation of the “American Dream,” conveying prosperity, financial security, and upward mobility — or so it was thought until 2008. Today, the housing crisis and flagging economy have taken some of the luster from homeownership, and has called into question elements of our nation's housing systems and policies.
Homeownership was not always the norm in the United States. In 1910, less than half of all U.S. homes were owned by their occupants. Yet over the past century, Americans have increasingly purchased their own homes — aided largely by rising incomes and a burgeoning mortgage finance system.
In 2010, 65.1 percent of U.S. homes were owner occupied. This rate is actually lower than the 2000 homeownership level of 66.2 percent, but homeowner rates have consistently been above 60 percent since the 1960s.
In rural and small town communities , homeownership rates are even higher than the national level. In 2010, approximately 17.9 million, or 71.6 percent of occupied homes in rural communities were owned by their inhabitants. Consistent with national trends, the 2010 rural homeownership rate declined by two percentage points from the year 2000 level.
(The definition of “rural and small towns” used in this brief was developed by the Housing Assistance Council (HAC), and is largely a measure of housing density and commuting at the Census tract level. It is important to note that HAC's rural and small town and definition is different than other measures. To see the particulars of our definition, go here.)
Homeownership Across the Rural Spectrum
Homeownership varies across demographic groups, and regions within rural and small town America.
Regionally, rural and small town homeownership rates are highest in the Midwest at 74 percent, and lowest in the West, where 68 percent of rural households own their homes. Among states, Delaware has the highest rural and small-town homeownership rate, at 77.8 percent, followed closely by Minnesota and Michigan, at 77 percent homeownership.
Overall, 37 states have rural and small town homeownership rates above 70 percent. Only two states —California and Hawaii — have rural and small town homeownership rates below the national level of 65.1 percent.
Ownership of housing also varies across racial and ethnic groups in rural and small-town communities. Similar to national characteristics, rural and small town minorities have substantially lowed homeownership rates than white non-Hispanic households.
Nearly three-quarters of rural white non-Hispanic headed households own their homes, while just 56 percent of rural minority-headed households are homeowners. The homeownership rate for rural and small town African Americans and Hispanics (55 percent) is 20 percentage points lower than that of white non-Hispanics households in rural communities.
At the same time, the level of rural minority homeownership is 8 percentage points higher than that of minorities in the United States as a whole.
[img:Demoownership.jpg]
Some of the largest differences in rural and small town homeownership rates are seen across age groups.
Typically, homeownership rates increase with age. For example, only 44 percent of rural and small-town householders below age 34 own their homes, compared to an 82 percent homeownership rate for householders age 65 and over. While seniors have among the highest homeownership levels of any rural and small town demographic groups, these, too, vary by age.
The homeownership rate for householders age 65 to 74 is 84 percent, while the homeownership rate for seniors age 85 and over is lower at 70.8 percent.
The much discussed “baby boom” generation (age 45 to 64 in 2010) also has high homeownership rates in rural and small-town areas. Nearly eight in ten rural and small town baby-boomers own their homes which is six percentage points higher than their suburban and urban boomer counterparts.
“True” Homeownership
Homeownership doesn't mean the same thing for every homeowner. Housing tenure in the United States is often viewed through an “either-or” lens, in which a household either owns or rents their home. In actuality, there are three basic forms of housing tenure : 1) renting; 2) owning with a mortgage; and 3) owning without a mortgage — often referred to as “free and clear” homeownership, in which a homeowner has no mortgage debt. A slightly closer look at data from the 2010 Census provides some nuance into mortgage-free, or what could be called “true,” homeownership, especially in rural communities.
Homeowners in rural and small town communities have higher levels of mortgage-free homeownership than their suburban and urban counterparts.
Nearly 42 percent of homeowners in rural and small town America own their homes free and clear of mortgage debt, compared to roughly 27 percent of suburban and urban homeowners with no mortgage. The higher rate of mortgage-free homeowners in rural and small town areas is likely attributable to several factors.
First, there are a large number of manufactured homes in rural areas. Manufactured homes, typically financed through personal property loans, have shorter loan terms than standard mortgage financing. These finance elements combined with relatively low purchase prices result in a substantial number of debt-free manufactured homes.
Demographic and age factors also impact the mortgage status of rural homeowners. The population is older in rural and small town communities than in the nation as a whole, including more senior households. Typically, homeownership rates increase and mortgage debt declines with age. Over three-quarters of rural homeowners age 65 and over own their homes free and clear.
[img:agehousing.jpg]
While more rural households own their homes free and clear, it is also important to note the equity they accumulate is likely to be less than that for homes in urban or suburban areas because rural houses are generally less expensive.
Factors such as distance from employment opportunities and amenities contribute to the lower value and appreciation of homes in many rural and small town markets. In rural and small town communities, over 40 percent of homes are valued at less than $100,000, compared to 23 percent of homes nationally. Additionally, many households residing in manufactured homes may own their homes, but not the lot on which their unit is placed. Residents who rent the land under their home may have reduced potential for appreciation in its value.
[img:nomortgagemap.jpg]
Home values and assets may be lower in rural areas, but the level of mortgage-free homeowners is not an insignificant statistic. Following a decade of lax financing standards and unconstrained housing consumption, millions of homeowners across the nation are “underwater” with substantial, and in some cases, unsustainable levels of housing debt.
While the housing crisis has not spared rural America, many rural and small town homeowners are buoyed by relatively large levels of equity in their homes. For most Americans, a home is still the largest asset they will ever own. Despite stagnant and declining home values nationally, asset and investment accumulation through homeownership is still a considerable economic factor for many rural residents.

Investigative reporter James Gordon Meek broke an important story this week: He revealed that U.S.-backed forces in Iraq are committing the same type of horrific war crimes — wanton killings of prisoners, beheadings, torture — as the Islamic State fighters on the other side of the front line.
Meek's report, broadcast by ABC News and based on photos and cell phone videos that Iraqi fighters had proudly shared on social media, shows the Humvees and M4A1 assault rifles that the U.S. government has supplied in abundance to Iraq's armed forces. In its effort to push the Islamic State out of Iraq, the U.S. is providing Baghdad with nearly $1 billion a year in weapons, in addition to training by several thousand American advisers.
U.S. and Iraqi officials professed surprise at what is happening, and told ABC that investigations would be launched to get to the bottom of it. If this sounds familiar in a “Casablanca” way — gambling in the casino, stop the presses — it should. Back in 2005, when Facebook was a curiousity used by just a few thousand students and Instagram was years away from being invented, the sorts of abuses that Meek recently found on social media sites were well underway.
Back then, I visited Samarra, a contested town in the heart of what was known as the Sunni Triangle, and wrote about the abuses I saw while accompanying Iraqi and U.S. forces on joint raids. I saw beatings, witnessed a mock execution, and heard, inside an Iraqi detention center, the terrible screams of a man being tortured. I received the same sorts of reactions that greeted Meek's story: U.S. and Iraqi officials expressed surprise and promised to punish any wrongdoers.
Nothing changed.
That's because torture, rather than being an aberration, was embedded in a strategy that was described, at the time, as the Salvadorization of Iraq—the use of dirty-war tactics to defeat an insurgency. It is more than a footnote of history that the origins of this policy appear to date to 2004, when the effort to train and equip Iraqi forces got underway in earnest under the leadership of Gen. David Petraeus, who went on to command all U.S. forces in Iraq, then in Afghanistan, then became director of the CIA, then resigned and pleaded guilty to disclosing a trove of highly-classified information to his lover and biographer, Paula Broadwell, and lying to the FBI about it.
I was hardly the first to witness the abuses and hypocrisy that were the hammer and anvil of the American program to build up Iraqi forces. In 2004, Oregon National Guard troops in Baghdad observed officers inside a Ministry of Interior compound beating and torturing prisoners; they entered the compound and found dozens of abused detainees, including one who had just been shot. The Oregon soldiers reported what they had found and received an incredible order from their commanders — leave the compound now.
In 2010, the deluge of military and diplomatic files that were released by WikiLeaks included a document that explained why the Oregon soldiers had been told to forget about what they had seen — FRAGO 242, as the order was called, required U.S. troops to not investigate any abuses committed by Iraqi forces unless U.S. troops were involved. In other words, so long as Iraqis were doing the torturing rather than Americans, it was none of our business. Move along, nothing to see here.
Then, as now, the reason these abuses were tolerated was a battlefield version of expediency — this is the way insurgencies are confronted, they all tend to be dirty, there's nothing we can do about it because angels don't win wars. The problem with this thinking is not just moral — we shouldn't support forces that we fully know are committing war crimes — it is also practical. What has turning a blind eye gotten us since the effort to equip Iraqi forces got underway in the aftermath of the toppling of the statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in 2003?
Expediency is not our friend. It is our enemy.

10. Alberto Del Rio  $675,000 Downside Plus First Class Travel
Alberto Del Rio is a constant upper mid card to main event act for the WWE. For good reason too, he is one of the very best in ring workers in the company and a real veteran in the industry. WWE pulling off the signing of Del Rio (then Dos Caras Jnr) in 2010 was a major coup for the McMahon empire  Caras Jnr was a huge draw in Mexico and a revered wrestling talent. WWE has Del Rio on a salary of $625,000 a year before bonuses and other royalties. Del Rio also enjoys the perk of WWE booking first class travel, an honour that was traditionally only reserved for the champion. Alberto's salary is testament to his skill and standing in the industry. Aware of the Mexican's strength as a performer, the WWE has consistently booked Del Rio in the upper mid card to main event scene. He won the 2011 Royal Rumble, as well as the 2011 Money in the bank briefcase. Alberto has held the WWE title on two occasions, and the world title also two times. Not bad for a man who has only been with the company for three years. The fact that Del Rio has enjoyed such consistency as a main eventer means that he will have earned far more than just $625,000. Bonuses for his high position on WWE cards will have made Del Rio a very rich man.
New Zealand might be about to have its next Formula 1 driver.
Not since Mike Thackwell in 1984 has a Kiwi driven on motorsport's biggest stage but that could change in the next fortnight with Le Mans 24 Hour winner Brendon Hartley looming as a serious contender for the vacant Toro Rosso seat at next week's US Grand Prix.
Youngster Pierre Gasly, a replacement driver this season himself, has opted to skip the race in Austin to concentrate on winning the Asian Super Formula championship at the series finale on the same weekend.
Autosport magazine is reporting that 27-year-old Hartley is the favourite to replace Gasly for the race at the Circuit of Americas track and is in the frame to get a full-time drive at the team next year.

He held the role of Red Bull's reserve driver from 2009-2010 and completed a test for Red Bull in 2008 as well as two for Toro Rosso in 2009 before being dropped from the programme.
He went on to fashion a terrific record in GT racing, including his win with the Porsche factory team at Le Mans this year. He is part of a trio including fellow Kiwi Earl Bamber and German Timo Bernhard that leads the World Endurance Championship but will be looking for another drive next year after Porsche's decision to withdraw at the season's end.
Hartley is set to race in the WEC round in Japan this weekend where he could secure the title.
He has also been linked to an Indycars drive alongside New Zealander and four-time series champion Scott Dixon at Chip Ganassi Racing.

About
Imagine a short romantic comedy film, about 10 minutes long, where all the acting is done by feet and toes and voices - no hands, no faces, just feet. YOU can help make it a reality by supporting this fund drive. I have some talented professional friends with cameras and editing software, directing and acting abilities and hopefully a couple with attractive feet. For about $3,000 I can stimulate my friends' economies a bit and have a very professional short film made in multiple formats which I can then enter in various short film contests from Seattle to Toronto and New York, and who knows where else. It would also be available over the internet all across the world.
I've got some great rewards for those who wish to contribute to this effort and it is your opportunity to support independent film at the grass roots level. Who knows, some day I may be inviting you to my premiere party at Sundance.
Thanks for watching this video and link this to any like-minded folk you may know. Hopefully, gotten off on the right foot and you can see just how fun this film will be, and how fun it will be to a part of it.

Liverpool are waiting on the fitness of captain Jordan Henderson and Adam Lallana ahead of Saturday's crunch Premier League clash with Manchester United.
Henderson has responded positively to treatment on the heel injury which forced him to miss the past two league games against Arsenal and West Ham.
However, the 25-year-old midfielder remains a doubt for the trip to Old Trafford and no decision will be made on his participation until later in the week.
Boss Brendan Rodgers is also hoping that Lallana is passed fit for duty after he was sidelined by a minor thigh problem picked up in the win over Bournemouth.
Both Henderson and Lallana were forced to declare themselves unavailable for England duty and remained at Melwood during the international break in order to undergo treatment,
Many of Rodgers' squad who have been away on international duty reconvened at Melwood on Tuesday as the preparations got underway for the trip to Old Trafford.
England duo James Milner and Nathaniel Clyne, along with Slovakia's Martin Skrtel, will report back for training on Wednesday.
Ben Carson signaled his exit from the race on Wednesday following a string of dismal performances. Ben Carson announces campaign is over 'I will still continue to be heavily involved in trying to save our nation,' the retired neurosurgeon said.
Ben Carson is suspending his bid for the presidency, the retired neurosurgeon announced Friday, speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland.
"Even though I might be leaving the campaign trail, you know there's a lot of people who love me, they just won't vote for me. But I will still continue to be heavily involved in trying to save our nation," he said.

The outgoing candidate peppered his speech with implicit warnings to the country about its future, both for fellow candidates and for the media, which intensely scrutinized claims about his biography throughout the course of his campaign.
“You don't need to have much of a developed brain to react, to react in fear," Carson said in urging a more thoughtful, productive national political discourse. "Animals can do that; lizards do that.”
Later in the speech, Carson appealed to the audience to get active and informed.
“We cannot continue to allow ourselves to be influenced and molded by the political class and by the media. That is going to destroy us," he said, remarking that it's "kind of sad" that the press is the only business protected by the Constitution "because they were supposed to be the allies of the people."
Carson signaled his exit from the race on Wednesday following a string of dismal performances in primaries and caucuses, writing in a statement that he saw no path to claim the Republican nomination.
"I do not see a political path forward in light of last evening's Super Tuesday primary results," Carson said in the statement released Wednesday, a day before he skipped the 11th Republican debate in his hometown of Detroit.
The following day, he danced around whether he was formally leaving the race. “I want people to start thinking about the real issues that are threatening America right now; those issues are not how big someone's hands are, or how long someone's nose is," Carson told Yahoo News' Katie Couric on Thursday.
Earlier on Friday, it was announced that Carson will serve as national chairman of My Faith Votes, a group focused on Christian voter turnout.
Theodorus "Theo" van Gogh[1] ( Dutch pronunciation: [teːjoːˈdoːrɵs ˈteːjoː vɑŋ ˈɣɔx];[2] 1 May 1857 – 25 January 1891) was a Dutch art dealer. He was the younger brother of Vincent van Gogh, and Theo's unfailing financial and emotional support allowed his brother to devote himself entirely to painting. Theo died at the age of 33, six months after his brother died at the age of 37.
Theo is widely known for his influence on his brother; however, this often overshadows the significant impact that Theo made on the art world as a renowned art dealer: Theo played a crucial role in the introduction of contemporary Dutch and French art to the public.[3]
Biography [ edit ]
[4][5] Theo van Gogh in 1873. This photograph was believed to show Vincent, but in 2018 was reassigned to Theo.
Theodorus "Theo" van Gogh was born on 1 May 1857 in the village Groot-Zundert in the province of North Brabant, Netherlands. He was the son of Theodorus van Gogh and Anna Cornelia Carbentus. His elder brother was artist Vincent van Gogh (1853–1890).
Business [ edit ]
Theo worked for some years at the Dutch office of the Parisian art dealers Goupil & Cie in The Hague. Theo joined the Brussels office on 1 January 1873 as their youngest employee. After Theo was transferred to the London office, he moved to the office in The Hague, where he developed into a successful art dealer.[6] By 1884, he was transferred to the Paris main office. Beginning in the winter of 1880–1881, he sent painting materials as well as monthly financial support to his brother and painter Vincent van Gogh, who was then living in the Netherlands.
Private life [ edit ]
In Paris, Theo met Andries Bonger and his sister Johanna. He married Johanna in Amsterdam on 17 April 1889 and they moved to Paris. Their son Vincent Willem was born in Paris on 31 January 1890. On 8 June, the family visited Vincent, who was living near Paris in Auvers-sur-Oise. Vincent died in July 1890 at age 37. Theo suffered from dementia paralytica, an infection of the brain,[7][8] and his health declined rapidly after Vincent's death. Weak and unable to come to terms with Vincent's absence, he died six months later (25 January 1891) at age 33 in Den Dolder.[9]
Theo's great-grandson, also named Theo van Gogh, was the controversial film director, who was murdered on the streets of Amsterdam in 2004 by an Islamic extremist after making a short film critical of Islam.[10]
Relationship with Vincent [ edit ]
[11] This 1887 portrait by Vincent van Gogh , long thought to be a self-portrait, was reassessed in 2011 to be one of his brother Theo van Gogh.
Theo admired his elder brother Vincent for his whole life, but communicating with him proved to be difficult, even before Vincent opted to follow his artistic vocation. The communication between both brothers suffered from diverging definitions of standards, and it was evidently Theo who kept on writing letters. Vincent is known to have not kept the letters Theo sent; on the other hand, Theo kept every scrap of correspondence from his brother. Therefore, mostly Vincent's answers survived and few of Theo's. Theo was often concerned about Vincent's mental condition and he was amongst the few who understood his brother.[12] It is known that Theo helped Vincent to maintain his artist lifestyle by giving him money. He also helped Vincent pursue his life as an artist through his unwavering emotional support and love. The majority of Theo's letters and communications with Vincent are filled with praise and encouragement. Vincent would send Theo sketches and ideas for paintings, along with accounts of his day-to-day experiences, to the delight and eager attention of Theo.[13]
Dealer and artist [ edit ]
While it is true that Theo is best known for being the brother of Vincent van Gogh and that one of the major roles of Theo van Gogh's life was his influence on Vincent's career, Theo himself made many important contributions within his lifetime. Theo's work as an art dealer and the important effect he had on the art world are often overshadowed because of his relation to Vincent, but Theo played a vital role in the introduction of contemporary Dutch and French art to the public.[3] Theo was instrumental in the popularity of Impressionist artists such as Claude Monet and Edgar Degas by persuading his employers, Goupil & Cie, to exhibit and buy their works.[14]
In 1886, Theo invited Vincent to come and live with him in Paris, and from March they shared an apartment in Montmartre. Theo introduced Vincent to Paul Gauguin, Paul Cézanne, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Henri Rousseau, Camille Pissarro and Georges Seurat, and in 1888 he persuaded Gauguin to join Vincent, who had moved to Arles in the meantime.[citation needed]
Correspondence [ edit ]
The two brothers maintained an intensive correspondence, with Theo often encouraging his depressed brother. Theo was one of the few people who Vincent could talk to and confide in. These letters are one of the main and only sources of information about Vincent's life, providing many detailed accounts of not only the occurrences but also the thoughts and feelings in Vincent's life. Over three-quarters of the more than 800 letters Vincent wrote during his life were to Theo, including his first and his last letters.[15] It is largely thanks to Theo and his wife that these letters are available today.[12] Hardly any of Theo's letters remain because Vincent failed to keep them.[16] The letters have been collected and published in book form as The Letters of Vincent van Gogh.[17][18]
The relationship between the two brothers was the subject of the movie Vincent & Theo (1990), directed by Robert Altman. It also formed an important part of the film Lust for Life (1956), which was directed by Vincente Minnelli. Theo was played by the British actor James Donald and Vincent by the Hollywood star Kirk Douglas.
Death [ edit ]
Vincent and Theo van Gogh's graves at the cemetery of Auvers-sur-Oise
Theo's health deteriorated in the months after the death of his brother. He was admitted to the Willem Arntz Hospital, a psychiatric hospital, in Den Dolder on 18 November 1890. He had been diagnosed in Paris as suffering from a progressive and general paralysis. Initial examination confirmed this diagnosis. By 1 December his medical notes confirmed he presented all the symptoms of dementia paralytica, a disease of the brain. He died on 25 January 1891. The cause of death was listed as dementia paralytica caused by "heredity, chronic disease, overwork, sadness".[9] In 1914, Theo's body was exhumed and reburied with his brother at Auvers-sur-Oise.[19]

A judge has praised an undercover police officer who infiltrated a group of British supporters of so-called Islamic State to gather evidence.
Group leader Mohammed Alamgir, 37, was jailed for six years at the Old Bailey for inviting support for IS.
Speeches made by Alamgir and four other men in Luton were secretly recorded by the officer, known only as Kamal.
Judge Michael Topolski QC said he had displayed "considerable resourcefulness and even greater courage".
LIVE: Updates on this and other Bedfordshire news
He said the evidence he had gathered had played a "pivotal role" in the case and that it was not difficult to imagine the fate "that might befall him had he been exposed".
The court heard how the men had made speeches at a marquee and a church hall.
The judge described how Alamgir, of Kenilworth Road, Luton, spoke in June 2015 at St Margaret's Church "of the sun setting on the British Empire and the sun trying to rise on the Islamic State".
Sentencing him, the judge said: "You are in my judgement deeply committed to an extreme and violent Jihad mindset.

He was sentenced to two years and six months.
In China's primary and secondary schools, there exists an obvious paradox. On one hand, the official education system is attempting to ease the burden of schoolwork on students, with the Education Administrative Department repeatedly exhorting schools to lessen students' workloads. On the other hand, more and more of the time students spend outside the classroom is being devoted to educational training organizations. Frenzied students are taking part in every kind of competition under the sun, from nationwide tournaments like the International Math Olympiad or the Chun Lei Trophy, to all manner of local competitions.
Like other East Asian societies, China has historically placed high value on educating children. Due to the country's vast population and the limited resources of elite schools, not only is there intense competition during entrance exams, but there are also top colleges putting students' unique abilities — such as performance in science competitions, writing ability, oral skills, musical talent, and achievements in dance — under the microscope.
Such cruel competitions have been denounced across society by those who feel that they monopolize children's free time, place too much emphasis on performing under test conditions at the expense of cultivating creativity and imagination, and — most concerningly — stunt students' interest in learning. Against this background, government departments have begun to staunchly promote holistic education.
The Education Administrative Department has put a lot of thought into enacting this policy. As early as 1993, instructional guidelines stipulated that junior middle school students should not be given more than 1.5 hours of homework per day. In a notice issued in 2000, officials reiterated that first- and second-year students should not purchase extracurricular tutoring books or be assigned written homework, while forbidding any department or group from unlawfully holding competitive activities for primary school students.
In 2013, a set of 10 guidelines for reducing student workloads made schools assume zero background knowledge when they teach new subjects; encouraged them not to give homework to primary school students; strictly prohibited them from running remedial or revision classes; and made them give their students one hour of exercise per day. Though the rules have become more and more detailed, the crazes for remedial classes and student competitions have not only continued, but also become more and more intense. What is the reason behind this?
Although reducing student workloads is a noble aim, blindly telling schools to give them less work ignores a fundamental truism of education. Attaining a high level of educational ability isn't always an effortless, enjoyable process. To a large extent, the phenomenon of “happy education,” as the policy has come to be called, lacks any factual basis. In the West, elite schools also impose a relatively high degree of pressure on their students. The difference only lies in the fact that Western education not only emphasizes the student's grades, but also looks at their physical fitness, their participation in clubs and societies, volunteering work, and leadership skills.
The very best schools hold student competitions in such high regard is because it allows them to overcome the diminished role of tests in their selection procedures. - Xiong Yihan, political scientist
In addition, throughout the education process, Western curricula use the students' own interests as a guide, and encourage diverse methods of assessment and development. While the Chinese Ministry of Education's unburdening policy superficially has the students' best interests at heart, in practice it creates a lot of time spent away from learning. Because schools have lost the power to arrange how this time is spent, private education companies have stepped into the breach. In the end, the policy only reduces the amount of homework students get from schools, while failing to address the intense competition surrounding entry into the country's best educational institutions.
Since the turn of the century, access high-quality educational resources has clearly become more and more unequal. In the 1980s and '90s, while the quality of a basic education across China varied slightly between regions, it was nowhere near as polarized as it is now. At that time, many county-level high schools held strong reputations across their respective provinces; today, every part of the country has a rarefied clutch of so-called super schools clustered in provincial capitals, vacuuming up almost all the best students across the province, and creating further imbalance of educational resources.
Let me take two examples with which I am quite familiar: Shanghai and my home province of Hunan, in central China. A little over 10 years ago, the town where I grew up, Hengyang, was home to a few top provincial-level middle schools with strong reputations for quality. In the past decade, however, these schools have regressed dramatically as exceptional students from wealthy family backgrounds have fled en masse to the four best schools in Changsha, the provincial capital.
Shanghai's experience is similar. In the past, the city was said to have “four great schools and eight great icons,” referring to the guardian deities that supposedly kept watch over the city. But now, the gap between presumed top schools and the “Big Five” senior highs — Shanghai High School, Qibao High School, and the high schools affiliated with Fudan University, East China Normal University, and Jiao Tong University — is expanding rapidly. The admissions procedures of top-tier universities like Peking, Tsinghua, Fudan, and Jiao Tong also place too much emphasis on recruiting students from these “super” schools.
So on one hand, it is becoming more difficult for students to gain access to top schools, while on the other, schools are continuing to emphasize the importance of lightening students' workloads. This will only bring about a new problem: What schools teach will become overly simplified, students will be assigned a bare minimum amount of work, and standardized tests will therefore lose much of their ability to separate the best from the rest. If test questions are too easy, they will only be able to separate high- and low-ability students, without being able to screen out truly exceptional ones — say, the top 1 percent — from the merely excellent. This is because there will no longer be an observable difference in these students' scores.
In other words, grades achieved on the zhongkao — China's senior high school entrance exam — can be used to pick out students from top junior highs, but they will not satisfy the most selective super schools. As a result, super schools will implement their own screening procedures, using more difficult tests and interviews to achieve their goal of selecting the cream of the crop.
The reason why the very best schools hold student competitions in such high regard is because it allows them to overcome the diminished role of tests in their selection procedures. Intense competition at such events provides the most prestigious schools with a comparatively cheap and reliable signal — namely, that to a certain extent competitions are more accurate than tests in reflecting the differences between high-achieving students. In this light, the rise of student competitions cannot be separated from unburdening policies in basic education. When combined with China's increasingly polarized educational landscape, they're also why the policy is being constantly undermined.

U2 frontman was investor in firm based in island nation where foreign investors pay 5% tax on profits, Paradise Papers show
His band have never been there, and neither, it seems, has he. But as an investment opportunity, Bono found what he was looking for in Lithuania.
The U2 frontman used a company based in Malta to pay for a share in a shopping centre in a small town in the north-east of the country, the Paradise Papers reveal.
The singer, whose real name is Paul Hewson, was an investor in the Maltese company Nude Estates, which bought the Aušra mall – named after the Lithuanian word for dawn – for €5.8m (£5.1m) shortly after it opened in 2007.
Nude Estates incorporated a Lithuanian company of the same name to hold the property in Utena, 60 miles (97km) north of the capital, Vilnius.
In 2012, the shopping centre business was transferred to a company in Guernsey called Nude Estates 1.
Malta is a low-tax jurisdiction. For foreign investors, the tax paid on any profits earned by companies is reduced to 5%. In Guernsey, no tax is paid on company profits, although any money brought back into the UK or Ireland would be subject to tax.
Bono's spokeswoman told the Guardian: “Bono was a passive, minority investor in Nude Estates Malta Ltd, a company that was legally registered in Malta until it was voluntarily wound up in 2015. Malta is a well-established holding company jurisdiction within the EU.”
She added that he was also a passive, minority investor in the Guernsey company linked to the shopping complex.
Bono has made no apologies for his tax affairs after previous revelations.
In 2015, he said U2 “paid a fortune in tax”. An earlier decision by the band to run some of their business through the Netherlands was, he said, “just some smart people we have working for us trying to be sensible about the way we're taxed. And that's just one of our companies, by the way. There are loads of companies”.

NAIROBI, Kenya (Morning Star News) – The Muslim father of a 9-year-old boy in eastern Uganda who put his faith in Christ this month tied his son to a tree and burned him, sources said.
Nassif Malagara of the Kakira Parish area, Kisozi Sub-County, Kamuli District decided to become a Christian after a neighbor took him to visit a church in another village, undisclosed for security reasons, on June 5.
“At the end of the service, Nassif remained behind and then followed me to the church's pastry room and requested that he wanted to receive Jesus as his personal savior,” the pastor of the church told Morning Star News. “I was a bit hesitant, but after his continuous press, I then prayed with him, and he left.”
Nassif subsequently declined to participate in any Muslim activities, including attending a madrassa (Islamic school), the pastor said. His father, 36-year-old Abubakar Malagara, and stepmother, Madina Namwaje, 35, became furious when they learned he had converted to Christianity, the pastor said.
The boy told Morning Star News that his parents prohibited him from eating, beyond the day-time fast of Ramadan, so that he went without food for two days before sneaking to his neighbor's house for food. He brought food back to his home over the next few days, and on June 9 his father caught him eating.
“He started beating me up with sticks, but I managed to escape to a nearby bush,” Nassif said. “My father then followed me and got hold of me back to the homestead, where he tied me up to a banana tree. He went into the house and came back with a hot piece of wood. The banana tree had dry leaves, which caught fire and caused serious burns on my body.”
Neighbors heard his screams for help and rescued him, he said, and took him to Kamuli Hospital. The hospital's Walwawo Zubari told Morning Star News that Nassif had burns on several parts of his body.
“Nassif has been recovering, but at a very slow pace,” Zubari said. “He might need to be referred to another hospital for specialized treatment.”
A relative told Morning Star News that she hopes to take custody of Nassif after his release from the hospital.
Area residents alerted Kisozi Police Post, and officers arrested Malagara, registering the case under reference number CRR044/2016. Malagara, who attends Nankaduro mosque, has been released on bail.
The neighbor (name withheld for security reasons) who introduced Nassif to the church said he fears for his life after receiving a threatening text message on his phone.
“We know that you are behind the conversion of Nassif to Christianity,” the message read. “You will soon reap what you have sown, which will be a lesson to others. Islam is against such conversion.”
The sender blocked his identity, but the neighbor said he suspects Malagara might have used another Muslim's phone to send the message.
About 85 percent of the people in Uganda are Christian and 11 percent Muslim, with some eastern areas having large Muslim populations. The country's constitution and other laws provide for religious freedom, including the right to propagate one's faith and convert from one faith to another.
Kamuli District is about 220 kilometers (136 miles) from Mbale Town in eastern Uganda. Nassif's case comes after a Christian in eastern Uganda who had received death threats from Muslims after a religious discussion was killed on June 4. The body of Yokannah Zirinkuma of Kasasira village, Kibuku District, was found in a pool of blood in nearby Kadama village, near the home of the primary suspect. Zirinkuma was 50.
On May 15 in Kasecha village, Kibuku District, Micah Byamukama, pastor of Kasecha Baptist Church, died at Kabweri Health Centre after ingesting an insecticide that a Muslim villager was suspected of putting into his food. He was 61.
On May 8 in Mbaale village, Imanyiro Sub-County, Mayuge District, a Muslim strangled his wife to death for leaving Islam, relatives and neighbors said. Awali Kakaire, 34, allegedly killed Mariam Nakirya for embracing Christianity. She was 30.
On April 19, Muslims in Pallisa District beat and raped a young Christian woman for testifying that a mosque leader killed her father because of his faith, sources said. The imam at a mosque in Kanyumu village, Sheikh Musana Ibrahim, and two other Muslims killed Samson Mukama on Jan. 28, according to his daughter.
On April 4, a Muslim in Kachomo village, Budaka District, attacked his wife for becoming a Christian, telling a judge that Islam allows him to kill any apostate, sources said. Having moved to another village with their four children following an attack last year, Ntende Hawa, 38, said she was visiting her estranged husband to discuss child support when he questioned her about her faith and began strangling her. Her husband's brother stopped the assault.
Threats from hard-line Muslims and the rape of her 13-year-old daughter forced a Christian mother of five children to flee their village in eastern Uganda in March, sources said. Amina Napiya, a 42-year-old widow, fled her home in Nakajete village, Budaka Town Council, on March 16.
Napiya and her five children fled after receiving a text message that the family would be killed for leaving Islam, she said. Napiya's daughter was raped on Feb. 25 while fetching firewood a kilometer from their home at about 4:30 p.m., the widow said. Napiya believes relatives may have hired Taika Suleiman, arrested in connection with the alleged rape, to assault her daughter because of their faith, as her daughter told her that the rapist said, “This is the second warning to your mother for disgracing the faith of the Muslims.”
On Jan. 10, relatives of Abdu Nsera, a recent high school graduate in Katende village near Busede, Jinja District, beat him after finding out he had left Islam to become a Christian. They burned down a house they had built for him and have been searching for him after he fled.
On Jan. 27 in Numuseru village, Naboa Sub-County in Budaka District, the body of Laurence Maiso was found at his house, his head in a pool of blood. Four days earlier, Imam Kamulali Hussein had met him and his wife on a local road and told him, “Allah is about to send to you the Angel of Death in your house. Please prepare to meet him at any time.”
On Dec. 23, 2015, a pastor in eastern Uganda was hacked to death as he and other church members resisted an effort by Muslims to take over their land in Nansololo village near Mazuba, in Namutumba District, area church leaders said. Pastor Bongo Martin is survived by a widow and two children.
In another area of eastern Uganda, five underground Christians in a predominantly Muslim village, including a pregnant mother, died from a pesticide put into their food after a Bible study on Dec. 18, area sources said. The Bible study took place in Kachomo village, Kachomo Sub-County, Budaka District at the home of Hajii Suleiman Sajjabi, a convert from Islam who had begun the study with eight family members who had come to faith in Christ under his influence.
Four of Sajjabi's relatives have died, as did a pregnant neighbor, according to area sources. A doctor at Mbale Regional Hospital said a postmortem test showed a substance known as Malathion, a low-toxicity pesticide, in those who had died. Though low-level toxic, Malathion when ingested quickly metabolizes into highly toxic Tomalaoxon.
Islamic extremists in eastern Uganda on Dec. 8, 2015 set a deadly trap for a Christian policeman who had left Islam, and the next day other hard-line Muslims kidnapped three children from another convert in a nearby village. More than 20 Muslim extremists in the Komodo area of Kadama Sub-County, Kibuku District, killed officer Ismail Kuloba at about 4 p.m. after he responded to an urgent call to intervene in a supposed land dispute between warring parties, an area Christian told Morning Star News. Kuloba was 43.
One of the assailants, Mudangha Kasimu, threw a stone that hit Kuloba in the forehead. Kasimu then shot him twice in the head, and he died as other Muslims were shouting, ‘Allah Akbar [God is greater],'” sources said.
About 12 miles east in Kabuna, near Budaka in Kaderuna District, a group of Muslim men from Pallisa on Dec. 9 kidnapped three children of Madengho Badir, a Christian convert from Islam, sources said. Badir, 42, arrived at his home in Kabuna Sub-County, Kabuna parish, at 10 p.m. to find 5-year-old Nabukwasi Shakira, 7-year-old Gessa Amuza and 10-year-old Wagti Musitafa missing.
An area source said a 14-year-old boy from Kabuna, Karami Hassan, was with Badir's three children when they were abducted near their home. The boy said a group of Muslims from Pallisa were looking for Badir, and the boy led them to Badir's children.
Outside of Kabeshai, near Pallisa, a Christian father of five who supported 10 children whose families had disowned them for leaving Islam was killed on Dec. 2. One of three men who attacked Patrick Ojangole reproached him for failing to heed a warning to cease his Christian activities before the Christian was killed, said a witness who was with Ojangole and escaped. Ojangole was 43.
On Nov. 12, 2015, the father of a young Muslim woman in east Uganda tried to beat her to death after she became a Christian, but community leaders intervened and limited him to disowning her, sources said. Kibida Muyemba learned that his 21-year-old daughter, Namusisi Birye, had put her faith in Christ at an evangelistic campaign held that day in Nandere village, Kadama Sub-County, Kibuku District, 41 kilometers (25 miles) west of Mbale, church leaders told Morning Star News. Birye and a man in the traditional dress of an imam confessed openly to receiving Christ, they said, and angry Muslims cut the event short.
On Oct. 19, 2015, Muslims in Kalampete village, Kibuku District who were angry at a Christian for leaving Islam killed his wife, a month after his brother was killed for the same reason. Mamwikomba Mwanika, mother of three adult children and five others ranging in age from 17 to 9, died en route to a hospital after Muslims unknown to her dragged her from her home at about 9 p.m. and assaulted her, survivors said.
Her husband's brother, Samson Nfunyeku, was killed in the village on Sept. 23 after flaring tempers cut short a religious debate he'd had with Islamic scholars.
In Nsinze village, Namutumba District, a Muslim beat and left for dead his wife and 18-year-old son on Aug. 11 after learning they had converted to Christianity, area sources said. Issa Kasoono beat and strangled his wife, Jafalan Kadondi, but she survived, said a source who requested anonymity. He said other relatives joined Kasoono in beating her and their two sons, Ibrahim Kasoono, 18, and Ismael Feruza, 16, though the younger son managed to escape with only bruises on his arm.
The wife of a former sheikh was poisoned to death on June 17, 2015 after she and her husband put their faith in Christ in Nabuli village, Kibuku District. Namumbeiza Swabura was the mother of 11 children, including a 5-month-old baby.
In Kiryolo, Kaderuna Sub-County, Budaka District on March 28, 2015, five Muslims gang-raped the 17-year-old daughter of a pastor because the church leader ignored their warnings that he stop worship services, she said.

NEW YORK (AP) — Lynn Redgrave, an introspective and independent player in her family's acting dynasty who became a 1960s sensation as the unconventional title character of “Georgy Girl” and later dramatized her troubled past in such one-woman stage performances as “Shakespeare for My Father” and “Nightingale,” has died. She was 67.
Her publicist Rick Miramontez, speaking on behalf of her children, said Redgrave died peacefully Sunday night at her home in Kent, Conn. Children Ben, Pema and Annabel were with her, as were close friends.
“Our beloved mother Lynn Rachel passed away peacefully after a seven year journey with breast cancer,” Redgrave's children said in a statement Monday. “She lived, loved and worked harder than ever before. The endless memories she created as a mother, grandmother, writer, actor and friend will sustain us for the rest of our lives. Our entire family asks for privacy through this difficult time.”
Redgrave was diagnosed with breast cancer in December 2002, had a mastectomy in January 2003 and underwent chemotherapy.
Her death comes a year after her niece Natasha Richardson died from head injuries sustained in a skiing accident and just a month after the death of her older brother, Corin Redgrave.
The youngest child of Michael Redgrave and Rachel Kempson, Lynn Redgrave never quite managed the acclaim — or notoriety — of elder sibling Vanessa Redgrave, but received Oscar nominations for “Georgy Girl” and “Gods and Monsters,” and Tony nominations for “Mrs. Warren's Profession,” ”Shakespeare for My Father” and “The Constant Wife.” In recent years, she also made appearances on TV in “Ugly Betty,” ”Law & Order” and “Desperate Housewives.”
“Vanessa was the one expected to be the great actress,” Lynn Redgrave told The Associated Press in 1999. “It was always, ‘Corin's the brain, Vanessa the shining star, oh, and then there's Lynn.'”
In theater, the ruby-haired Redgrave often displayed a sunny, sweet and open personality, much like her ebullient offstage personality. It worked well in such shows as “Black Comedy” — her Broadway debut in 1972 — and again two years later in “My Fat Friend,” a comedy about an overweight young woman who sheds pounds to find romance.
Redgrave's play “Nightingale” at off-Broadway's Manhattan Theatre Club in 2009 was the last time she appeared on stage in New York. Lights on Broadway marquees will be dimmed Tuesday.
“She was adored by audiences, and although she embarked on a medical treatment as previews began, she never missed a show and gave magnificent performances eight times a week,” said Lynne Meadow, artistic director of MTC.
“We admired her strength, her talent, her courage and her enormous good heart. There wasn't a stage hand, a press rep, a box office person who didn't worship Lynn. She was true theatre royalty.”
Tall and blue-eyed like her sister, she was as open about her personal life as Vanessa has been about politics. In plays and in interviews, Lynn Redgrave confided about her family, her marriage and her health. She acknowledged that she suffered from bulimia and served as a spokeswoman for Weight Watchers. With daughter Annabel Clark, she released a 2004 book about her fight with cancer, “Journal: A Mother and Daughter's Recovery From Breast Cancer.”
Redgrave was born in London in 1943 and despite self-doubts pursued the family trade. She studied at London's Central School of Speech and Drama, and was not yet 20 when she debuted professionally on stage in a London production of “A Midsummer's Night Dream.” Like her siblings, she appeared in plays and in films, working under Noel Coward and Laurence Olivier as a member of the National Theater and under director/brother-in-law Tony Richardson in the 1963 screen hit “Tom Jones.”
“Before I was born, my father was a movie star and a stage star,” the actress told the AP in 1993. “I was raised in a household where we didn't see our parents in the morning. We lived in the nursery. Our nanny made our breakfast, and I was dressed up to go downstairs to have tea with my parents, if they were there.”
True fame caught her with “Georgy Girl,” billed as “the wildest thing to hit the world since the miniskirt.” The 1966 film starred Redgrave as the plain, childlike Londoner pursued by her father's middle-aged boss, played by James Mason.
Dismissed by critic Pauline Kael as a false testament to free thinking, the movie was branded “cool” by moviegoers on both side of the Atlantic and received several Academy Award nominations, including one for Redgrave and one for the popular title song performed by the Australian group The Seekers.
“All the films I've been in — and I haven't been in that many attention-getting films — no one expected anything of, least of all me,” Redgrave said in an AP interview in 1999.
“Georgy Girl” didn't lead to lasting commercial success, but did anticipate a long-running theme: Redgrave's weight. She weighed 180 pounds while making the film, leading New York Times critic Michael Stern to complain that Redgrave “cannot be quite as homely as she makes herself in this film.
“Slimmed down, cosseted in a couture salon, and given more of the brittle, sophisticated lines she tosses off with such abandon here, she could become a comedienne every bit as good as the late Kay Kendall,” he wrote.
Films such as “The Happy Hooker” and “Every Little Crook and Nanny” were remembered less than Redgrave's decision to advocate for Weight Watchers. She even referenced “Georgy Girl” in one commercial, showing a clip and saying, “This was me when I made the movie, because this is the way I used to eat.”
At age 50, Redgrave was ready to tell her story in full. As she wrote in the foreword to “Shakespeare for My Father,” she was out of work and set off on a “journey that began almost as an act of desperation,” writing a play out of her “passionately emotional desire” to better understand her father, who had died in 1985.
In the 1993 AP interview, Redgrave remembered her father as a fearless stage performer yet a shy, tormented man who had great difficulty talking to his youngest daughter.
“I didn't really know him,” Redgrave said. “I lived in his house. I was in awe of him and I adored him, and I was terrified of him and I hated him and I loved him, all in one go.”
Redgrave credited the play, which interspersed readings from Shakespeare with family memories, with bringing her closer to her relatives and reviving her film career. She played the supportive wife of pianist David Helfgott in “Shine” and received an Oscar nomination as the loyal housekeeper for filmmaker James Whale in “Gods and Monsters.” She also appeared in “Peter Pan,” ”Kinsey” and “Confessions of a Shopaholic.”
On stage, she looked at her mother's side of the family in “The Mandrake Root” and “Rachel and Juliet.”
“Nightingale” touched upon her health, the life of her grandmother (Beatrice Kempson) and the end of her 32-year marriage to actor-director John Clark, who had disclosed that he had fathered a child with the future wife of their son Benjamin. She sat at a desk and worked from a script, but it didn't affect what the AP called “her touching, beautifully realized performance,” the AP wrote last year.
Lynn Redgrave is survived by six grandchildren, her sister Vanessa, and four nieces and nephews.
A private funeral will be held later this week.
he Allahabad High Court had ordered in 1964 that no public mosque existed at the disputed land bought by the Guru Singh Sabha gurdwara in Saharanpur, for further construction, which led to riots in this Uttar Pradesh city last Saturday.
Muharram Ali Pappu, a former Congress councillor was arrested on Wednesday by the local police as the main conspirator in the riots, which took the lives of three people. The city magistrate had given an adverse report against him as the one instigating the trouble over the disputed land in 2011, a copy of which is with The Sunday Guardian.
According to an order passed by a Saharanpur court on 15 May last year, while due debts were being recovered from the original owner of the disputed property, some persons claimed that a public mosque existed at the site and filed a petition before a special district judge, which was dismissed. "Against the said order a petition was filed before the honourable High Court and the court made it clear via its order dated 01-09-1964 that no public mosque existed at the disputed site. That order is the final order. No appeal has been made against it," said the order. The Sunday Guardian has a copy of the order.
The order added that at present, no mosque has been found at the disputed property nor was namaaz being offered by anyone. The order mentioned that false claims had been made about the presence of a public mosque at the site.
"Hence it is proved that according to available evidence as per the petitions neither did any public property form part of the disputed property nor was it in use," said the order.
The case (no. 744/10) was fought between Gurnam Singh Sahni, general secretary of the Guru Singh Sabha gurdwara committee and one Abdul Wahab, apparently the mutawalli of the mosque.
The report by the city magistrate earlier stated that Pappu was a "notorious professional leader" and one of those "persons who wanted to disrupt communal harmony." The report said that Pappu was using Abdul Wahab, a labourer, as a front because he had cases against him multiple police stations in the city. Wahab later admitted being influenced by Pappu for filing the case.
The report added that "the probe till now has not revealed the presence of any mosque nor have people from the Muslim community made any statements regarding it".
It further mentioned that the municipal council had also not found the presence of any mosque from 1947 to 1967, as it deposed during the cases which went on in the said time period. "The common people also rejected the presence of any mosque here," read the report.
In its petition to the Sahranpur court, Guru Singh Sabha contended that they bought two adjoining plots in 2001 from one Anurag Atri and others. The Singh Sabha sought permission from Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee and began the construction of a gurdwara, after taking due permission from the concerned authorities. The first owner of the property was Sheikh Md. Aksari and due to some legal issues, his property had to be auctioned. At that time, one Khalil Ahmad objected that the disputed property had a public mosque in its north-west corner and thus it could not be auctioned. Aksari sought permission from the then sub-divisional magistrate to sell it off and it was granted. Consequently, he sold it off to two women. A petition was filed challenging the sale in the court of the special judge, Saharanpur which was dismissed on 02-12-1951. Subsequently, the Allahabad High Court also dismissed it.
After buying the property, the Singh Sabha began construction and faced objections following which a case was filed in 2010.
In response, the defendant Abdul Wahab said that he was the mutawalli of the said mosque and was against the sale of the disputed property. He alleged that the Singh Sabha presented a wrong map of the property to the authorities and thus got the permission. He contended that Aksari used around 535.69 square meter land for private purposes as a mosque. Initially, it was not in public use.
He added that following differences between the two women buyers, the matter went to court and Pandit Padam Prasad was declared the owner of one part of the property. His descendants, including Anurag Atri and others sold it off to the Singh Sabha. Wahab claimed that the mosque continued to exist and it was taken over by the Sunni Central Waqf Board in Lucknow but slowly, it lost out on most devotees.
In its order, the court noted that Wahab had later admitted that he was illiterate and had signed the affidavit without reading it. He also made a u-turn on ever having accepted that there used to be a mosque at the disputed property and that it was ever in use.
Wahab admitted that he had been misled by Pappu who offered him financial inducement and got him to file the affidavit.
It is 30 years since the publication of a slim volume of articles and essays titled Small is Beautiful - a key text of the nascent environmental movement. The year 1973 was a timely one for radical environmental thinking. The first UN conference on sustainable development had been held the previous year, and soon after, within months of each other, Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and the UK Green party were founded.
Small is Beautiful rapidly became a bestseller, and its author, EF Schumacher, was feted by international leaders and counterculture activists alike. Today, Schumacher is less well known, but the ideas he popularised helped shape modern environmentalism, development theory and the global justice movement.
Equal parts economic analysis, spiritual tract and radical manifesto, the book reflected the contradictory nature of its author - a patrician academic who was also passionately interested in Eastern philosophy. What bound his work was a central belief that modern society had lost touch with basic human needs and values - and in doing so had failed both the planet and its people.
In the name of profit and technological progress, Schumacher argued, modern economic policies had created rampant inefficiency, environmental degradation and dehumanising labour conditions. "Ever bigger machines, entailing ever bigger concentrations of economic power and exerting ever greater violence against the environment, do not represent progress: they are a denial of wisdom. Wisdom demands a new orientation of science and technology towards the organic, the gentle, the non-violent, the elegant and beautiful," he wrote.
The remedy he proposed - a holistic approach to human society, which stressed small scale, localised solutions - flew in the face of economic orthodoxies of the time: "I have no doubt that it is possible to give a new direction to technological development, a direction that shall lead it back to the real needs of man, and that also means: to the actual size of man. Man is small, and, therefore, small is beautiful."
Western campaigners and governments in the developing world took up his arguments. But today, amid the wholesale imposition of globalisation and free trade, Schumacher's vision of self-sufficient local economies seems quaint and anachronistic. So is small still beautiful?
Born in Bonn in 1911, Schumacher emigrated to England in 1936. He became a British citizen in 1946 and in 1950 became economic adviser to the National Coal Board. For the next 20 years he worked at the heart of the British economic establishment, but visits to India and Burma led him to doubt technocratic certainties. He concluded that the imposition of a Western model of development had bypassed the rural poor. Industrialisation and megaprojects created vast wealth for a few, but left the masses trapped in spiritual and material poverty.
The antidote he called "Buddhist economics" - "a middle way between materialist heedlessness and traditionalist immobility".
Instead of mass production and mechanisation, industry in the developing world should be on a "human scale". Cheap, locally developed solutions would be more effective than imported technologies and have less environmental impact.
In 1966, Schumacher founded the Intermediate Technology Development Group (ITDG), and his work inspired non-government organisations around the world. Today the group supports hundreds of projects, from donkey plough workshops in Sudan to micro-hydroelectric schemes in Nepal, Sri Lanka and Peru.
But Small is Beautiful was never accepted by mainstream economists, who see it as an impractical model for development. The Oxford economist Wilfred Beckerman published a riposte to Schumacher titled Small is Stupid.
Local management of resources has become commonplace in mainstream economics, but localisation and self-sufficiency are not always efficient or even practical, says Julian Morris, director of free-market think-tank the International Policy Network. "Most of the people in the world who currently don't have electricity would benefit from having it. The important thing is to get them electricity in the most efficient and costeffective matter, and avoid pollution. For that, we're not talking about local solutions, but solutions that come from the economies of scale," he says.
"It comes down to whether or not you believe in technological progress and growth," says Philip Stott, professor emeritus in bio-geography at the University of London. "I believe that technology and growth can fundamentally be equated with good."
According to Stott, Schumacher's followers idealise a primitive past while ignoring the benefits of scientific progress. They risk condescension in their attitudes towards the developing world. "There is an element of neo-colonialism - they are trying to regress parts of the world that should be progressing," he says.
But science and technology have not improved basic living conditions for much of humanity, argues Cowan Coventry, chief executive of the ITDG. "Given the dramatic [scientific] advances of the past 40 years, why is it that the number of people living in poverty continues to increase? Why do we find that 2 billion still don't have access to electricity?"
Schumacher's followers may have failed to take up the wider implications of Small is Beautiful, says Coventry. Despite the tight focus implied in the title, Schumacher proposed an overhaul of the way the global economy is run. "People saw the beauty of local endeavour, but they never really grappled with the bigger issues of how to change macro policies."
Meanwhile, the march of trade liberalisation threatens small-scale manufacture in developing countries, while small-scale agriculture is swamped by subsidised imports.
"We're seeing the same economic model. It's business as usual," says Spencer Fitzgibbon, a member of the Green party national executive. Governments still place their faith in technological advances instead of considering economic re-organisation, he says.
Schumacher's view of mechanisation finds its parallel in today's debates over GM crops and nanotechnology. Once again, hi-tech solutions are being boosted when their benefits are still unclear, argues Coventry. "Extravagant claims are often made about new technologies and their benefits for developing countries. We're sceptical about those claims, especially when they're made by corporate interests. The big question is, can new technology bridge the divide between the haves and the have nots?" It is the same question that Schumacher put 30 years ago.
"Small is Beautiful is a book of many good ideas, and they are more and more relevant today," says Satish Kumar, editor of Resurgence, where many of Schumacher's essays first appeared.
"Schumacher was called a crank, and he quite happily agreed. But what is a crank? It's a small element in a machine that makes revolutions."
Tony Blair is back in town with a speech about his new “mission”: persuading the British people that they made the wrong call in backing Brexit.
Labour's last election winner will tell listeners that people voted “without knowledge of the true terms of Brexit”, and that as those terms “become clear”, it is the right of the people to change their mind – and the duty of pro-Europeans to do so.
It's a measure of the febrile nature of British politics that an observation that is, to be frank, banal in the extreme is considered heretical or controversial.
Brexit might well be a success – I laid out one possible path towards that here – but it is hard to see how it will be a success that unifies half of the electorate. Blair is right, too, that just because we can see a path to making "the best of a bad job doesn't alter the fact that it isn't wise to put yourself in that position unless you have to". For those of us who still think Britain is better of in the European Union, that the promises extended to the 52 per cent cannot be reconciled with one another, let alone the 48 per cent, is reason to retain the option of a do-over if it doesn't work out.
The bulk of Labour voters who opted to leave wanted protectionism, lower immigration and higher public spending – and only one of those is likely to be forthcoming under Theresa May. Ethnic minorities who backed Brexit in Newham and Birmingham did so because they hoped for fairer and more humane visa conditions for the nations of the Commonwealth. Good luck with that.
As far as the Conservative electoral coalition is concerned, free trade with the rest of the world may please the Brexit elite in SW1, but is less likely to appeal to the agricultural seats they represent in the House of Commons - particularly if it leads to the emergence of non-tariff barriers to trade with the EU.
All of which assumes that Brexit is a success. If Britain falls out of the EU without a deal, if a hard border between Northern Ireland and the South reignites conflict in that part of the United Kingdom, and if Scotland falls out of the Union, that will have consequences for public support for Brexit, too. That Theresa May has made a series of unforced errors which have reduced British leverage only increases the risk on that score. Blair is right to say that the break-up of the United Kingdom is "back on the table" as a result of the Brexit vote.
So it's not unreasonable or particularly remarkable that pro-Europeans should still retain hope of winning a second referendum. What is unreasonable and downright sinister is the insistence of a vocal section of the Brexit elite and their media allies that it is remarkable or undemocratic to ask for a second opinion.
A Woodcraft Folk meeting in North West London, 1947 (Photo: Getty)

I was around 11 years old, with a large group of adults and children walking through a woodland in south Dorset. Jeremy Corbyn was patiently explaining to me an aspect of the rail franchising system.
No, this wasn't my dream last night. This was the Woodcraft Folk, the anti-Scouts youth movement once derided on a prime-time comedy panel show for having “wicker uniforms”. I joined the Folk when I was six.
On Wednesday evenings we'd variously play bulldog in a community centre hall, learn about the invasion of East Timor, or go swimming at Archway pool. A few weekends a year we'd head to a youth hostel in Surrey or Epping Forest, where we'd build campfires and fail to read Ordnance Survey maps on nine-mile hikes. In the summer we'd take our tents further afield.
Corbyn on clan duty
Woodcraft's groups, age-divided into Elfins, Pioneers and Venturers, are run by parents and volunteers – so Corbyn became involved in our Highgate and Holloway district when his son Tommy joined. The Islington North MP – not that I knew he was that initially – became a familiar presence on camps.
He took part in “clan” duty – doing the cooking or washing up. And in the best Woodcraft spirit, listened more than he talked. One November evening Corbyn even took our entire group of 10 to 12-year-olds to Parliament to meet Tony Benn.
It's not just Corbyn's unexpected success that may now put the Woodcraft Folk in the spotlight. Two of Labour's new MPs are woodies. Lloyd Russell-Moyle, who unseated the Conservative Simon Kirby in Brighton Kemptown, is the former chair of the Folk. Alex Sobel, the new MP for Leeds North West, helped re-start a group his two children attend.
Thinking for ourselves
The Woodcraft Folk might seem like the nursery of an Islington North alt-world of allotments, beards and muesli. But far from indoctrinating young people, the Woodcraft Folk taught kids like me to think for ourselves. Unlike my friends in the Scouts, I was never made to swear allegiance to God and the queen.
We swore allegiance, if you like, to each other. Our camps were way cheaper than school trips, and we joined groups from Handsworth in Birmingham, and the former mining community of Stanley in County Durham. Not to mention Woodcraft Folk-equivalents from across the world.
Changing the world
Russell-Moyle told me that seeing Woodcraft as an escape from the real world missed the point. “Capitalist education, like scouting, is about fitting people into society,” he said. “Liberal education is about creating an alternative world. The point of socialist education is… you take people out so that [they] can go back into real world to not just reject the world we have, but change it.”
Woodcraft is different from “summer camp activities”, Russell-Moyle says, because it's not just about the benefit for individuals. “You go along [to weekly group nights] and you build up a collective,” he says. “And that's one of the fundamentals about the Labour party.”
A mass movement?
Woodcraft gives activists a “resilience about bureaucracy”, Russell-Moyle says. Tony Benn said Labour had “never been a socialist party, but it's always had socialists in it”. The same could be said of the 92-year-old Woodcraft Folk. It's always has had socialist, environmental and liberal currents.
Sobel says: “The Scouts and the Guides have modernised, but they're still not secular youth organisations. It would be good for us a party and a movement to make Woodcraft a mass movement for young people who share those values.”
It was, after all, Sobel says, a “huge increase in youth participation which got both me and Lloyd elected”. Russell-Moyle concurs. “Jeremy Corbyn having a Woodcraft Folk background makes it easier for woodies – young people sceptical about mainstream politics – to see an alternative that inspires them,” he says.
But of course it's not just about the one man – “there's a group of people leading the party who inspire that confidence”. Corbyn repeatedly urged voters not to “walk by on the other side of the street” over the campaign.
I can't help but think of the song we'd sing at the end of our Elfin group nights in that draughty community hall, which ended: “Should any be weary, we'll help them along.”
In the past week, Puerto Rico was devastated by Hurricane Maria and a bunch of millionaire NFL players took a knee during the national anthem.
Guess which one President Donald Trump tweeted about the most? If you don't know, the mainstream media has been more than happy to let everyone know. Trump tweeted nearly 20 times about the NFL protest but devoted only one tweet to Puerto Rico.
Monday evening, Trump began tweeting about Puerto Rico, talking about its poor infrastructure and financial problems from before the hurricane hit. Naturally, Leftists weren't happy, and the media was again able to attack Trump for his tweets being “not well received.”
Because, apparently, the only thing Trump does is tweet.
Article after article condemned Trump for focusing on the NFL (in tweets) instead of Puerto Rico (in tweets). Leftist after leftist also began claiming the damage in Puerto Rico would be Trump's “Katrina,” in reference to the hurricane that devastated the Gulf Coast during President George W. Bush's administration.
The Daily Beast published an article titled “Puerto Rico has become Trump's Katrina.” Vox writer and Gaza bridge expert Zack Beauchamp tweeted out an article from his employer and wrote that it was “hard” to read the article “without concluding that Puerto Rico is actually Trump's Katrina.” FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver also noted “Some obvious parallels to Katrina here.”
Perhaps the nastiest (now apparently deleted) tweet came from former Obama Senior Adviser Dan Pfieffer, who claimed, “If Puerto Rico had electoral votes, help would already be on the way, but it doesn't so Trump and Republicans are in no rush.”
The message was clear: Trump was doing nothing to help Puerto Rico (based on liberal bias and tweets).
As it turns out, it was the media ignoring Puerto Rico—not Trump.
PBS's John Yang spoke to Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello about the help he has received from the states. Rosselo immediately said he was “very grateful for the administration” and that “they have responded quickly.”
“The president has been very attentive to the situation, personally calling me several times,” Rossello said. “FEMA and the FEMA director have been here in Puerto Rico twice. As a matter of fact, they were here with us today, making sure that all the resources in FEMA were working in conjunction with the central government.”
He asked Congress to quickly provide an aid package to the island.
Politico reported, “Rossello and other officials praised the federal government for planning its response in detail before the storm hit, a contrast with what Puerto Rico has long seen as the neglect of 3.4 million Americans living in a territory without a vote in Congress or the electoral college.”
Tweets mean nothing. It takes no effort at all to send one. Acting like Trump actually spent all day Monday caring about the NFL because of what he tweeted is absurd. Does the media really think all he does is tweet? It sure seems like it. They would rather write dozens of articles about every single one of the president's tweets than look into what he's actually doing.
Or maybe they can't. Maybe humping President Barack Obama's leg for eight years has made the current Republican administration unwilling to share as much information, because they know it'll be spun negatively.
I'm not defending Trump's tweets. I wish he'd stop. Just 21 percent of Americans use Twitter, and a good chunk of them aren't using it to follow the news and snark in opposition (like me and other members of the media).
It would just be nice if the leftist media could report what's really going on, instead of creating a narrative and reporting only what defends that narrative.

FORSYTH COUNTY, N.C. — A Forsyth County emergency dispatcher has been suspended with pay over comments he made that were picked up in a 911 recording connected to Maya Angelou's death, according to the Winston-Salem Journal.
Angelou, 86, famed poet, actress and activist, died early Wednesday morning at her home in Winston-Salem after a long illness.
In the county's recording of the 911 call made by Angelou's caretaker, an emergency dispatcher can be heard in the background discussing an interview Oprah Winfrey did last fall with the BBC that generated some controversy.
Winfrey and Angelou were close friends.
“These comments are unacceptable and we have opened an internal investigation to look into the circumstances surrounding this event,” Forsyth County EMS Director Dan Ozimek said in a statement. Editor's note: The comments are made at the 5-minute mark in the video.
Ozimek said the telecommunicator, John Ruckh, has been suspended with pay pending the investigation. Ruckh has worked for Forsyth County EMS for 24 years.
Ozimek said he discovered Ruckh's conversation when reviewing the tape on Wednesday. Ruckh was not the primary dispatcher on the call but was in the same room.
The conversation is a bit garbled on the 911 recording and takes up less than a minute of the 7-minute call, but Ruckh appears to be saying that “Oprah has fallen out of grace” with a lot of people and asks someone if they have heard her recent rant. He says she is upset because people are not supportive of President Barack Obama and, apparently paraphrasing one of her statements, says that racism is alive because so many white people have been raised in the era of hating black people.
Ruckh explained To Thursday that he was just having a conversation with another co-worker about an interview he had seen.
“Unfortunately, I work in a high-profile job and everything's recorded,” Ruckh said.
Ruckh said he regrets the timing of the conversation. He described Angelou as a “wonderful human being” for whom he had “the utmost respect.”
“This is in no way a racial slur, slander, associated conversation,” said Ruckh, who is Caucasian.
In a video interview posted Nov. 13 on www.bbc.com, Winfrey speaks with the BBC's Will Gompertz about her role in “The Butler” and the racial themes addressed in the film.
When speaking about racism, Winfrey says during the interview, “There are still generations of people, older people, who were born and bred and marinated in it, in that prejudice and racism, and they just have to die.”
The interviewer also asked her about Obama and if it has crossed her mind that some of the treatment he has faced is because he is black.
“I think that there's a level of disrespect for the office that occurs, and that occurs in some cases and maybe even many cases because he's African American,” Winfrey said.
Despite his suspension, Ruckh said Thursday that he has nothing but the utmost respect for the county.
“In Emergency Services, we deal with a lot of pain and suffering and we make decisions in split seconds to know how to do, what to do and who to send. … However, sometimes we become calloused and insensitive. I really hate that this happened at the time that it did, because this is taking away from Maya Angelou's passing,” Ruckh said.
“It is our hope that these comments will not overshadow the celebration of Maya Angelou's positive impact that she has had to this community and around the world,” Ozimek said. “We offer our deepest sympathy to Maya Angelou's family and friends.”
Ozimek said the primary dispatcher, Shannon Brooks, did “an excellent job” managing the emergency call.
In the 911 recording, one of Angelou's caretakers says she thinks that Angelou has died and that Angelou had said she did not want to be resuscitated.
Brooks can be heard asking the caretaker if she has a yellow form with a stop sign on it that indicates that Angelou did not want to be resuscitated in case of a medical emergency. The caretaker responds by saying that someone else has all of Angelou's paper work and that that person is on the way. Brooks tells the caretaker that since the form is not there he will give instructions on how to provide treatment.
Ozimek said that the form referred to in the conversation is obtained by a patient and their doctor from the state office of emergency medical services. The yellow form has a stop sign on it and bears the words “DO NOT RESUSCITATE ORDER” prominently in red. The order states that in the event the patient's heart stops beating or the patient stops breathing, no resuscitation should be attempted. The order doesn't affect any other care that the patient's condition indicates, including care to provide comfort.

Steve Hansen fires warning shot at McKenzie TOBY ROBSON
All Blacks coach Steve Hansen has fired a shot across Australian opposite Ewen McKenzie's bow.
Hansen said today that he believed his Wallabies counterpart was racked with uncertainty over whether to play Quade Cooper or Matt Toomua at first five-eighth.
Asked if he felt mentally challenged by the intense secrecy that has surrounded Australia's line-up for Saturday's Bledisloe Cup match in Sydney, Hansen said: "No. The better question would be is he [McKenzie] feeling a bit mentally challenged because he doesn't know which five-eighth he wants to play?
"He's in a difficult situation, isn't he. I'm imagining when [former coach] Robbie Deans wasn't picking Quade Cooper he was saying, 'I'll pick you, I'll pick you'.
"Now our information is he's going to pick the other bloke [Toomua]. There are only two reasons he wouldn't want to tell them.
"One, he's not sure himself, or two, he doesn't think they can cope with the pressure of being out there in the public too early.
"So it's not affecting us. It doesn't bother me a hoot who they play."
He believed Toomua would be at first-five and that his Brumbies team-mates, Christian Lealiifano and Tevita Kuridrani, would play outside him.
The All Blacks expect the Wallabies to mimic the Brumbies' rushing defensive screen in the backs in a bid to put them under pressure behind the advantage line.
But whatever combination McKenzie picks, Hansen made it clear the Wallabies would be under intense pressure because of the arrival of a new coach.
"I only have to think back myself to when I had my first test match as [All Blacks] coach," he said.
"Whether you want to admit it publicly, there is pressure because there's a question mark.
"Australia hasn't had a great run against us for a wee while now. That's all been attributed to Robbie Deans, which I think is a bit unfair.
"Everyone seems to think Ewen is going to make the difference, so there has to be pressure on him, because what happens if it doesn't work?
"There's a lot of pressure and that's why they will turn up and give it everything they've got. We need to match that intensity or better it."
Hansen said Wellington hooker Dane Coles' omission from the All Blacks squad was not a reflection of his scrummaging ability.
"Dane's problem is he hasn't played. He got injured just after the second test [against France] and hasn't played any rugby. He's done a lot of running," he said.
"The coaching staff, along with the wellbeing group, thought it would be better if he got 40 or 50 minutes tonight [for Wellington], then be available next week. That's the only reason he missed out."
Hansen said it was incorrect to say the selectors believed the new scrum rules being used during the Rugby Championship better suited older hookers Andrew Hore and Keven Mealamu.
"I don't think so. I just think they will reward people who can scrum. Colesy can scrum, so I'm reasonably happy with where he's at," he said.
"We just need to give him some game time and some confidence with his calf."
Hansen indicated Chiefs lock Brodie Retallick would have pushed hard for a starting berth had he not missed last Friday's training match, where the All Blacks got their first chance to trial the new scrum laws.
"That's part of the reason. We have three really good locks. We can only start with two of them," he said.
The Wallabies are expected to name their side today.

Considering how important coaches are to teams or even making preseason predictions, Athlon is taking a look at how each conference stacks up with its head coach rankings for 2013.
Ranking the coaches in any college football conference is a difficult task. Many factors play into just how successful a coach is at any school. How well are the assistants paid? Are the facilities up to par with the rest of the conference? Can the coach recruit or is he more of an X's and O's manager? Are there off-the-field or age issues to take into consideration? Has a coach built a program or continued the success from a previous coach? How is the resume outside of their current position? These questions and more were posed to the editors at Athlon Sports, as they were asked to rank the coaches of each of the six BCS conferences. One thing to keep in mind - the record is not always indicative of where a coach should rank in a conference.
Ranking the Big Ten Head Coaches for 2013
1. Urban Meyer, Ohio State
Record at Ohio State: 12-0 (2012-present)
Record at Florida: 65-15 (2005-2010)
Record at Utah: 22-2 (2003-04)
Record at Bowling Green: 17-6 (2001-02)
Overall Record: 116-23 (11 years)
Really the only thing left on Meyerâs resume is to defeat an SEC school in the national championship. In his first year at Ohio State, he took a 6-7 Buckeyes team and turned them into a perfect 12-0 program, proving his past successes were no fluke. He already claims two BCS National Championships, four conference titles (would have been five had OSU been eligible last year), three conference Coach of the Year awards, one Heisman winner and one national Coach of the Year honor. In each stop along the way, Meyer has proven to have an immediate impact on the program be it at Bowling Green, Utah, Florida or Ohio State. He is an elite recruiter and an elite talent developer. No, he isnât the nicest or most honest guy in the business, but his teams are extremely well coached and they win big.
2. Pat Fitzgerald, Northwestern
Overall Record at Northwestern: 50-39 (2006-present, 7 years)
Fitzgerald is the perfect fit at Northwestern, and he continues to take the program to new heights. The Illinois native starred at linebacker for the Wildcats from 1993-96 and was a two-time Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year. Fitzgerald had no coordinator experience when he was promoted to the top spot at Northwestern and took over the program in a difficult time, replacing Randy Walker after his unexpected death in 2006. Despite his inexperience on the sidelines, Fitzgerald has been a home-run hire for Northwestern. The Wildcats are 50-39 under his watch and have played in five consecutive bowl games. Northwestern earned its first bowl victory since the 1949 Rose Bowl by beating Mississippi State 34-20 in last season's Gator Bowl. Fitzgerald is never going to reel in top-25 recruiting classes, but he has done a good job of finding and developing plenty of talent during his tenure. As long as Fitzgerald stays on the sidelines in Evanston, expect the Wildcats to remain a consistent contender in the Big Ten Legends Division, and they could start 2013 in the preseason top 25.
3. Brady Hoke, Michigan
Record at Michigan: 19-7 (2011-present)
Record at San Diego State: 13-12 (2009-10)
Record at Ball State: 34-38 (2003-08)
Overall Record: 66-57 (10 years)
After turning around Ball State and San Diego State, Hoke was Michiganâs pick to lead the program back to national prominence. So far, so good. The Wolverines are 19-7 under Hokeâs watch and have back-to-back 6-2 records in conference play. Michigan also won the Sugar Bowl against Virginia Tech to cap its first season under Hokeâs watch and has finished each of the past two seasons ranked in the Associated Press top 25. Although Hoke posted an overall losing mark at Ball State (34-38), the program didnât have a winning record in the six seasons prior to his arrival. He was able to guide the Cardinals to back-to-back bowl games for the first time in school history, including a 12-1 regular season record in 2008. San Diego State was considered an annual underachiever prior to Hoke, but he led the Aztecs to the 2010 Poinsettia Bowl â their first postseason appearance since 1998. As a Michigan man, Hoke is a perfect fit in Ann Arbor. And after two seasons, Hoke has the Wolverines poised once again to be a threat to win the Big Ten title every year.
Â
4. Mark Dantonio, Michigan State
Record at Michigan State: 51-28 (2007-present)
Record at Cincinnati: 18-17 (2004-06)
Overall Record: 51-28 (9 years)
The Spartans underachieved in 2012, but Dantonioâs overall record in six years in East Lansing is a rock-solid 51-28. The Texas native has guided Michigan State to six consecutive bowl berths and recorded back-to-back 11-win campaigns in 2010-11. Dantonioâs 2011 team played for the Big Ten Championship, and the 2012 squad tied for the conference title. Prior to his tenure with Michigan State, Dantonio recorded an 18-17 record in three years with Cincinnati, which included two bowl appearances. Michigan State has the resources to be a consistent top-25 program but was considered an underachiever before Dantonioâs arrival. Despite slipping to 7-6 in 2012, Dantonio will have Michigan State back in the mix for the Big Ten Legends Division.

5. Bill OâBrien, Penn State
Overall Record at Penn State: 8-4 (Penn State, 2012-present)
Bill Belichick assistants havenât exactly gone on to do big things as head coaches, but in one short year, OâBrien might be on his way to being the best of the Patriots' coachâs offspring. There is little viable evidence in favor of or against OâBrien as a head coach other than the job he did in his first year in Happy Valley. In the face of the worst NCAA scandal in history, he won eight games with an offense that was more creative and innovative than fans at Penn State had seen in nearly a decade. He also recruited extremely well considering the circumstances. The sample size is extraordinarily small and the situation is still difficult to quantify. That said, it's pretty clear that OâBrien has won most of Nittany Nation over in one quick season. And if his growing interest from NFL executives is any indication, Penn State has found a good one in the Brown University graduate.

6. Gary Andersen, Wisconsin
Record at Wisconsin: 0-0 (First Season)
Record at Utah State: 26-24 (2009-2012)
Record at Southern Utah: 4-7 (2003)
Overall Record: 30-31 (5 years)
Donât be fooled by Andersenâs 30-31 career record. The Utah native is an excellent coach who should win big in Madison. Prior to his first head coaching job at Southern Utah in 2003, Andersen worked as an assistant at Northern Arizona and Utah. And after a one-year stint as the Thunderbirds head coach, he rejoined the Utesâ coaching staff and stayed in Salt Lake City until 2009, when he was picked to lead Utah State. Andersen turned the Aggies from WAC bottom feeder to a title contender, leading Utah State to an 11-2 record in 2012 with a top-20 finish in the Associated Press' poll. Andersen doesnât have experience coaching in the Big Ten, but he is familiar with Urban Meyer since he served as his defensive line coach with the Utes in 2004. Despite his lack of familiarity with the Big Ten, Andersen has been successful at each of his coaching stops, and Utah State showed big improvement in each of his four seasons. With Meyer leading Ohio State, the Badgers may not match its recent run of three straight Big Ten titles in the near future. However, Wisconsin should be a consistent top-25 team under Andersenâs watch.
7. Bo Pelini, Nebraska
Overall Record at Nebraska: 49-20 (Nebraska, 2003, 2008-present)
Pelini is one of the most intriguing coaches to evaluate among all the BCS conferences, if not the entire FBS pool. He leads one of the most powerful and historic programs in the nation and has resources at his disposal that most schools only dream of. He has led the Cornhuskers to three conference championship games in six seasons in two different leagues and has never won fewer than nine games. He also posted his best conference record with a 7-1 mark a year ago. However, he has also had many uncomfortable (and possibly inappropriate) moments with his players on national television and has never lost fewer than four games in any season. Nebraska is back competing for league championships for the first time since the '90s, but is Pelini treading water at 9-4 each season or was 2012 a glimpse of more to come?
Â
8. Kirk Ferentz, Iowa
Record at Iowa: 100-74 (1999-present)
Record at Maine: 12-21 (1990-92)
Overall Record: 112-95 (17 years)
A few seasons ago, Ferentz would have ranked much higher on this list. However, Iowa has been going in the wrong direction over the last three years. After going 11-22 including an Orange Bowl victory over Georgia Tech in 2009, the Hawkeyes have watched their win total decrease in each of the last three years. This steady decline resulted in a 4-8 mark in 2012, which was Ferentzâs the fewest wins since 2000 (3-9). While Ferentz has led Iowa to 10 bowl games and two BCS bowls, the program seems to have gone stale in recent years, and he certainly didnât make anyone in Iowa City happy when he hired Greg Davis as his offensive coordinator in 2012. Are the Hawkeyes capable of getting back on track under Ferentz? Absolutely. However, with Ohio State and Michigan coming back to national prominence, along with a challenging division (at least for now), Iowa has a tough road to contend in the Big Ten. Ferentz has done a lot of good things for the program, but if the Hawkeyes have a few losing seasons in a row, it might be time for a fresh start for both parties.

9. Jerry Kill, Minnesota
Record at Minnesota: 9-16 (2011-present)
Record at Northern Illinois: 23-16 (2008-10)
Record at Southern Illinois: 55-32 (2001-07)
Record at Emporia State: 11-11 (1999-2000)
Record at Saginaw Valley State: 38-14 (1994-98)
Overall Record: 136-89 (19 years)
Kill isnât flashy or exciting, but he enters 2013 with the most wins during his head coaching career among his Big Ten peers. The Kansas native started his career with Saginaw Valley State in 1994 and recorded a winning record in each of his five seasons. Kill took over at Emporia State in 1999 and left for Southern Illinois in 2001. He went 55-32 with the Salukis, which included five consecutive playoff appearances from 2003-07. After that, Kill led Northern Illinois to three straight bowl trips from 2008-10 and recruited many of the players who played in the Huskiesâ Orange Bowl appearance last season. Minnesota went 3-9 in Killâs first season but improved to 6-7 and earned a bowl berth in 2012. Kill knows how to develop talent and can uncover hidden gems on the recruiting trail. Minnesota isnât an easy job, but Killâs track record shows he can consistently produce a winner. Expect the Golden Gophers to only get better with Kill on the sidelines the next few seasons.
10. Darrell Hazell, Purdue
Record at Purdue: 0-0 (First Season)
Record at Kent State: 16-10 (2011-2012)
Overall Record: 16-10 (2 years)
No one can accuse Hazell of not paying his dues. Born in Cinnaminson, N.J., and playing his college ball at Muskingum University (New Concord, Ohio), Hazell spent 25 years as an assistant before getting his first head coaching gig at Kent State. Doug Martin posted nary a winning season with the Flashes in seven seasons prior to Hazellâs arrival. In just two years, Hazell built KSU into a division champion and set a school record with 11 wins. With heavy coaching ties to the Midwest and Northeast, Hazell should be able to recruit the Big Ten footprint well and clearly has the coaching chops to be successful at Purdue.
Â
11. Kevin Wilson, Indiana
Overall Record at Indiana: 5-19 (Indiana, 2011-present)
Offense has long been the name of the game for Wilson, both at Oklahoma as a coordinator and now at Indiana. After grooming nearly a decadeâs worth of elite passers in Norman, Wilson has quickly turned Indianaâs passing game into one of the Big Tenâs best. His team ranked fifth in the league in passing offense, but managed just one win in his first year in Bloomington. Last season, his team led the league in passing offense and improved to four wins with all signs pointing to even more success â and a possible bowl game â in 2013. There is still much to be accomplished for Wilson to be considered one of the leagueâs better coaches but more progress in Year 3 at Indiana would go a long way to proving that the Hoosiers made the right choice.
Â
12. Tim Beckman, Illinois
Record at Illinois: 2-10 (2012-present)
Record at Toledo: 21-16 (2009-2011)
Overall Record: 23-26 (4 years)
All signs were positive for Beckman when he took over for Ron Zook at Illinois last season. He learned under two respected names in Jim Tressel and Mike Gundy before building Toledo into a MAC contender in his three years leading the Rockets. Everyone knew it was going to take time to rebuild the Illini following the Zooker, however, no one expected a 2-10 debut season in Urbana-Champaign. He has his work cut out for him in a tough division loaded with solid coaches and powerful programs to prove he was the right choice for the job.

BUSINESS OWNERS HAVE said that mandatory sick pay will lead to job losses and absenteeism.
That is according to a major survey of members carried out by ISME, the Irish Small & Medium Enterprises Association.
The survey confirmed that the proposed mandatory sick pay of four weeks for employers will have a disastrous impact on competitiveness, jobs and absenteeism levels, ISME said.
The survey was carried out last week and involved 766 respondents.
According to the results:
93 per cent of companies anticipates job losses.
90 per cent of companies outlined that their cost base would increase if the proposal is introduced.
72 per cent of companies feels that absenteeism levels will increase with only 3 per cent expecting a reduction.
75 per cent of SMEs does not have a sick pay scheme in place.
Commenting on the results, ISME CEO Mark Fielding said that the survey” clearly indicates SME opposition to a plan that will put further pressure on costs, will lead to increased absenteeism and will result in the loss of thousands of jobs, adding to exchequer costs”.
He said that the typical number of days lost per annum due to absenteeism in SMEs is three days and well policed.
It is estimated that the business cost of the measure will be an additional €150m per annum, but this fails to take into account increased absenteeism and loss productivity, said ISME.
Fielding questioned where Minister Joan Burton, who proposed the sick pay, thinks that businesses will find the money to pay sickness benefit on top of replacement pay.
In conclusion Fielding said that the government:
is supposedly promoting and encouraging enterprise and job creation on the one hand while, on the other, this ‘mad-cap' proposal is a definite ‘job-killer' creating an atmosphere of uncertainty among the small business community, which is stymieing business activity, investment and employment creation.
He said the proposal to introduce a mandatory sick pay scheme should be ‘binned'.
Comments from the participants in the survey included:
These proposals are definitely stopping me from hiring a new employee in the coming months.
Small companies would be unable to fund the new proposals.
We had a sick pay scheme of 12 weeks but when thing got bad we had no choice to stop it. When we stop we had a 90 per cent drop in our absenteeism.
I had to introduce a “no sick pay” policy last year. Absenteeism has reduced hugely.

When documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras began work in 2011 on “Risk,” her portrait of WikiLeaks and its hugely controversial founder Julian Assange, the organization had spent months working with news outlets to publish stories based on more than 700,000 U.S. classified documents leaked by U.S. Army Pvt. Bradley Manning.
“It was so important to see publications that were exposing what was happening with U.S. foreign policy, which is something that I cared about and was working on in my own work,” Poitras, who had previously made documentaries on the American presence in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay, said in an interview with Yahoo News.
Poitras said that the documents from Manning — comprising U.S. diplomatic cables and war logs from Iraq and Afghanistan — “opened up a more adversarial chapter in journalism” after “a decade of failure to report what the U.S. government was doing.”
By the end of filming in early 2017, WikiLeaks looked very different from an upstart operation devoted to bringing to light the inner workings of American diplomacy and overseas military activities.
Over the course of six years, two leading members of WikiLeaks, including founder Julian Assange, were accused of sexual assault; Assange hosted a show on Russian state television from his self-imposed exile in Ecuador's London embassy; rogue NSA contractor Edward Snowden provided reams of classified documents to Poitras and others before settling in Russia with the help of WikiLeaks; Manning entered prison after being convicted under the Espionage Act (she later received clemency from then President Barack Obama); Russian intelligence leveraged WikiLeaks in an influence operation to damage Hillary Clinton; CIA chief Mike Pompeo called Wikileaks a “hostile nonstate intelligence agency”; and Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that the U.S. would pursue criminal charges against Assange.
Poitras, who moved to Germany in 2012, acknowledges the increasing turmoil facing WikiLeaks and its enigmatic leader. But she is more concerned about the U.S. government's reaction to WikiLeaks over the last six years.
“The film feels a bit like a tragedy, which unfolds over many years, beginning with maybe a moment of optimism and ending at a moment of more despair,” Poitras said. “And I think it encompasses that. And I don't mean that to surround WikiLeaks or Julian, but politically where we fit today.”

“Risk” is an attempt by Poitras to present WikiLeaks' actions as a noble endeavor, while also providing intimate portraits of the people behind the organization. As the film unfolds, the actions of the primary characters put the organization in a less flattering light.
“Risk” begins in 2011, with Assange attempting to reach then Secretary of State Clinton to inform her that 250,000 diplomatic cables were about to be published, unredacted, on the open Internet. Jacob Appelbaum, known as the “American WikiLeaks hacker,” is shown confronting Egyptian telecom officials over the blocking of Twitter during the Arab Spring. Poitras introduces the two men as heroes on the front lines of the government transparency movement.
Then Assange is accused of sexually assaulting two women in Sweden. He is shown telling lawyers that the charges are part of a radical feminist conspiracy. He adds that it would better if it were only one woman, as that would make it easier to pressure the accuser by impugning her character. Later in the film, Appelbaum is accusedby former co-workers and acquaintances of sexual assault and bullying. The accusations led to Appelbaum being disowned by the privacy community. (Poitras notes that he denies any criminal conduct.)
Poitras acknowledges that she had to alter the story as the sex scandals tarnished the men behind WikiLeaks.
Still, it's been a while. I've been spending a few days on this blog thingee, see, dusting off the cobwebs. If you came here for "authentic china nike jersey" or "louboutin sneakers" deals, sorry, the spam comments are all gone. (Oh, BCR also doesn't suck to read on a cell phone these days.) But hopefully you'll start to see a few things that look familiar.
OK, sure, The Boss is better associated with New Jersey than Durham. But aren't all those wisecracks about Duke being the University of New Jersey at Durham enough to make him at least an honorary member? (To say nothing of the fact that his daughter apparently went to college at Duke .)
Everything dies, baby that's a fact. But maybe everything that dies someday comes back. - Bruce Springsteen
Springsteen's beloved Atlantic City, sad to say, has not fared as well as Durham in recent years. Heck, since this blog went on hiatus in 2011, AC saw a casino open to swelling crowds, then struggle and go bankrupt in only two years.
Compare that to what you see when you look down the list of blog stories published in the weeks before our first goodbye. (Hey, some place called DaisyCakes is opening -- swell!) Over the intervening four years, downtown Durham has bloomed even further, even faster than before. Restaurants fill downtown spaces that were dead or dying. There are enough hotels to... well, I'm not exactly sure. Suffice it to say: Durham will not be running out of hotel rooms anytime soon.
And of course, most controversially: we have apartments. Hey, have you noticed? There's a room or two or a thousand for rent. Hope you like granite counters!
Durham's a booming place. But all booms have their challenges. One needs to look no further than Atlantic City -- or Durham itself -- to know that.
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
Once a charming resort town, the jet and car challenged Atlantic City's supremacy. New Jersey leaders fought deep poverty with what they were sure would be a proverbial ace in the hole: legalized gambling! No need to go to Las Vegas, East Coasters; just come down the old Shore. And that worked, for a while in the 1980s and 1990s.
Until, of course, every other state saw an opportunity for tax revenue. Once again, Atlantic City's dominance was under fire. Heck, no sooner had Massachusetts axed their moralistic Blue Laws than did the Bay State start looking at opening its own casinos.
Similarly, Durham faced this same challenge once before in its relatively brief existence.
All these funky buildings becoming cool places are -- as every person reading this blog probably knows -- only here because they, too, were built in a boom. And that boom was tobacco, wafting into every nostril and pressed into every pocked and rolling (literally, in cigarette form) out of every one of the factories that filled downtown along the North Carolina Railroad corridor.
As Don Draper knows, though, no fashion stays forever. And indeed, tobacco became deeply unfashionable; American smoking rates peaked after World War II. Proud headquarters decamped for New York and other places far away. Factories slowly closed. American Tobacco was abandoned in the 1980s; today's West Village, a decade later.
The Hill Building, viewed from inside the crumbling wall of the Chesterfield Building, Oct. 2010
The very boom that once had Durham spoken of in the same breath as "Chicago" among post-Civil War cities had been snuffed out.
Yet just as the lavish old resorts of southern New Jersey become transformed into glass-and-Trump resorts, so did those Durham buildings that survived the bulldozer start turning into something new.
Of course, the recovery hasn't been for everyone. The good jobs, the best jobs for those with a blue-collar skill set, sputtered out. They transformed briefly, in the visage of Northern Telecom phone sets and IBM PCs. Yet most of that work, too, is gone.
And the wreckage of homes and lives in East Durham show it. Newspaper articles from the 1990s talk about East Durham's decline, as working-class factory men and women and their families struggled in uneasy retirements in the modest mill houses they lived in amidst what were company neighborhoods, if not company towns. As property values declined, crime and drugs seeped into the fabric of the communities, and the fabric of neighborhoods changed.
Today they are changing yet again. A house on Driver St. that I toured years ago, when friends in the just-christened Old East Durham were getting a home tour together, was in ramshackle state such that even I, a lover of old homes, could not imagine it ever being rescued.
Earlier this year, the restoration -- championed by Preservation Durham, which for years advocated for the house until it was renovated -- was complete, and the house sold quickly.

Like the factories downtown, the house was beautifully renewed.
As with downtown's factories, renewal is a better option than demise. Yet outcomes like this have and will also, inevitably, raise the specter of gentrification, a problem Durham has certainly wrestled with in the past four years far more than it did in the first five years I wrote BCR.
To some, gentrification is a means of renewing a neighborhood that had hope and resources before Durham's long malaise shut it down. To others, gentrification is a sign of a social and economic failing, of Durham evicting those who had found shelter, no matter how undesirable, in the wreckage.
There's a kernel of accuracy in both views, I am sure. And ultimately the answer lies somewhere in between.
And the answer will be every bit as ephemeral of the life, and decline, and death, and rebirth, and stalling, and decline, and rejuvenation, of every city that's ever lasted.
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
My hope and goal in writing this blog, as always, is to share reporting but also opinion on where we are and where we are heading down that path.
I won't bore readers with a long narration about all the places I disappeared to over the past few years. Briefly put, the strain of closing out my late mother's affairs; the ongoing "joys" of renovating an older home; and juggling professional responsibilities all created barriers to getting started again.
Life's slowed down over the past year or two. Still, it was hard to start writing again.
Part of that is due to the time commitment: a web site can be a bottomless sink of one's time. (I should note that the relaunch will be at a pace of writing that is, shall we say, a bit slower than at the site's 2010 peak. We'll see what the future holds.)
Then for a while, frankly, I found myself with little to say. Durham has been moving, generally, in a very good direction. Compared to the inanity of some 2000s-era County Commission and school board meetings... pleasant, even.
Over time, though, it's inevitable to find things that, well, bother you. Like an itch, you can ignore than for only so long until you scratch. When you're a writer, there comes a point to pick up the virtual pen.
Durham is, after all, a place I love and put down roots. I think we were great at celebrating what made us different and great, even a decade ago.
Now, people are listening, have listened. And people are moving here, in a seemingly increasing flow. Heck, the City of Durham last year ranked third among cities, after Austin and Orlando, in population growth by percentage.
That influx is a sign of success, yet also challenges our perception of who we are, and raises fears about who we might become.
To me, Durham doesn't peculiarly belong to those of us who've been here a decade, any more than it does to those who have lived here their whole lives -- or who moved into a downtown condo a couple of years back. (So pioneering, you vocal scamps, you!)
It belongs to all of us, to the new and old alike.
We're at a time where there has been, and will be, more conflict over the decisions and repercussions of that growth. From traffic, to zoning, to our schools, to how to mitigate where possible the impacts of change.
I don't expect I'll have all (or many) of the answers, but I look forward to at least asking the questions, and to readers continuing the conversation in the comments.
Glad to be back. Thanks in advance for reading.

I picked up a tube of Geo F. Trumper Sandalwood shave cream, my third shave cream/soap from Geo F. Trumper. I had mixed feelings from my first two – the Rose was a bit too flowery, while I just didn't get on well with the puck of Eucris – however refuse to give up too easily.
Packaging
The first thing I need to discuss is how I feel about shave cream in a tube. I don't really enjoy it. Feels a bit too much like a tube of artists paint – doesn't feel right having to squeeze to get your product on your brush. I much prefer my cream in an open bowl where I can smell the fragrance as soon as I remove the lid; it was difficult to sense the fragrance by simply unscrewing the cap from the tube. I also like being able to add more cream if needed without having to reach for the tube and squeeze a little more out.
Lather
Packaging aside I had a good experience with the Geo F. Trumper Sandalwood cream. I didn't need much cream to build up a lather; which lasted me for three passes (I opted to apply the cream directly onto the brush – choosing the bowl I'm sure would be equally effective).
Scent
The fragrance really opened up once I got the lather going – just strong enough to enjoy it, not overpowering at all. The nice, creamy lather performed well, good lubrication and cushion, and did a good job of moisturizing.
All around I had a good experience with the Sandalwood shave cream. I was beginning to get concerned that I wasn't going to find a Geo F. Trumper product that I really enjoyed, with the exception of it being in a tube (to be fair I purchased the tube on purpose to see how I would like it – the Sandalwood is also available in a bowl ), I believe I found one, and look forward to trying some of their other creams and soaps.

I always felt terrible for missing Martin Luther King's March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in the summer of 1963. I was a young man then, not yet twenty. Coming from a yeshiva background, it was all so foreign. And yet, when I heard his “I have a dream” speech on TV, I felt a spiritual stirring.
Over the years, King became one of my heroes, one of my rebbes in spiritual activism. When I heard of the fiftieth anniversary commemoration, I resolved to be there.
As a rabbi, preparing for the fast approaching High Holidays, I was trying to save time by taking a quick shuttle flight from New York, arriving in Washington at about 1:30pm, in time for President Obama's speech.
God had other plans. My flight was cancelled. Once boarding the next shuttle, we sat on the runway for well over an hour, as thundershowers came through.
I thought, maybe it's just not in the cards – it's just not going to happen.
Once landing, knowing that the rally was over, I contemplated turning around and immediately flying back. But there was something in me that impelled me to go forward with my plans.
Maybe it was the respect I wanted to show for Dr. King, not only for his universal message, but for his speaking out for Soviet Jewry. In one phone hook-up conversation he had with Jewish leadership in December 1966, he poetically said:
We cannot sit complacently by the wayside while our Jewish brothers in the Soviet Union face the possible extinction of their cultural and spiritual life. Those who sit at rest, while others take pains, are tender turtles and buy their quiet with disgrace.
Speaking out for others when every ounce of one's energy is needed to defend one's own people is a deep expression of spirituality, teaching one of Dr. King's most important lessons: we are all interconnected – if one person is not free, we are all not free.
I took a quick taxi ride and arrived just as the rally ended. The rally was over, but I soon found out that I was not late.
Had I been at the rally, I would have been somewhere in the back, heard the speeches, and left. The moment may have felt different. Coming afterwards allowed me to draw closer to it all.
Walking towards the Lincoln Memorial was memorable. Being with people of all backgrounds, many of them making their way out, but with thousands still milling about was itself significant, as it was a glimpse of the prophet's vision that God's house would one day be a house for all people.
I came pretty close to the Lincoln Memorial – within a few feet of the bell from the Sixteenth-Street Church in Birmingham, AL, where four young girls were tragically killed during the civil rights movement. It had been brought in for the commemoration and rung eight times just before the President spoke.
I was feeling something deep. The Lincoln Memorial is not the Western Wall, but it is a place of holiness. Here, fifty years ago, Martin Luther King dreamed. And here, fifty years ago people young and old, black and white, stood together as they did now.
Much like a pebble cast into a pond, creating ripples and mystically affecting every part of the larger world, great moments continue on even after they are over. And certainly, the place of the event eternally houses that moment's experience.
The commemoration event had ended. The King speech was a jubilee of years behind us. And yet, they both continued reverberating in different ways.
While three presidents spoke at the commemoration, no president was present fifty years ago. But, for me, the most powerful rallies are not the events where politicians speak to the people, but where people speak to the politicians.
I missed the first rally, came to the second as it ended, and most probably won't be around to attend its centennial.
As I walked away I took a final glimpse at that Birmingham bell. It has special significance in this High Holiday season. For the larger world, a bell shares the same significance as the Jewish shofar – a sound of redemption, of freedom.
Being in that space on that day served to help me spiritually prepare for the upcoming holidays. Arriving afterwards reminded me to value the echoes of that bell, and of the shofar, as much as the sound itself.
A 37-year-old Philadelphia man is accused of calling in a phony report of a man firing an assault weapon near Pennsbury High School in an attempt to throw officers off his trail, then attacking a police dog that found him when his ploy failed.
Falls police had been tracking Michael Hutcheon for about 15 minutes Thursday morning when they were redirected to the high school because a 911 caller reported a man was firing an assault weapon, according to court documents. Police said they were looking for Hutcheon after he started a fight at a bar not far from Pennsbury High School.
Police checked the area around the Hood Boulevard school, but found nothing, and no other calls reported anyone firing a weapon, according to an affidavit of probable cause. The man who called in the report refused to provide his name, but dispatchers had a record of the phone number he called from, police said.
Police officers resumed the search for Hutcheon, with a K-9 officer named Monte. The dog tracked the suspect to a group of homes behind Amelia Drive, where police found a whiskey bottle and a baseball cap, the affidavit said.
Monte continued tracking the scent and located Hutcheon � wearing only a muscle shirt and no pants or shoes � hiding under dense brush behind Jo-Jo�s Ice Cream shop in the 8000 block of New Falls Road, police said.
Hutcheon refused to come out of his hiding place or show his hands and he was verbally abusing the officers, court documents allege. Monte�s handler deployed the dog in an attempt to pull Hutcheon from his hiding place, but Hutcheon kicked the police dog in the face and body repeatedly, authorities said. The dog wasn�t injured, police said.
Lt. Hank Ward arrived on the scene and ordered Monte removed because Hutcheon wasn�t moving and police were worried he would injure the dog. The suspect continued to refuse to come out of the brush, telling officers � �Come and get me, punk,� the affidavit said.
Ward crawled into the brush to pull Hutcheon out. As Ward got closer to the suspect, Hutcheon put up his hands in a fight stance and threatened to kill the officer, police said. In response, Ward sprayed Hutcheon with pepper spray.
With the assistance of a second officer, Hutcheon was taken into custody and handcuffed; it took three officers to get him into the patrol car, the affidavit said. Hutcheon continued to struggle with the officers while he was taken to the hospital to wash off the pepper spray, officials said.
After he was in custody, police found a cellphone in the undergrowth and determined the phone number matched the one used to make the 911 call reporting a man firing an assault weapon near Pennsbury High School.
Hutcheon was arraigned Thursday before District Judge Jan Vislosky on charges including illegally taunting a police animal � a third-degree felony � and misdemeanor charges including making a false alarm to a public safety agency, terroristic threats and disorderly conduct. He was sent to Bucks County prison in lieu of 10 percent of $300,000 bail.

Earth Day — celebrated by few, propagandized by many.
The late Senator Gaylord Nelson founded the event in 1970 out of “concern about what was happening to the land, rivers, lakes and air.” Back then, Earth Day was widely observed by participating in environmental clean-up projects — clearing streams of trash and debris, planting trees and so on.
Unfortunately, that sense of personal activism has been largely lost over the last few decades. Instead, we have been told that the best way to address Nelson's concerns is by using solar panels and wind mills and following government instruction on how much energy to use or what kinds of products to buy.
The problem is that these things do not actually protect the environment. People do. Indeed, our nation's most precious resource is its people. It is people, after all, who provide the economic wherewithal and discover the technological advances that allow us to pursue environmental improvement.
One such advance — though not widely popular with the Earth Day Industrial Complex — is nuclear power. More so than any other energy source, nuclear technology makes possible the production of massive amounts of clean, reliable and affordable power. In fact, nuclear power — which now provides 20 percent of our nation's energy — does more to preserve Senator Nelson's prized environmental resources (land, water and air) than any other energy source, “green” or otherwise.
Conserving land. A traditional nuclear power plant takes up only a few hundred acres. New reactor technologies are even less land-intensive. The power produced by a single nuclear reactor is often enough to keep the lights on for millions of people. Wind and solar, on the other hand, can take thousands or tens of thousands of acres to produce the same amounts of energy. For instance, in order to generate the same amount of power as a single nuclear reactor, wind turbines would have to cover the entire area of the Great Smoky Mountains — that's over 900 miles.
Of course, land-use considerations extend beyond the size of a plant's footprint; the amount of land needed to support a plant also matters. Fueling nuclear reactors with uranium is a good choice from a land-use perspective. First, modern mining techniques either leave the earth's surface mostly undisturbed or restore it once mining operations end. Second, uranium fuel can be recycled and used multiple times. Lastly, uranium mined for other purposes can now be repurposed and used to fuel power reactors. Indeed, half of America's nuclear energy (or 10 percent of all of our electricity) is produced from uranium that was converted from Russian warheads.
Keeping our waterways clean. Though anti-nuclear activists want you to think otherwise, nuclear power is actually very water friendly. Yes, it uses massive amounts of water to cool plant equipment, but it actually consumes very little of that water. Depending on the cooling system, it either returns the water, untouched by anything radioactive, to its source or releases about half of it through condensation before returning the rest to its source. This approach has virtually no measurable impact on local aquatic life.
Some nuclear power plants, such as the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, do not even use fresh water for cooling. Instead, they use waste water from nearby cities.
Other energy sources have a much greater impact on water resources. Take offshore wind, for example. The proposed Cape Wind project in the Nantucket Sound would consist of 130 wind turbines, spread across 25 square miles. Due to the intermittency of wind, it would take approximately 24 of these projects to produce the same amount of energy as one average-sized new nuclear plant.
Breathable air. Nuclear power emits virtually nothing other than water vapor into the atmosphere. That's because nuclear fission, which produces the heat used to run the generators, requires no burning. So those most concerned about pollutants such as particulates, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides or emissions like CO2 should be particularly attracted to nuclear energy.
Senator Nelson cited the need to clean our land, water and air as the reason for Earth Day. Nothing has contributed as much to this objective while also meeting America's energy needs as nuclear power. No wonder the heavily subsidized yet oh-so-trendy alternative energy technologies are considered “green.” It's the envy, don't you know?

It's been almost two weeks since Brock Turner, the former Stanford swimmer, was sentenced to six months in a county jail for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman outside a fraternity party—and two weeks since the victim's impassioned, 7,000-word statement to her attacker went viral. On Sunday, at Stanford University's commencement ceremony, a banner with “Protect Survivors Not Rapists” streaked across the blue sky. And commencement speaker Ken Burns said: “If someone tells you they've been sexually assaulted, take it effing seriously. And listen to them! Maybe, some day, we will make the survivor's eloquent statement as important as Dr. King's Letter from a Birmingham Jail.”
Now, with public sympathy for the victim still running high, her supporters are trying to harness that outrage into a professional campaign to recall Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky, who was responsible for the light sentence. While several Change.org petitions calling for Persky's removal made the rounds on social media, Michele Landis Dauber, a Stanford professor of law and sociology, has emerged as the leader in efforts to transform the immediate backlash into a long-term effort to recall Persky.
Dauber has been a powerful advocate for sexual assault victims on Stanford's campus, revamping the university's sexual misconduct policy, supporting student survivors, and even creating a course on the topic that will run this year. We caught up with her to talk about the recall efforts and what the Brock Turner case means for the larger movement to end campus sexual assault.
Mother Jones: Clearly the victim's statement has struck a chord. It's being read on news channels, and even into the Congressional Record. But it's not as if she's the first person to come forward as a victim of campus sexual assault. What's different?
Michele Landis Dauber: It's her incredible writing. It does a great job at communicating what the experience is of being assaulted, and having to go through the highly intrusive rape examination and the criminal process. We've been told by the people on the other side who don't like the campus sexual assault movement that these are all “he-said, she-said” cases. Quite rightly, they say campus procedures are often very flawed, the investigation methods are not that good, and we aren't sure what we can trust. [Opponents say that] it seems like a lot to call somebody a rapist if they haven't gone to a criminal trial.
There are many good reasons that survivors don't want to go to criminal court. They want their colleges to give some lesser sanction and let them move on with their lives in a less intrusive way. But she did it. She was a good citizen. She sacrificed herself. She went through that criminal trial. She went through that horrible [sexual assault response team] exam. And at the end, she got three unanimous convictions that should have resulted, by law, in a minimum sentence of two years. And yet he walked out of there serving 89 days in the county jail. That really hit people.
The message to survivors is: “You're on your own. Don't bother to call police or report.” And the message to potential perpetrators is: “You don't have to take this stuff seriously.”
MJ: If campus procedures are so flawed, and some state judges can't be trusted, where does the solution lie?
MLD: The message to survivors is: “You're on your own. Don't bother to call police or report.” And the message to potential perpetrators is: “You don't have to take this stuff seriously. Don't worry, we have your back.” Survivors are being left without an option. You can't count on the courts and you can't count on your school. I'm not willing to accept that. That's why I think we need to recall this judge and replace him with someone who understands sexual violence.
MJ: Since the recall campaign began, critics have argued that it's inappropriate to hold judges accountable to the whims of social media, especially based on a single case. What's your response to that argument?
MLD: It seems to me that their argument is more with the California constitution than it is with me. The California constitution provides that our judges are elected, not appointed. They are serving at the pleasure of the people and they are accountable to the people. And it is the constitutional right of the women and other people of Santa Clara county to call for this recall because we're unhappy with this judge's perspective on sexual violence.
We're not accusing him of doing anything unethical, we're not accusing him of doing anything illegal, we're not calling for a federal investigation into a civil rights violation. At least not on the record of what we know so far. There is a process provided in the constitution for dealing with these kinds of concerns and we're simply exercising that process.
Yes, one case can absolutely be bad enough that it should trigger some set of voters to reconsider this person as a judge. [The sentence] is a terrible thing that has made women on our college campuses less safe, because it is sending the message that if you are young, and you are drinking alcohol, and if, previous to your crime, you have been a very high-achieving young person with good grades and high SAT scores and a record of athletic accomplishment, then that alone can exempt you from the minimum penalty that has be prescribed for sexual assault by the California legislature.
MJ: Some supporters of criminal justice reform are uncomfortable ever supporting more prosecutions, more convictions, longer sentences. What do you say to those who see any movement toward greater incarceration—even for rape—as troubling?
MLD: Two years is a short sentence. Contrary to what his parents said, this is not a life-destroying sentence. It's not fun, it's not a picnic, it's not a good time, but it's not the reason for the mass incarceration epidemic. Sending one privileged person convicted of sexual assault to a short 21-month sentence in prison is not the reason that we have the highest number of incarcerated people in the world. That's because of long sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. Let's be honest. There are many poor black and brown people in the California penitentiary system doing much harder time than two years for nonviolent property and drug crimes, who never sexually assaulted anybody. So let's put this in perspective.
MJ: Emily Bazelon wrote in the New York Times last week that the fact Brock Turner was convicted at all represents progress, since so many rapists don't get prosecuted. Charges are so often never filed, even when rapes are reported to police in the first place. Do you agree with her argument?
MLD: In this case, you have two eyewitnesses who literally pulled the attacker off the unconscious victim. You have a victim who didn't wake up for hours afterward, who was taken to the hospital immediately and evidence was collected immediately. The attacker was apprehended at the scene with an erection still in his pants and has DNA from her vagina on his fingers. Absolutely, 10 years ago, those facts would have led to a conviction. The evidence in this case was overwhelming. It's almost like a perfect case.
What's the usual case? Two people alone in a dorm room, with no witnesses, and the victim has very hazy memory of what happened. It's his word against hers. There's no police, and there's no [sexual assault] exam, and there's no DNA evidence. She just says he did it, and he just says he didn't. No charges are ever brought. That's the average campus rape case. So if you want to say this represents progress in campus sexual assault, you're trying to shoehorn this case in as if it were similar to other campus sexual assault cases, which it really is not.
MJ: Are there lessons for colleges and universities from this?
MLD: At Stanford, what needs to happen is a serious look at the fraternity system. On Stanford property, at a house owned by Stanford University and occupied by the Kappa Alpha fraternity, a party happened at which a girl got seriously sexually assaulted next to a dumpster. I think for Stanford, the important thing is that it has not yet apologized, or acknowledged that there was anything further to learn here, or expressed compassion for the victim. Even though this was an elite Stanford athlete—a recruited athlete, a scholarship athlete—in a D I program, at a fraternity party, all those facts did not cause Stanford to say, “OK, we need to take a step back and as a community ask ourselves [about] the way our athletics department is being run, the way our fraternity situation is being managed. Should we even have fraternities?” They have not wanted to take on the frat system, even though we've had, in the last few years, several very highly-publicized incidents of sexual harassment and sexual assault coming out of our fraternities.
MJ: What do you see as the next step in the fight to stop sexual assault on campuses?
MLD: We have to give out sanctions that fit the offense, just like in the criminal court. If you have a student who was [found responsible for] sexual assault with force, or while she was incapacitated, you need to remove that individual from your campus. I agree that the process by which you do that must be fair and must provide due process and must be administered by competent people. An unfair process helps no one. But once you've gone through with that process and you think that you know that person has raped someone, they have to go.
We need to get good processes in place, we need to use them, and then we need to impose good sanctions that make our campuses safe. This case is encouraging because the first step to the solution is empathy. There is empathy for this victim that maybe we wouldn't have seen before, coming from everybody except Stanford and Judge Persky. But for millions of other people around the world, there's empathy and compassion for her even though she got thoroughly intoxicated, and that wouldn't necessarily have been the case. So maybe it is progress.

During the early George W. Bush years, when a boy king seemed to be inhabiting the White House, Bill Clinton appeared as sage as King Solomon, minus the latter's 700 wives and 300 concubines (although it might depend on how you count), and people sought him out as a shepherd. In 2008, however, Barack Obama made Clinton lose his cool, in more than one way, and, today, people are suggesting that Clinton has lost the magic entirely. This Wednesday, he defended his support for tough crime measures in 1994 and welfare reform in 1996, putting on a spirited and sincere show, but one that earned him accusations of being condescending and tone-deaf and “very dehumanizing.” Just a couple of weeks ago, he spoke of the “awful legacy of the last eight years,” a complaint probably uttered with Republican opposition in mind, but one that could not have pleased the current White House. Some have now urged Hillary Clinton to bench her husband. “She can't divorce him,” Michelle Goldberg wrote recently in Slate, “but she can fire him.”
Picking on the Clintons is not without its rewards, campaign stumbles aside. Their habit of approaching the line of vulgarity (or illegality), like a drunk trucker swaying almost (but not quite fully) out of his lane, can drive even their fans crazy. But while Clinton's mind may be as disorganized as ever, it is still strong; his unvetted remarks are excusable; and his voice—for all its foibles—remains valuable. In fact, it might be insidiously valuable during this particular election cycle.
We'll start with the gaffes, which have set people talking about mental decline. This narrative is a pesky one that's hard to get rid of once it takes root, and every misstep becomes another confirmation of it. But it's silly. While all of us are going downhill after age 25, more so at 70 than at 50, Clinton's mind still seems to be in fine repair. Politicians say rash things all the time. That's unavoidable in the profession, unless you want to go pure robot. Anyone remembers “I didn't inhale”? That dumb line was voiced over two decades ago, but no one thought it meant Bill Clinton had lost his political gifts. They simply concluded that he could be full of it, a belief that subsequent years didn't dispel. This year, however, Clinton is making far less trouble than in 2008, when he was insisting, for instance, that Hillary and Obama hadn't really differed on Iraq. Despite a few glancing digs at Bernie Sanders, he has been pretty peaceful. Even when protesters try to disrupt events, he's patient.
The charitably minded will also acknowledge that mastering the twin roles of ex-president and spousal campaign surrogate is tough, not to mention unprecedented. Sit out the campaign, and it looks weird, generating other sorts of embarrassment and headlines. Is Bill under house arrest? Is Bill being hidden? Exclusive: Bill has 6 months to live! On the other hand, any president, even a former one, looms dangerously large on a stage next to a mere aspirant. Get too involved in the mud-throwing of a primary, and you not only lose your statesmanlike aura but also look like you're taking the wheel of the car. That happened in 2008, when Clinton couldn't help but act like someone desperate to be in charge again. In 2016, though, he looks much more like a supporting player. He's performing before Podunk venues across New York and doing his best to play to his strength: connecting with people in a non-giant room. Are you going to advise Hillary not to send her husband to talk to 850 people at the Grapevine Banquets in Depew (just east of Cheektowaga, if you're looking to place it) on the grounds that it'll hurt more than help? Please.
The raised levels of the protein tailed off after a year or so
The University of Pavia found a brain chemical was likely to be responsible for the first flush of love.
Researchers said raised levels of a protein was linked to feelings of euphoria and dependence experienced at the start of a relationship.
But after studying people in long and short relationships and single people, they found the levels receded in time.
The team analysed alterations in proteins known as neurotrophins in the bloodstreams of men and women aged 18 to 31, the Psychoneuroendocrinology journal reported.
The love became more stable. Romantic love seemed to have ended
Piergluigi Politi
They looked at 58 people who had recently started a relationship and compared the protein levels in the same number of people in long-term relationships and single people.
In those who had just started a relationship, levels of a protein called nerve growth factors, which causes tell-tale signs such as sweaty palms and the butterflies, were significantly higher.
Of the 39 people who were still in the same new relationship after a year, the levels of NGF had been reduced to normal levels.
Report co-author Piergluigi Politi said the findings did not mean people were no longer in love, just that it was not such an "acute love".
Stable
"The love became more stable. Romantic love seemed to have ended."
And he added the report suggested the change in love was down to NGF.
"Our current knowledge of the neurobiology of romantic love remains scanty.
"But it seems from this study biochemical mechanisms could be involved in the mood changes that occur from the early stage of love to when the relationship becomes more established."
However, he said further research was needed.
Dr Lance Workman, head of psychology at Bath Spa University, said: "Research has suggested that romantic love fades after a few years and becomes companionate love and it seems certain biological factors play a role.
"But while we are a pair-bonding species, there is some doubt over whether this is within monogamous relationships or not.
"Different societies have different practices and trends."
John Dunsworth, a Nova Scotia actor best known as the irreverent trailer park supervisor Jim Lahey, has died at the age of 71.
Dunsworth played Mr. Lahey on Trailer Park Boys, and is also known for his portrayal of Dave Teagues in the series Haven.
"With heavy and broken hearts the family of John F. Dunsworth would like to let people know that our amazing husband, father and grandfather John Dunsworth has passed away," his daughter Sarah Dunsworth said in a statement to CBC News.
"John left this world peacefully after a short and unexpected illness," her statement said.
I am beyond devastated. John was a beautiful guy. Brilliant and fascinating. I am forever grateful for having known him. RIP my friend. <a href="https://t.co/tPcyvXIRDy">https://t.co/tPcyvXIRDy</a> —@MSmithBubbles

While growing up in Halifax, Dunsworth "didn't have the foggiest notion" he would become an actor, he once told CBC's At the Table.
He moved to Toronto in the mid-'60s, and began performing on stage while attending the University of Guelph.
"I decided then and there that I don't care if I go broke in my life, I am going to be an actor, because I love to live in other people's shoes and learn other [existences]," he told CBC in the 2010 interview.
Sad news to lose John Dunsworth. His wild passion for acting was matched by his love of life and family. One of Canada's greatest. —@MikeClattenburg
In the '80s, long before Mr. Lahey became a household name, Dunsworth started a casting agency because he said there were so few film opportunities in Nova Scotia. He said that allowed him to go to auditions, and later he helped actors such as Halifax's Ellen Page find work.
He said he did everything from building sets to voiceovers, but always believed in the potential of the film industry in Nova Scotia.
"We'd be way better off if we nurtured our own talent and allowed it to flourish here," he said in 2010.
So sad. RIP John Dunsworth. One of the finest men and most brilliant actors I've ever had the honor to work with. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TrailerParkBoys?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TrailerParkBoys</a> —@TomArnold
Tour was scheduled
Over the years, Dunsworth appeared in dozens of television shows and movies. He had played Mr. Lahey since 2001 and toured with actor Patrick Roach, who appeared as the trailer park's assistant manager. They were scheduled to perform this week in Florida, but the shows were cancelled earlier Monday.
Unlike his best-known character, Dunsworth didn't drink and advocated against video lottery terminals, motivated by his own battle with a gambling addiction.

The idea of aging union workers fading into glory after decades of holding down the same job is trending in another direction. And it has much to do with the growing, younger, more technologically agile worker base that's becoming available.
Yes, millennials are posed to shake up an aging worker-employer compact that's controlled and supported most of the nation's blue-collar labor force since the mid-19th century.
The magazine GOVERNING reports that polling by Gallup and the Pew Research Center shows that about 60 percent of those younger than 30 express support for unions, compared to about 40 percent to 45 percent of older Americans. Such age-related resentment turned young people away from organized labor in the 1970s and 1980s when there was a widespread perception that unions were in place mainly to protect the status quo for a select group.
But GOVERNING correspondent Alan Greenblatt found such generational bias mostly has faded. That's to be expected with the damage that the housing foreclosure crisis of the last decade has done to the markets and a steadily rising corporate preference to contract out work to cheaper foreign workers.
Yet in researching "How Millennials Can Make Their Mark on Unions," Greenblatt found that "Younger workers can bring a new energy to organized labor. But if unions want to attract millennials, they'll have to change some of their ways."
For example, he says, the young hire is more liberal in politics than a veteran shop employee. And they are gutsy about their opinions, having been raised, in many cases, at least two decades from the average union worker. And they can be inquisitive to the point where offense can be taken, although not intended.
Here's how Robert Suarez, president of the Miami branch of the International Association of firefighters, explains it: "When they question authority, they want to know why that's the best way to do something. They're a little more interested in the substance of the issue than prior generations. If you make the mistake of saying to the younger generation, 'shut up and just do it because everybody else is doing it,' you're going to have a problem."
"The older generations, they had bad experiences with unions in their time," admitted Jacquita Berens, a 30-year-old who is working to organize home health workers in Minnesota for the Service Employees International Union. "Young people are more receptive to unions, to change."
And they will need to be, because the fate of public and private employee unions has been undergoing dramatic shifts that are trending away from the traditionally high wages, plush medical and retirement benefits and guaranteed work.
But there is a silver lining. Millennials like a good dust-up over ideas and issues of fair wages and healthy work conditions. If the old guard pays attention, it can sustain organized labor by respectfully grafting in these new workers.

Libyan Militiaman Says He Warned U.S. Of Dangers
Enlarge this image toggle caption John Poole/NPR John Poole/NPR
Two days before the deadly Sept. 11 attack on Americans in Libya, three U.S. officials met pro-government militias working to provide security in the city of Benghazi.
In that meeting, which included the American economic and political counselors, Mohammed el Gharabi, a leader of a prominent militia, says he warned the Americans that the security situation in Benghazi was deteriorating.
Assassinations are becoming rampant; no one is safe, including militiamen like himself, he says he told the Americans.
He asked for help to secure Benghazi and suggested scaling back or possibly closing diplomatic missions until conditions were more secure. He didn't cite any specific threat, but reminded the Americans that there had been an attack in June on the fortified U.S. Consulate, which is enclosed by a high wall, topped with concertina wire.
They didn't heed his warning, he says.
So far, the U.S. government has been tight-lipped about the security procedures that day when a two-pronged attack on the consulate and a safe house left four Americans dead, including Ambassador Chris Stevens.
Spontaneous Or Planned?
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Thursday she was forming a panel to investigate the attack. Much of the current debate centers around whether the attack was spontaneous or planned.
Libya's President Mohammed el-Megarif says he believes the attack was planned, but U.S. officials have said they have not seen any such evidence so far.
Clinton has also said that the mission in Benghazi was secured properly and that there was no indication of an imminent threat.
"Let me assure you that our security in Benghazi included a unit of host government security forces, as well as a local guard force of the kind that we rely on in many places around the world," she said.
But Libyan witnesses are asking why Stevens was apparently left alone at the consulate. When the attack by heavily armed men was over, fires raged and people looted the compound.
Video Footage From The Consulate
Libyan Fahed al Bakkosh took video of events that night and has posted the footage on YouTube. His video shows Libyans pulling a man — who appears to be Stevens — from a room at the consulate.
Bakkosh says he walked into the consulate after midnight. There were no Americans and no visible security as Libyans looted the compound. He then heard a young man scream, "Dead body."
Libyans were pulling the man out of a smoke-filled room, and the man was still breathing, Bakkosh says. The Libyans took him to the hospital, and only later, Bakkosh says, did they discover it was Stevens.
The doctor who treated Stevens says he died of asphyxiation, and his heart had stopped by the time he reached the hospital.
Where were the bodyguards? Bakkosh asks. There wasn't even an ambulance, he says.
Hours after the consulate attack, Libyan authorities sent security forces to the Benghazi airport to meet a U.S. team sent to evacuate the Americans.
One of those Libyans, Fathi Obeidi, described the U.S. group as seven Marines in civilian clothes. Using a GPS, they went to a secret safe house inside a walled compound.
There, they found three villas, one of which was occupied by more than 20 Americans who had fled the consulate, says Obeidi.
Within 15 minutes, that house came under fire by either RPG or mortar fire, he said. The assailants, he said, appeared to have been lying in wait. They fired from a distance, and it was impossible to identify them.
After the attack stopped, the U.S. rescue team and the Libyans evacuated the Americans to the Benghazi airport. They asked the Libyan security forces to bring Stevens' body from the hospital. Obeid says it took two planes to evacuate all the Americans from Benghazi.
Shipquay Street in Londonderry remains cordoned off this lunchtime as a police murder investigation gets underway following the shooting dead of a man this morning.
It is thought the murder took place shortly before 11am. Police have confirmed that a man was killed but have releaased no further details at this stage. However, it is understood that the man was in his mid 30s and originally from the Galliagh area of the city. He has been named locally as Barry McCrory. It is understood that the murder was particularly brutal and the victim was shot in the head.
The scene in Derry's City centre this morning.
Condemnation of the murder followed swiftly afterwards. Speaking at the scene Londonderry DUP Councillor Gary Middleton said: “The mood here in the city is one of complete horror especially since this took place in broad daylight.”
The parents and a brother of the victim were at the scene of the murder this afternoon.
SDLP MLA Pat Ramsey was close by at the time of the killing and heard the shots ring out.
The Foyle MLA also pointed the finger of blame at dissident republicans.
“This is an appalling and disgraceful incident. I was in the vicinity this morning and heard the shots that have resulted in this tragic loss of life. There is a deep sense of shock in Derry City centre today.
“Once again there are those in our community who are intent on destroyong the unity of purpose that can only benefit everyone, especially our young people. My condolences and sympathies are with the family of the victim at this time and I urge anyone with any information about this incident to contact the PSNI.”
And, MP for the city, Mark Durkan said: “I strongly condemn this despicable and cowardly attack. People in Derry utterly reject any such violence. Shootings like this are resented not just as ruthless attacks on individuals but also attacks on peace and the image of city.”
Local media reported that the man found dead was the suspected bomber [Reuters]
Two explosions have rocked central Stockholm, the Swedish capital, killing one person and injuring two, according to rescue officials.
The first blast came from a car that exploded near Drottninggatan, a busy shopping street in the centre of the city, Ulf Goransson, a spokesman for the Swedish police, told Al Jazeera on Saturday.
Shortly afterwards, a second explosion was heard further up the same street and the body of a man was found on the ground.
"There was series of minor explosions, causing a fire in one of the cars in the street. Some minutes later, we found a man seriously injured 300 metres away from the scene of the first explosion. This man died," he said.
Authorities suspect that at least one of the blasts was a suicide attack.
"Most worrying attempt at terrorist attack in crowded part of central Stockholm," Carl Bildt, the Swedish foreign minister, said in comments on his Twitter account.
"Failed - but could have been truly catastrophic."
Bag of nails
Sweden's SVT television later reported that the man who died in the attack was the bomber. A bag filled with nails was found near the body, SVT said.
Neither the police nor the intelligence service have confirmed the SVT report.
The Aftonbladet newspaper quoted a source as saying that the man was carrying six pipebombs, of which only one exploded.
"I cannot confirm that the death is linked to the explosion of the car but I cannot deny it either," Petra Sjolander, a police spokeswoman, said.
Soon after the blasts, the Swedish news agency TT said it had received an email warning with a threat to Sweden and its people ahead of the explosions.
It said the threat was linked to Sweden's presence in Afghanistan, where it has a force of 500 soldiers, and referred to caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed by Lars Vilks, a Swedish artist.
"There was no direct threat directed to any specific event or explosion ... it was directed in general to Sweden and to the Swedish people," Mats Johansson, the managing editor of the TT news agency, told Al Jazeera.
"There is no confirmation that the content of the mail has anything to do with these explosions."
Threat received
TT said that messages in Arabic and Swedish were received about 10 minutes before the first explosion.
"Our acts will speak for themselves," TT quoted the message as saying. "Now your children, your daughters and your sisters will die as our brothers, our sisters and our children are dying."
The message concluded by urging "mujahidin" to rise up in Sweden and in Europe, the news agency said.
The message was also sent to Sweden's Security Police.
Vilks, who depicted the Prophet Mohammed with the body of a dog in a cartoon in 2007, has been the target of previous attacks.
In March, an US citizen who called herself "JihadJane" was charged with plotting to kill the cartoonist. In May, arsonists tried to set fire to his house.
Sweden raised its threat alert level from low to elevated in October because of "a shift in activities" among Swedish-based groups that it was said could be plotting attacks there.
The security police said then that the threat remained low compared to that in other European countries, and no attack was imminent.

While "The X-Files" may be long over, that doesn't mean actress Gillian Anderson is finished exploring the unknown. Gillian and author Jeff Rovin have co-written the first book -- "A Vision of Fire" -- in their
"A Vision of Fire" tells the story of child psychiatrist Caitlin O'Hara, a single mom trying to juggle her job and her family life when her world is turned upside down when a young girl named Maanik starts having disturbing and violent visions. Teens -- and even animals -- around the globe are hurting themselves and acting irrationally, forcing Caitlin to think there's more to these creepy coincidences. Caitlin races the clock to decipher clues that could save Maanik and possibly the world.
As the co-writer of the new book series, Anderson told Entertainment Weekly, she "wanted a very strong female character, around my age. I would want to read something like that and I think other women would like to read."
"A Vision of Fire" will be published in October by Simon & Schuster's new imprint Simon451 -- a nod to the sci-fi classic "Fahrenheit 451" by Ray Bradbury. (Editor's note: Simon & Schuster is owned by CBS. CNET is published by CBS Interactive, a unit of CBS.)
Eager fans can read an excerpt from "A Vision of Fire" now via the Simon451 Fall 2014 Preview Sampler -- which is available for the Amazon Kindle, Barnes & Noble Nook, Apple iBookstore, and the Google Play Store. The sampler also includes excerpts from Nicholas Sansbury Smith's bestselling "Orbs" series, as well as excerpts from several upcoming science fiction and fantasy titles from Simon451.
MasterCard has entered the realm of real-time payments.
The payments technology company today launched MasterCard Send, a personal payments service that enables funds to be sent quickly and securely to customers domestically and internationally.
As noted in a press release, the service – rolling out first in the U.S. – facilitates disbursements and person-to-person (P2P) payments to and from almost any U.S. debit card account, not just MasterCard-branded ones. Funds transferred via MasterCard Send will be available for use within 30 minutes, rather than taking the days it sometimes takes with the current ACH process.
“Through MasterCard Send, we have enabled a breakthrough solution that takes the pain out of the system, provides faster clearing of payments, and delivers a better user experience for senders and receivers alike,” Ed McLaughlin, Chief Emerging Payments Officer at MasterCard, said in the release. “MasterCard Send is addressing a real need that exists in today's digital world to enable consumers, businesses, governments and more to have a safe, simple and secure way to transfer and receive funds quickly.”
Barb King, a group head in the MasterCard Payment Systems Integrity Group, described the service to PYMNTS as “a breakthrough platform in the industry.”
She gave several examples of use cases – including the settling of insurance claims, the sharing economy, and ticket resale – noting that the service is being marketed to companies, rather than directly to consumers.
As for what specific segments MasterCard is targeting with MasterCard Send, King remarked that the company is “working with a number of businesses that are dispersers” in the U.S.
Beyond the U.S., King shared that MasterCard is currently working with governments in other parts of the globe on remittances, with a plan to extend partnerships over time.
Regarding the details of a MasterCard Send transaction, King noted that the time a transaction takes does not vary according to the size of payment. Rather, the speed is analogous to an ATM transaction.
“Think of [a MasterCard Send transaction] as any other transaction that you do with a debit card today,” she stated. “We are working with all debit networks that exist in the U.S….to make sure that they have that reach.”
Details on the business model and economics were not disclosed.
The company's focus for the new platform, King said, is generally on changing “inefficient processes,” whether those be check-based or cash-based.
Because MasterCard Send leverages existing platforms and networks, King pointed out that there have not been any security challenges in getting the service up and running.
“All of the entities that we're working with have already been part of the payments industry,” she said. “They've already been looking at transaction security, data security… And I think that is one of the advantages, certainly in the consumer's mind.”
Referencing consumer studies, King said that “consumers are much more comfortable giving their personal details to their financial institution than they are to many other types of entities.”
And that, she attested, is a big reason why MasterCard Send is more appealing than the bitcoin protocol. “[It works off] the model that gives the consumer the ability to get…funds in a way that they're already very comfortable with.”
MasterCard is launching the value-added service because, says King, “We think [personal payments] is a growing space in the industry, [be it] person-to-person payments, business to consumer, [or] government to consumer. When you look at some of the industry statistics that exist, in terms of the opportunity to displace cash and checks, we're talking trillions of dollars.”
Concluded King: “As consumer demand grows to make those transactions secure and fast, we think this is going to be…a very high-growth space for us over time.”

With the 2014 NFL season kicking off this week, Onion Sports has in-depth analysis on each team in the NFC South.
Bucs
Strengths: Beginnings of plays whistled dead for offsides usually showed potential; Paper bags on fans' heads somewhat mute never-ending chorus of boos
Weakness: No one from Bucs' front office has shown up to work in nine years
Head Coach: Hiring of Lovie Smith has given plenty of belief and excitement to opposing teams
Roster: Team used draft to surround quarterback Josh McCown with diverse array of future holdouts
Strategy: Defense uses Tampa 2 scheme, in which middle linebacker and two safeties drop into zone coverage and then give up a lot of yards
Key Offseason Acquisition: New quarterback Josh McCown brings the leadership and confidence that only comes from a mediocre journeyman on tail end of his career
Player To Watch: While rarely putting up gaudy stats, punter Michael Koenen has proven to be an effective game manager
Fan Experience: Stadium's famous pirate ship will now fire once for every yard gained by offense
Panthers
Strengths: Cam Newton finally understanding his role as the offense; Team provides fans with much-needed distraction from city of Charlotte
Weakness: Special teams far too reliant on performance of veteran long snapper J.J. Jansen
Roster: Offseason departures of receivers Steve Smith, Ted Ginn Jr., Brandon LaFell, and Domenik Hixon pave way for anyone interested in becoming a wide receiver in the NFL
Biggest Risk: Pregame drill in which teammates take turns stomping on Cam Newton's left ankle
Team Chemistry: Remaining eight players on roster incredibly close and have strong on-field connection
Fun Fact: There are only 113 wild panthers left in the Charlotte metropolitan area
OSN Projection: Expect head coach Ron Rivera to turn the Panthers' fortunes around for a second straight season
Falcons
Strength: Worst running game in NFL would only matter up until 2004
Weaknesses: Playoff format; Glaring flaws in defense easily identifiable by opponents and anyone who catches 30-second highlights of a Falcons game on ESPN
Biggest Advantage: Offense far better when playing in airless vacuum of Georgia Dome
Roster: Offseason has seen many players sign lucrative contracts as production assistants on Hard Knocks
OSN Stat: Steven Jackson averages 3.3 thoughts of retirement per carry
Goal: Win some games, but most importantly, conduct selves as true Falcons on and off the field
Number Of Super Bowls Falcons Would Have Won If Team Never Released Michael Vick: Three
Biggest Question: Is Mark Ryan truly an elite quarterback?

Facebook stock dropped 2.8 percent this morning after an investment firm indicated that the social network's number of users have fallen over the last six months, Bloomberg reported.
The shares of Menlo Park, Calif.-based Facebook decreased 2.8 percent to $27.45 at 10:53 a.m. ET, Bloomberg said, while the shares of Zynga, which has games that are mostly played on Facebook, dropped 6.1 percent to $4.54. Perhaps the panic was short-lived, as the stock ended the day at $28.09, a 0.55 percent decline.
This comes on top of the stock's 8.1 percent decline yesterday.
The Capstone report, written by analyst Rory Maher, revealed that Facebook's user base in the U.S. decreased 1.1 percent over the past six months. Additionally, 14 of the 23 markets where Facebook has been successful saw a decline or little growth over the past three months.
These numbers add to the slew of stats on Facebook's declining member base. ComScore numbers from late June showed a decline of unique U.S. visitors to the site in a three-month period -- from 158.9 million in March to 158.01 million in May. Another analytics company, ForeSee, said user satisfaction also continues to decline.
RaaS : Ransomware-as-a-Service, Services available on the DarkNet
Over the past few years, since around 2010‒2012, this new Trojan malware called Ransomware has seen a growth. It is reported by some Antivirus companies that the growth rate of Ransomware is over 100‒200% each year. The financial losses each year are in millions of dollars.
As there is no exact solution to this malware, it continues to create havoc. Criminals and cyber crooks have now started a business of this: they have named the service as Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS).
Before we understand what RaaS does, a quick understanding of ransomware. Ransomware is an old malware. Its origin is traced back to as early as in 1989. That was the first reported Ransomware. A ransomware infects the victim's machine and holds your computer with your data as hostage and demands ransom money in return for the release of the victim's data. This simple logic that the malware uses makes it one of the most difficult malwares to overcome in today's time. Today ransomware makes use of Cryptographic techniques to encrypt your data. The strength of the ransomware lies in the encryption techniques. Previously the ransomware used Symmetric Key Algorithm (uses same key to encrypt and decrypt). This was fine but the malware researcher (the Good guys) started to find out the flaws and tried to break the encryption method. But as time changed the malware developers too started using more difficult and complex techniques such as the AES 256, RSA 2048, RSA 4096, and Elliptic Curve algorithms.
These algorithms are extremely difficult to crack. I won't be discussing the complexity of cracking the algorithms. You can search online more about this on various forums and online social platforms if you are really curious to understand the mechanics or simply trust me and an approximate analogy that I am about to make - Imagine 1 single file on your computer is encrypted with RSA 2048 algorithm. And you don't know the key. You try to decrypt it using a technique called brute forcing. So how much brute force you will need and how much time will it needs? To be approximate, imagine each individual on this planet has a simple computer and they all use their computing power to crack this one single file, then the time estimate for cracking this file will be around 70‒80 years. Yes! That is for only one file. Imagine if you have 100 GB of data. I leave it up to you to do the math.
So now that I have established the seriousness of Ransomware, a quick summary on ransomware in few lines is as follows:
Malware which encrypts your files. Ask money in exchange for your file. (Just like a regular Ransom exchange) Money is in usually Bitcoins (BTC) (Money of the web. Non-Traceable. Totally Anonymous.) Brute forcing is no longer an option.
The question now is which people are at risk? Everybody you and me and not just big corporation. We can perhaps think that common people can simply format his machine and start fresh? Yes he certainly can but I read on a forum that a father, who had lost his son a year ago to cancer was hit by ransomware. All the pictures of his son were encrypted. I believe it is not who is a victim: common individual or big corporate, it is about the value of data that is hit. For that common father those pictures mean the world as they hold the memories of his passed away son. Remember, we live in in a digital age where we store our pictures in our computers and phones. No hard copies! The father was lucky that the malware developer had a heart and he gave the key. But this was the story of the past. New malware developers are ruthless and not as kind as the one mentioned. This is a one in a million case of keys released. The Financial and Medical sector are the top targets as they are responsible of holding data and information of large volume of individuals. What is more concerning is that the spread of Ransomware is no way near slowing down because anyone who has a bit of knowledge of internet can use this service to make quick money. How is that?
For this article, we are going to discuss one such RaaS known as Satan Ransomware. This RaaS is available on the Dark Web. It is active since January 2017.
Figure 3: Satan Ransomware Instructions
Figure 3 shows a quick description of what Satan Ransomware is and how it can benefit you.
The payout that is mentioned is 70-30 ratio. Say 1 BTC is approximately 1000 USD, then according to 70-30 ratio payout, the Site owners, the service providers will get 30% (300 USD)and the user of the service gets 70% (700 USD). That for any common person is a lot of money. Easy Money.
Let's now understand the website and the Service that is provided.
Figure 4: Satan Ransomware First Page
As shown in Figure 4, the first screen is what we are greeted with. There is another option of new users to Register.
Upon clicking the Register we are directed to a different page (Figure 5):
Figure 5: Sign-in Page
As we see, the signup is very simple. There is no validation required, no email id is required to register. That means the people who are providing the service have no idea of your identity. This assurance of anonymity is a very powerful aspect.
Upon signing up and logging in, the interface that we see is as follows (Figure 6):
Figure 6: Activity Tracker of the Malware a user has infected
The RaaS provides an activity tracker which can help keep tabs on the amount of ransomware's that have successfully infected machines and how many victims have paid the ransom amount. Your Bitcoin address shows that whenever you want to withdraw the amount you just need to provide your bitcoin address and the 70 % of the total bitcoins collected as ransom will be reflected in your account.
Now the RaaS also provides you with the option of customizing a small amount of the features of Ransomware (Figure 7).
Figure 7: Customizing your own Ransomware
The features that you can customize, and which pretty much define a ransomware altogether is the Ransom amount, which can be given according to the RaaS users will. The minimum ransom hinted is 0.1 BTC (136 USD approx.) There is also a feature wherein suppose the victim is unable to pay the ransom amount in the stipulated time then the ransom amount can multiply as part of punishment to the victim.
The third option describes the duration till which the ransom is expected to be paid.
The Notes option is for the Service users to keep tabs, for example if the service user is targeting banks and he gives the banks 10 days, he can write in the notes as “Ransomware for X Bank” and then if he's targeting Hospitals he can note it as “Ransomware for Y Hospital” so that this way he does not mix up between two malwares and thus can simultaneously work on multiple different campaigns efficiently without an hassle or confusion.
Figure 8: Dropper Techniques used
Just customizing the ransomware is not enough to get the work done. If you simply create a malware, the chances of its detection are high by an Antivirus. To ensure that the malware is not detected, the Service provides you with two XOR techniques to help the malware evade the ransomware. The page clearly describes the instructions on how to make a dropper (Figure 8).
The codes are listed as shown in figures 9 and 10:
Figure 9: Dropper Technique 1
Figure 10: Dropper Technique 2
The RaaS also provides the user with the option of language independence. That means now that user is no longer bound by the boundaries of language to infect its victims. The language translation is available for English, Portuguese, Russian, Dutch, Italian, French and other languages totaling up to 14 different languages.
Figure 11: Language Translation and Ransom Note
This panel also discusses the creation of Ransom notes. For humor, many ransomware developers use very harsh or very polite or simply a business like tone in their ransom note.
The next tab is for the summary information of the RaaS user.
Figure 12: Account information
This tab keeps all the information about the RaaS user (Figure 10). The username, how much cut is provided (70% is the default), logged Information, how much ransomware have been developed and how many victims have been infected. I have intentionally deleted my username since the website is still live.
Lastly, the Notice tab informs us about the recent releases (Figure 11).
Figure 13: Version description.
Messages tab is when there is a need for communication between the Service User and Malware Developers and between Victim and Service users in case of price negotiation.
After reading all this, I assure you that it is half as easy to design the ransomware than it is to read and understand this article. In one sentence: Yes, it is very simple to create a ransomware.
Conclusion
Now towards the end of this article, I am pretty sure you must have more questions than before reading this article. Let me put some things straight so that there is no confusion and misunderstanding.
No. I am not the bad guy. The whole aim of this article is to make you aware that the threat is very real and you do not need any expert skills to spread ransomware contrary to popular beliefs that you need to be “expert”. Yes. Satan Decryption tool is available. Do they work? I do not know. I will shortly check them personally and let you know. But that is not enough. Just having a decryptor does not mean users—individuals and companies should not take sufficient precautions. Regular offline backups (on external hard disks, DVDs etc.) is the best precaution you can take for now. The reason of why ransomware continues to grow is the power of anonymity. The money transaction is in bitcoins which is itself crypto-currency. Another aspect is that during registration, the users of this service are safe as none of their credentials are validated.
This article has the sole aim of educating the readers about RaaS and how it is an easy money making method which most cyber criminals are using today. RaaS is a simple, easy-money solution. The users of RaaS feel that it is a harmless crime because you are not killing anyone for money, RaaS service users are not exposed in the open; hence, the perpetrator is safe. These factors account to the ever increasing rise in Ransomware.
I hope I was able to convey the magnitude of problem we have to solve. And this can be done only if we are united as a community.
If you used my method for adding length to your nails and would like to know how to fill and remove them here is a my quick tutorial…
*sidenote- this can also be applied to a regular gel polish manicure, one that doesn't included tip extensions. If you applied color simply use your same color choice (or darker color) in place of the Simple Sheer I used in the video.
Fills:
After about two weeks you will notice regrowth of your natural nail between the cuticle and gel polish, instead of removing them you can follow these steps and simply touch up that area.
1. Completely remove all nail polish from your nail.
2. Apply cuticle remover and push back cuticles.
3. Clean off the cuticle remover from your nails by using a damp washcloth (or by washing your hands).
4. Using a 180 grit file, lightly file down the top layer of gel only (DO NOT file down the regrowth line yet, if you have thin/weak nails it is important not to use a course grit file on your natural nail). The goal of this step is to keep the gel from building up to thick. You don't want to remove all the gel, just enough so that when you apply the new gel on top it's still fairly thin and natural looking.
5. Using a super fine file or fine grit buffer gently buff the regrowth line so it blends into the natural nail.
6. Wipe nails down with alcohol to remove any nail dust, oil, residue left by cuticle remover or hand soap.
7. Apply a new gel polish manicure using the same process as I did in the original tutorial.
8. Wipe nails down with alcohol to remove the tacky surface and apply cuticle oil.
And you're done!
Removal:
If you have done a fill and it has been another two weeks (or less) it may be time for removal due to lifting or tips coming off. Here is how to remove gel polish..
1. Trim down any excess length using artificial nail clippers. Turn your hand so your palm is facing you, that way you can see underneath your nail. Be sure not to trim down your natural nail!
2. Using a 180 grit file, file down the top layer of gel polish. If you have any regrowth be sure to not file down your natural nail.
3A. Pour pure acetone into two small bowls (one for each hand). You want enough acetone to completely submerge nails up to your cuticle.
3B. Foil Method-
cut 10 small squares of aluminum foil (squares width should be large enough to wrap around your finger and long enough to cover the entire nail).
soak a cotton ball with pure acetone and place it on top of the nail
using one square of aluminum foil wrap it around your finger to enclose the acetone soaked cotton ball onto your nail.
4. Let the nails soak for 10-15 minutes.
5. Remove nails from acetone. The gel should be dissolved. and the tip extension should pop right off. If there is remaining gel on your nail use an orangewood stick to gently scrape remaining gel off. If the gel (or tip extension) does not easily scrape off DO NOT try to pry, peel, or scrape it off. Continue to soak in acetone in 5 minutes increments until all gel (and tip extension) is removed.
6. Apply cuticle oil, cream or lotion.
I removed my gel polish nails and I am quite pleased with the length I now have. However, my nails are still pretty thin so if this happens to you, you have some options.
Option 1. Apply a new gel manicure minus the tip extension. This will give you strength to grow out your nails but doesn't have lasting effects (once it's removed your nails will still be thin).
Option 2. Use a nail strengthening treatment. I have used Nail Tek and Duri Rejuvacote with great results.
**Stay tuned for another tutorial on how to add length using Gelish's new Hard Gel LED clear builder gel and Dual Forms. This new method will add length without using tip extensions!
10 Team-Building Games That Promote Critical Thinking
by TeachThought Staff
One of education's primary goals is to groom the next generation of little humans to succeed in the “real world.”
Yes, there are mounds of curricula they must master in a wide breadth of subjects, but education does not begin and end with a textbook or test.
Other skills must be honed, too, not the least of which is how to get along with their peers and work well with others. This is not something that can be cultivated through rote memorization or with strategically placed posters.
Students must be engaged and cooperation must be practiced, and often. The following team-building games can promote cooperation and communication, help establish a positive classroom environment and — most importantly — provide a fun, much-needed reprieve from routine.
10 Team-Building Games That Promote Collaborative Critical Thinking
You can purchase a classroom-ready version of team-building games that promote critical thinking here.
1. If You Build it…
This team-building game is flexible. Simply divide students into teams and give them equal amounts of a certain material, like pipe cleaners, blocks, or even dried spaghetti and marshmallows.
Then, give them something to construct. The challenge can be variable (think: Which team can build the tallest, structurally-sound castle? Which team can build a castle the fastest?).
You can recycle this activity throughout the year by adapting the challenge or materials to specific content areas.
Skills: Communication; problem-solving
2. Save the Egg
This activity can get messy and may be suitable for older children who can follow safety guidelines when working with raw eggs. Teams must work together to find a way to “save” the egg (Humpty Dumpty for elementary school students?) — in this case an egg dropped from a specific height. That could involve finding the perfect soft landing, or creating a device that guides the egg safely to the ground. Let their creativity work here.
Skills: Problem-solving, creative collaboration
3. Zoom
Zoom is a classic classroom cooperative game that never seems to go out of style. Simply form students into a circle and give each a unique picture of an object, animal or whatever else suits your fancy. You begin a story that incorporates whatever happens to be on your assigned photo. The next student continues the story, incorporating their photo, and so on.
Skills: Communication; creative collaboration
4. Minefield
Another classic team-building game. Arrange some sort of obstacle course and divide students into teams. Students take turns navigating the “mine field” while blindfolded, with only their teammates to guide them. You can also require students to only use certain words or clues to make it challenging or content-area specific.
Skills: Communication; trust

5. The Worst-Case Scenario
Fabricate a scenario in which students would need to work together and solve problems to succeed, like being stranded on a deserted island or getting lost at sea. Ask them to work together to concoct a solution that ensures everyone arrives safely. You might ask them to come up with a list of 10 must-have items that would help them most, or a creative passage to safety. Encourage them to vote — everyone must agree to the final solution.
Skills: Communication, problem-solving
6. A Shrinking Vessel
This game requires a good deal of strategy in addition to team work. Its rules are deceptively simple: The entire group must find a way to occupy a space that shrinks over time, until they are packed creatively like sardines. You can form the boundary with a rope, a tarp or blanket being folded over or small traffic cones. (Skills: Problem-solving; teamwork)
7. Go for Gold
This game is similar to the “If you build it” game: Teams have a common objective, but instead of each one having the same materials, they have access to a whole cache of materials. For instance, the goal might be to create a contraption with pipes, rubber tubing and pieces of cardboard that can carry a marble from point A to point B in a certain number of steps, using only gravity.
Creative collaboration; communication; problem-solving
8. It's a Mystery
Many children (and grown-ups) enjoy a good mystery, so why not design one that must be solved cooperatively? Give each student a numbered clue. In order to solve the mystery — say, the case of the missing mascot — children must work together to solve the clues in order. The “case” might require them to move from one area of the room to the next, uncovering more clues.
Skills: Problem-solving, communication
9. 4-Way Tug-of-War
That playground classic is still a hit — not to mention inexpensive and simple to execute. For a unique variation, set up a multi-directional game by tying ropes in such a way that three or four teams tug at once. Some teams might choose to work together to eliminate the other groups before going head-to-head.
Skills: Team work; sportsmanship
10. Keep it Real
This open-ended concept is simple and serves as an excellent segue into problem-based learning. Challenge students to identify and cooperatively solve a real problem in their schools or communities. You may set the parameters, including a time limit, materials and physical boundaries.
Skills: Problem-solving; communication
While education technology is a basic and crucial component of the 21st century classroom, educators must still ensure that students are engaging with each other in meaningful ways. Team-building exercises are a great way to do this, and because of this, they will never go out of style.

According to a recent article, at least one police department in Connecticut deliberately and officially refuses to hire people who are too smart:
On March 16, 1996 Robert Jordan from Connecticut, and 500 others underwent a written screening process which included the Wonderlic Test, conducted by the Law Enforcement Council of Southeastern Connecticut, Inc. (“LEC”), a coalition of fourteen cities and towns, in order to apply for a position as a police officer. Several months later Jordan learned that the city of New London started interviewing candidates. After not hearing from them, Jordan inquired as to why he was passed over. Jordan eventually learned from assistant city manager Keith Harrigan that he would not be interviewed because he “didn't fit the profile.” Thinking it was obviously age discrimination because he was 46 at the time, Jordan filed an administrative complaint with the Connecticut Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities. The response that he received was completely out of left field. The city responded that it removed Jordan from consideration because he scored a 33 on the Wonderlic Cognitive Ability Test, and that to prevent frequent job turnover caused by hiring overqualified applicants the city only interviewed candidates who scored between 20 and 27. The city of New London claims that “People within certain ranges achieve a degree of job satisfaction and are likely to be happy and therefore stay on the job.” They apparently believed that Jordan was too smart to be happy being a cop.
Interesting. The question, of course, is whether other police departments have a similar policy. I'm sure they won't be voluntarily offering this information anytime soon. But if they wanted to discriminate on the basis of intelligence, that would be legal now. A federal court has ruled against Jordan, saying that the Connecticut police department did nothing wrong.
The court said that because the police department refused to hire any smart people, Jordan couldn't claim that he was particularly being discriminated against.
Does the court have any idea what discrimination actually is? Discriminating against a whole group of people is not better than discriminating against an isolated individual. It's worse. By the same logic you could say that a restaurant that refuses service to all black people is not discriminating. “They're not discriminating against you personally. They don't serve any black people.” Sheesh. Maybe that court had the same low-intelligence application requirements as the police department.
So we can't say for sure that all police departments are suffering from these same hiring policies. Though if the current state of the police force is any indication, it wouldn't be an unreasonable conjecture.
The entire purpose of a gun registry is to enable ease of tracking and confiscation of privately held firearms, regardless of whether such confiscation is justified.
simply paranoid. luckily people with your views make up only a small % of the population. which is why federal UBC will pass here soon.
how can I be secure in my ownership of an item if I do not have the right own that item in a mostly anonymous manner...
because the idea of the federal govt somehow orchestrating a coast-to-coast door kick-in gun seizure of every home in America isn't possible.
...especially when numerous legislators and politicians openly seek to prohibit ownership of that item?
there are no legislators or politicians at any important level calling for a nationwide ban on all civilian firearm ownership.
Plans are moving forward for a proposed indoor drive-in theater with a 1960s feel in East Nashville.
Michael Counts, the project designer, said Thursday the “August Moon Drive-In” is still targeted to open in Spring 2018.
Right now, Counts said the $10 million project is in a critical phase for about the next 90 days. It needs to raise $6.5 million to start the project, the vast majority of which has already been committed, but Counts said the theater is looking for accredited investors from the Nashville area to join the project.
“We're looking for a small group of the right partners who have a vested interest in Nashville,” Counts said in an interview with Fox 17 News.
Since publicly announcing the indoor drive-in theater, Counts said the response has been “phenomenal” and “overwhelming,” even reaching to audiences as far as Canada and Australia.
There have already been talks with Nashville Mayor Megan Barry, which Counts said were “positive” and she seemed “eager and excited.” After financing is complete, Counts will go back to the mayor to smooth out plans and permits.
The 60,000 square-foot air-supported dome is slated to be built in Main Event Parking at the intersection of James Robertson Parkway and Interstate 24. Counts said a grounds lease has been talked about with the owners of Main Event Parking which should soon be finalized.
Counts said he's thankful for the outpouring of enthusiasm from Nashvillians and plans are full steam ahead.

LAAYOUNE, Western Sahara—A day after Bill Clinton feted donors and dignitaries at an extravagant Moroccan feast under a warm Marrakech night sky, a group of local Sahrawi Arabs gathered for tea in a far more humble setting here to share their outrage that Clinton's family foundation had accepted millions of dollars from a company owned by a government accused of repressing their people.
The four men used to work as miners for a subsidiary of OCP, the state-owned phosphate company that paid more than $1 million to sponsor the lavish outdoor gala and the concurrent two-day meeting of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation headlined by the former U.S. president. Its purpose was to highlight efforts by the foundation , its donors and the Moroccan government to improve the lives of marginalized people in North Africa and the Middle East, and Bill Clinton opened the event by praising OCP, King Mohammed VI and “Morocco's longstanding friendship to my family and to the United States.”
Story Continued Below
The former miners have seen a very different side of Morocco's government and OCP. They say the company, formerly called the Office Chérifien des Phosphates, forced them to retire early and slashed their pensions, leaving them struggling to scrape by while hiring ethnic Moroccans for more senior jobs. The miners also told me how they had witnessed firsthand multiple examples of the “ arbitrary and prolonged detention” and “physical and verbal abuse” that the U.S. State Department says Moroccan authorities mete out to Sahrawis advocating for independence in Moroccan-occupied Western Sahara.
“Hillary Clinton sold her soul when they accepted that money,” declared Mohamed Lahwaimed, who gathered with the other former miners in a second floor walk-up in the Western Sahara capital of Laayoune, a modern-looking desert town with a population of 200,000 people about 500 miles southeast of Marrakech. Wearing traditional Sahrawi dara'a robes and lounging on worn pillows, they sipped green tea and spoke Arabic. “And now we are concerned that if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency of the United States of America, she will take the side of Moroccans even more,” Lahwaimed said through an interpreter.
Added fellow former miner Lahbib Salhi, “All the tainted money that Morocco has gathered from taking away our rights has been used to bribe the Clinton Foundation and the international community.”
The miners—and human rights activists interviewed in Laayoune—put real faces on abstract criticisms swirling half a world away around Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. The runaway favorite for the Democratic nomination, Clinton has found herself scrambling to answer suggestions that donations to the family's sprawling $2 billion global charity influenced her actions as secretary of state and could compromise her objectivity if elected as president.
It's certainly true that the Clintons have had a long—and lucrative—relationship with Morocco. Moroccan King Mohammed VI, who was traveling abroad during last week's CGI meeting in Marrakech, nonetheless loaned one of his palaces to Bill and Chelsea Clinton to stay in during the meeting, according to attendees. The king was listed on a donor roll as having pledged as much as $500,000 to the Clinton Foundation to help build Bill Clinton's presidential library (though the foundation says the donation never came through), while the state firm OCP has donated as much as $6 million over the years to the Clinton Foundation's efforts. Both Clintons have publicly embraced the king in recent years as an example of an Arab moderate ruler with whom the U.S. should partner, and leaked Moroccan diplomatic cables show that Hillary Clinton during her tenure as secretary of state was seen by Rabat as among its most ardent supporters in the Obama administration.
There is no evidence that she tailored her official positions to suit Morocco's preferences because of personal or financial relationships. But the overlap between her diplomatic portfolio and the funding for her family's philanthropy illustrates the way nearly any foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation can be viewed through the prism of U.S. policy. And it highlights why countries, companies and individuals that could benefit from her past and possibly future public service might be inclined to support the foundation.
In fact, Hillary Clinton's relationship with Morocco's government was pivotal in brokering last week's Clinton Global Initiative meeting in Marrakech, according to sources familiar with the foundation's inner workings. They say that, as CGI was considering options including Hong Kong and Singapore for possible international meetings, the former secretary of state, then serving on the foundation's board, talked to the king about the Moroccan option, which emerged as the frontrunner. Mrs. Clinton herself originally was listed as a meeting host, but she backed out as her presidential campaign approached, resigning from the foundation soon after officially entering the race.

As the campaign kickoff neared, the foundation proceeded with plans to hold the meeting in Marrakech with funding from OCP despite concerns of some foundation staffers about the political optics of affiliating with a state company tied to the occupation of Western Sahara and the controversial mining of a valuable natural resource, which some observers say violates international law. The approach the staffers settled on was “just to avoid using the word ‘Western Sahara' and stay out of it,” said one source involved in the planning. “It's not polite to your host.”
In a statement, the foundation said that it doesn't have a stance on the Western Sahara dispute and suggested that the issue didn't factor into the planning of the CGI meeting or the meeting itself. “CGI is not a political or diplomatic organization. CGI does not take political positions on issues and it's critical to our mission that we do not,” said the statement. “The purpose of the CGI Middle East & Africa meeting—like all CGI meetings—is to encourage meaningful Commitments to Action that address many issues, and that will ultimately expand access to clean water, create new employment opportunities for young people, and empower women and girls.”
The foundation has not facilitated any projects in Western Sahara , officials said, and the plight of the territory was not mentioned at all during the official proceedings last week in Marrakech.
When Politico broached the issue with one CGI meeting participant who works in the region, he stalked off. Another participant who witnessed the exchange urged Politico to refer to “the Southern Provinces” of Morocco, not the Western Sahara, explaining “you don't use those words here. Those are fighting words.”

Western Sahara, a vast but sparsely populated desert expanse along North Africa's Atlantic coast, has one of the world's largest reserves of phosphate, a fertilizer ingredient that has spiked in value in recent years, boosted by rising demand from international fertilizer manufacturers.

The French comedian Dieudonné M'Bala M'Bala, who has become notorious for vitriolic outbursts against Jews and use of the controversial quenelle – allegedly a quasi-Nazi salute – threatened legal action on Monday after officials banned his show.
The order against the celebrity, better known as Dieudonné, came shortly after France's interior minister, Manuel Valls, advised local authorities they were within their rights to cancel his performances as a potential threat to public order.
Valls sent a circular to municipal chiefs across the country entitled: The fight against racism and antisemitism – demonstrations and public meetings – Mr Dieudonné M'Bala M'Bala's shows.
In it, he wrote : "The fight against racism and antisemitism is a main concern for the government and demands energetic action."
He cited the comedian's show entitled Le Mur (the Wall), which begins a national tour from Thursday and which Valls said contained "antisemitic and defamatory" material that targeted "several celebrities of the Jewish confession" as well as "virulent and shocking attacks on the memory of Holocaust victims".
He added: "Respect for freedom of expression does not prevent, in exceptional circumstances … the banning of an activity if the measure is aimed only at preventing a breach of public order."
Alain Juppé, a former centre-right prime minister and mayor of Bordeaux, was the first to react, announcing a ban on Dieudonné's planned show in the city on 26 January.
Juppé told the newspaper Le Parisien: "I believe these conditions are met in Bordeaux and as a result I'm banning the show."
Dieudonné's lawyer said on Monday evening that he would contest in court any attempt to stop the performances.
The comedian has been fined several times for defamation, using insulting language, hate speech and racial discrimination. He has argued that the quenelle is an anti-establishment gesture.
However, after photographs of people, including police officers and firefighters, doing the salute near Jewish sites, synagogues and street signs, the anti-racism group SOS Racisme said it would sue anyone who distributed pictures that left no doubt as to the antisemitic nature of the gesture.
Nicolas Anelka, the West Bromwich Albion and France footballer, who is a friend of Dieudonné, faces disciplinary action for giving the quenelle after scoring against West Ham 10 days ago.
On Monday, Dieudonné was in a provocative mood. "It warms the heart to see support growing by the day!!!" he tweeted, signing off #quenelle.
Beatles candids from 50 years ago, when John pissed off the Christians

"We're more popular than Jesus now," said John Lennon during an interview with the London Evening Standard 50 years ago today on March 4, 1966.
The words would turn Christians across America against the Beatles, easily the biggest pop music act in the world at the time.
Lennon made the remark to journalist Maureen Cleave for a series called "How does a Beatle live?"
The full quote was: "Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that. I'm right and I'll be proved right. We're more popular than Jesus now. I don't know which will go first, rock 'n' roll or Christianity. Jesus was all right but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me."
No one in Great Britain paid much attention when the story ran. But, months later, when the teen magazine Datebook across the pond splashed the "more popular than Jesus " quote over its front page without context, America's Bible Belt took notice.
It was not pleased.
Beatles records and memorabilia were burned in bonfires. Disc jockeys refused to play the band's 45s (vinyl singles).
The reaction and criticism dampened the Beatles' enthusiasm to tour the U.S. in August. But the tour went on despite the protests. The band received threats over the phone and faced picketing by the Ku Klux Klan, which at one venue nailed a Beatles album to a wooden cross.
In Memphis, someone set off a firecracker on stage, further wracking nerves. Manager Brian Epstein pressed Lennon to make an apology for the "more popular" remark.
A reluctant Lennon told a reporter, "If you want me to apologize, if that will make you happy, then OK, I'm sorry."
By the end of August, the Beatles had had enough of touring. The band's concert at Candlestick Park in San Francisco on Aug. 29 was its last. From then on, they would perform together in the studio.

There are still a few hours left to contribute to the BLEduino Kickstarter campaign, but the operation is already a tremendous success. Not only did it reach its funding goal in fifty-two hours, but it has now exceeded its initial target by more than 430 percent.
This is even more impressive when you take into account that this was the first hardware crowdfunding campaign to ever come out of Puerto Rico. It is the brainchild of Caguas-based startup Kytelabs, whose three co-founders are on a mission to turn their island into a great home for hackers and makers.
BLEduino: Bluetooth made easy
When Jonathan Gonzalez, Ramon Gonzalez and Angel Viera decided to create an Arduino-compatible board that would support Bluetooth 4.0, they were essentially scratching their own itch. While working on a smart umbrella prototype earlier this year, they realized how handy it would be to rely on ready-to-use boards.
Although they soon discovered some Bluetooth-enabled boards in the market, they also noticed that these had several flaws. As a matter of fact, the model they stumbled upon was so small that its capacities and compatibility were limited. In addition, it was still quite hard for the average person to make it work.
This helped them define specs for their own project: BLEduino would have to be small enough for all sorts of projects, but still compatible with larger Arduino shields. It would also have to be affordable and easy to connect, even for newbies.
To maximize its potential, Kytelabs' founders decided to build BLEduino on top of Leonardo, while adding Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connectivity.
Kytelabs' solution to size issues is actually a separate component that its founders call the “Shield-Shield.” The team sounds quite proud of this small piece of hardware, which they say offer the wide Arduino compatibility that their competitors promise but often lack. Here's the explanation they posted on Kickstarter:
“For a board to be fully compatible, you would need it to support both the old Arduino UNO pin layout and the new Arduino Leonardo pin layout. Not only that, the boards would have to support 5V logic (which we do). The layout problem is solved by our Shield-Shield by allowing you to switch between the old and new pin layout by just flipping a switch. In other words, the same Shield-Shield is basically backwards and forwards compatible, allowing it to work with nearly all Arduino shields.”
The Shield-Shield is also quite cheap, and Kickstarter backers will get one for free if they opt for the $49 pledge (vs. $35 for the BLEduino-only reward).
One of the reasons why BLEduino is easy to connect is that it uses BLE, a subset of Bluetooth 4.0, which has many advantages over Bluetooth 2.0. For instance, pairing is only a one-off operation, and the fact that it is low-energy makes it great for passive uses. Compared to wi-fi, using Bluetooth also means that no router is necessary.
As usual with hardware components, BLEduino can have so many applications that it would be pointless to list them all. Still, Kytelabs' Kickstarter video does a good job at showing potential hacks, from connected LEDs and LCDs to teleguided robots.
Since hardware can be quite intimidating for beginners, Kytelabs' team has used its software developing skills to create an iPhone app with pre-set modes. While Android doesn't have official support for Bluetooth 4.0, Kytelabs has already promised that it will also launch its app on Google Play as soon as it does.
This app-based approach is likely one of the key elements of BLEduino's appeal and accessibility. It is worth noting that the app is open source, and Kytelabs will release its code in August once design details are finalized.
To broaden BLEduino's reach, the team is also hopeful that the product will one day be distributed in the Arduino Store, which will depend on official approval and the payment of a licensing fee.
In the meantime, the first clients to put their hands on the BLEduinos will be its Kickstarter backers, to whom they should start shipping in November after Kytelabs completes quality assurance and packaging. Since the startup is familiar with the pain of international shipping costs, it decided to offer a flat shipping rate to all non-US clients, even if it may have a negative impact on its margin.
Joining forces
“The main reason we did Kickstarter was to motivate Puerto Ricans to do their own thing in hardware,”Jonathan Gonzalez tells TNW. While the team doesn't expect to make profits from its campaign, it has also been keeping expenses impressively low. It has only spent $1,500 over the last six months, despite the fact that it needed to buy tools and import components.
This was only possible thanks to engineering company EngiWorks, which gave Kytelabs the free office space it needed to design and assemble its prototypes. For instance, the soldering work is done on-site by Angel, who is in charge of most of the startup's hardware tasks.
EngiWorks is not the only Puerto Rican entity to support BLEduino, and Kytelabs' founders were surprised to see how many of their Kickstarter backers come from Puerto Rico – around 25 percent. This share was even bigger at the beginning of the campaign, although most of these early backers made donations rather than try to pre-buy a BLEduino board.
“We were very surprised by the local support we got, because we never saw demand for [hardware] here,” Jonathan says. He still wonders how much of this goodwill has to do with the content of Kytelabs' work: “Some people even wanted to send money orders after hearing about us, because they didn't trust the Internet for payments,” he laughs.
Conversely, he and his co-founders were quite thrilled by the international support the campaign has received. According to Kytelabs, it has attracted contributions from open hardware fans from over 50 countries – which means quite a lot in terms of putting Puerto Rico on the map.
Puerto Rico, a place for hackers and makers?
Working on BLEduino from Puerto Rico had its pros and cons. While it helped the team keep many expenses low, the lack of an active hardware community also meant that all components had to be imported. Still, Kytelabs' initiative is helping many hardware and startup aficionados come out of the woodwork.
“The Facebook community for hardware in Puerto Rico has grown a lot, and we get many emails these days. Even our friends take what we do more seriously, and it is having an impact on the image of entrepreneurship in general,” Jonathan explains.
Hardware knowledge is not uncommon among Puerto Rican techies. All three Kytelabs founders studied at the University of Puerto Rico, Managuez, where they say 70 percent of the Computer Engineering degree focuses on hardware. Ironically, they also report that Arduino has been outlawed for student work, as professors deemed that it made things “too easy.”
Because of this ambivalence, Angel, Jonathan and Ramon disagree on whether their education is directly responsible for their achievements. On one hand, Ramon notes that it was during their studies that they respectively developed custom design projects such as the Pyrobot and the rotary SWORD display. On the other hand, he and his co-founders explain that they learned a lot by themselves.
Jonathan points out that fellow students who didn't do extra work and didn't show personal interest in hardware projects would be unprepared to join startups like Kytelabs, whose team has the specificity to be able to combine hardware and software.
As we noted in a previous post on Puerto Rico's nascent tech ecosystem, launching startups after or before graduating is still new on the island, where computer science graduates often take job offers from large corporations in the continental U.S.
However, Kytelabs' story shows that things have changed. According to Ramphis Castro from Startups of Puerto Rico, it was the first team that attempted to create a startup straight out of school, and it won't be the last. “The community has enabled this to now be a real option for students on the island,” Ramphis predicts, in reference to the many initiatives that have blossomed in Puerto Rico.
This is why Kytelabs' example is so important for the local economy; by becoming role models, its founders can inspire others to follow the same path. They have already contacted their former professors to offer some of their time and will soon start giving presentations on lean startups, customer development and crowdfunding to computer engineering students, while becoming mentors to high school students.
Beyond startups and entrepreneurship, Kytelabs' ambition is to round up all hackers and makers. “There are tons of makers in Puerto Rico; they just don't know it yet, or they don't know there are others like them,” Jonathan says.
To acknowledge this talent, the team is planning to add new events to Puerto Rico's increasingly busy schedule, such as a MakerFaire and a BLEduino-focused hackathon. It is also hoping to get public support for these initiatives, as Puerto Rico's government is showing a keen interest in the local tech scene.
This preoccupation was made clear last June during the first edition of Puerto Rico Tech Summit, which discussed how governments can embrace technologies. The event also included a dedicated hackathon, which Kytelabs' team won thanks to Digidoc, an e-signature solution for government agencies.
Turning this prototype into a product may well be the next item on the startup's roadmap. However, it will have to wait until the team is done shipping BLEduinos and other rewards to its many Kickstarter backers all over the world.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- A former NFL player has been sentenced to life in prison for a series of home-invasion robberies and a sexual assault in Sacramento.
Keith Wright, who is 32, was sentenced Friday in Sacramento County Superior Court to multiple life terms. He was convicted last month of 19 charges that included forcible oral copulation, armed robbery, kidnapping, burglary and false imprisonment.
Prosecutors say DNA evidence and stolen items found in Wright's home connected him to three home invasion robberies in July and August 2011.
The former University of Missouri defensive lineman saw little playing time in the NFL after being selected in the sixth round of the draft by the Houston Texans in 2003.
He also was with the Indianapolis Colts, Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Detroit Lions.
Seizing peoples' attention on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles is no easy feat. But a billboard depicting a U.S. soldier and a Muslim woman has managed to do just that.
The ad for SnoreStop sleep aids is meant to emphasize how the product can save couples. Between the hashtag #betogether and the slogan "Keeping you together" is a soldier embracing the woman, who's wearing a wedding ring.
"[The ad] is trying to shock you into looking at it," observer Jan Clair told CBS Los Angeles.
"We want to show couples that you normally don't see in advertising," SnoreStop spokeswoman Melody Devemark told the station. "People feel that we are trying to misuse the image of military servicemen. I think they don't understand that there are couples like this that do exist."
Fox 5 in San Diego reported that the campaign was inspired by a real-life veteran named Jamie Sutton and his wife, Aleah. In a behind-the-scenes YouTube video, the company says it wanted to celebrate diversity and generate publicity in the process.
Early reactions on trade publication AdWeek were positive, with some calling the ad "excellent" and "cool." The Council on American-Islamic Relations also gave the advertisement a thumbs-up.
"If you have Muslims in an ad for a product that's not about religion or not a PSA, it's a sign that we're accepted as a cultural norm," a spokeswoman for the organization told The Huffington Post.
More of the billboards are going up in San Diego, Houston, Salt Lake City, New York City and elsewhere.
Check out an interview with the ad's models, U.S. soldier Paul Evans and actress Lexy Panterra, below.
US Army general
Vincent Keith Brooks (born October 24, 1958) is a United States Army general who commanded United States Forces Korea, United Nations Command and ROK-U.S. Combined Forces Command. He previously served as commanding general of the United States Army Pacific and before that as the commanding general of Third Army.[1] Brooks was the United States Central Command Deputy Director of Operations during the War in Iraq, and frequently briefed the media, which raised his public profile. He also served as the Chief of Army Public Affairs The Pentagon. He was the deputy commander of 1st Cavalry Division in Baghdad during the 2006-2008 "surge" and upon returning to the United States became the commanding general of the same division. He later was commanding general of the 1st Infantry Division. General Brooks assumed command in Korea on April 30, 2016 and was succeeded by Robert B. Abrams in November 2018. Brooks is scheduled to retire after completing his assignment in Korea.
Family [ edit ]
Brooks was born in Anchorage, Alaska. He grew up in an Army family in California, and his father Major General Leo A. Brooks Sr. and brother Brigadier General Leo A. Brooks Jr. both retired after careers in the Army.[2][3] His uncle, Francis K. Brooks was the majority leader of the Vermont House of Representatives and a member of the Vermont Senate.[4][5] Vincent Brooks attended Thomas Jefferson High School in Alexandria, Virginia, for two years and then Jesuit High School in Carmichael, California, and graduated in 1976. He was a basketball player and he decided to follow his brother to West Point to study to become an officer.
Military service [ edit ]
Brooks as a cadet in 1980
Brooks with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in 2018
At West Point, Brooks was the academy's first African-American Cadet First Captain, the highest position (Cadet Brigade Commander) a cadet can hold, an appointment that brought much public visibility at an early age in life. He graduated from West Point in 1980. After graduating from Brooks served in South Korea and Kosovo among other places. In Kosovo he concurrently served as the deputy commander of the U.S. force in Kosovo (Task Force Falcon) and as commander of the 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division based at Fort Stewart in Georgia. From that position he moved to the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon. While serving there he was temporarily assigned to be Deputy Director of Operations at U.S. Central Command or CENTCOM. Returning to the Pentagon and The Joint Staff in April 2003 he became the Lead Strategic Planner for the Global War on Terrorism working closely with the CIA, the Departments of State, Treasury and Justice, the FBI and the military's U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM).
In his role as Deputy Director of Operations he also became the spokesperson of United States Central Command, the main force in the Middle East. At that time he was the youngest general officer in the Army. From 2006 to 2008 Brooks served as the Deputy Commanding General of 1st Cavalry Division, serving for fifteen months in Baghdad as second in command of the main effort (Multinational Division - Baghdad) stabilizing the Iraqi capital city and province during what is now called "The Surge." Upon return from Iraq, he took command of the 1st Cavalry Division until April 2008. Following an assignment as the Deputy Commanding General of the Army's III (Third) Corps at Fort Hood, Texas, he again took command of a combat unit, serving as the Commanding General of the historic 1st Infantry Division at Fort Riley in Kansas from April 2009 to May 2011. He deployed the unit to Iraq for a year, serving as U.S. Division - South, responsible for securing the heavily Shi'ite areas of the southern half of the country. The headquarters was in Basra, Iraq. Following two years in a second division-level command, Brooks took command of U.S. Army Central and Third Army responsible for all U.S. Army operations throughout the Middle East and Central Asia (from Egypt to Kazakhstan). During this time, Brooks oversaw the reduction of forces in Iraq as well as the build up of forces in Afghanistan.
As part of the "Asia Pivot" of the East Asian foreign policy of the Barack Obama administration, Brooks envisioned and brought into execution a "Pacific Pathways" of a single US Army unit that would move to different countries of the Asia and Pacific regions for up to three months at a time to develop first-hand understanding of the region. While initially criticized in some circles[6] the innovative approach has met high acclaim from the countries of the region and the units involved in the missions.
In March 2016, Brooks was nominated to command United States Forces Korea, the U.S.-South Korea Combined Forces Command, and United Nations Command, succeeding Curtis Scaparrotti.[7] He served until October 2018, and was succeeded by Robert B. Abrams. Brooks was scheduled to retire after completing his command assignment in Korea.

A new NASA and university analysis of ocean data collected more than 135 years ago by the crew of the HMS Challenger oceanographic expedition provides further confirmation that human activities have warmed our planet over the past century.
Researchers from the University of Tasmania, Sandy Bay, Australia; and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., combined the ship's measurements of ocean temperatures with modern observations from the international Argo array of ocean profiling floats. They used both as inputs to state-of-the-art climate models, to get a picture of how the world's oceans have changed since the Challenger's voyage.
The Challenger expedition, from 1872 to 1876, was the world's first global scientific survey of life beneath the ocean surface. Along the way, scientists measured ocean temperatures, lowering thermometers hundreds of meters deep on ropes.
"The key to this research was to determine the range of uncertainty for the measurements taken by the crew of the Challenger," said Josh Willis, a JPL climate scientist and NASA project scientist for the upcoming U.S./European Jason-3 oceanography satellite, scheduled to launch in 2015. "After we had taken all these uncertainties into account, it became apparent that the rate of warming we saw across the oceans far exceeded the degree of uncertainty around the measurements. So, while the uncertainty was large, the warming signal detected was far greater."
Uncertainties around the Challenger's measurements were caused by the limited areas measured during the voyage; the actual depths the thermometers descended to; and the likely natural variation in temperature that could occur in each region during the voyage.
"Our research revealed warming of the planet can be clearly detected since 1873 and that our oceans continue to absorb the great majority of this heat," said researcher and lead author Will Hobbs of the University of Tasmania's Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies and the Australian Research Council's Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science. "Currently, scientists estimate the oceans absorb more than 90 percent of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases, and we attribute the global warming to anthropogenic (human-produced) causes."
The Challenger expedition measurements also revealed that thermal expansion of seawater caused by global warming contributed about 40 percent of the total sea level rise seen in tide gauges from 1873 to 1955. The remaining 60 percent was likely to have come from the melting of ice sheets and glaciers. Prior to this research, climate models offered the only way to estimate the change before the 1950s.
Results of the study are published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.

A tearful Carryn Owens, the widow of U.S. Navy SEAL William "Ryan" Owens who died in a raid in Yemen, received a standing ovation from Congress when President Trump acknowledged her husband's bravery. (Reuters)
The invitation came on Jan. 30, the day after her husband was killed in a raid on an al-Qaeda stronghold in Yemen.
President Trump, then just 10 days in office, called Carryn Owens, the grieving widow of Navy SEAL William “Ryan” Owens, to express his condolences, according to a White House account, and to invite her and her three children to visit him at the White House.
“By the way,” Trump told Owens, according to the White House, “I'm going to be giving this speech in February. If you feel comfortable, I would love to have you as a guest.”
Owens was overcome with emotion from the past 24 hours. She told the president that she appreciated him asking, but was noncommittal. Trump directed a military aide to follow up with her until, ultimately, she accepted.
The story of how Owens made it to the balcony of the House chamber Tuesday night to create the emotional high point of Trump's joint address to Congress was recounted Wednesday by White House press secretary Sean Spicer in his briefing with reporters.
Near the end of his 60-minute speech, Trump recounted the counterterrorism raid — his first as president — and recognized Carryn Owens, whose eyes were filling with tears. He said of her late husband, “Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity,” as she looked to the heavens. The crowd of lawmakers, administration officials and military leaders stood to applaud her for two full minutes.
“I've been in this town 25 years, probably watched ‘State of the Unions' for 30,” Spicer said. “I've never seen a sustained applause like that.”
[President Trump harnesses the power of the crowd]
Spicer said the past month has been an emotional roller coaster for the Owens family, but the White House staff worked closely with Carryn to arrange the visit.
“Our goal was to make sure that we respected her wishes and her privacy,” Spicer said. “Even with referencing her in the speech, that was her decision. We asked her, ‘The president would like to raise this,' and she said, ‘I'd like that.'”
Trump's aides kept Owens' name off the list released to the media of guests who would be sitting in first lady Melania Trump's box, so as to lessen the media attention on the family in the run-up to the speech, Spicer said.
Adding to the sensitivity was the public posture Ryan Owens' father was taking. Bill Owens said in an interview last Friday with the Miami Herald that he had reservations about the decision to launch his son's fatal mission in Yemen and called for an investigation. He also said he was troubled by Trump's incendiary comments during last year's campaign about another Gold Star family.
Bill Owens also said that when Trump and daughter Ivanka visited Dover Air Force Base to pay their respects to the Owens family as Ryan's flag-draped casket was carried off a military jet, he declined to visit with the president.
“I'm sorry, I don't want to see him,” Bill Owens recalled telling a chaplain in his interview with the Herald. “I told them, ‘I don't want to meet the president.'”
Clearly, Carryn Owens felt differently. On Tuesday, she and her children visited the White House. They met privately with Trump and some of his senior aides. The kids ate lunch at the Navy mess, toured the White House and hung out for a bit with Spicer, who for years has been an officer in the Navy Reserve.
“They're kids,” Spicer said. “They were happy. They were running around. I don't know that they fully appreciate the sacrifice that their father made.”

Yesterday President Trump invited a bunch of network anchors to lunch and told them he was open to a comprehensive immigration bill that included a path to legal status—but not citizenship—for undocumented immigrants. The anchors were permitted only to source this to a “senior administration official,” and they did. This fed a round of positive news coverage in the hours leading up to Trump's address to Congress.
Today, however, CNN reports that Trump was deliberately lying to them. Mediaite has the story:
CNN reported Wednesday on a senior administration official admitting that the White House intentionally misled reporters ahead of President Donald Trump‘s congressional address in order to get generate positive press coverage as part of a “misdirection play.” ….Host John King wondered why reporters should even trust the White House going forward. “It does make you wonder; so we're not supposed to believe what the senior-most official at the lunch says — who then they allowed it to be the president's name says — we're not supposed to believe what they say?” he asked. “Maybe we shouldn't believe what they say.”
What are reporters supposed to do the next time Trump tells them something on background? Or any other White House official? Given their track record, can reporters believe anything they say?
First Nations in Ontario will get the chance to buy shares in Hydro One, a public utility the Liberal government has partially privatized.
The government says it has reached an agreement in principle with the province's First Nations to loan them up to $268-million to buy up to 15 million shares at $18 per share.
That is above the province's book value, but below the $24-to-$26 range the stock has been trading in recent months.

For the deal to go through, at least 80 per cent of the band councils will have to approve the agreement by the end of next year.
If ratified, Ontario would sell the shares to a new investment vehicle owned collectively by First Nations and provide seed capital of up to $45-million over three years.
Energy Minister Glenn Thibeault says in a statement that this would give economic development opportunities to First Nations across the province.
Thirty per cent of the utility's shares have already been sold, and if 15 million shares are sold to the First Nations, it would represent another 2.5 per cent.
The Great American streetcar scandal (also known as the General Motors streetcar conspiracy and the National City Lines conspiracy) is a conspiracy in which streetcar systems throughout the United States were dismantled and replaced with buses in the mid-20th century as a result of illegal actions by a number of prominent companies, acting through National City Lines (NCL), Pacific City Lines (on the West Coast, starting in 1938), and American City Lines (in large cities, starting in 1943).
National, which had been in operation since 1920, was organized into a holding company, and General Motors, Firestone Tire, Standard Oil of California, Phillips Petroleum, Mack, and the Federal Engineering Corporation made investments in the City Lines companies in return for exclusive supply contracts. Between 1936 and 1950, National City Lines bought out more than 100 electric surface-traction systems in 45 cities, including Detroit, New York City, Oakland, Philadelphia, Phoenix, St. Louis, Salt Lake City, Tulsa, Baltimore, Minneapolis, and Los Angeles, and replaced them with GM buses. American City Lines merged with National in 1946
Indeed, in the 1920s automaker General Motors (GM) began a covert campaign to undermine the popular rail-based public transit systems that were ubiquitous in and around the country's bustling urban areas. At the time, only one in 10 Americans owned cars and most people traveled by trolley and streetcar.
Within three decades, GM, with help from Standard Oil, Firestone Tire, Mack Truck and Phillips Petroleum, succeeded in decimating the nation's trolley systems, while seeing to the creation of the federal highway system and the ensuing dominance of the automobile as America's preferred mode of transport.
GM began by funding a company called National City Lines (NCL), which by 1946 controlled streetcar operations in 80 American cities.
“Despite public opinion polls that showed 88 percent of the public favoring expansion of the rail lines after World War II, NCL systematically closed its streetcars down until, by 1955, only a few remained,” writes author Jim Motavalli in his 2001 book, Forward Drive.
The idea was simple. Starting in 1936, National City (in the East and South) and its subsidiaries American City Lines (Midwest) and Pacific City Lines (West) bought controlling interests in 146 trolley systems in the U.S. and Canada, using money laundered through several finance companies that were in on the scheme. The new managers were directed to abandon streetcar service and replace the trolleys with GM buses. Contracts were then signed ensuring the exclusive use of Firestone tires and rubber products, and Standard Oil fuels and lubricants. Vendors who had held contracts for decades were frozen out. GM, Firestone and Standard Oil sales zoomed, and profits went through the roof.
Many of those trolley systems were already in poor financial shape, some of them about to collapse, in the wake of 1935 federal anti-trust legislation (which, ironically, had mortally wounded many trolley companies by severing their connections to power companies – and their access to cheap electricity). But others, particularly in the bigger cities, were healthy – and getting healthier with the delivery of brand-new, ultramodern trolleys called "PCC cars" (small fleets of which are still operating in some American cities, providing comfortable, fast, safe service to thousands of commuters every day.)
GM first replaced trolleys with free-roaming buses, eliminating the need for tracks embedded in the street and clearing the way for cars. As dramatized in a 1996 PBS docudrama, Taken for a Ride, Alfred P. Sloan, GM's president at the time, said, “We've got 90 percent of the market out there that we can…turn into automobile users. If we can eliminate the rail alternatives, we will create a new market for our cars.” And they did just that, with the help of GM subsidiaries Yellow Coach and Greyhound Bus. Sloan predicted that the jolting rides of buses would soon lead people to not want them and to buy GM's cars instead.
Quinby, a longtime trolley advocate from New Jersey, had shocked his wealthy parents by taking a blue-collar job operating a huge, interurban trolley between Paterson, N.J., and Ridgewood, N.Y., as his first job after college. When World War II came, he enlisted in the Navy and was stationed in Key West, Fla. He was still there when, in 1945, the conspirators resumed their temporarily delayed program.
Among the first to recognize the devastation that was taking place, Quinby prepared a detailed manifesto, which he sent to every mayor, city manager and member of Congress – to everyone and anyone, in short, who had anything to do with governance, regulation, politics or transportation.
I got hip to this a year or so ago from the show Cities of the Underworld where they showed the defunct and rotting subway system under Los Angeles. I did a search here, didn't come across this so I thought I would share this little bit if history that has been hidden.This gave rise to the car culture we now have today. Whereas in those days one could walk down a street and walk directly into a business now they have to build huge parking lots to accommodate the cars and has limited the access for those without cars, the elderly and the handicapped.Why did this happen? Interesting question.In the late 19th century, rail based systems were becoming commonplace in the cities of the U.S. Of course, they required power, so the companies also went into the electric business. They had enough excess power to sell to the consumer and soon the electric companies outgrew their trolley and subway businesses. Problems with labor, increasing difficulties in routing and competition from the automobile soon came into play and the increasing were and tear on systems that weren't making as much money as the companies wanted made for the death knell of the streetcar.They just couldn't make enough money, those poor companies, so they had to do something.Seems the public was happy with what it had, for the most part. Irregardless, the subways and streetcars kept disappearing.Corporate greed and cronyism at it's finest.They forced us to buy their cars, use their oil, tires and other such items as were needed for the making and upkeep of the automobile.This would have gone unknown by the public if not for the actions of a Naval officer E. Jay Quinby, stationed in Florida.Good on him, I say. Too bad these types of tactics are useless today as our leaders can't be bothered to listen to anything the American people say.On April 9, 1947, nine corporations and seven individuals were indicted in Los Angeles Federal District Court on two counts of anti-trust violations: "conspiracy to acquire control of a number of transit companies to form a transportation monopoly, and conspiring to monopolize sales of buses and supplies to companies owned by the City Lines."Continues in next post. I didn't expect this to be this long but I guess there's a little more info than I thought.EDIT: Spelling errors[edit on 9/30/2009 by TheLoony]
We haven't seen much of Sonic Forces' Classic Sonic levels yet, but Sega just dropped a new trailer that should comfort old-school players. One of the game's classic-style stages is Casino Forest, the latest iteration on a familiar type of Sonic the Hedgehog level.
I may be in the minority, but I get a lot of anxiety just thinking about Sonic's casino levels. At a pre-Tokyo Game Show event last week, Sonic Forces' lead programmer, Hiroshi Takunaga, demoed Casino Forest for us — and even he found himself struggling with the game's various pinball segments. I just remember getting magnificently stuck in Sonic CD's version of the casino level, Collision Chaos, back in the day ... so stuck that I still struggle to get past it even now.
But Casino Forest looks charming, the slot machine rigamarole aside. And anyone who still swears by Sonic the Hedgehog 2's Casino Night Zone and its successors will likely find much to love in Casino Forest. It's a paean to those beloved older games' stages, as are the other Classic Sonic levels in Sonic Forces.
Don't expect a recreated Sega Genesis experience, a la Sonic Mania, however. Sonic Forces is a modern Sonic project through and through. But Sega did tell me that Sonic Mania's success at adapting original Sonic gameplay for the current generation had an influence on how the team developed Sonic Forces' Classic Sonic stages.
“[Takunaga] has spent a lot of time going in deep on how [Sonic Mania] feels and how it moves,” game director Morio Kishimoto told me. “In that aspect, Classic Sonic stages have taken some reference to Sonic Mania because it's been a very great help at looking into Classic Sonic.”
Maybe I'm not so pumped for Casino Forest, but Kishimoto's statements should be encouraging for those who aren't as clumsy with those Sonic slots. Sonic Forces is out Nov. 7.
VR headset developer kits from Acer and HP that work with Microsoft's upcoming Windows 10 mixed reality platform will be available for pre-order today starting at around $300.
The hardware of the headsets themselves likely won't change between when these systems start shipping to developers and when they are marketed toward consumers in a push planned for the holidays this year, according to Microsoft. Software and content of course will be lacking until then, and the Windows operating system itself is still evolving to fully support mixed reality at the core of the system. This means that to actually do anything with the headsets before the consumer push you'd need to be a developer, use Windows in a development mode and program software yourself for the kit.
Both HP and Acer headsets feature LCD displays which are expected to be less expensive than the OLED displays used in Facebook's Oculus Rift and HTC's Vive. Those more expensive screens provide smooth and comfortable visuals for most users, and some of these benefits may be lacking on Acer and HP systems. I tried the Acer development edition headset during a demo at Microsoft's Build conference this week and noticed a kind of stutter to the visuals when moving my head backward and forward or my whole body to the right and left. It is unclear the reason for the stutter — a different writer for Upload tried the headset recently at an event in New York and described a “motion-blur when you moved around — creating a fuzziness to the graphics.”
An interview late last year with Microsoft's Alex Kipman indicated the company intends to support partners building headsets with a variety of specifications. Those partners include the previously mentioned Acer and HP as well as ASUS, Dell, Lenovo and 3Glasses. If OLED screens similar to what Vive and Rift use for smoother visuals are included in any of those headsets it is likely they'll be more expensive overall than the $300 Acer system. All the headsets are powered by a Windows 10 PC.
Microsoft is also announcing Motion Controllers with full six degrees of freedom that will be offered as a bundle with the Acer headset later this year for around $400. If trying to compare to the $600 Rift and Touch bundle, we would note there are likely going to be significant differences in how these controllers perform compared with those used by the Vive and Rift — mainly due to the nature of the widely different tracking methods. So while this Microsoft-powered Acer bundle is $200 cheaper than the Rift and Touch, and will be more convenient since the headset and controllers don't require external cameras or laser emitting boxes to work, there are still likely to be significant differences in the applications that are best suited for the varying hardware.

Longtime Le Mans participant WR is set to return to Circuit de la Sarthe in 2016 as a potential Garage 56 entry with a biogas-powered prototype.
The French squad, which last took part in the twice-around-the-clock endurance classic in 2010, has launched a new project that will showcase alternative technology.
The car will utilize a 1.6-liter 3-cylinder engine running on biogas, which is primarily made up of methane and carbon dioxide. It will be outfitted with a cryogenic fuel tank and will feature liquid injection.
Led by Gerard Welter, the project also sees involvement from a number of former Renault and Peugeot motorsport staff, including Jean-Pierre Boudy, Guy Audoux and Vincent Soulignac.
Construction of the car, built to FIA LMP regulations, is set to begin next year, with plans to present the all-new prototype during next year's 24 Hours of Le Mans, with the goal of securing the Garage 56 entry in 2016.

Arts subjects are being cut because those who teach them are not saying why they matter, says Alain de Botton.
Speak to anyone working in the humanities within academia right now and you will hear that this country is about to enter a new Dark Age. The reason lies in the coalition government's decision to impose swingeing cuts on almost all departments.
Philosophers, historians, classicists and literary critics feel especially badly let down. They fear a new age of philistinism, a moment when the nation finally gives up on serious culture and focuses instead on making money and inebriating itself on talent contests and celebrity chat shows.
If asked to apportion blame for what has happened to their departments, these academics do not have to search long for an answer, obviously "the government" is responsible. It is the government that has failed to appreciate the valuable work that the humanities do and it must therefore be scorned accordingly.
A Point of View's latest writer The BBC has an enormous reputation for impartiality - but part of that also involves occasionally letting people be quite partial and personal in their take on things. That's what makes Point of View so distinctive. I want to try to respond to familiar stories of our times, with a little more analysis and opinion than is normally allowed in the media. I'd like to provoke thought, analysis - and the occasional disagreement. I'll be looking at the way museums work, how people talk to one another, what a non-scientist can say about environmental catastrophe and why marriage is a spiritual discipline. The dialogue with readers through comments is also part of the pleasure of the exercise.
It could seem unfair to knock someone when they are already down, but personally I can't help but feel this approach and analysis lets academics off far too lightly. I have spent most of my professional life around and in the shadow of academics in the humanities, and have benefited hugely from the stored knowledge that they sit upon.
However, right now, at this difficult moment in the history of British universities, there is a need to acknowledge that at least some of the woes that have befallen academics is squarely their own fault. To put it at its simplest, academics in the humanities have failed to explain why what they do should matter so much. They've failed to explain to the government, but this really only means "us" - the public at large.
They have allowed themselves to be offended by the very need to justify their relevance, speaking only in dangerously vague terms about the value of culture in helping people to "think" or they have counted on having just enough respect left not to have to spell out why they should exist at all, other than because what they do is just so important.
Now they have learnt that if they couldn't say in clear terms why they still mattered, then an impatient, harried government might just decide that they didn't really, and a bored, stressed, stoical wider public wouldn't bother to raise a hand in protest.
Don't get me wrong, I care deeply for the humanities and believe they have a vital role to play in a healthy society. I just think that the way culture is currently taught in universities is a travesty of its real potential, and that the government cuts are an understandable, if not at all nice, consequence of the failure of current teaching methods and goals.
Tease
My personal view of what the humanities are for is simple - they should help us to live. We should look to culture as a repository of useful and consoling ideas about how to face our most pressing personal and professional issues. We should look to novels and historical narratives to impart moral instruction and edification, to great paintings for suggestions about value, to philosophy to probe our anxieties and offer consolations.
It should be the job of a university education to tease out the therapeutic and illuminative aspects of culture, so that we can emerge from a period of study as slightly less disturbed, selfish, unempathetic and blinkered human beings, who can be of greater benefit not only to the economy, but also to our friends, our children and our spouses.
Image caption Do we learn more from Oprah Winfrey?
I'm certainly not the first person to express these hopes of education. You start to hear them in mid-19th Century Victorian Britain, when men like John Stuart Mill come out with statements like: "The object of universities is not to make skilful lawyers, physicians or engineers. It is to make capable and cultivated human beings."
His contemporary Matthew Arnold sounded similar notes, expressing a view that a liberal education should help to inspire in us "a love of our neighbour, a desire for clearing human confusion and for diminishing human misery". At its most ambitious, Arnold added, it should even engender the "noble aspiration to leave the world better and happier than we found it".
These well-meaning, mid-Victorians wanted to use humanistic culture to replace scripture. They wanted universities to become our new churches, places that would teach us how to live, but without dogma or superstition.
Human misery
Claims that culture could stand in for scripture - that Middlemarch could take up the responsibilities previously handled by the Psalms, or the essays of Schopenhauer satisfy needs once catered to by Saint Augustine's City of God - still have a way of sounding a bit eccentric, or just insane in their combination of impiety and ambition. But I want to argue that we are wrong to be suspicious of such claims. Culture can and should change and save our lives.
Image caption Alan Bennett's History Boys was about lessons in life
Though it was at first hoped by men like Arnold and Mill that universities might be our new churches, these centres of learning have never offered what churches invariably focus on - guidance. It is a basic tenet of contemporary scholarship that no academic should connect works of culture to individual sorrows.
The contemporary guardians of culture have a habit of cudgelling anyone who might try to use culture for didactic ends or to open a subject up to a mass audience. When confronted by those who demand of culture that it should be relevant and useful, that it should offer up advice on how to choose a career or survive the end of a marriage, how to contain sexual impulses or cope with the news of a medical death sentence, the guardians of culture become very disdainful.
Whatever the rhetoric of graduation ceremonies and the ambitious tone of prospectuses, there seems a strange and regrettable truth to confront about the workings of the modern university, that the institution has precious little interest in teaching us any emotional or ethical life skills - how to love our neighbours, clear human confusion, diminish human misery and leave the world better and happier than we found it.
To judge by what they do rather than what they airily declaim, universities are in the business of turning out a majority of tightly focused professionals (accountants, lawyers, physicians, engineers) and a minority of culturally well-informed, but ethically confused arts graduates aptly panicked about how they might remuneratively occupy the rest of their lives.
Vulgar
We have implicitly charged our higher-education system with a dual and possibly contradictory mission, to teach us how to make a living and to teach us how to live. And we have left the second of these two aims recklessly vague and unattended.
How should universities be rearranged? In my view, departments should be required to identify the problematic areas in people's lives and to design courses that address them head on. Notions of assistance and transformation which presently hover ghost-like over speeches at graduation ceremonies should be properly explored.

There should be classes in, among other topics, being alone, reconsidering work, improving relationships with children, reconnecting with nature and facing illness. A university alive to the true responsibilities of cultural artefacts within a secular age would establish a Department for Relationships, an Institute of Dying and a Centre for Self-Knowledge.
Universities may well be teaching the right books but they too often fail to ask direct questions of them, declining to advance sufficiently vulgar, neo-religious enquiries because they are embarrassed to admit the true nature of our inner needs. They are fatefully in love with ambiguity, they trust in the absurd modernist doctrine that great art should have no moral content or desire to change its audience.
We have constructed an intellectual world whose most celebrated institutions rarely dare to ask, let alone answer, the most serious questions of the soul. Oprah Winfrey may not provide the deepest possibly analysis of the human condition, but arguably, in my view, she asks many more of the right questions than the humanities' professors at Oxford.

LABOUR face the humiliating prospect of losing to the Tories at the Holyrood election and slumping into third place, an exclusive Record poll predicts today.
The shock result comes as Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale prepares to rally her party's spring conference in Glasgow.
Failure to hold on as the second party in the Scottish Parliament would be catastrophic for Labour, whose support has melted away in recent years.
Our Survation poll of more than 1000 adults suggests Dugdale will lose to rival Ruth Davidson by a single seat on May 5.
Labour and the Tories are tied at 18 per cent on the regional ballot. In the constituency vote, Labour edge it on 20 per cent compared to the Tories on 16.
But when the numbers are crunched through Scotland's complex voting system, the Tories could come out on top with 22 seats to Labour's 21.
The battle for second place has become the main contest in an election the SNP are certain to win, barring a major upset over the next few weeks.
Our poll puts the SNP on an astonishing 70 seats out of the available 129 at Holyrood, one more than they secured in 2011.
The SNP are on 54 per cent in the constituencies and 42 per cent in regions.
The Greens are on 10 per cent, which could give them nine MSPs.
Ukip would win their first and only Holyrood seat, the poll suggests, while the Lib Dems would move up from five to six seats.
The seats were calculated using the online ScotlandVotes seat predictor, hosted by marketing firm Weber Shandwick.
The results will make grim reading for Dugdale as she goes into today's conference. She'll try to put a brave face on it by insisting the shine is coming off the SNP, particularly their record on the NHS and schools.
Dudgale will promise a Scottish Labour government would set up an online system to book GP appointments within 48 hours.
Last night, Scottish Labour said: “For the first time since devolution, the Scottish Parliament election in May will be about how we use the major new tax powers to invest in the future of our economy.
“Kezia Dugdale has set out a bold plan to stop the SNP's cuts to schools and other vital services. Faced with the choice between using Scotland's powers to invest in the future of our economy or carrying on with the SNP's cuts to schools, Labour would use the powers.
“We will go into this election with a bold plan to give everybody in Scotland a fair chance in life. We are in no doubt about the scale of challenge but we are confident in our vision for Scotland.”
The Survation poll also looks at popularity ratings of party leaders, putting Dugdale below Davidson and Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie.

SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon was the only one scoring a positive result, at 21. Green leader Patrick Harvie scored minus one.
Prime Minister David Cameron has the worst result of any British political leader at minus 35.
SNP business convener Derek Mackay said: “This is yet another very positive poll for the SNP as we approach the election – but is an absolute disaster for Kezia Dugdale on the morning of her own conference.
“People are continuing to reject a chaotic and divided Labour party which isn't even regarded as a credible party of opposition, never mind a credible party of
government – and which finds itself locked in a desperate battle for second place with the Tories.
“And with their complete lack of any positive vision for Scotland, Labour's position is only going to get worse.
“It's also heartening to see such positive approval ratings for Nicola Sturgeon, while Kezia Dugdale finds herself even more unpopular than a right-wing Tory leader.”
Davidson has already predicted big things for the Tories in May, but the party tried to play down the poll last night.
A spokeswoman said: “People are responding to Ruth's pledge to hold the SNP to account.”
• Survation polled 1051 Scots aged over 16 between March 10 and 17.

Two thirds of Scots say they want Britain to stay in EU
THE fight to keep Britain in the EU is backed by 65 per cent of Scots, a Record poll shows today.
Our exclusive survey reveals almost two-thirds support the campaign to stay in Europe.
Backing for a Brexit has increased by one point in a month, while support for staying in Europe has fallen by a single point.
The results, calculated by pollsters Survation, show Scots are more likely to favour retaining membership of the EU but in the rest of the UK the margin is much tighter.
The poll result comes as MSPs on Holyrood's Europe Committee publish a new report showing the benefits of continued membership.
It underlines Scotland's “crucial” access to the single market and fears for a long, difficult period if Britain votes to leave.
The report also raise concerns that the UK will become more “detached” from Europe even if voters say Yes to the EU in the June 23 referendum.
MSPs said Scotland should actively strengthen its place in EU policy-making to ensure the country does not get pushed to the sidelines.
Committee convener Christina McKelvie said: “We've had evidence from a wide range of Scots voices on what EU membership means to them.
“There are two sides to every argument and we've considered all the evidence but, as a committee, we are unanimous in our view that there is a positive case to be made in Scotland for EU membership.”
Former Labour MP Tom Harris, who is leading the Vote Leave campaign in Scotland, said: “Very few people are focusing on the EU referendum. But after the Holyrood elections, people will start to engage and we could see a turnaround.”

For one quarter Monday night, Virginia Tech made Ohio State look pedestrian. Those other three quarters were a problem.
This will be the story of Ohio State's season: Teams will have moments of success against the Buckeyes, as did the Hokies during the second quarter in Blacksburg, but superior talent, confidence and execution will demand four quarters of excellence to unseat OSU's charge back toward the College Football Playoff.
Needless to say, Ohio State remains in the top spot of the USA TODAY Sports 1-128 Re-rank. The top four is unchanged, with the Buckeyes again trailed by Baylor, Auburn and Alabama, but TCU moves into fifth after Boise State's 16-13 win against Washington.
The re-rank features strong gains from Texas A&M, which was impressive in a win against Arizona State, and Temple, which snapped a decades-long losing streak to Penn State. On the negative end, Stanford and Texas took steep drops after season-opening defeats.
New to the top 25: Texas A&M, Arkansas, Brigham Young, Tennessee and Minnesota.
Out of the top 25: Stanford, Virginia Tech, Nebraska, Wisconsin and Texas.

1MW: The US media is very critical of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. He's frequently denounced as "anti-American", a "leftist strongman", and a dictator. Can you briefly summarize some of the positive social, economic and judicial changes for which Chavez is mainly responsible?
Eva Golinger----The first and foremost important achievement during the Chávez administration is the 1999 Constitution, which, although not written nor decreed by Chávez himself, was created through his vision of change for Venezuela. The 1999 Constitution was, in fact, drafted - written - by the people of Venezuela in one of the most participatory examples of nation building, and then was ratified through popular national referendum by 75% of Venezuelans. The 1999 Constitution is one of the most advanced in the world in the area of human rights. It guarantees the rights to housing, education, healthcare, food, indigenous lands, languages, women's rights, worker's rights, living wages and a whole host of other rights that few other countries recognize on a national level. My favorite right in the Venezuelan Constitution is the right to a dignified life. That pretty much sums up all the others. Laws to implement these rights began to surface in 2001, with land reform, oil industry redistribution, tax laws and the creation of more than a dozen social programs - called missions - dedicated to addressing the basic needs of Venezuela's poor majority. In 2003, the first missions were directed at education and healthcare. Within two years, illiteracy was eradicated in the country and Venezuela was certified by UNESCO as a nation free of illiteracy. This was done with the help of a successful Cuban literacy program called "Yo si puedo" (Yes I can). Further educational missions were created to provide free universal education from primary to doctoral levels throughout the country. Today, Venezuela's population is much more educated than before, and adults who previously had no high school education now are encouraged to not only go through a secondary school program, but also university and graduate school.
The healthcare program, called "Barrio Adentro", has not only provided preventive healthcare to all Venezuelans - many who never had access to a doctor before - but also has guaranteed universal, free access to medical attention at the most advanced levels. MRIs, heart surgery, lab work, cancer treatments, are all provided free of cost to anyone (including foreigners) in need. Some of the most modern clinics, diagnostic treatment centers and hospitals have been built in the past five years under this program, placing Venezuela at the forefront of medical technology.
Other programs providing subsidized food and consumer products (Mercal, Pdval), job training (Mission Vuelvan Caras), subsidies to poor, single mothers (Madres del Barrio), attention to indigents and drug addicts (Mission Negra Hipolita) have reduced extreme poverty by 50% and raised Venezuelans standard of living and quality of life. While nothing is perfect, these changes are extraordinary and have transformed Venezuela into a nation far different from what it looked like 10 years ago. In fact, the most important achievement that Hugo Chávez himself is directly responsible for is the level of participation in the political process. Today, millions of Venezuelans previously invisible and excluded are visible and included. Those who were always marginalized and ignored in Venezuela by prior governments today have a voice, are seen and heard, and are actively participating in the building of a new economic, political and social model in their country.
2 MW---On Monday, President Chavez threw a Venezuelan judge in jail on charges of abuse of power for freeing a high-profile banker. Do you think he overstepped his authority as executive or violated the principle of separation of powers? What does this say about Chavez's resolve to fight corruption?
Eva Golinger----President Chávez did not put anyone in jail. Venezuela has an Attorney General and an independent branch of government in charge of public prosecutions. Chávez did publicly accuse the judge of corruption and violating the law because that judge overstepped her authority by releasing an individual charged with corruption and other criminal acts from detention, despite the fact that a previous court had not granted conditional freedom or bail to the suspect. And, the judge released the suspect in a very irregular way, without the presence of the prosecutor, and through a back door. The suspect then fled the country.
This is part of Venezuela's fight against corruption. Unfortunately - as in a lot of countries - corruption is deeply rooted in the culture. The struggle to eradicate corruption is probably the most difficult of all and will probably not be achieved until new generations have grown up with different values and education. In the meantime, the Chávez administration is trying hard to ensure that corrupt public officials pay the consequences. That judge, for example, engaged in an act of corruption and abuse of authority by illegally releasing a suspect and therefore was charged by the Public Prosecutor's office and will be tried. It has nothing to do with what Chávez said or didn't say, it has to do with enforcing the law.
3 MW---Why is the United States building military bases in Colombia? Do they pose a threat to Chavez or the Bolivarian Revolution?
Eva Golinger----On October 30th, the US formally entered into an agreement with the Colombian government to allow US access to seven military bases in Colombia and unlimited use of Colombian territory for military operations. The agreement itself is purported to be directed at counter-narcotics operations and counter-terrorism. But a US Air Force document released earlier this year discussing the need for a stronger US military presence in Colombia revealed the true intentions behind the military agreement. The document stated that the US military presence was necessary to combat the "constant threat from anti-US governments in the region". Clearly, that is a reference to Venezuela, and probably Bolivia, maybe Ecuador. It's no secret that Washington considers the Venezuelan government anti-US, though it's not true. Venezuela is anti-imperialist, but not anti-US. The US Air Force document also stated that the Colombian bases would be used to engage in "full spectrum military operations" throughout South America, and even talked about surveillance, intelligence and reconnaisance missions, and improving the capacity of US forces to execute "expeditionary warfare" in Latin America.
Clearly, this is a threat to the peoples of Latin America and particularly those nations targeted, such as Venezuela. Most people in the US don't know about this military agreement, but if they did, they should question why their government, led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Barack Obama, is preparing for war in South America. And, in the midst of an economic crisis with millions of people in the US losing jobs and homes, why are millions of dollars being spent on military bases in Colombia? The US Congress already approved $46 million for one of the bases in Colombia. And surely more funds will be supplied in the future.
4 MW---What is ALBA? Is it a viable alternative to the "free trade" blocs promoted by the US?
Eva Golinger----The Bolivarian Alliance of the Americas - Trade Agreement for the People, is a regional agreement created five years ago between Venezuela and Cuba, and now has 9 members: Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Antigua and Barbuda, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Dominica. ALBA is a trade agreement based on integration, cooperation and solidarity, contrary to US trade agreements which are based on competition and exploitation. It promotes a way of trading between nations that assures mutual benefits. For example, Venezuela sells oil to Cuba and Cuba pays with services - doctors, educators and technological experts that help to improve Venezuela's industries. Venezuela sells oil to Nicaragua and Nicaragua pays with food products, agricultural technology and aide to build Venezuela's own agricultural industry, which long ago was abandoned by prior governments only interested in the rich oil industry. ALBA seeks to not just provide economic benefits to its member nations, but also social and cultural advances. The idea is to find ways to help members develop and progress in all aspects of society. ALBA recently created a new currency, the SUCRE, which will be used as a form of exchange between member nations, eliminating the US dollar as the standard for trade.
5 MW---Are US NGO's and intelligence agents still trying to foment political instability in Venezuela or have those operations ceased since the failed coup?
Eva Golinger----In fact, the funding of political groups in Venezuela, and others throughout Latin America that promote US agenda, has increased since the April 2002 coup against President Chávez. Through two principal Department of State agencies, USAID and the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), the US government has channeled more than $50 million to opposition groups in Venezuela since 2002. The USAID/NED budget to fund groups in Venezuela in 2010 is nearly $15 million, doubled from last year's $7 million. This is a state policy of Washington, which the Obama Administration plans to amp up. They call it "democracy promotion", but it's really democracy subversion and destabilization. Funding political groups favorable to Empire, equipping them with resources, strategizing to help formulate political platforms and campaigns - all geared towards regime change - is a new form of invasion, a silent invasion. Through USAID and NED, and their "partner NGOs" and contractors, such as Freedom House, International Republican Institute, National Democratic Institute, Pan-American Development Foundation and Development Alternatives, Inc., hundreds of political groups, parties and programs are presently being funded in Venezuela to promote regime change against the Chávez government. US taxpayer dollars are being squandered on these efforts to overthrow a democratically elected government that simply isn't convenient for Washington. Remember, Venezuela has 24% of world oil reserves. That's a lot!
6 MW---How hard has Venezuela been hit by the economic crisis? Do the people understand Wall Street's role in the meltdown?
Eva Golinger----Actually, the Chávez government has taken important steps to shelter Venezuela from the financial crisis. People here in Venezuela absolutely understand Wall Street's role in the crisis and know that the US capitalist-consumerist system is principally responsible for causing the financial crisis, but also the climate crisis that the world is facing. The Venezuelan government took preventive steps against the financial crisis, such as withdrawing Venezuela's reserves from US banks two years ago, creating cushion funds to ensure social programs would not be cut and diversifying Venezuela's oil clientele so as not to be dependent solely on US clients. Recently, several banks have been nationalized by the Venezuelan government and others have been liquidated. But this was more due to the mismanagement and internal corruption within those banks. The Venezuelan government reacted quickly to take over the banks and guarantee customers' savings would not be lost. In fact, it's the first time in Venezuela's history that no customers have lost any of their money during a bank liquidation or takeover. This is part of the Chávez Administration's policy of prioritizing social needs over economic gain.
7 MW---Here's an excerpt from a special weekend report by Bloomberg News:
"Americans have grown gloomier about both the economy and the nation's direction over the past three months even as the U.S. shows signs of moving from recession to recovery. Almost half the people now feel less financially secure than when President Barack Obama took office in January...Fewer than 1 in 3 Americans think the economy will improve in the next six months....Only 32 percent of poll respondents believe the country is headed in the right direction, down from 40 percent who said so in September." (Bloomberg)
The frustration and disillusionment with the US political/economic system has never been greater in my lifetime. Do you think people in the United States are ready for their own Bolivarian Revolution and steps towards a more progressive, socialistic model of government?
Eva Golinger----The rise of Barack Obama neutralized a growing sentiment for profound change inside the US. Hopefully, the slowdown in US activism will only be temporary. South of the border, there is tremendous change taking place. New social, political and economic models are being built by popular grassroots movements in Venezuela, Bolivia and other Latin American nations that seek economic and social justice. I believe strongly that models in process, like the Bolivarian Revolution, provide inspiration and hope to those in the US and around the world that alternatives to US capitalism do exist and can be successful.
The US has a rich history of revolution. There are many groups inside the US dedicated to building a better, more humanist system. Unity and a collective vision are essential aspects of building a strong movement capable of moving forward. Every nation has its moment in history. This is the time of Latin America. But there is great hope that the people of the US will soon unite with their brothers and sisters south of the border to bring down Empire and help build a true world community based on social and economic justice for all.
Bio.--- Eva Golinger, winner of the International Award for Journalism in Mexico (2009), named “La Novia de Venezuela” by President Hugo Chávez, is a Venezuelan-American attorney from New York, living in Caracas, Venezuela since 2005 and author of the best-selling book, “The Chávez Code: Cracking US Intervention in Venezuela” (2006 Olive Branch Press).
Who's the real bully, the United States or President Rodrigo Duterte?
This was how Senator Antonio Trillanes IV countered on Thursday Senator Panfilo “Ping” Lacson's statement that the US' reported decision to stop the planned sale of assault rifles to the Philippines was not a scare tactic but a “bully attitude” by the Americans.

“Napakadali nilang ituro sa iba no pero yung nandito sa ating bayan na pinapatay yung kapwa natin, si President Duterte, ni hindi nila masabihan ng kahit na ano (It's easy for them to point to others but they can't accuse President Duterte of anything amid the people who were killed in our country),” Trillanes said during the Kapihan sa Senado.
“Sino ang tunay na bully dito? Hindi nga bully, mamatay tao pa e (Who's the real bully? Not only a bully but a killer),” added the senator, who is accusing Duterte of allegedly behind the extrajudicial killings in the country and the so-called Davao Death Squad.
Trillanes reiterated that the reported scrapping of the arms deal with the Philippines was an indication that the international community was not happy with what is happening in the country, particularly the reported human rights abuses.
He said there was no debate on the government's war on illegal drugs but the issue on how to deal with it.
“Ang pinag uusapan dito, ano yung approach mo? Ni ngayon wala ka pang nakikitang wholistic program e on how to deal with drugs. Ang sinasabi lang patayin, patayin. Sa akin mali yan at bilang halal na opisyal ng gobyerno ay tinitindigan ko yan …” he said.
(We are talking about the approach. We haven't seen a wholistic program on how to deal with drugs. All they say are these drug pushers and users should be killed. For me it's wrong and as an elected official of the government, I would stand up to it.)
Instead of belittling the criticisms of other nations, Trillanes said, Duterte's “apologists” should admit that there was really something wrong with the present leadership. RAM/rga

Journalism has a special, hallowed place for stories of its practitioners' persecution. There is no higher claim to journalistic integrity than going to jail to protect a source. And the Newseum in Washington, D.C., establishes the profession's legitimacy with a memorial to fallen scribes, thus drawing an implicit connection between the murdered abolitionist editors of long ago and the struggling outfit that gave you this morning's page-one story about cute pets in Halloween costumes.
But no journalistic operation is better prepared to sing the tragedy of its own martyrdom than Fox News. To all the usual journalistic instincts it adds its grand narrative of Middle America's disrespectful treatment by the liberal elite. Persecution fantasy is Fox News's lifeblood; give it the faintest whiff of the real thing and look out for a gale-force hissy fit.
As the Obama administration has discovered by now. A few weeks ago, after Fox had scored a number of points against administration figures and policies, administration spokesmen decided it was time to start fighting back. Communications Director Anita Dunn called the network "a wing of the Republican Party," while Obama himself reportedly dismissed it for following "a talk radio format."
The network's moaners swung instantly into self-pitying action, likening the administration's combative attitude to Richard Nixon's famous "enemies list."
They should remember that it wasn't just the keeping of a list that made Nixon's hostility to the media remarkable. Nearly every president--and probably just about every politician--has criticized the press at some point or other. What made the Nixon administration stand out is that it also sued the New York Times to keep that paper from publishing the Pentagon Papers. It schemed to ruin the Washington Post financially by challenging the broadcast licenses for the TV stations it owned. It bugged the office of Joseph Kraft, a prominent newspaper columnist. One of its most notorious henchmen was G. Gordon Liddy, who tells us in his autobiography that under certain conditions he was "willing to obey an order to kill [columnist] Jack Anderson."
It is interesting to note that Mr. Liddy, that friend of the First Amendment, appeared frequently in 2006 on none other than the Fox News network. In fact, the network sometimes seems like a grand electronic homage to the Nixonian spirit: Its constant attacks on the "elite media," for example, might well have been inspired by the famous pronouncements on TV news's liberal bias made by Mr. Nixon's vice president, Spiro Agnew.
And, of course, the network's chairman, Roger Ailes, was an adviser to Mr. Nixon in the 1968 presidential campaign; his signature innovation back then was TV commercials in which Mr. Nixon answered questions from hand-picked citizens in a town-hall style setting.
Although they cry persecution today, the network and its leading lights have not really distinguished themselves on the issues surrounding clashes between the government and the press. When Mr. Ailes was on the other side of the politician/press divide, making ads for the presidential campaign of George H. W. Bush, the Washington Post once found out in advance where one of the commercials was going to be filmed. According to an article that appeared in that paper in 1988, Mr. Ailes was moved to comment thusly on the situation: "'These leakers!' he told an inquiring reporter the night before the planned event. 'I think they should all be executed and tortured.'"
Mr. Ailes was joking on that occasion. But faced with one of the biggest First Amendment cases of our own time--the New York Times's 2005 story on the George W. Bush administration's domestic wiretapping program--how did Fox News react? By impugning the motives of the Times, of course, with different Fox personalities speculating that the Times deliberately published the story when it did in order to dissuade the U. S. Senate from reauthorizing the Patriot Act.
To point out that this network is different, that it is intensely politicized, that it inhabits an alternate reality defined by an imaginary conflict between noble heartland patriots and devious liberals--to be aware of these things is not the act of a scheming dictatorial personality. It is the obvious conclusion drawn by anybody with eyes and ears.
The principal of a Los Angeles high school where a scuffle broke out with adult protesters over a new gender-neutral bathroom praised his students Wednesday as "trailblazers" for campaigning to install the restroom.
In a statement, Principal Martin Gomez said he is proud of students at Santee Education Complex for their efforts to establish the first multi-stall, gender-neutral restroom at the Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation's second-largest.
He dismissed the protesters as a small group trying to "discredit the brave actions of our students."
Students leaving the school Tuesday tussled with protesters dressed in black and yelling from a bullhorn.
A video of the brawl aired on KABC-TV showed one person punching another on the ground while onlookers yelled and other students were held back.
No one was seriously injured or arrested.
Sgt. Edward Bernal with the Los Angeles School Police Department said the protesters were members of the Westboro Baptist Church, an anti-gay group. Police were expecting protesters to appear at the school again Wednesday and placed additional officers at the scene, though no demonstrators showed up. Instead students held a peace rally, waving gay pride rainbow flags and carrying signs, including one that read, "Keep Calm, It's Just a Toilet."
Westboro did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Bathrooms for transgender students have become a focal point in the national debate over anti-discrimination laws. The U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice submitted a friend-of-the-court brief in support of a Virginia teenager last October stating schools can't prevent transgender students from using the restrooms that correspond with their gender identities without violating federal law.
Students at Santee Education Complex collected more than 700 signatures as part of a campaign launched in January called "It's Just a Toilet" in support of a gender-neutral restroom. The school announced the bathroom's official opening last week.
The school's 1,800 students still have access to gender-specific restrooms on campus as well.
Gomez said Wednesday the school was working to avoid any further altercations. In addition to extra police patrols, the school has counselors on hand and asked teachers to review a PowerPoint presentation with students discussing the incident, freedom of speech and school expectations.
Kween Robinson, 17, a junior who worked on the gender neutral-bathroom campaign, said she was saddened when she walked out of school Tuesday and found a group of adults yelling that the students were sinners and "going to hell."
She condemned Tuesday's violence and said student advocates remained undeterred.
"Those bathrooms are going to be there forever," she said.

"My comments defending traditional marriage have led to intimidation tactics that seek to undermine my reputation and somehow silence me and my beliefs, as if opinion is only a one-way street.
"I am a Christian, and I am a model. Models pose for pictures, including lingerie and swimwear photos. Recently, photos taken of me as a teenager have been released surreptitiously to a tabloid website that openly mocks me for my Christian faith.
"I am not perfect, and I will never claim to be. But these attacks on me and others who speak in defense of traditional marriage are intolerant and offensive. While we may not agree on every issue, we should show respect for others' opinions and not try to silence them through vicious and mean-spirited attacks."
CHAMPIONS Dundalk are threatening to leave Oriel Park unless they can gain ownership of the ground to begin some redevelopment.
The Lilywhites board believe that revamping the old Oriel is crucial for the club if they are to build on their recent on-field successes.
They were limited to a capacity of just 3,000 by Uefa for last Wednesday's Champions League qualifier home leg with BATE Borisov.
And Sunday's 2,600 attendance for the top-of-the-table clash with Cork City was their smallest of the season as fans stayed away in the wet weather — just 2,000 seats in Oriel are currently covered.
The club's preference is to remain at Oriel Park, their home since 1936, though the lease is still in the hands of former owner Gerry Matthews. The ground itself is held in trust by the Casey family.
Dundalk cannot apply for Government support to redevelop unless they are the lease-holders, while they are reluctant to take on major work themselves unless they own the ground.
But they have spent close to €150,000 in the last 18 months keeping it up to scratch and have declared enough is enough — either they get the ground or they move out.
If forced to leave Oriel, it is likely they will move to Dundalk Institute of Technology.
Firefly director: 90,000-plus fans possible

A few hours after the dust settled following Firefly Music Festival's long-awaited announcement of Paul McCartney as a headliner, festival director Greg Bostrom gave an interview with The News Journal.
During the talk, he explained the McCartney delay, revealed that Firefly 2015 should draw "at least" 90,000 people -- up from last year's 80,000 -- and reacted to the leaks that undercut the festival's line-up announcement.
Firefly will run from June 18-21 at The Woodlands in Dover this year and general admission passes, $249-$329, will go on sale Monday at noon via www.fireflyfestival.com. VIP passes, $699-$1,999, go on sale Friday at noon.
With Firefly less than four months away, here is the latest information about the fest's fourth edition from the man pulling the strings:
How big of a feather in the cap is McCartney for Firefly?: To say we're excited would be the biggest understatement you an make. In terms of importance in music history, song catalog, quality of performer and everything else -- it's hard to think of somebody bigger. This is a great testament to how much the festival has grown. To be able to book a guy like McCartney, it really means that there's nobody off the table for Firefly.

The impact of teaming up with Coachella founders Goldenvoice: The Goldenvoice partnership has been helpful with [McCartney.] Paul played Coachella a couple of years back and had a great experience. Through that, [Goldenvoice president Paul Tollett] and Paul's team formed a great relationship. They were very helpful in helping push everything through and getting the show approved.
Is McCartney's people aware he has never played Delaware before?: When we were putting together the press release, someone brought up the idea that this might be his first show ever in Delaware. So their whole team combed through The Beatles tours, the Wings tours and McCartney's solo tours and like you indicated, this will be his first time in the state.
What caused the line-up announcement delay this year?: The simple answer is that it's just something that takes a long time. Part of Paul McCartney's success has been that they are keenly aware of what they are doing, when they're doing it and why they're doing it. So we announced his appearance at Firefly just as soon as we could. We didn't have it done until Tuesday night.
Is Paul McCartney's official Facebook page correct in confirming his Firefly performance will be Friday June 19?: Unfortunately, I can't give you anything useful. We'll give our official schedule in the coming months, but until then, we'll have to stay mum on the specific days.

Why The Killers are back as a headliner for the second time in four years: To date, The Killers has been one of the best received headliner performers we've had. Anyone who was there in 2012 will tell you that the showmanship, the catalog, the energy, the live show: I don't think there was a disappointed soul leaving The Woodlands. Every time we ask our fans who they want to see, across the board they're telling us to bring The Killers back. That's been reflective in every survey we've done and every time we've posted on Facebook. They have made it clear: they want The Killers. With the growth of the festival -- the first year we were at 30,000 and this year we should at least triple that -- there's a huge portion of the fans who didn't see them.

Does well-known (and somewhat militant) vegetarian Morrissey know there will be meat served on festival grounds?: Any venue requirements or specific advances from the artists that will be important to their show is discussed during the contract phase. Their camp is aware that Firefly is a festival with a lot of different venues and food options and we've discussed all those considerations. We don't anticipate any problems. There won't be any surprises when he shows up on site.
Reaction to the multiple line-up leaks, which revealed Firefly's line-up more than a month before its release: From one perspective, it's a little humbling that people went to the extent they did to get the information out there sooner than we intended. On the other hand, obviously, we love to announce days as much as everyone else, if not more. We love the excitement and the anticipation. Just like everyone else, it takes a little of the magic away when there's speculation and rumors out before any official confirmation. We commiserate with fans on that.

You may have thought the glory days of the cronut were long gone; you were wrong. The phenomenon lives, and the proof is in the crowds at Bengees Ice Cream Crafters. The tiny shop opened in February just off of South Lake Avenue, and it's already attracting a steady stream of regulars who can't get enough (or take enough Instagram-worthy photos) of their Creamy Buns, a.k.a. cronut ice cream sandwiches.
If the term “Creamy Bun” sounds familiar, you might be mistaking it for the “Milky Bun,” the doughnut ice cream from Afters Ice Cream, which opened a location in Pasadena about six weeks before Bengees. The Milky Bun was dubbed the next cronut by NBC News, and the novelty treat formed the backbone for Afters' seven-location-strong mini empire that also boasts 151,000 Instagram followers.
Still, Bengees owner Foulay Saelor says he'd never even heard of Afters until recently when a customer told him about the chain. He also says—and even dug up some evidence from an early Yelp review—that he originally called the concoction “the Bengee,” but eventually changed the name on the advice of a friend who thought the name and the product could be better correlated.
A post shared by Bengees Ice Cream Crafters (@bengeesicecream) on Mar 4, 2017 at 2:11pm PST
A post shared by Bengees Ice Cream Crafters (@bengeesicecream) on Jan 20, 2017 at 6:11pm PST
And the similarities between Afters and Bengees don't end on the menu boards. Both shops have punchy phrases plastered on the walls that double as Instagrammable backdrops: Afters has Millennial-facing platitudes like “less talk, more ice cream” and “ice cream is cheaper than therapy” whereas Bengees has “and then, ice cream” and, simply, “ice cream therapy.” The slogans are almost identical, even down to the simple, blocky font and black and white typeface.
Co-founder of Afters Ice Cream Andy Nguyen confirmed that his company is in no way affiliated with Bengees. He added that, “The store looks very inspired by us,” and that Afters is “often imitated, but never duplicated.”
Yelpers have noticed the glaring similarities too. “Oddly similar to Afters, the decor, croissant ice cream sandwich, etc.” says Marissa R. “BUT Afters doesn't have delicious vegan options so this is my go-to!” Saelor agrees that his vegan items set his store apart, and the nearby plant-based restaurant Real Food Daily offers plenty of supplemental customers.
Other Pasadenans are grateful for Bengees offering a reprieve from the perennially long lines at Afters. “I love that the location isn't in old town, because it means fewer crowds (cough, Afters, cough) for the same great taste and service,” says Garen A., who definitely doesn't have a cold, before adding that he prefers the cronut version at Bengees' anyways.
Intellectual property is a tough issue to tackle in the restaurant industry. No one can prove that they truly invented a certain dish or cooking method, so most legal protections are limited to nomenclature, hence the Creamy Bun versus Milky Bun distinction.
In any case (at least according to the Yelp mob) it seems that this ice cream doughnut sandwich rivalry is only benefitting the sweet-toothed consumers and raising the city-wide standards for cold ice cream in hot dough. And who could be mad at that?
The White House lists 78 incidents to back up Donald Trump's claim that terrorist attacks are being underreported
Terrorism 'not even being reported': Trump cites Sydney siege in list of attacks
A number of Australian killings, including the 2014 Sydney siege and the murder of Curtis Cheng, are among 78 events worldwide that the White House claims were terrorist attacks underreported by the media.
The list was produced by the White House on Tuesday to back up claims by the president Donald Trump and White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, that the world's media was deliberately covering up or underreporting terrorism.
On Monday Trump accused the media of deliberately covering up terrorist attacks.

“It's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported,” he said. “And in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that.”
Spicer later walked Trump's comments back, suggesting the president meant attacks were underreported, rather than covered up, and said he would release a list of examples.
After the release of that list a White House spokesperson told the Guardian: “The real point here is that these terrorists attacks are so pervasive at this point that they do not spark the wall-to-wall coverage they once did.
“If you look back just a few years ago, any one of these attacks would have been ubiquitous in every news outlet, and now they're happening so often – at a rate of more than once every two weeks, according to the list – that networks are not devoting to each of them the same level of coverage they once did. This cannot be allowed to become the ‘new normal', and the president, for one, is not going to be satisfied until the American people are much safer and more secure.”
The list includes many high profile attacks that received widespread international coverage, including the 178 people killed by gunmen in Paris, the 86 killed in Nice, the 14 killed in San Bernardino in the US, and the massacre of 49 people at an Orlando gay nightclub.
It also includes five Australian incidents that received extensive coverage.
In December 2014 Man Haron Monis took employees and customers of the Sydney city Lindt Cafe hostage. Monis killed one man, Tori Johnson, and another hostage, Katrina Dawson, was killed when police stormed the building in the early hours of the following morning. Monis was also killed. The incident received blanket coverage from Australian media and international news outlets at the time, and appeared on front pages across the globe.
Guardian Australia and many other media outlets produced rolling coverage of the siege itself for 18 hours, as well as exhaustive analysis and coverage of the subsequent inquest.

Trump's list also included the October 2015 Parramatta shooting, when 15-year-old Farhad Jabar killed Curtis Cheng, a 58-year-old accountant for the New South Wales police force. Jabar was shot and killed by police who responded to the attack.
The incident, the subsequent police task force, and charges against four others in relation to the attack were extensively covered. It too received international attention.
In August last year Smail Ayad allegedly stabbed and killed 21-year-old British woman, Mia Ayliffe-Chung, and 30-year-old British man, Thomas Jackson, at a backpacker hostel in north Queensland.
Ayad, a 29-year-old French man, allegedly cried “Allahu Akbar” during the attack, prompting police to investigate terrorism links. They all but ruled out the possibility Ayad was a radicalised extremist within 24 hours. Ayliffe-Chung's mother has dismissed the suggestion.
It too, despite the coverage and lack of established links to terrorism, appeared on the White House list.
The following month a 22-year-old man, Ihsas Khan, was charged with committing a terrorist attack and attempted murder after allegedly stabbing a 59-year-old man multiple times in the Sydney suburb of Minto.
The incident appeared across Australian media, and in international publications including the New York Times, the Times of Israel, CNN, the Daily Mail, and even Breitbart News, the conservative publication co-founded by senior Trump adviser Steve Bannon.
Global media organisations including the BBC, CNN and Fox News, were among those who covered the September 2014 stabbing of two police officers by a young radicalised man, 18-year-old Numan Haider.
Haider had agreed to meet officers at the Endeavour Hills station in Melbourne, to talk, but instead stabbed the pair, one of whom who shot and killed him. An inquiry into the incident was told the police officers had no choice. The violent attack and the speed at which the teenager had been radicalised shocked Australia.
Kellyanne Conway's fictitious 'Bowling Green massacre' not a one-time slip of the tongue Read more
The list of attacks was released by the White House on Tuesday, following disputes between the Trump administration and the media after spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway referred to a non-existent massacre during an interview. Conway claimed she misspoke when she accused media of never reporting the “Bowling Green massacre” – which did not happen – but it was later revealed to be the third time she had said it.
Publicly available archives of front pages, compiled by Washington DC's Newseum, reveal the extent of international front-page coverage devoted to many of the incidents listed.

The British Museum is running a trial of virtual reality technology with a view to offering it as a permanent tool to explore its collection.
Families will be invited to navigate a virtual reality Bronze Age roundhouse and interact with 3D scans of objects.
In June, London's Natural History Museum also started using VR technology.
Both museums are using Samsung Gear VR headsets.
Only visitors aged 13 or over will be allowed to use the headsets in the British Museum. Families with younger children can use a Samsung Galaxy tablet or enter a dome with an interactive screen.

Visitors will be able to explore different interpretations of how the objects might have been used in the past. Among those on display will be two gold bracelets, discovered at a site in Gloucestershire, and treasures that the museum has not yet acquired.
Other objects include a bronze dagger that was not intended for practical use because the blade was never sharpened and a bronze loop - believed to be a bracelet.
Chris Michaels, head of digital and publishing at the British Museum, said: "It gives us the chance to create an amazing new context for objects in our collection, exploring new interpretations for our Bronze Age objects."
The technology will be on show at a virtual reality weekend from 8 to 9 August but in the autumn it will be integrated into the museum's education programme. It will be assessed to see how it is enhancing the way students learn about the Bronze Age.
The First Life exhibit at London's Natural History Museum has been using virtual reality since June to allow visitors to experience an underwater environment at the dawn of life on Earth.
Emily Smith, Head of Audience Development at the Natural History Museum, told the BBC: "The VR experience has been hugely popular with visitors.
"We've increased the number of slots and are now running the experience daily in response to demand. Visitors have even been bursting into spontaneous applause at the end of the showings."
A Toronto teacher has been ordered to work from home after school board officials learned he had posted explicit materials, originally intended for gay bars and bathhouses, in the classrooms of Grade 7 and 8 students since October.
A Toronto District School Board spokesperson confirmed that the posters — part of an awareness campaign by AIDS Committee Toronto — contained the phrase “If you like to f—” in bold letters, followed by tips on how gay and bisexual men can practice safe sex. The materials also detailed steps on how to “Use your head when giving it,” which was coupled with a photo of a man's partially exposed buttocks.
“On Friday May 3rd, I was made aware and the material was taken down immediately,” reads a letter written by Principal Marc Mullan that was sent on Tuesday to parents of children at the Delta Alternative School in Little Italy.
The teacher will remain home from work until the TDSB completes a review of the matter, said spokesman Ryan Bird. The posters were removed on Friday, Mr. Bird said.
“This is clearly inappropriate,” he said on Tuesday. “It crosses a line.”
Eric Mackey saw the poster, pinned to a bulletin board at the back of the classroom, earlier this year during a routine visit to the classroom.
“I stood there and looked at it and thought, ‘This is great,'” said Mr. Mackey who has two children at the school and serves as the co-chair of the school council.
“I personally am very comfortable with this poster on the wall. And my children are comfortable with it,” he said, adding that when the poster was put up in October, it was accompanied with a discussion where children were told that “if anybody has a hard time with this, it will be taken down.”
According to Mr. Mackey, a survey was sent home at the beginning of the school year that asked parents to indicate what hot topics they hoped the teacher would cover.
‘If you want to talk to a 12-year-old, or a 13-year-old, or a 14-year-old, then talk to them about real stuff'
“High-risk” behaviour, like sex and drug-use, was one of the most popular responses.
“As co-chair of the school council, I've never been informed that there was an issue with it. No teacher, no child, no parent has said a word about it. I guess I'm a little surprised that all of a sudden everybody's outraged,” he said.
“We're talking about teenagers that use that sort of language. You could package it nicely, and you could teach it in a way where you're talking about the birds and the bees,
“But if you want to talk to a 12-year-old, or a 13-year-old, or a 14-year-old, then talk to them about real stuff. Use the word F–k. Use the word ‘blowjob.' That's what they're talking about.”
The TDSB would not confirm the teacher's name, but did say the posters had been in the classroom since October 2012. The Delta Alternative School has an enrolment of 63 students in grades seven and eight, split across two classes.
AIDS Committee Toronto confirmed the materials were part of their awareness campaigns, but stressed that they were “not intended for school-age children.”
“The language and imagery is geared towards a specific audience,” said Kyle Greenwood, manager of communications at ACT.
“They're to be distributed in gay bars and bathhouses throughout the city.”
National Post
Robert George, founder of the National Organization for Marriage, has filed an amicus brief that will be entered as part of the Supreme Court's review of DOMA. That hearing is set to begin in late May/early June. The brief, filed by NOM attorney John Mauck, argues that marriage has always been defined as between a man and a woman, displaying an appalling ignorance of sociology and history. Not surprisingly, the summary states that this request for the preservation of marriage per that definition is due to “sincere belief” and “sound public policy” rather than “animus.” Yeah, right.
It goes on to say that same-sex marriage “imperils religious liberty.” If the thinking behind this is that the First Amendment protects them via the government, then they need to step back and re-examine that misconstruction. Their attempts to bring the government in as long as it's on their side would be laughable if there were not so much at stake. The argument that marriage is the foundational unit of society can be made in support of marriage equality as well as in defense of discrimination, so that just doesn't hold water. As far as the law is concerned, “vast human experience” is not an acceptable measure of proof. Especially for something that would discriminate against a large percentage of Americans.
But discrimination is exactly what George and his group are all about. Their Manhattan Declaration is nothing less than a call to followers to violate any laws which they feel conflict with their faith. The gist of the Declaration is that Christians will be “ostracized and themselves targeted for discrimination” if they choose to discriminate against same-sex couples. Basically, they contend, groups like Catholic Charities should be free to single out people they dislike without anyone objecting. Especially anyone like the government. Examples given in the brief include those same Catholic Charities who chose to be bigots regarding benefits and adoption services. Rather than extend those benefits and services to same-sex couples, they chose to shut the programs down. Then, in an act of supreme chutzpah, they whine that they were forced to do so. The brief is full of similar anecdotal “evidence:” prosaic stories highlighting flagrant cases of discrimination against same-sex couples in the name of Jesus.
In NOM's world, religion is more important than human dignity. The ability to victimize those who are different is more important than practicing what their erstwhile founder preached. In NOM-land, the Constitution only applies to those who follow their belief system, profess their faith and live the way they do. Everyone else is just fodder for their self-aggrandizement. I sincerely hope the Supreme Court disregards this amicus brief and remembers that their decisions should be guided by the Constitution, not bullies.

India could play Pakistan in Dubai later this year if the government gives the go-ahead to the Indian cricket board. The BCCI has written to the Home Ministry, seeking permission to play Pakistan to complete their obligations under the Future Tours & Programme (FTP) agreement which was inked in 2014.

Earlier, when it was headed by Shashank Manohar, the BCCI wanted to host Pakistan for a short series in 2016 but did not get government clearance owing to tension between the two countries and the subsequent terror attacks on Indian soil.
The Indian Express has learnt that the BCCI has now approached the Home Ministry, seeking government permission. And this time, the Indian team is willing to play a series in Dubai which is the home venue of the Pakistan team.
The Indian board is looking at a September or November window to play Pakistan. The BCCI had reserved September for the Champions League T20 but the tournament has been discontinued. It is learnt that the BCCI wants a short series in November in Dubai before the Indian tour of South Africa.

“Permission has been sought from Home Ministry, we don't know what is the government stand. Last time, tension between the two countries was at its peak. Also, there is the FTP agreement that needs to be fulfilled and that's why the board is willing to travel to Dubai to play a series against Pakistan. Unless the government gives its nod, the BCCI cannot do anything,” a source said.

The path from losing to winning is never straight.
There are always crossroads.
The Jaguars face a major one on Sunday.
The franchise was an NFL worst 17-63 over the last five years heading into this season.
Two people associated with that struggle are former coach Gus Bradley and Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers.
Bradley coached the team from 2013-16, going 14-48 before being fired.
Rivers handed the Jaguars four of those losses, throwing for 12 touchdowns and no picks combined. His passer ratings for the four games: 138.9 last year, followed by 118.4, 130.0 and 125.2 in 2013.
Rivers and Bradley are now on the same team, as Chargers coach Anthony Lynn hired him to be Los Angeles' defensive coordinator.
Both are coming to EverBank Field on Sunday with the hope of dashing the Jaguars' hot 5-3 start.
Philip and Gus: Seems like the name of a charming kids cartoon about a rambunctious dog and curious cat.
For the Jaguars, it's been nightmarish for different reasons.
Vanquishing them on Sunday would be therapeutic — a double dose of detox.
The Jaguars believe they are among the best teams in the NFL. They believe Bradley was a major reason why the former teams didn't achieve. That's evident by the fact Jaguars owner Shad Khan retained general manager Dave Caldwell, promoted Doug Marrone to head coach and held onto both coordinators in Nathaniel Hackett and Todd Wash.
The message was clear. The Jaguars had a Gus Bradley problem.
So far, Khan looks right. The Jaguars record isn't as impressive as how it has recorded it. The team has won all five games by at least 16 points and has a point differential of plus-89 that is the best in the AFC.
The Jaguars are tied for first in the AFC South and are going for their third consecutive win on Sunday.
If Bradley is a part of derailing the momentum, that will be difficult to stomach.
If Bradley walks out a winner, Rivers will likely be a main reason why.
However, the Jaguars defense is a sleeping giant that has not only awakened since Rivers last saw it in Week 2 last year, but is swinging a big club.
Rivers now must navigate a defense that added end Calais Campbell, cornerback A.J. Bouye and strong safety Barry Church in free agency.
A defense that just acquired tackle Marcell Dareus before the Oct. 31 trade deadline.
A defense that is watching second-year players like cornerback Jalen Ramsey, linebacker Myles Jack and end Yannick Ngakoue blossom.
Linebacker Telvin Smith, free safety Tashaun Gipson, cornerback Aaron Colvin and end Dante Fowler are playing better than last season.
Defensive tackle Malik Jackson remains a constant threat. Linebacker Paul Posluszny and tackle Abry Jones are reliable.
This time should be different.
This time will be different.
The Chargers had a bye to prepare, but Rivers could have a month and it wouldn't matter. He's an elite quarterback – one of the most underrated players of this generation – but it won't matter Sunday.
He's going to get dominated.
Bradley's defense will too.
Jaguars rookie running back Leonard Fournette will see to it. The fourth-overall pick will be motivated for redemption. The rookie was inactive last week in a win over Cincinnati as a disciplinary action by the team.
Fournette hasn't played in four weeks. He missed a game with an ankle injury, the Jaguars had a bye and then he sat against the Bengals.
Bradley's defensive acumen won't matter when his players can't consistently tackle Fournette without giving up yards after contact.
Expect a statement game from Fournette.
Expect another statement from the defense.
Expect two vestiges of Jaguars past failures to fade away by Sunday evening.

Water restrictions have begun in the Dublin area, causing low pressure and loss of supply.
Dublin City Council said the restrictions from 8pm to 7am will remain in place until Monday 4 November.
It said the situation has arisen because of a problem at its biggest water treatment plant.
Production at the Ballymore Eustace plant has dropped by up to 25%.
Council engineers are still investigating the cause, but believe the recent heavy rain has made the reservoir water more difficult to treat at the plant.
A council spokesperson said that although the incoming water is still of a satisfactory quality, its constituent characteristics have changed.
The issue is not related to the algae problem at another treatment plant at Roundwood, which caused water rationing last March.
The council said the quality of water being supplied to homes has not been compromised.
Speaking on RTÉ's Morning Ireland, Dublin City Engineer Michael Phillips said: "The characteristics of water change from season to season, they normally operate within a certain band. We haven't experienced this, in this plant, over the past 20 years.
"So whether it's due to the weather or the climate we do not know."
Mr Phillips said people can expect very severe reductions and restrictions to their water supply from 8pm to 7am across the four Dublin local authority areas.
He said people will have no water in the cold tap in the kitchen, but they should have 24-hour storage in their tank.
"It's crucial to conserve that water with the minimum use of washing machines, dishwashers, showers and washing your teeth. Please do not leave the tap run," he said.
Taoiseach Enda Kenny earlier said he hoped the restrictions could be sorted soon.
He said it was the subject of a brief discussion at Cabinet this morning and he has asked the Secretary General to make contact with Dublin City Council.
Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Brendan Howlin said the current water restrictions will have no bearing on water metering.
He said that water metering is part of an overhaul of national water supply.
"We're going to establish the biggest State company since the ESB was established - Irish Water. That will formally come into being on the 1 January, " Mr Howlin said.
"For too long we've had a very disparate water supply system in this country, with every local authority being responsible for their own affairs.
"We'll have one national authority providing what I hope will be a world-class service to everyone in the country. That obviously has to be paid for."
When asked if there would be adequate infrastructure when people began paying, the minister said: "There has to be an understanding, like the ESB or any other service, if you don't get the service you don't pay for it."
Fianna Fáil has said Minister for the Environment Phil Hogan must accept some blame over lingering problems with Dublin's water network.
Restaurant operators call for later restriction time
Reacting to the water restrictions, Restaurants Association of Ireland Chief Executive Adrian Cummins described Ireland as a "third-world country".
Speaking on the same programme, Mr Cummins said if the restrictions began later in the evening it would give his members a chance to make money to pay rates to local authorities.
He said: "Obviously, they are not going to give us any compensation. They never have and they probably won't in the future, but this has to stop.
"It seems to be every six months in this country. We had a water shortage during the summer, we have a water shortage now, and probably if we have snow in the winter time, we will have a water shortage again."
The RAI is calling on the restrictions to be implemented at a later time of 9.30pm/10pm to allow restaurants in the evening trade to have any chance of dealing with the shortages.
Mr Cummins called for tankers of water to be delivered to the business community.
He said a clear strategy should be worked out and there should be more communication from Dublin City Council.
Information on each Dublin local authority is available below.

Friday's milestone episode airs just days after the actress celebrated her 20th anniversary playing Sami Brady; she talks to THR about what's in store for her character and daytime TV's struggles.
Alison Sweeney has spent more than half her life playing Sami Brady on Days of Our Lives.
The 36-year-old actress, who began acting at age 4, is marking her 20th year on NBC's daytime drama, which airs its 12,000th episode Friday. During that time, Sami has walked down the aisle 14 times -- resulting in five actual marriages -- had four kids and is about to become a grandmother. She also has tackled such story lines as bulimia, date rape, teen pregnancy, capital punishment and her son's coming out.
STORY: NBC's 'Days of Our Lives' Renewed Through 2014
Sweeney, who has won multiple Soap Opera Digest and Daytime Emmy Awards for her role, also has begun directing episodes of the daytime series, which was just renewed through September 2014.
Sweeney -- who lives in L.A. with her husband, Dave, a California Highway Patrol officer, and son Ben, 7, and daughter Megan, 3 -- also juggles Days with her duties as host of The Biggest Loser, which had its 14th season premiere Sunday. She recently talked to The Hollywood Reporter about her long run on the soap, the state of daytime TV, what's ahead for her character and her most memorable fan encounter.
THR: Congratulations on your 20th year on the show -- and series' 12,000th episode.
Sweeney: It's so exciting, isn't it? [Jan. 5 was] my 20th anniversary on Days of Our Lives. That's incredible and so special for me, and I totally remember my screen test. I was 16 years old and I've been very lucky. I remember celebrating the 7,000th episode, and to be here now at 12,000 is just such an honor. Day has always been strong as an icon in TV history, and it's still going on strong and represents the genre of daytime drama so well. I'm proud to be a part of it. I'm a fan of daytime drama; I totally get it. When we are doing scenes that are romantic or will get the audience riled up, I feel like I'm a fan in the room going, "People are going to be so mad right now!" I love it. It fuels my fire. I still feel excited to go to work every day.
THR: What can you tell us about the 12,000th episode?
Sweeney: We shot it four months ago, so it's hard to remember everybody's story. But I know that Sami right now is in a very delicate situation -- these two gorgeous men are definitely both speaking up that they'd like to have her affection. She feels very torn between them for such different reasons, and there's a major revelation coming down the line for her. The audience already knows there is a girl pregnant with -- I can't believe I'm saying this -- her grandchild, but Sami doesn't know. It's such a great twist, and people are waiting for that to come out and see what her reaction is going to be. Anybody who is a fan knows that she is not going to take that lying down.
THR: What has it been like having Eileen Davidson back?
Sweeney: She was on the show when I first started, so it's awesome to have her back. She's an amazing actress, and it's a lot of fun to have her included in the mix again.
STORY: 'Days of Our Lives' Favorite Eileen Davidson Returning
THR: What's been your favorite story line for Sami?
Sweeney: There was one that was affectionately called "Sydnapping" by the fans. Basically it was a two-year run of a story line where Sami found out she was pregnant, and [another character] Nicole swapped babies. The baby Sami thought was her child died of meningitis, but it turned out it wasn't really her child, and it was a two-year battle to get her child back. In the process, she fell in and out of love and had a major transformation as a human being. Sometimes characters can feel repetitive, but going through something like that has to change you and it certainly changed Sami. She found her spunk again, but it took years. But the maturity wasn't there before; it was a major turning point for me as an actress.
THR: How do you juggle duties for both Biggest Loser and Days of Our Lives?
Sweeney: It's crazy, and it's tough because there is a lot going on and a lot to manage and they are very different jobs. Luckily, the producers on both ends are fantastic and work together really well. I love both jobs so much.
THR: How long do you think you could continue to play Sami?
Sweeney: As long as they will let me. Obviously, daytime is a tough place to be right now. That's true of TV and every industry; I don't know anyone avoids the tough times. But we are fighting the fight and trying to stay current. For me, Sami is always interesting and fun and exciting, and I love that she wears her heart on her sleeve and is so dramatic and unpredictable. It's fun to go to work every day and work with talented actors and gorgeous guys and play out these outrageous fight sequences and do crazy things I'd never do in real life.
THR: How much input do you have in your story lines?
Sweeney: That's sort of a separation of church and state there. To a certain extent, we get to have conversations about certain dialogue that maybe isn't in keeping with how we feel the character has been over the years. But in terms of major story lines, it's absolutely the writers' purview, and we are the keepers of the gate for our characters. We do the best we can to create a through line. One thing they will concede is that I'm the only one there who has been there for every single scene of the same character for over 20 years, so I do have a certain place to stand on to have that conversation.
THR: Will you be directing more episodes of the show?
Sweeney: I'm going to be directing again in 2013. I've always dreamed of being a director ... and I decided to stay with the show instead of going off to college. And I started following the directors at work and learning everything I could. It paid off. I feel like I'm good at it, and I feel like I'm learning something new every day when I'm directed by them and continue to learn when I'm directing.
Q&A: 'Biggest Loser' Host Alison Sweeney Spills Secrets on Season 14
THR: Has it been hard seeing other daytime dramas canceled?
Sweeney: It's really tough because like I said, I am a fan, and we know how how loyal and passionate our fans are. So I can only imagine how heartbreaking it is for other shows people have grown up watching with their mom and grandma in the living room every day for 40-plus years. We want to make sure that doesn't happen for Days fans. It's sad, and we are friends with actors on other soaps that were struggling, and now there isn't a show to go to. We fight hard to keep Days strong and on the air. I'm happy to read that some might find a home online; I know the audience is there, and everyone has to find a way to make it work in today's economy and on a budget.
THR: Has your show been affected by budget cuts?
Sweeney: Yeah of course, it's affected every show. We're just feeling our way out and trying new things out, and we work fast and hard. The amazing thing is to see the energy level of the cast and crew who go the extra mile and push that much harder, and we don't miss a beat. We fight hard to do what we can above and beyond what is expected to put out our best product.
THR: You've written two nonfiction books: the memoir All The Days Of My Life (So Far) and a guide for women about nutrition and fitness dubbed The Mommy Diet. Now Hyperion is set to release your first fiction book, The Star Attraction, on May 14. What can you tell us about it?
Sweeney: When I started writing it, I was writing just for me actually because just as a creative person, I was feeling at that time frustrated, dare I say, about the story lines in Days of Our Lives. I was feeling like I wanted to stretch my creative wings and tell the story I wanted to tell. I'm notoriously a company girl and keep my opinions to myself about the story lines that aren't my favorite, but I felt like I had a creative outlet -- I had my laptop and started writing my way and how I wanted the story told. I embodied the main character and wrote about what I know. It's a story set in Hollywood about a publicist and her career, so there's a little gentle teasing about actors from a publicist's perspective and an inside look at how red carpets and Hollywood work. I had a great time telling this love story that I wanted to tell. I hope the fans love it; it's a good summer beach read that gives a hint into Hollywood.
THR: What's been your most memorable fan experience?
Sweeney: I could tell you about the crazy ones, but I met Shaq one time at The Tonight Show, and then he came over to the set of Days because he said he watched the show. It was pretty amazing. I'm a huge basketball fan, and it was pretty cool to meet him.
The company has a good track record for success, too. Two of its other forced obsolescences have largely been forgotten by today's users. The removal of floppy drives upon the launch of the iMac in 1998 felt similarly aggressive at the time. Most computer users had dozens of disks loaded with software and files, all rendered useless. And the MacBook Air, first introduced in 2008, removed the optical drive to allow for a thinner, lighter laptop body. Today, none of Apple's computers feature built-in CD/DVD drives, and nobody seems terribly bothered. Thinner computers are far more important.
But Nicer's parody underscores an unseen motivation: Apple's aggressive battle against the retrograde pull of hardware standards also exerts an implicit control on its users. Buying an Apple product becomes an exercise in trust for the future it will bring about. And the problem with the future is that it's very hard to think about how it might have been different once it arrives.
* * *
When the iMac came on the scene, floppy disks were already insufficient to carry the increasingly bloated files produced by computer use. The CD-ROM drive had been delivering multimedia content for half a decade already, and big graphics files were commonplace well beyond the domain of graphic design and publishing that had been Mac mainstays since the 1980s. External, high-capacity floppy disk storage had been around for some time, but Iomega's 1994 Zip drive, with its 100 MB disks, had become the standard for those who needed to move more than a high-density floppy's 1.44 MB of data around. In 1996, the Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection standard had also emerged, allowing easier, cheaper attachment of peripherals, among them external disks and, later, flash drives. And of course, the internet was becoming popular beyond universities and research labs, offering access to network storage and transfer of files large and small.
But the ordinary home computer user—the target of Steve Jobs's bold new entry-level iMac—was less likely to see external drives, FTP, and even email attachments as obvious solutions to the problem of file creation and management.
If anything, the iMac suggested that computers weren't tools with which to generate things that left those computers. The first models came with a CD-ROM drive, but writeable optical drives didn't appear until 2001. The iMac was a fun, colorful, and self-contained unit of computer experience. It purposely eschewed disturbance from without. A 1998 television spot for the machine overlaid the sound of traffic as it panned over a boring, complex PC before giving way to the calming chirp of birds as the iMac came into view.
With iMac, Apple began to shift computers from their role as tools with which to make materials for work and play, to a device with which to view previously-created media. In 1977, Apple had touted the fact that its first computer would let users “start writing your own programs the first evening.” By 1999, iMac print ads boasted, “The thrill of surfing. The agony of choosing a color.” The computer was already becoming the device that the iPhone and iPad would later realize: fashion-forward digital media distribution endpoints, rather than utilitarian machines for creating materials for use or output in other contexts.
Release that Oxytocin
The Hidden Aspects
You're an amazingly resourceful and self-driven being who has chosen the life of the private companion for the freedoms it allows you. Answering your own phones, scheduling appointments, juggling your accounts and being an all-around sole trading ninja! But there are days when you crave human interaction; ironic for someone who's vocation involves the most intimate of human interactions, however, this connection can't be filled by a client. Sometimes you just want to be around someone who understands you, however, it often isn't even those closest to you. Friends and family, as supportive as they may be, don't have the insight into your world that you need at that moment, they can't relate as easily, and it may feel impossible to have a blunt conversation or whine about certain aspects of the job.
The Loss of Oxytocin
“You're going to get lonely” – never was there a truer piece of advice for an independent escort, although at the time this statement was said to me, I'm sure I just brushed over it.
Until one day it hit me; well maybe that's a bit of a lie. As it was more like it crept up on me. I had had many a day when I was alone and felt like no one would want to talk to me, they'd heard my stories before or had their own issues to worry about, but I was able to keep busy and forget about it. I was in a bustling city, surrounded by people, my social media notifications never ceased with new conversations or the latest news, and I was but a phone call away from multiple friends, and yet I felt – isolated.
You're going to get lonely
That's when I came across the following; Loneliness, Isolation and Boredom are Choices by Lola Davina, almost as though the universe had enlightened me the moment I needed it. While I didn't read the blog attached to Lola's profound statement, this image was all I needed that day.
Lola Davina – Blog Post: 23 Things I Wish I Knew – #18 https://twitter.com/Lola_Davina/status/859589608471920642
Being alone was a choice. Telling myself “Oh I won't contact my friends as they're probably busy” is the exact opposite of what I needed. Being in a different city without any friends near is just another excuse! Why not contact someone new? Another working lady, who really, is probably in the same boat as you, or has been there themselves.
It is amazing what a simple cup of coffee with a complete stranger can achieve. One minute you are in your pyjamas telling yourself It's okay to stay in your warm, cosy bed and continue to watch Netflix. The world will go on without you. Why bother getting up? A few hours later, you're refreshed and wondering why you didn't get up sooner! Feel that Oxytocin!
What's the worst that could happen?
Why not book a coffee date with a fellow Sex Worker? Who understands your mindset better than a person who's experiencing it for themselves? It's like catching up with an old friend, yet there's that rush of meeting someone for the first time, the new and the familiar wound up in one package. It's often easier to talk with someone you don't know, they don't know your past and therefore are less likely to pass judgement, they offer new perspectives, a different mix of conversation, boost confidence and quite possibly may be better listeners. Mix this with the fact they also understand the stigma and alienation associated with being a prostitute/escort/hooker/whore or however you identify, and you have the perfect coffee buddy. Unless of course, they don't like coffee?
So reach out to your fellow sex worker, don't get hung up on the what ifs – “what if they don't want to”, “what if I am taking time away from their work”. The worse that's going to happen is a “no”, so take a chance. Contact that escort in your town, or the one travelling through, or arrange a date for when you're somewhere new! Organise a gathering through social media, or private channels. There's a high possibility that others are seeking new connections as well.
The best part of all, is that release of Oxytocin, during that shared hug between two strangers, perhaps even new found friends, who understand each other.
Ezekiel Elliott did not wait for the ruling to come down from Harold Henderson on his appeal of a six-game suspension for violation of the domestic violence policy. The Cowboys running back has already sued the NFL, according to documents obtained by CBS Sports.
The NFLPA, with lawyer Jeffrey Kessler leading the way, filed a petition on behalf of Elliott asking the Eastern District Court of Texas to overturn any forthcoming suspension ruling from Henderson. Elliott was initially suspended six games on Aug. 11; his appeal hearing began this week and ran for three days. A ruling is expected either Friday or Monday at the latest and there was believed to be a "real chance" that the suspension was reduced multiple games.
The petition claims that Elliott's suspension, even after appeal, was a "product of a process that has already deprived the Union and Elliott of fundamental fairness," "one of the most fundamentally unfair arbitral processes conceivable" and part of a "League-orchestrated conspiracy by senior NFL executives ... to hide critical information."
Furthermore, the petition states that the "conspiracy" to "hide critical information" was designed to hide said information from Roger Goodell, his outside advisors on the Elliott discipline, the NFLPA and Elliott, the Dallas Cowboys and NFL fans.
The petition claims Elliott was not given a fair process when he was denied an opportunity to confront his accuser and additionally when the testimony of Roger Goodell was not compelled during the appeal hearing.
Elliott's lawsuit claims he was not allowed to look at the investigative notes from the NFL's interviews with the accuser.
Of particular note in the Elliott petition: Kessler and the attorneys claim that the "Elliott Report" (the document produced after almost a year of investigatory work) "deliberately omitted a conclusion" as to what sort of punishment the league should hand down for Elliott.
The petition claims that Kia Roberts, one of the lead investigators for the case, "would have had to reveal her conclusion, as an experienced lawyer and prosecutor, that there was not sufficient evidence to proceed with any discipline," had there been a conclusion included.
Put another way: the NFLPA believes that because Robert co-authored the report, her professional opinion that no punishment should be given to Elliott should have been included in the report. The union claims it was not.
The NFLPA also claims there was a document called the "Inconsistency Transcript" written by Roberts about the claims by Elliott's accuser, Tiffany Thompson, and that "someone at the NFL tried to cross out" that name for the document.
The ultimate goal of the lawsuit in the long term is to have the ruling and suspension vacated, but the short term effect here could be, as was the case for Tom Brady prior to the 2015 NFL season, the court granting Elliott an injunction to play football in Week 1.
If the court did that, Elliott would be immediately eligible to play and the six-game suspension -- or whatever new suspension Henderson hands down -- would be put on hold and go into effect if and when the court declined to vacate the award. It is possible, like with Brady, that the court waits until next offseason to hear the case. It is also possible that the court declines to even issue the injunction, pointing to the Brady case as an instance where the NFL's power to impose discipline was upheld.
And sometimes, you just have to take a stand.
With all the controversy surrounding the upcoming Disney production, “Beauty and the Beast” – specifically speaking – the controversy over the “exclusively gay moment”, it could probably do quite well at the box office.
Or it could be a complete bust.
If you're a parent who would rather your children not be exposed to the subtle workings of the left, you may want to make that stand by not giving your hard earned dollars into the pockets of Disney.
An Alabama drive-in is taking just that stand.
“It is with great sorrow that I have to tell our customers that we will not be showing ‘Beauty and the Beast,'” read a message on the Facebook page of the Henagar Drive-In Theatre in the northeast portion of the state. The message was removed Friday evening, but CNN affiliate WHNT in Huntsville, Alabama, has it here
The message was in response to a comment made by director Bill Condon, who proudly championed the character LeFou's affections for Gaston, the arrogant would-be suitor of Belle, heroine of the movie.
Condon told the British gay magazine Attitude, “LeFou is somebody who on one day wants to be Gaston and on another day wants to kiss Gaston. He's confused about what he wants. It's somebody who's just realizing that he has these feelings.”
I seriously never got that from the cartoon version.
Hollywood wants to lecture us. They need us to know that if we don't fall in line with their agenda, we're just intolerant, petty, and everything wrong in the world.
And as such, they will target our children, and bit by bit, they will weed out all those destructive morals and values that threaten the world's far left, Utopian vision for the future.
The owners of the drive-in further stated:
“If we can not take our 11-year-old granddaughter and 8-year-old grandson to see a movie we have no business watching it,” the message said. “If I can't sit through a movie with God or Jesus sitting by me then we have no business showing it. We are first and foremost Christians. “We will not compromise on what the Bible teaches. We will continue to show family-oriented films so you can feel free to come watch wholesome movies without worrying about sex, nudity, homosexuality and foul language.”
And that is fair. It's their right, as business owners.
Of course, that doesn't mean there aren't those who would reject that explanation (not that they needed one).
Some who commented were supportive, but we know how social media works, don't we?
Another wrote, “It's sad that someone uses Jesus to defend his own sins of discrimination against other people.” Theater patron Jeremy Reed told CNN affiliate WAAY about the fairy tale, “When I grew up it was just a regular story of a regular romance between a man and a woman.” Clete Wetli, a gay rights advocate, called the theater's decision “absolutely absurd,” adding, “I commend Disney for being inclusive and showing the real diversity of love in our world.”
Well, then you spend your money on it. That doesn't mean everybody has to.
Carol Laney, the owner, offered:
“My salvation isn't about money. It's not about men. It's what God wants me to do,” she said. “We will not be playing movies that have sex. We will not be playing movies that have nudity. It's my choice.”
Ms. Laney sounds like my kinda people.
In the end (at least in this world), it will come down to a free market solution, for both the movie and the theater.
If the movie offers something people want, it will do well. If not, it will bomb.
If the theater is offering agreeable product to its customers, it will do well. If not, their bottom line will show it.
For me, I appreciate the stand on principle. If I lived anywhere near, I'd show that support by taking in a movie there, every week.
Prayers for their continued success.
The frightening saga of Amanda Knox, an American student who was convicted of murdering her roommate Meredith Kercher in Italy in 2007, has finally drawn to a close.
An Italian court has thrown out Knox's 2009 conviction. After four years in an Italian prison cell, Amanda Knox will finally go free.
Knox was not guilty of the charges against her. She was tried largely in the tabloids and the court of public opinion. Her case was badly mangled by Italy's postal police, and the trial was more of a show trial than anything, with headlines declaring her a sex-crazed monster and impugning her reputation with no facts to suppor them.
Knox faced 26 years in prison. She would have been middle aged before she was released, having spent more than half her life in a foreign prison. She will spend the rest of her life facing down rumors of her guilt and a tarnished reputation.
Her former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, has also been acquitted.
This is a good day for justice, and for Knox and Sollecito and their families. The brutal murder of a young woman is no longer made all the more tragic by the conviction of innocents.
For more on this case, read this excellent piece in Rolling Stone.

Bitcoin may be the reigning prima donna of the crypto market, but at least one big Wall Street bank is not impressed.
A team of Morgan Stanley analysts led by James Faucette on Wednesday held up bitcoin BTCUSD, +0.28% as a poster child for speculation while downplaying its potential as a legitimate currency.
In a scathing report, the analysts noted that the number of online merchants accepting bitcoin has dropped to just three, from five a year earlier. During the same period, the value of the cryptocurrency has soared more than 250%.
“The disparity between virtually no merchant acceptance and bitcoin's rapid appreciation is striking,” Faucette wrote.
He blamed the lack of bitcoin's appeal for retailers on hoarding by investors given its rapid appreciation, as well as higher costs and slow transaction times.
But ironically, the main culprit may be its own skyrocketing worth.
“The ecosystem has focused more on value speculation rather than the foot-leather-eating work of increasing acceptance — way easier to trade speculatively than convince new merchants to accept the cryptocurrency,” said Faucette.
Read: How big is bitcoin, really? This chart puts it all in perspective
In June, Morgan Stanley had warned that for digital currencies to join the ranks of other traditional investment tools, they must accept government oversight, although it did not articulate what that would entail.
Meanwhile, until those regulations are introduced, the debate over whether bitcoin is just another form of Monopoly money or a bona fide currency is likely to continue without a definitive conclusion.

In recent days, I've heard various people calling for punishing the maker of Innocence of Muslims, and more broadly for suppressing such speech. During the Terry Jones planned Koran-burning controversy, I heard similar calls. Such expression leads to the deaths of people, including Americans. It worsens our relations with important foreign countries. It's intended to stir up trouble. And it's hardly high art, or thoughtful political arguments. It's not like it's Satanic Verses, or even South Park or Life of Brian. Why not shut it down, and punish those who engage in it (of course, while keeping Satanic Verses and the like protected)?
I think there are many reasons to resist such calls, but in this post I want to focus on one: I think such suppression would likely lead to more riots and more deaths, not less. Here's why.
Behavior that gets rewarded, gets repeated. (Relatedly, “once you have paid him the Dane-geld, you never get rid of the Dane.”) Say that the murders in Libya lead us to pass a law banning some kinds of speech that Muslims find offensive or blasphemous, or reinterpreting our First Amendment rules to make it possible to punish such speech under some existing law.
What then will extremist Muslims see? They killed several Americans (maybe itself a plus from their view). In exchange, they've gotten America to submit to their will. And on top of that, they've gotten back at blasphemers, and deter future blasphemy. A triple victory.
Would this (a) satisfy them that now America is trying to prevent blasphemy, so there's no reason to kill over the next offensive incident, or (b) make them want more such victories? My money would be on (b).
And this is especially so since there'll be plenty of other excuses for such killings in the future. It's not like Muslim extremists have a clearly defined, unvarying, and limited range of speech they are willing to kill over (e.g., desecrating Korans and nothing but). Past history has already proved that; consider the bombings and murders triggered by the publication of the Satanic Verses.
What's more, there are lots of people in the Muslim world who are happy to stoke hostility. (Neither the recent riots nor the Mohammed cartoon riots were simply spontaneous reactions to what was done in America or Europe; they came about after people in the Middle East took steps to encourage anger on the part of their fellow Middle Easterners.) Even if something doesn't outrage lots of people at first, some will be happy to try to explain to them why they should indeed be outraged.
So imagine what would likely happen the next time someone writes a book like the Satanic Verses, or makes a movie — even a serious movie — depicting Mohammed, or perhaps reproduces the Mohammed cartoons in the course of making a movie about the cartoon controversy. Or imagine perhaps what might happen if extremist Muslims in the Middle East start trying to generate outrage over American Christians trying to convert some Muslims to Christianity, whether in America or using American Web sites to try to reach Middle Eastern countries.
I don't have statistics on how many people would be willing to riot over such conversions, but 84% of Egyptian Muslims support enacting a law providing “the death penalty for those who leave the Muslim religion.” If even a tiny fraction of this 84% can be persuaded to riot over Americans' trying to persuade Muslims to leave the Muslim religion, that could be plenty of people willing to murder. (See also this example of mob attacks on churches in Egypt “stoked in part by hard-line Islamic clerics warning that Christians were trying to convert Muslim women.”)
“Last time this happened, and our men killed four Americans, the Americans saw the light and decided to punish the blasphemers. They agreed that blasphemy must be suppressed — and yet they now shamelessly refuse to act on their promises!” (I doubt that the mob will have much of a sense of the nuances of American legal doctrine, so it's a safe bet that they won't know that the hypothetical new law doesn't extend to “serious literature” or “genuine debate” or religious proselytizing; plus they might not view the Satanic Verses and the like as “serious literature” or “genuine debate.”) “Maybe the Americans forgotten what happened last time — but we haven't. Let's give them a taste of the same medicine that worked so well back then.”
Now the people I'm describing of course won't include all Muslims, or most Muslims. But events over the past decades have shown that there are enough extremist Muslims (whatever their fraction of the Muslim population might be) who are willing to riot and murder in reaction to what they see as blasphemy. Obviously this is a large enough and dangerous enough subset of Muslims that some people are willing to try to forcibly suppress American speech in order to appease them. Will our accommodating these Muslim extremists diminish that impulse, or fuel it?
(I suppose some people might think that America's good-faith efforts to try to suppress blasphemy would change some of the would-be rioters' attitudes, as a gesture of goodwill towards their sensibilities. But the four murders were in Libya, a country that we had just helped save from a brutal tyrant, and were committed by Muslim extremists who were freer and more powerful as a result of our military help to the Libyan revolutionaries — if that didn't build enough goodwill to save our people's lives, then I don't see how enacting a new speech restriction would.)
So what will we do after that next round of killings? Broaden the speech restriction, so that the Satanic Verses and proselytizing of Muslims and anything else that might provoke extremist Muslim murderers would be banned, too? Or hold the line, risking infuriating the extremists even more? People tend to be more angered by what they see is a broken promise of appeasement (even if they view the promise as much broader than its actual terms) than by a stubborn refusal to deal in the first place. And of course once the American government proves willing and able to suppress some blasphemy, it will be even easier to view the American government as responsible for refusing to suppress other blasphemy.
Moreover, this lesson — if you want to shut up the blasphemers, just kill enough Americans in response — will likely be learned not just by extremist Muslims but by others. Extremists of other religions might do the same with regard to American speech (or American behavior) that angers them. (Hindu religious riots and threats of violence seem to be limited right now to what the rioters and threateners see as provocations in India, but all it takes is for a few extremists to take the next step.) So would be extremist nationalists of various nations who are angered by what American individuals or the American government is doing, or extremists of various transnational ideologies who are likewise anti-American.
To be sure, there is already some incentive for people in these groups to riot and kill to try to get their way (as well as some disincentive). But, again, will the example of our suppressing American speech to appease extremist Muslims be ignored by those other extremists? Or will it increase their incentives to adopt the tactics that worked so well for extremist Muslims? Remember the trifecta: kill Americans, visibly force America to change its ways, and on top of that suppress the blasphemy or other behavior that you dislike, win win win. That's a hard temptation to resist.
That's why it seems to me to actually be safer — not just better for First Amendment principles, but actually safer for Americans — to hold the line now, and make clear that American speech is protected even if foreigners choose to respond to it with murder. That would send the message, “murder won't get you what you want.” Not a perfectly effective message to be sure, but a better one than “murder will get you what you want.”
Reuters Wealthy Chinese diners eat at a table suspended more than 160 feet above the ground on a hazy day in the Shanghai financial district.
HONG KONG (MarketWatch) — How do the ultra rich live in China? Sometimes, they spend thousands of dollars to eat a fancy dinner suspended in the sky from a crane.
This past Friday, a dining table seating 22 was lifted about 165 feet off the ground by a crane in the Lujiazui financial hub of Shanghai, with diners fastened to chairs (for safety reasons, of course) and enjoying a meal with a pretty unusual view of the city's dense banking towers.
This so-called “dinner in the sky” event, first created by Belgian entrepreneur David Ghysels as a dinner concept in 2004, was organized by the local Four Seasons hotel.
In fact, dinner by crane isn't completely new — you can enjoy a similar experience in Las Vegas, for instance — but because this is China, the gustatory adventure carried a world-beating price tag.
Each guest needed to shell out a cool 8888 yuan ($1430) per person, and that's not including the 15% service fee. Too pricey? Then maybe try lunch at a bargain 3888 yuan ($622). In fact, even a simple afternoon tea costs 1888 yuan ($303), according to a report by the Shanghai Morning Post.
And because this is China, there were more than enough people willing to pay the sky-high price: All available seats were booked by the time the restaurant opened, the report quoted the hotel as saying.
“At the top [of the crane's ascent], the dining table would spin to give diners a 360-degree view of Shanghai from the sky, seeing the landmark Oriental Pearl Tower and the Shanghai Tower” still under construction, the hotel was quoted as saying.
Some options on the dinner menu (translated from Chinese):
Caviar with shrimp and broccoli
French black truffles with mixed vegetables
Foie gras in black vinegar with rhubarb and strawberry jam
Pan-fried Iceland sablefish and seasonal vegetables with vanilla and watermelon
While Shanghai routinely suffers choking air pollution, this turned out to be not too much of a problem, since it was raining when the crane went up.
But of course, the rain created problems of its own, with the weather heavy enough that the organizers had to cancel Thursday's seatings. This left just two days of uber-expensive extreme dining, for 11 out of the scheduled 14 table rounds available to a total of 242 guests, amid a more manageable drizzle.

CLOSE Authorities said the 2 year old's mother had just stepped away to go to the restroom, when the pitbull attacked. Neighbors said the family pet had no history of aggression. VPC
After finding out Wednesday that a 2-year-old had been killed by his family's pit bull, a relative grieves and a family friend makes a call. (Photo: Ben Gray, AP) Story Highlights Dog that attacked is a pit bull
2-year-old was left in room with it for a moment
But it was enough time to be fatal to the child
UNION CITY, Ga. — A family dog who had never shown aggression before attacked and killed a 2-year-old boy Wednesday in a subdivision near here about 15 miles southwest of Atlanta, police said.
STORY: Mom studying while Ga. toddler mauled
STORY: Some cities tighten vicious dog laws
The mother, Angela Rutledge, and her son, Beau, were at home with their pit bull at about 1:30 p.m., investigators said. She told investigators that she left the room for a moment to go to the bathroom, but when she returned it was clear that the dog had attacked her son, killing him before she could call 911 for aid.
First responders were able to corral the dog in the bathroom until Animal Control officers arrived. The boy was pronounced dead at the scene.
"Clearly, they were rattled when they came out from what they saw," said Detective Melissa Parker of the Fulton County Police Department. "Some were in tears."
The grief-stricken Rutledge was taken to the hospital; her husband, Jermiah Rutledge, was subdued with a Taser after he came home and also became hysterical, police said.
&amp;lt;!--iframe--&amp;gt;
The dog was taken to the Fulton County Animal Shelter, where it is being evaluated in isolation. Officers were not certain if the dog would be killed.
Police said Wednesday that no crime had been committed, and no charges had been filed as of Thursday.

Fans are speculating that the theme song to Suicide Squad may have been revealed during a live show at the Wav Nightclub in Atlantic City on April 2.
Dubstep artist Skrillex debuted a new collaboration with rapper Rick Ross during his show. The song includes lyrics that would seem to link it to Suicide Squad, including mentions of “Suicide Squad,” and possibly “Gotham City” and “Killer Croc.” There's also a line about a “purple Lambo,” which describes the car the Joker drives in the film.
There's been no official announcement concerning the track, so we'll have to wait to see if this is an official collaboration with Warner Bros.
It feels good to be bad…Assemble a team of the world's most dangerous, incarcerated Super Villains, provide them with the most powerful arsenal at the government's disposal, and send them off on a mission to defeat an enigmatic, insuperable entity. U.S. intelligence officer Amanda Waller has determined only a secretly convened group of disparate, despicable individuals with next to nothing to lose will do. However, once they realize they weren't picked to succeed but chosen for their patent culpability when they inevitably fail, will the Suicide Squad resolve to die trying, or decide it's every man for himself?
Comodo has confirmed that two other resellers have been compromised since the "Comodogate" attacks which saw an attacker generate forged certificates for login.live.com, mail.google.com, www.google.com, login.yahoo.com, login.skype.com and addons.mozilla.org. According to Comodo's CTO, Robin Alden, no further certificates were issued as a result of these compromises at the two RAs (Registration Authorities). The disclosure will do little to reduce the worry that other forged certificates could be in circulation.
Alden was responding to queries in the mozilla.dev.security.policy Usenet group. He also confirmed that Comodo was reinstating a "high value target check" on all certificate orders noting that "regrettably it had been disabled for a small number of RA accounts" and that the company was "removing the aspects of our back-end system that allow this check to be optional".
The company had assumed that the threat would come from an RA which was not performing validation properly or avoiding doing validation. Alden says the RA in this case was carrying out those duties correctly. He says that the underlying problem was that "what we had not done was adequately consider the new (to us) threat model of the RA being the subject of a targeted attack and entirely compromised".

DAYTONA BEACH — The public defender's office is asking that a judge reduce or eliminate the $1.2 million bail for Ebony T. Wilkerson, the pregnant mother who drove her minivan into the ocean with her three children aboard.
Wilkerson is asking to be released on her own recognizance or that the bond be reduced to an amount that she could post, according to the motion filed by Assistant Public Defender Craig S. Dyer. Wilkerson is being held at the Volusia County Branch Jail on three counts of attempted first-degree murder and three counts of child abuse. The case has been assigned to Circuit Judge Leah Case and is scheduled to be heard Monday afternoon.
Public Defender James Purdy said in a phone interview on Tuesday that the bail amount is equivalent to locking Wilkerson up without a chance at freedom.
Purdy said, “1.2 million dollars is the equivalent of no bond for somebody who doesn't have that kind of money.”
Wilkerson is entitled to a reasonable bail, he said.
“The purpose of bond is to ensure the appearance of the defendant at trial,” Purdy said. “It's not intended to be a mechanism to hold someone in jail pending trial. You are presumed innocent until proven guilty.”
Wilkerson drove into the waves in Daytona Beach on March 4 with her children in her minivan. Volusia County Sheriff Ben Johnson and sheriff's Sgt. Richard Fortin said previously that Wilkerson had the intent of killing her children because she “calmly and easily got out of the van” and walked away while the three youngsters screamed for someone to help them.
Wilkerson, who is pregnant, left her South Carolina home on March 2 and headed for sister Jessica Harrell's home in Daytona Beach because Wilkerson claimed her 31-year-old husband, Lutful Ronjon, had been abusing her for 14 years and she did not want him near their three children any longer, a Volusia County sheriff's report shows. The day before she left, she filled out a police report in Myrtle Beach, S.C., claiming that Ronjon had beaten her and attacked her in a beachside motel in front of their children. Before she headed south to Daytona Beach, she also filed a report with North Charleston police recounting what had happened in Myrtle Beach and complaining that police there had not arrested Ronjon, an incident report states.
Two days after she arrived at Harrell's apartment, though, Wilkerson took her three children — two daughters ages 3 and 10, and a son, 9 — on a ride to the beach, telling them along the way that she was taking them to a better place, Fortin said. Several people saw her driving too close to the water on the beach and warned her, but she took a hard left and plunged the van into the cold water, forging ahead as her terrified children cried and yelled.
Wilkerson's son jumped onto her lap and tried to wrestle the steering wheel from her in an attempt to turn the Honda Odyssey van away from waves. One wave finally slammed into the van, tossing it about and almost tipping the vehicle over into the 58-degree water.
Bystanders and Beach Safety Ocean Rescue officers who encountered Wilkerson said she blocked an officer from getting into the van. He pushed her out of the way and along with the other rescuers grabbed the children and took them to shore.
The records for Wilkerson's case did not appear on the clerk's website until Tuesday morning, which is longer than records typically take to appear on the site.
The clerk's office, though, said it was posted in a timely manner.
“This case was processed timely considering 1st appearances conducted on Saturday and the paperwork was processed on the first available business day which was Monday and was made available after the warrant was properly cleared,” wrote Jessica Simson, a project specialist with the clerk's office, in an email.
MASN broadcaster Gary Thorne may just be one of the most interesting men in the world.
The longtime play-by-play man, who was recently inducted into the UMaine Sports Hall of Fame, is known for his illustrious sports broadcasting career.
But beyond the box, there are so many other interesting facts about Thorne. Sit down and chat with him for a few minutes, and you'll learn so much about him, from the fact that he wanted to be an FBI agent to his journey in law school.
However, his greatest passion of all may just be reading. Thorne goes through about a book a week, keeps books on his nightstand, frequents local libraries and always takes plenty of books when traveling with the team.
His passion for reading is what inspired his weekly blog on MASNsports.com, naturally titled “Hitting the Books.” You can check it out here. (Get it? Library pun.)
Although reading tends to be a solitary activity, Thorne makes it inclusive by inviting fellow broadcasters to discuss their favorite books and interacting with commenters on the blog.
So when the idea of sharing some of his all-time favorite reads with some (unsuspecting) fans came up, Thorne was 100 percent on board.
Inspired by Goodreads' “Hide a Book Day,” Thorne will be hiding copies of his favorite books around the ballpark before the Orioles' game against the Red Sox on Monday, Sept. 18. Be sure to get to the park early and look around the lower bowl seats, Dempsey's Brew Pub & Restaurant and other secret locations to see if you find a hidden copy signed by Thorne himself.
If you do, then get reading! Even if you're not one of the lucky few to stumble upon a book, be sure to check out his blog to catch up on all of the recommendations and then start hitting the books!
Thursday, the court released its judgments in five different cases that touched on tariffs set by the Copyright Board governing music downloading, photocopying textbooks, videogames and movie and TV soundtracks.
“I think it's definitely pro-consumer,” said University of Ottawa law professor and Toronto Star columnist Michael Geist. “It's also a pro-business decision as the court has recognized that innovation that is so crucial for the Canadian economy relies on flexibility in copyright.”
And for the most part, the rulings benefit the public while potentially leaving songwriters and performers a little poorer.
All cases pitted the societies that collect fees on behalf of creators against the distributors or users of the copyrighted materials.
But just as important as saving money is the Supreme Court's support for the idea of “fair dealing,” experts say.
Cynthia Andrew, a policy analyst for the Ontario Public School Boards Association says school boards currently pay the Copyright Board about $5.16 per student per year. She thinks that figure might drop next year as a result of this ruling.
“It restores a measure of common sense to Copyright debate,” says Murray, who co-authored Canadian Copyright: A Citizen's Guide. “We still have to buy stuff if we're using a lot of it, but if we need little bits, then we've got to get on with our lives, and anybody who has taught knows this . . . Copyright is going to cover the commercial market for works, and it still does.”
Queen's University professor Laura Murray pointed out universities and school boards already pay an annual tariff for the right to photocopy parts of textbooks; an extra fee on each individual work copied, which the court rejected, would have sent costs spiraling.
In one of the biggest cases, school boards across the country faced off against a body that collects royalty fees for publishers. The court sided with the educators.
Countries like the United States, Germany and Japan already have similar guidelines in place, she said.
That means while it's unfair for a teacher to photocopy an entire textbook to avoid buying it, the average teacher copies fewer than 10 pages per student per year, Andrew says.
Music downloaders and telecoms also won as the Justices upheld previous decisions of The Federal Court of Appeal and Copyright Board that cable and other Internet providers should not have to pay royalties on song downloads or the free, 30-second song previews they offer shoppers.
The clips, which are automatically deleted and often of lesser quality than the musical works themselves, count as research which helps consumers determine what music to purchase, the court said.
The Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada (SOCAN) had argued that “since the evidence showed that each user, on average, listened to 10 previews before purchasing a musical work for download, the overall amount of time spent listening to previews was so large that the dealing was unfair.”
The organization suggested other methods, like advertising, album artwork, textual descriptions, and user-generated album reviews, were available to help users identify potential music for purchase.
Had they prevailed, consumers should not have seen a levy on previews, said Eric Baptiste, CEO of SOCAN.
“To the best of our knowledge, there's no significant difference in price point for business models in countries that have this viewing situation for previews compared to countries that don't have it.”
The court's findings reflect a discomfort with the “layering of rights,” Geist said.
For example, a business that had bought the required licensing right being forced to pay another fee when a song is downloaded by a consumer.
“Suddenly now they're being nickel-and-dimed,” Geist said. “It's clear the public has been frustrated and concerned with that kind of evolution. It feels as if the courts almost just said ‘Enough!' The payment is of course appropriate, but multiple payments for basically the same thing isn't.”
The justices instead determined there should be no copyright fees levied on cable companies or other digital providers when music is downloaded, but that artists should be compensated when it is streamed online.
SOCAN is taking its time to parse the “disappointing” downloading ruling which means the potential loss of royalties from permanent downloads, 3.1 per cent, for example, on each iTunes track purchased.
A lawyer for Rogers Communications Inc., one of the digital service providers that went up against SOCAN, said the industry is now owed roughly three cents for every song downloaded in Canada between 1996-2006.
SOCAN has been collecting money for both streaming and downloading but has not distributed the funds to its members given the pending cases.
“From our own perspective the court got it right: streaming is a very important and growing part of the digital business . . . because people want instantaneous access to music and are not really wanting to have a permanent copy of music on a device,” Baptiste said.
But Peter Cardinali, a Toronto-based musician, producer and record executive, said: “This is the bottom line — composers and music producers depend on these ever shrinking performance royalties to make a living and to be able to continue creating music. For years now, film and TV composers have been forced to reduce, or in some cases, forfeit their up-front fees, as well as share or give away their publishing to the production companies (some are even partnered with the Internet Service Provider owners), with the promise/lure of a generous ‘back end' (i.e. performance royalties). Now?”
The judges also ruled movie theatres, broadcasters and cable companies shouldn't be charged for the music that's part of a film or a TV program they are showing.
“It seems incongruous that songwriters should be compensated when their work is broadcast on TV and in motion pictures, while the actual performers of the recordings are not,” said Ian MacKay, president of Re: Sound Music Licensing Company, a non-profit dedicated to obtaining fair compensation for artists and record companies for their performance rights.
“That being said it is the Supreme Court's role to interpret the law as it exists, not as it should be. Unfortunately, Canada's copyright law has today been found to put Canadian recording artists and record companies at a disadvantage in the international marketplace.”
Similarly, the court ruled software companies that sell video games online should not have to pay royalties for the music included in the games.
Video game manufacturers argued that a royalty would be redundant given they already pay licensing fees for the pop songs used in games like “Guitar Hero,” and own the copyrights to original music used in games.
David Fewer, director of the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic, said the decision ensures a sleekerbusiness model for video game manufacturers.
“When you think about the Internet as a platform for doing business, this is a huge win because it cuts down the amount of red tape you have to deal with,” says Fewer. “For software or (television shows) or film or even eBooks, all that stuff would have run into this second layer of copyright clearance. Any layer of clearance is a pain . . . It makes (products) more expensive.”

HOW astronauts go to the toilet in zero gravity has always interested some. Now it can reveal unwanted difficulties - among them issues of ownership - can arise.
Newly-released transcripts from NASA's Apollo 10 mission to the moon in May 1969 show that when it came to boldly going, all was not well.
Astronauts Thomas Stafford, John Young and Eugene Cernan had, judging by the transcripts, profound difficulty managing the spacecraft's toilet, the Daily Mail reported.
Apollo 10's Commander, Thomas Stafford, was first to realise there was a problem.
"Give me a napkin quick ... there's a turd floating through the air," he said.
John Young, the Command Module Pilot, quickly replied: "I didn't do it. It ain't one of mine."
Eugene Cernan, the Lunar Module Pilot, quickly realising the blame was shifting towards him, shot back: "I don't think it's one of mine."
Stafford then retorted: "Mine was a little more sticky than that. Throw that away."
Young retorted: "God almighty" before laughter is heard.
Cernan then discovers there's more than one piece of human waste floating in the cockpit.
"Here's another goddamn turd. What's the matter with you guys? Here, give me a –" which is greeted with laughter from Stafford and Young.
Stafford asks: "It was just floating around?"
Cernan: "Yes."
The issue was reviewed after the mission ended, with NASA experts concluding that correctly using the "facilities"in space - ie, a strategically-positioned plastic bag - required "a great deal of skill".
"In general, the Apollo waste management system worked satisfactorily from an engineering standpoint," according to the biomedical review said. "From the point of view of crew acceptance, however, the system must be given poor marks."
Apollo 10 was the fourth manned mission in the US Apollo space program. Its purpose was to be a "dry run" for the Apollo 11 mission, testing the procedures and components of a Moon landing without actually landing on the Moon itself.

“How Not To” Lyrics
I can honestly understand why it's over
I can go through the motions of walking away
I can give you the key and take my things back
I can find plenty things to fill my days
But I don't know how not to think about you
When it's late at night and crying
And I know that I ought to be the one who is strong and just moves on
But I probably turn down your road, knock-knock on your door
Fall back in your arms, wake up in the morning
Hating myself for the way that I can't help the way I still want you
I just don't know how not to, how not to, how not to
I just don't know how not to, how not to, how not to
You're like second nature, baby, you're just like breathin'
A melody that you hear and you can't forget
The time goes by and I still need you
Yeah, you were at the heartbreak of no regret
But I don't know how not to think about you
When it's late at night and crying
And I know that I ought to be the one who is strong and just moves on
But I probably turn down your road, knock-knock on your door
Fall back in your arms, wake up in the morning
Hating myself for the way that I can't help the way I still want you
I just don't know how not to, how not to, how not to
I just don't know how not to, how not to, how not to
I don't know how not to think about you
When it's late at night and crying
But I know that I ought to be the one who's strong and just moves on
But I probably turn down your road, knock-knock on your door
Fall back in your arms, wake up in the morning
Hating myself for the way that I can't help the way I still want you
I just don't know how not to, how not to, how not to
I just don't know how not to, how not to, how not to

Tesco is making a (likely futile) attempt to push its own, in-house mobile payments app PayQwiq, meaning the apathy is somewhat understandable. Sainsbury's isn't being very forthcoming about why it's been dragging its heels, but we imagine the secret lies with Zapp. Two years ago, Zapp was pitched as a kind of friendly mobile payment system. One that wouldn't be tied to one device manufacturer, or mobile OS. Asda and Sainsbury's pledged their support for Zapp way back when, but it never materialised. In fact, the last we heard, MasterCard acquired VocaLink -- the company behind Zapp -- this past July.
It was only a matter of time before Sainsbury's had to pull a Barclays and admit that contactless support is now an important convenience for customers. And with the active authentication of Apple Pay and Android Pay allowing contactless transactions to breach the £30 cap for cards, you can now pay for your weekly shop without a wallet or purse in sight.
SANAA (Reuters) - Yemen's powerful Houthi movement fought artillery battles with the army near the presidential palace in Sanaa on Monday, surrounded the prime minister's residence and drew accusations they were mounting a coup.

Explosions echoed across the city and smoke hung over downtown buildings as the most intense clashes since the Shi'ite Muslim Houthi movement seized the capital in September, throwing the fragile Arab state deep into turmoil.
In the evening, the government said a palace in central Sanaa where the prime minister lives had been encircled by Houthi forces and that Houti representatives were talking with the president.
“Houthis in meeting with president to agree on terms for releasing chief of staff in return for changes in constitution and national authority,” Information Minister Nadia al-Saqqaf said on her Twitter account.
The Houthis' September takeover made them the country's de facto top power, and tensions between them and President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi had been growing since Saturday when they abducted his chief of staff, Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak, to gain leverage in a bitter dispute over a proposed new constitution.
Earlier on Monday, Saqqaf said Houthi fighters had fired on Prime Minister Khaled Bahah's motorcade after he left a meeting with Hadi and a Houthi adviser that had been called to try to resolve bitter disagreements over a draft constitution.
A Yemeni government spokesman described the shooting at Bahah's armoured convoy as an assassination attempt. Bahah's residence, the Republican palace, was later cut off.
“The gunmen have surrounded the palace and the prime minister is inside,” government spokesman Rajeh Badi said. Two eyewitnesses confirmed the siege.
Al-Saqqaf earlier told Reuters the presidential palace had come under “direct attack” in what she described as an attempted coup. Hadi was believed to have been at home in another district at the time. “If you attack the presidential palace ... This is aggressive, of course it is an attempted coup,” she said.
Government ministers said a ceasefire had come into force in the evening after the Houtis had seized the state news agency and television station. Nine people were killed and 90 wounded, Health Minister Riyadh Yassin told state news agency SABA. Final numbers are likely to be higher.
Widely seen as Iran's ally in its regional struggle for influence with Saudi Arabia, the Houthis — now part of Yemen's government — said they would “escalate the situation” if their demands for a fair stake in a new constitution were not met.
Yemen has long been plagued by tribal divisions, a separatist challenge in the south and the threat from a regional wing of al Qaeda, which claimed a deadly Jan. 7 attack in Paris on a satirical journal known for mocking Islam.
GUNFIRE, EXPLOSIONS
In the early evening, state news agency Saba quoted Interior Minister Jalal al-Roweishan as saying a ceasefire had gone into effect. Residents reported that the intense artillery and gun battles of earlier in the day appeared to have tailed off.
But residents were uncertain about the immediate cause of the violence, which began in the early morning with explosions near the palace and the home of the national security chief.
Residents said army gunners had shelled a housing compound used as a Houthi base.
Heavy gunfire and explosions shook the Hadda district in the diplomatic quarter in Sanaa's south. A Reuters witness saw gunmen in Al-Khamseen street, home to some senior government security officials, including the defence minister.
“On my way to work in the morning in Hadda street, there were gunmen swarming everywhere. They were in military fatigues. Their bazookas bore ‘Death to America, death to Israel' signs, which is the Houthis' sign,” said a hotel worker.
In a move that stunned the Arab world, the Houtis seized Sanaa in September and advanced into central and western regions of Yemen, where Sunni Muslims predominate. The Houthis want more rights for the country's Zaydi Shi'ite sect and say they are campaigning against corruption.
PARTNERSHIP
A deal signed later that month between political parties and the Houthis called for the formation of a new unity government followed by the withdrawal of Houthi combatants from the capital. The fighters have remained in place, however.
In what he said was an attempt to defuse the violence, Saleh al-Sammad, a Houthi member appointed by Hadi as a political adviser in September, issued a statement with a list of conditions addressed to the government.

The conditions include a “fair” and inclusive partnership with Ansarallah, the political wing of the Houthi movement, and omitting sections of a draft constitution that he said violated September's political agreement.
“If the previous agreement is not honoured, there is commitment to escalate the situation ... and it is difficult to undo the escalation, which will come at a big cost,” he said.
The draft, launched on Saturday, aims to resolve regional, political and sectarian differences by devolving authority to the regions, but has been opposed by the Houthis who fear it will dilute their power.
Media playback is not supported on this device Swann: I was awful in Australia
Graeme Swann said he chose to walk away during England's Ashes whitewash because his bowling was "awful" and he felt "powerless" during matches.
The spinner, 34, who quit cricket after the third Test, described the decision as the "most sobering" of his life.
"It was a horrible feeling to come to terms with," Swann told Radio 5 live.
Swann also gave his backing to captain Alastair Cook, saying not even legendary skipper Mike Brearley could have turned around a failing team.
England's sixth highest Test wicket-taker with 255, caused a major shock when he announced his retirement from all forms of cricket four days before the fourth Ashes Test in Melbourne.
Swann in numbers Took 255 wickets in 60 Tests at an average of 29.96
wickets in at an average of Appeared in 79 one-day internationals, claiming 104 wickets at 27.76
one-day internationals, claiming wickets at Made 39 Twenty20 international appearances, taking 51 wickets at 16.84
Speaking on 5 live's Not Just Cricket, which airs at 21:00 GMT on Monday, Swann said his performances in the first three Tests - he took seven wickets at an average of 80 - caused him to bring forward a departure he had planned for the end of the tour.
As the effects of a second elbow operation in March 2013 took their toll on his bowling, the one-time match-winner, who made his Test debut against India in December 2008, felt he had become a liability.
"Quite simply, I was awful," he said. "Whenever I bowled in the past, I could always get a lot of revolutions on the ball, dip and trouble most batsmen I bowled at.
"But from the outset of the tour, in the warm-up matches, I just couldn't do it. After my second elbow operation, I've never really got the same revolutions I got before it, but it just [deteriorated] and I really felt powerless to tie people down.
"In Adelaide, I was getting hit for six by a rabbit who bats at number 11. It gets to a point that you realise you are hindering the team. You are not helping them in any way.
"It's a horrible feeling to come to terms with because you are playing for your country, you love playing cricket for England and it's your life, but to actually come to that conclusion is possibly the most sobering decision I have ever had to make.
"It was horrendous."
The 5-0 whitewash in Australia was only the third in England's history and statistically their worst ever Ashes tour.
But Swann was quick to deflect criticism from Cook and described the dismal series as a collective failure.
Cook v Brearley as captain Cook Brearley Tests 21 31 Won 9 18 Drawn 6 9 Lost 6 4 Win ratio 43% 58%
"No man could have captained us this winter - there is not a captain on earth," he said. "You could bring back Mike Brearley and he wouldn't have done any good.
"We were terrible. We have got to get more improved performances from the team and then the captain will be able to do his job.
"Cook should keep doing the job he was doing beforehand, not panic about what has happened and just get everyone together and think how are we going to go about scoring big runs again.
"That is the only way you can win Test matches. It's what we did arguably for five years. We were so good because we had such a reliable top order who were scoring so many runs. If we can get back to that we will be fine."
The aftermath to England's disastrous Ashes campaign has featured claims of splits in the dressing-room.
Swann says the reports, including a rumoured rift between coach Andy Flower and star batsman Kevin Pietersen, have been wide of the mark.
"It will probably surprise people to hear that the changing-room was not divided," he added. "It was remarkably calm. People just knew we were not performing and they were doing whatever they could to improve that.
"Some of the stuff I have read is just a made-up pack of lies. There was one line in one of the famous tabloids saying KP refused to go to the Christmas dinner. He sat on the table next to me with his whole family.
"He's had his moments in the past where he certainly has been divisive in the dressing-room, but to be fair to Kev, since coming back from his 'reintegration' he has been much improved."
New Delhi: Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde on Tuesday clarified his remarks on crushing the elements of media for spreading false propaganda against the Congress.
Shinde said, "My comments were on social media. It was with regards to the issue related to the Northeast students who were being targeted in Hyderabad and Karnataka. It was not on journalists."
Stoking a controversy, The Union Home Minister on Monday threatened to "crush" the electronic media, alleging a section of it was unnecessarily provoking the Congress party by indulging in "false propaganda" against it.
The outburst by Shinde, a Congress leader who hails from Maharashtra's Sholapur district, came at a Youth Congress event in Sholapur.. Shinde, who is a Lok Sabha MP from Sholapur, alleged that since the last four months a section of the electronic media is "manipulating" news about him and his party and warned it would be "crushed" if this kind of reportage is not stopped immedidately. "What is happening in the electronic media largely I am aware of it. In the last four months there have been efforts by the media to provoke us (Congress). We will crush such elements in the electronic media, which are indulging in false propaganda, if it did not stop" he said. "I have the intelligence department under me. I know who is doing such things. I know what is happening. Some forces are behind this," he added. Shinde's remarks came against the backdrop of a series of opinion polls in the national and regional media which predicted a poor showing for the Congress in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. Urging the media to focus on positive stories, which will be welcomed by the people, Shinde said the people of the country will not accept those dividing the country by disturbing society. Shinde's attack against electronic media came even as the Editors Guild of India today objected to "unsubstantiated charges" levelled by public figures dissatisfied with the coverage of their activities or with criticism. The Guild expressed its view against the backdrop of attack on media by AAP leadere Arvind Kejriwal and former Army Chief Gen V K Singh, It appealed to political leaders and public figures not to resort to "vague, unsubstantiated charges of corrupt motives and abuses when refuting, questioning or criticising the media and keep the public discourse civil and within reasonsable bounds."
Image copyright AP Image caption Kim Jong-nam had largely lived outside North Korea since falling out of favour with his half-brother
Malaysian authorities are searching for suspects as they investigate the death of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's half brother.
Kim Jong-nam died after an apparent poison attack in the airport in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, on Monday.
His body is undergoing an autopsy. Few official details have been released.
South Korea's acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn said if North Korea was found to be responsible, it would show its "brutality and inhumane nature".
A woman from Myanmar has been detained at Kuala Lumpur airport as part of the investigation, Malaysian state news agency Bernama reported.
North Korea silent
Malaysia is yet to formally confirm that the dead man is Kim Jong-nam, as he was travelling under a different name, Kim Chol.
But the government of South Korea has said it is certain it is him. Its spy agency is said to have told lawmakers they believe Mr Kim was poisoned.
It would be the most high-profile death linked to North Korea since Kim Jong-un's uncle, Chang Song-thaek, was executed in 2013.
North Korea has not commented on the death but officials from the country's Malaysian embassy have been visiting the hospital in Kuala Lumpur where Mr Kim's body has been taken.

Mr Kim was attacked while preparing to board a flight home to Macau. His death was only made public on Tuesday.
The chief police officer of Royal Malaysian police, Datuk Sri Abu Samad, has said that a post-mortem examination is expected to be completed soon.
In response to reports that North Korea had asked to claim the body, he said there had been no official request.
Police are studying security camera footage from the airport. Images circulating in the media have focused on two women seen alongside Mr Kim, who were later seen leaving the scene in a taxi.

What happened?
Kim Jong-nam was attacked at about 09:00 (01:00 GMT) on Monday while waiting at the budget terminal of Kuala Lumpur International Airport for a 10:00 flight to Macau, Malaysia's Star newspaper reports, quoting police.
Exactly how the attack unfolded is still unclear. Officials and witnesses have variously said he was splashed with a chemical or had a cloth placed over his face. Earlier reports spoke of a "spray" being used or a needle.
He died on the way to hospital.
Why the delay in identifying him?
South Korean media named the victim early on Tuesday but the Malaysian authorities initially reported only the sudden death of an unnamed North Korean national who had fallen ill at the airport.
Police then released a statement which quoted the victim's travel document identifying him as "Kim Chol", born on 10 June 1970. Kim Jong-nam is believed to have been born on 10 May 1971.
It was not the first time Mr Kim had travelled under an assumed identity: he was caught trying to enter Japan using a false passport in 2001. He told officials he had been planning to visit Tokyo Disneyland.
Who was he?
The Tokyo incident is thought by some analysts to have spoilt Kim Jong-nam's chances of succeeding his father, Kim Jong-il, who died in 2011.
Bypassed in favour of his youngest half-brother for succession, Kim Jong-nam kept a low profile, spending most of his time overseas in Macau, mainland China and Singapore.
He later spoke out against his family's dynastic control of North Korea and in a 2012 book was quoted as saying he believed his younger half-brother lacked leadership qualities.
But he had said he was not interested in assuming the leadership himself.
Was this an assassination?
Unnamed US government sources have said they believe he was poisoned by North Korean agents.
The director of the National Intelligence Service (NIS), Lee Byung-ho, told South Korean MPs that Pyongyang had wanted to kill Kim Jong-nam for several years, but that he was being protected by China.
Mr Kim was reportedly targeted for assassination in the past. A North Korean spy jailed by South Korea in 2012 is said to have admitted trying to organise a hit-and-run accident targeting him.
The secretive state has a long history of sending agents overseas to carry out assassinations, attacks and kidnappings.
You probably could have guessed that the value of that beloved red-door Victorian from everyone's favorite ABC sitcom has only increased over the years.
Little did the Tanner family know that their multi-family house would have been appraised for some major bucks in the years that followed the show's run on television due to the major cost of living increase in the San Francisco Bay area.
The house itself is located in the extremely desirable San Fran neighborhood called Lower Pacific Heights (often referred to as just "Lower Pac Heights") and has become an icon for tourists and fans of the show alike.

Though the exterior has definitely been renovated and changed since the opening credit shots to the show were filmed, it's still maintained its charm and unmistakable characteristics.
The home is located at 1709 Broderick Street and includes three bedrooms and three bathrooms spread among 2,500 square feet of living space.
The two-story Victorian sold for $725K in 1990, according to Redfin, which was only two years after 'Full House' first aired.
16 years later in 2006, the house sold for a whopping $1.85M. That's an average of an astounding 6.1 percent appreciation per year.

And it should come as no surprise that today, nearly a decade later, the home is valued at an even higher number.
Zillow estimates the famed house's value to be around $3.56M, while Trulia gives it a lower estimate at $2.8M. Taking the average of these two, we can deduce that the home is worth somewhere around $3.18M.
Neighborhood Scout reports that the average appreciation rate in San Francisco has increased 3.43% annually across the last 10 years. Applying this rate to the price the house was last sold for would mean the home is valued somewhere around $2.48M.
Taking all of these estimates into account, this means that the Tanner house is valued just shy of $2.5M at its lowest, and just above $3.5M at its highest.

There's also data from McGuire Real Estate that shows the average sale price of a house in Lower Pacific Heights was a whopping $3.846M, as reported to Popsugar.
So while there's still conflicted debate on the logistics of exactly how much the 'Full House' house is valued at today, we can gather that it probably wouldn't sell for any less than $2.5M and could be worth upwards of $3.85M.
We think it's pretty safe to say that anywhere in that price range would have Michelle Tanner wide-eyed with her thumbs up exclaiming "You got it, dude!"

A group of gun-toting gay Libertarians said they were welcomed with open arms Sunday at a Seattle gay pride event.
Kevin Finger and five of his friends walked downtown carrying handguns, AR-15s and AK-47s, The Blaze reported. One sign they carried read, “Armed gays don't get bashed.”
“We had prepared ourselves for the worst — to be yelled at, screamed at, called names, taunted, and circled. But what we didn't expect, was how welcoming everybody would be at Seattle Pride,” Mr. Finger told The Blaze.
He said the group had concerns beforehand of what kind of reaction their firearms would provoke. He said they received a few “uneasy looks,” but “many of those looks turned into curiosity when they saw us chatting and having a good time with other event goers.”
Shannon Tahjanjoki, one of the open-carry advocates, wrote on Facebook that the guns prevented the group from entering the actual event at the Seattle Center, but they were allowed to continue demonstrating outside.
The group even took a lighthearted photo with Seattle police, The Blaze reported.
“Lots of conversations. Lots of handshakes. Lots of high-fives. Lots of hugs. It was a day to remember,” Mr. Finger said.
He said he and his friends are “steadfast Libertarians,” adding that equal marriage rights were “part of the very first Libertarian platform at the party's inception 43 years ago,” The Blaze reported.
The group was reportedly denied participation in an Olympia gay pride parade last week due to their guns.

In August 2008, then–L.A. Weekly staff writer Christine Pelisek broke the story that California's most elusive murderer — the longest-operating serial killer west of the Mississippi — was on the loose again. The killer, dubbed the Grim Sleeper by the Weekly because he took a 13-year break before bizarrely resuming his slayings, is believed to have begun his awful crime spree on a warm August night in 1985, when the body of cocktail waitress Debra Jackson was found in an alley near West Gage Avenue.
In total, DNA testing and ballistics matching would link the Grim Sleeper to the deaths of 10 women and one man; the most recent, Janecia Peters, was found dead on the first day of 2007. The women ranged in age from 14 to 35, and most of them were discovered along a strip of Western Avenue in South L.A.
Continue Reading
Pelisek went on to write a series of in-depth articles about the Grim Sleeper for the Weekly before LAPD finally tracked him down in 2010. Lonnie Franklin Jr. was arrested thanks to the historic use of "familial DNA" sleuthing, in which Gov. Jerry Brown agreed to tap the DNA profiles of every man in the California prison system to compare saliva and other DNA left on Grim Sleeper victims. That move led authorities straight to Franklin's incarcerated son, and then to him.
Now a senior writer at People, Pelisek covered Franklin's 2016 death-penalty trial. Below is an excerpt from her book, The Grim Sleeper: The Lost Women of South Central, published June 13 by Counterpoint.
There were no nods of encouragement or waves of support from Lonnie David Franklin Jr.'s family members as he was escorted to his seat at the defendant's table in the windowless courtroom on the ninth floor of the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center. None of them were there for the long-delayed start of his trial. Sylvia, his wife of more than 30 years, was a no-show. His two children, Crystal, 37, and Christopher, 34, whose DNA profile led to his father's arrest, didn't make an appearance either.
Instead, on this day, the 16th of February, 2016, the four rows of long wooden benches in the spectator's gallery were thick with a mix of media, police, deputy district attorneys, and family members of the women Franklin was accused of murdering.
Franklin looked different from the day in 2010 when the world first saw his mug shot. Five and a half years behind bars had changed him. Once a burly man who appeared strong enough to toss a body into a dumpster, this now-bespectacled 63-year-old sat slouched next to his defense team. He appeared to have shriveled since his arrest. His long-sleeved, light blue shirt and dark blue slacks hung loosely on his now-thin frame.
Beyond his diminished look, Franklin was clean-shaven, his salt-and-pepper hair clipped short. He resembled a college professor or a bookish grandfather, not a stereotypical serial killer.
The man now known as the Grim Sleeper appeared unfazed and emotionless, never once turning his dark eyes toward the spectator gallery behind him. He just stared straight ahead at the courtroom wall, seemingly oblivious to the family members' hostile glares burrowing into the back of his head, and the unblinking stares of the mass media recording his every moment.
Almost everyone in the courtroom was convinced of his guilt, but none could fathom why. Was he simply a man who hated women and killed them when they made him angry? Or were his motives more complicated?
Lonnie Franklin Jr.'s mugshot Los Angeles Police Department/Newscom
Lonnie Franklin, in many ways, was a chameleon.
He was born in Los Angeles on Aug. 30, 1952. His mother, Ruby, was a strong-willed former beauty-school student from Texas, and his father, Lonnie Sr., a laid-back longshoreman. The timeline is somewhat vague, but not too long before Lonnie Jr. was born, possibly while Ruby was still pregnant with him, his parents got into a head-on collision and his mother was thrown out of the car. Doctors had to reattach her left ankle.
She survived and Lonnie Jr. grew up in South Central on East 78th Street, then Grand Avenue and then 85th Street with her and his father and his sister, Patricia, who was five years younger than he. Otis, Ruby's older son from another relationship, grew up in Texas with relatives but visited the Franklin home during the summer.
Franklin was somewhat of a sickly child. He had perpetual colds and started suffering from migraines that were so bad that he would throw up and have to lie down in a darkened room. These didn't subside until he was in his early 40s. As an adult, he was also afflicted with bleeding ulcers.
Franklin was a poor student who had problems with reading and writing. When he was in the fifth grade, Ruby hired a college student to tutor him, but the extra studying didn't help his grades. He struggled throughout high school and changed schools before he transferred to Dominguez High School in Compton, where he enrolled in the work-study program — he went to school in the morning and then to a job in the afternoon.
Franklin may not have been book smart but he excelled at fixing cars. Being an accomplished gearhead became a lifeline for the social teen to impress girls and show the local gangsters he was somebody they could go to. Franklin's dad taught him to drive when he was 7. When he was 14, his dad gave him his first car and allowed Franklin to drive it around the neighborhood.
As a youngster, Franklin was a fast talker and a flirt, always ready with a compliment.
Rep. Ron Paul, Texas Republican, won the 2011 Washington Times/CPAC Straw Poll of 3,742 activists, the chairman of the Conservative Political Action Conference, the huge annual gathering of conservatives, announced Saturday.
The presidential preference poll, sponsored this year for the first time by The Times, is seen as one of the earliest tests of grassroots popularity among the party's dominant conservative wing, and Mr. Paul, who ran unsuccessfully for the nomination in 2008, traditionally has done well in the CPAC voting.
The Republican lawmaker, long a favorite of the party's libertarian wing, took 30 percent of the votes cast, followed by Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney with 23 percent. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who has said he will not be a candidate in 2012, and former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson tied for third, with 6 percent of the vote.
Former GOP House Speaker Newt Gingrich followed with 5 percent.
Tied at 4 percent were Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels and former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty. Trailing them was former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who garnered just 3 percent of the vote.
Asked in the survey if they were generally happy with the field of GOP contenders lining up to challenge President Obama next year, 56 percent of CPAC voters said they were generally satisfied with the current crop of candidates, while 43 percent said they were not.
The announcement of the vote came at the end of the third and final day of the CPAC gathering in Washington.
This year's event attracted a record attendance of over 11,000, and more than 3,700 attendees participated in this year's straw poll — up more than 1,300 from a year ago.

I'm really happy to introduce myself and my new Official Good Smile Blog! First, let me introduce myself! I've been collecting figures for many years now, starting off with small trading figures then moving onto larger scaled figures. I've had this passion for so long and have truly been a fan of all sorts of figurines! I started blogging online about my passion to help spread the word of figure collecting, and through blogging I met many people within the fandom! Then that led to me meeting Aki-san, president of Good Smile Company and me working with this amazing company!
I truly am honored to be able to work with such an amesome company and work on something I truly am so passionate about! Included in this post as you can see are photos of a figure collection. This actually is my own personal collection, it's been hard work amassing so many figures with my the support of my friends and family I've grown from just collecting to a career.
I'm a fan of many series including Madoka, Gurren Lagann, Card Captor Sakura, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Guilty Crown, Full Metal Panic, Black Rock Shooter, Fate/Stay Night, Fate/Zero, Aria, Working!!, Ika Musume, Clannad, Clannad After Story, Code Geass, Bakemonogatari, Doctor Who (Yes it's not anime but I love it just the same!) Panty and Stocking with Garter Belt and many many more!
This area is my personal desk at home, currently I'm doing some remodeling of our LA office to bring in some more figures and more anime goodness into the office! But as you can see, I like to surround myself with my beautiful figures. As you can also see I'm also collecting not just figures but artwork, rubber straps and even Dollfie Dreams! Also one day, hopefully soon, I'll give you all a tour of my apartment. I have plenty more figures than shown at the moment, however lighting isn't all that great as I just moved in recently.
I'm also on a few places online;

We're very happy today to announce a new Lit Hub project—bookmarks (you can see it for yourself, right here). To paraphrase the press release (which is available in full here):
bookmarks will showcase critics from the most important and active outlets of literary journalism in America, aggregating reviews from over 70 sources—newspapers, magazines, and websites—and averaging them into a letter grade, as well as linking back to their source. Each book's cumulative grade functions as both a general critical assessment, and, more significantly, as an introduction to a range of voices.
We invite you take a look around the site and see what reviewers think of your favorite new book (or the big new books you weren't sure you'd read). If you have any questions about how bookmarks works, hopefully we'll have the answer for at least some of them at the “how it works” page, but you can always be in touch at bookmarks@lithub.com.
Thanks for reading!
Kelowna could become the first city in British Columbia to fly a "pro-life" flag over city hall.
The flag would fly during the last week of September, which the city has proclaimed "Protect Human Life Week," as it has done for the past five years.
Marlon Bartram, executive director of the Kelowna Right to Life Society, said the city hall rejected the flag's original design, which included the words 'From conception to natural death' along the bottom of the flag.
"That statement apparently violated their policy that the flag cannot advocate a certain point of view, be it political, religious or ethical," Bartram said.
The second flag design, which is being considered by city staff, is blue and white, with red stripes and with three silhouettes — a toddler, an adult and an elderly person — and with the word "pro-life" printed in capital letters across the centre.
"I think 'pro-life' is a very — I mean, it maybe has some history to it, for sure, but if you break it down, it's just we're for human life. There's nothing controversial there's nothing particularly political or religious about that statement," Bartram said.
A very different flag is flying over city hall this week.
For only the second year ever, a rainbow flag has been raised to mark Kelowna's gay pride celebrations.
City hall developed a policy last year, when it was asked to fly the rainbow flag for Pride Week.
The policy says that groups are forbidden from giving the impression the city endorses the cause behind a "courtesy flag."
While such a flag would be a first for a B.C. municipality, similar flags have been flown at city halls in Guelph and Whitby, Ontario.
NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- For many cash-strapped workers, Barack Obama's plan to stimulate the economy could mean more take-home money in their paychecks.
While details remain unclear, the president-elect's recovery proposal is likely to include a tax cut to boost spending. Exactly how much of a break that could mean for workers depends on how the tax cut is structured.
But back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest in some scenarios it could be anywhere from an extra $83 to $166 per paycheck during the first quarter of the year.
David Axelrod, a top adviser to Obama speaking Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press," said Obama had promised a middle class tax cut and that his economic recovery package will include "a portion of a tax cut that will become part of the permanent tax cut he'll have in his upcoming budget."
On the campaign trail, Obama proposed a number of tax cuts for middle- and low-income households, including an increase in the earned income tax credit for low-income families and an increase in the Hope credit to pay for education expenses. He also proposed exempting seniors with income under $50,000 from having to pay income tax.
But the proposal most likely to get money into the hands of the greatest number of taxpayers quickly is some form of Obama's proposed Make Work Pay Credit.
The credit would essentially work as a payroll tax credit equal to $500 a year for individuals and $1,000 for couples. And the money could be delivered fairly quickly simply by having employers reduce the tax withholding in a person's paycheck.
The full credit would be limited to those making $75,000 or less ($150,000 or less for couples). Individuals making between $75,000 and $85,000 (and couples making between $150,000 and $170,000) would get a partial credit.
The credit also would be refundable, meaning that even tax filers without any tax liability -- typically very low-income workers -- would receive one.
Assuming a worker gets a paycheck every two weeks, a $500 tax break amounts to $19.23 extra a paycheck. A $1,000 break for couples is the equivalent of $38.46 per pay period.
But those amounts could rise if the full tax break is given during the first part of the year. Generally speaking, "the potential stimulus effect is bigger the earlier in the year that you give it," said economist Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
One approach could be to give workers an advance on the money so that they'd receive the full $500 or $1,000 over the course of the first quarter. That could mean an extra $83 a paycheck for individuals or $166 for couples, assuming they get six paychecks between January and March.
Or that amount could be increased further if the economic recovery package calls for the tax credit to be in place for two years. In that case, if workers got an advance on two years' worth of credits, that would double the extra money in their paychecks.
How effective can it be?
Whether a temporary tax cut is spread out over the year, given in advance over the first quarter or dispensed as a one-time lump sum, there is a question about just how effective it will be in stimulating the economy.
Generally speaking, economists say, permanent tax breaks boost the economy more. Why? Because consumers feel freer to spend it rather than save it since they know it's a sum they'll get every year.
Vice President-elect Joe Biden said last week the stimulus tax cut would be a "down payment on the tax relief that we promised for the strapped middle class." So the promise of permanence may have its own stimulus effect. But considering that Congress hasn't weighed in on the issue, there's no guarantee.
Early evidence on the $100 billion in stimulus checks sent out earlier this year suggests that consumers saved more of their rebates than they spent. During the second and third quarters, when most of the stimulus money landed in consumers' bank accounts, the personal savings rate jumped over the first quarter.
But the numbers are still preliminary and given the financial chaos that erupted in late summer, it's hard to sort out what role the rebates played.
"Everyone was told we're in the worst financial crisis in decades so it could be that the savings rate would have gone up anyway because consumers weren't making big-ticket purchases [and put off spending] on anything that can be plausibly postponed," Burtless said.
Of course, consumer sentiment, if anything, is worse now.
Should the Obama team opt to propose a temporary payroll tax credit, there's nothing saying they couldn't make it worth more than $500 per worker. Nothing, that is, except the cost to federal coffers.
As it is, the Tax Policy Center estimates the cost of the Make Work Pay Credit would be $115 billion over two years ($49 billion in 2009 and $66 billion in 2010).
The total cost of the stimulus package, meanwhile, is expected to approach $800 billion. But that includes the many other elements that Obama's economic team has said would be included, namely spending on infrastructure, energy, education, health care and state aid.
Given that the country's deficit could hit $1 trillion before any money is spent on stimulus and the government to date has committed nearly $8 trillion in one form or another to stabilizing the financial system, ratcheting up the cost of any one stimulus item may not be a slam dunk.
For all of these tactical missteps, the fundamental problem for the GOP was larger. Both the House and Senate legislation seemed hatched in a time warp. In their determination to slash taxes for top earners, torch regulations on insurers, and to roll back federal spending on expanded insurance coverage (either through the private exchanges or Medicaid), each bill reflected the common Ronald Reagan-era Republican belief that their coalition is bound together above all by a determination to shrink government.
But since then, Republicans have grown increasingly dependent on blue-collar, older, and non-urban white voters who do not always agree that “government is the problem,” as Reagan declared. While these voters, many of them economically strained, remain deeply skeptical of programs like food stamps that shift resources to those they consider undeserving, they have shown much more tolerance for federal spending that financially supports people like them.
The failure to understand that distinction crippled the repeal effort. From every angle, the GOP bills imposed heavy costs on their own voters. The Urban Institute found that among those who would lose coverage under the Senate bill, 80 percent lacked a college degree, about 70 percent were in a household where someone worked full-time, and nearly 60 percent were white. Older working adults confronted enormous premium increases. Rural areas faced disproportionate risk from the Medicaid cuts because employer-provided insurance is less common there. Counties on the front line of the opioid crisis warned the Medicaid cuts would devastate their response.
All of the groups and places on that list preponderantly backed Trump last fall. As a candidate, he recognized that reflexive hostility to government did not serve his voters' needs: He even pledged to defend Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Yet on health care, Trump fatally deferred to the libertarian-infused instincts of House Speaker Paul Ryan.
Like many congressional Republicans, Ryan enshrines retrenching government above all other goals. On health care, that crusade opened a breach with the GOP's own voters: The proposals (particularly the Medicaid and insurance-regulation cutbacks) faced widespread resistance from blue-collar and older whites, even in polling conducted by prominent GOP firms like Public Opinion Strategies. In this week's ABC/Washington Post national poll, Trump's approval rating was 19 points lower than his vote last November among white women without a college degree, and 16 points lower among non-college-educated white men.
Those men are likely to stick with Republicans in the midterm elections. But veteran Democratic pollster Geoff Garin said the recoil on health care is so great that Democrats next year could eliminate the GOP advantage with blue-collar white women. Indeed, the ABC/Washington Post survey showed those working-class women—who backed both Trump and GOP House candidates by nearly 30 percentage points in November—now narrowly prefer that Democrats control Congress after 2018. Cutting Medicaid, especially while slashing taxes for the highest earners, puts “Republicans on the wrong side of the populist divide that Trump himself exploited,” Garin said.

White House press secretary emerged for his daily briefing in a Canada hockey jersey today, making good on a bet with Dimitri Soudas, spokesman for Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, on the outcome of the Olympic gold medal hockey games.
Canada won the women's game 2-0 over the United States and the men's game in overtime, meaning that Gibbs had to wear a Canada jersey during one of his on-camera briefings.
Soudas, Gibbs told reporters, is "somewhere several hindered miles north laughing."
Gibbs wore the jersey for a few minutes while making jokes with reporters. He noted that the number on the jersey, 39, was in honor of U.S. goalkeeper Ryan Miller, the tournament MVP.
He then took the Canada jersey off -- revealing that he was wearing a team USA jersey underneath it. The move prompted applause from some of the reporters. Gibbs proceeded to answer questions from reporters while wearing the Team USA jersey, which was #10 in honor of 2010.
At one point, a reporter asked Gibbs to take the jersey off, so that when he showed up on the nightly news it would not have to be explained why he was wearing a hockey jersey in a story about health care. That would look a little strange, the reporter said.
Gibbs kept the jersey on.
"It can't be any stranger than any of the other stuff I see on the news," he quipped.
CBS
The reporter than shot back: "I'm just glad it was a hockey and not a wrestling bet."
(Gibbs did eventually remove the jersey, well into the briefing.)
Gibbs also announced that the White House has instructed the U.S. embassy to make arrangements to deliver one case of Molson Canadian beer and one case of Yuengling lager from Pottsville, Pennsylvania to Harper's office.
President Obama and the Canadian prime minister had wagered on the outcome of the men's hockey final.
"I'm sure Dimitri will take most of that home and consume it," joked Gibbs.

As I've mentioned, Sam wasn't originally going to be Sam. When first introduced, he was just some guy who was late for the tournament. I liked his design enough, however, that I decided that some guy would be Sam, a character I hadn't (technically) designed yet.
An issue with his design, however, was that I'd given him stylized glasses that look opaque. This can be fine for some characters, but Sam's a character who's eyes we should be able to see now that we're getting to know him a bit better. I'm using this moment of characterization to unleash them upon the world.
I think I ALSO inadvertently designed a long haired Luke Skywalker angel. That's not really what I was going for, but that's what I think of when I look at him now.

As the refugee crisis enters its fourth year, the demographics of the men, women and children arriving on Europe's shores are undergoing an unprecedented shift. Syrians have so far made up the largest group of migrants attempting treacherous journeys across the Mediterranean Sea, followed by Afghans, Iraqis, Eritreans and sub-Saharan Africans. In the first three months of last year just one Bangladeshi arrived in Italy, but the number for 2017 stands at more than 2,800, making the country the largest single origin of migrants currently arriving on European shores, according to an exclusive report by The Independent. Those rescued in the Mediterranean Sea have told aid workers they paid more than $10,000 each to be taken from Dhaka to Dubai or Turkey and onwards to Libya, where the violence and chaos engulfing the fractured country is fuelling powerful smuggling networks. [arve url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CIWI2vqcHgE"/] The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said the emerging route had dramatically changed the demographics of asylum seekers arriving in Italy, who until now have largely hailed from sub-Saharan Africa. “The thing that's really changing is the main nationality of the migrants, and the number coming from Bangladesh,” IOM's Flavio di Giacomo told The Independent. “By the end of March last year only one Bangladeshi had arrived in Italy – and this year the number is more than 2,831 for the same period.” Some migrants taken ashore in Sicily and Apulia said their trip to Libya was organised by an “agency” that provided them with a working visa for between $3,000 and $4,000. [arve url="https://w.graphiq.com/w/whN1NDrRtj"/] “From Bangladesh, they first travelled to Dubai and Turkey, and finally reached Libya by plane,” an IOM spokesperson said. Some Bangladeshis crossing the Mediterranean have lived in the country for up to four years, while others stay there for just months while attempting to travel directly to Europe. According to information gathered by IOM, Bangladeshi migrants pay up to $10,000 to reach Libya, then another $700 to board a boat. [arve url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nPelTu3iupc"/] The crossing from North Africa to Italy is now the deadliest sea passage in the world, with a record of almost 1,100 people drowning, suffocating or dying of hypothermia on overcrowded boats so far this year. Chaos following the British-backed removal of Muammar Gaddafi has seen countless armed factions, including Isis, wage bloody battles for territory as widespread lawlessness allows smugglers to work unchecked along the coast. They coordinate with gangs inland to detain migrants in squalid detention centres, where Salah has met imprisoned Bangladeshis, while others continue to work in restaurants, services and construction. Bangladeshis are frequently employed for semi-skilled or unskilled labour in north Africa or the Gulf, receiving worse pay and treatment than migrants from richer countries. [arve url="https://w.graphiq.com/w/jKDhUz65Rkx"/] A controversial agreement struck between the EU and Turkey last year has reduced comparatively shorter and safer crossings over the Aegean Sea to a trickle, leaving Libya the main launching point for refugee boats. But moves to support Libyan detention camps have been criticised by humanitarian groups and the UN, which warned that refugees suffer arbitrary detention, rape and torture, and that pushing them back into a warzone could violate international law. The dire situation has so far scuppered prospects of replicating the controversial EU-Turkey deal, while talks between the GNA and a rival Russia-backed warlord in the east ended without agreement this week.

They say when you leave a place, it's not what you take with you, but rather what you leave behind. Hopefully, we left some great memories. I know we've left some great young men – Joe Tiller's speech at Ross-Ade Stadium following his final game in 2008.
From Tiller's first win against Notre Dame in his second game in 1997 to the last one against Indiana, he presided over the most successful era in Purdue football history. The victories between No. 1 and No. 87 were also special.
The program's all-time winningest coach passed away Saturday in Buffalo, Wyoming. He was 74.
From 1997 through 2008, Tiller revitalized a doormat program and made it nationally known and respected.
Beating the Fighting Irish and the Hoosiers to bookend his career was the perfect start and finish for any Purdue football coach. Tiller was the man who orchestrated it.
"Those are our two measuring sticks,” Tiller said following his final game in 2008, a 62-10 thrashing of Indiana at Ross-Ade Stadium. “When we step onto the field, we can't lose to those rascals. If you do, you have to live with it for a year.

Joe Tiller: Social media reaction
"Fortunately, in our period of time here, we've been on the good end of the stick. This is what Purdue football is all about."
Tiller was, and to some degree, still is Purdue football.
We are saddened to report that Joe Tiller has passed away in Buffalo, Wyoming. Condolences to Arnette, Julie, Renee and Mike. RIP. — Purdue Football (@BoilerFootball) September 30, 2017
The run is the only successful period most fans remember about the program. Maybe Jeff Brohm will change that and he's on his way to moving Purdue forward.
Before Tiller's arrival in 1997, Purdue had one winning season and no bowl games since 1984. The one winning season was due to a forfeit.
The unprecedented run of 10 bowl games in 12 seasons, including eight straight, may not ever be matched. The Rose Bowl was the crowning achievement following the 2000 season. There were appearances on New Year's Day in Florida. Tiller helped fans plan their holiday vacations with multiple trips to El Paso and San Antonio.
Quarterback Drew Brees was there from the beginning, playing for Tiller from 1997 to 2000.

"Today is a very sad day for me and the entire Purdue family," Brees told purduesports.com. "Coach Tiller was an important person in my life and to so many other guys who played for him. He did so much more than teach us how to win. He taught us life lessons and how to be great leaders and men. My thoughts and prayers are with Arnette, Julie, Renee and Mike."
Tiller had Purdue ranked as high as No. 5 in the country in 2004 with ESPN's Game Day on campus. Who could've predicted this?
Consider this. When Tiller retired, Purdue's 87-62 overall record and 53-37 mark in the Big Ten was the fifth-best in the conference during the 12-year span. Only Michigan, Ohio State, Wisconsin and Penn State posted better results.
That was the golden era of Purdue football.
"Joe Tiller was one of the great coaches in all of Purdue history," Purdue president Mitch Daniels said in a statement. "The next time we go to the Rose Bowl, our first thoughts will be of him, and we will miss him every day in between. Our hearts go out to Arnette and the entire Tiller family."
Tiller was the right guy at the right time to help a struggling program find its identity.
Coming from Wyoming, where Tiller emphasized the passing game, he rejuvenated the Boilermakers with his innovative “basketball on grass” offense forcing Big Ten defensive coordinators to scramble for solutions.

A lot of what you see today in college football is directly related to Tiller and his spread offense approach.
His emphasis on the quarterback meshed with the school's tradition, one he was familiar with from his stint as an assistant coach for four seasons under Leon Burtnett. When the Boilermakers have enjoyed solid play from the quarterback position, they've won.
He's remembered for recruiting Drew Brees but also for making quarterback Billy Dicken an All-Big Ten selection during his first season. He's remembered for his fun-loving approach and personality, but also for his toughness in dealing with players.
"He turned the program around,” offensive lineman Matt Light said in 2008. Light was a member of Tiller's first team and later played for the New England Patriots.
“He brought a lot of great players into the fold. He is a man who demanded a lot from his players. He set these guys up for life after football.”

Tiller and his wife, Arnette – who introduced the phrase ‘Boiler Up!' to add more excitement to Ross-Ade Stadium - traveled back to West Lafayette after retirement during the football season to watch at least two games. He remained a beloved figure walking around Ross-Ade Stadium or visiting with athletic department personnel in the press box.
When Tiller and former men's basketball coach Gene Keady were seen talking to each other, you stopped and admired the wins, the accomplishments and the men.
After that final game in 2008, Tiller invited anyone who was listening to stop by the family's new home in Buffalo, Wyoming.
“We're listed in the phone book. The gate is always open. The coffee pot is always on,” he told the sellout crowd.
And then in his final press conference, Tiller exited with a tremendous amount of satisfaction knowing he was leaving the program in a better place compared to when he arrived.
“I feel like I can ride off into the sunset and the job is done,” Tiller said.
Indeed, a job – and a life – well done.

Nicolai "device" Reedtz will miss another event, ESL Pro League Season 6 Finals, with Astralis ready to pull out of the tournament in case WESA disallows the team from using Dennis "dennis" Edman.
According to a source close to the team, Nicolai "device" Reedtz's slow recovery will prevent him from attending ESL Pro League Season 6 Finals with Astralis, who had just played BLAST Pro Series with Dennis "dennis" Edman as a stand-in this weekend.
Astralis are looking into using the Swede once more at the Pro League Finals in Odense. Their situation can be compared to Liquid, who will have to use Wilton "zews" Prado at the finals as Lucas "steel" Lopes wasn't allowed to play by WESA. That may become an issue for Astralis, as dennis also played the full online season of ESL Pro League with another team, GODSENT.
device's health issues continue
In case WESA denies Astralis their appeal regarding dennis, the team will pull out of ESL Pro League Season 6 Finals altogether, the source says.
When reached for a comment, RFRSH CEO Nikolaj Nyholm told HLTV.org that Astralis "are currently in talks with WESA and ESL about the situation".
Beer for Bones
As some of you (Beer Drinkers) may have already heard, a new(ish) study suggests that beer is a significant source of dietary silicon, a key nutrient for increasing bone mineral density. Researchers from the Department of Food Science & Technology at the University of California studied commercial beer production to determine the relationship between beer production methods and the resulting silicon (silica) content, concluding that beer is a rich source of dietary silicon…The trick here is to actually dig up the results, without spending a fortune on Science Journal subscriptions!
Details of this study are available in the February issue of the Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture, published by Wiley-Blackwell on behalf of the Society of Chemical Industry…Unfortunately, for curious Cyclists, amateur Science Buffs, and Librarians, and of course all cash-strapped bonefide Researchers the world over, the Publishing industry behind Science Journals presents a very significant and expensive barrier to the free spread of important information…Even if the research was publicly funded to begin with!
…So as soon as I can figure out how to access this privileged information, I'll be sure to post the details here. Here's what I've been able to glean so far :
Since the bio availability of silica is largely derived from fluids, it's been determined that beer is one of the richest sources of silica in the diet. However, little is known of the relationship between silicon content and beer style and the manner in which beer is produced. The purpose of this study was to measure silicon in a diversity of beers and ascertain which grist selection and brewing factors that impact the level of silicon obtained in beer.
Commercial beers ranged from 6.4 to 56.5 mg L-1 in silicon. Products derived from a grist of barley tended to contain more silicon than did those from a wheat-based grist, likely because of the high levels of silica in the retained husk layer of barley. Hops contain substantially more silicon than does grain, but quantitatively hops make a much smaller contribution than malt to the production of beer and therefore relatively less silicon in beer derives from them. During brewing the vast majority of the silicon remains with the spent grains; however, aggressive treatment during wort production in the brewhouse leads to increased extraction of silicon into wort and much of this survives into beer.
(PARTIAL) Conclusions:
Water and beer are the best sources (by far) fo Silica so, it stands to reason that combining both (in the form of beer) is the safest bet
Barley based beer is better, so forget wheat (weiss/witte) beer for bone growth)
“Hoppy” beers like Pilsners have an added boost of silicon
It's not much to go on if you want to treat beer as a dietary supplement (winks), but In the meantime, maybe you have something to add to another concept I'm researching….That Science Journals are a possibly big part of the problem when it comes to communicating good science to the Public ( hello, ClimateGate! ), maintaining a positive PR profile for the entire (recently sullied) field of Science, and of course allowing researchers and schools more liberal access to previous work, and thus lowering the cost of better and new research for everyone…..You can read more HERE

Adrian Wojnarowski breaks down the process of attempting to prove a team tampered with another team's player and what potential penalties could be levied on the Lakers if evidence is found. (1:59)
The possibility of impermissible contact between Los Angeles Lakers president of basketball operations Magic Johnson and four-time All-Star Paul George is at the crux of an NBA probe into tampering, league sources tell ESPN.
The Indiana Pacers filed tampering charges with the NBA against the Lakers, and the league issued a statement Sunday saying that an investigation is underway.
The Lakers are denying the allegations filed by the Pacers, insisting that there is no evidence of tampering, and they expect to be cleared in the matter, a team source told ESPN.
"As the NBA's statement made clear, we cannot comment about the specifics of any ongoing investigation," the Lakers said in a statement. "We can confirm, however, that we are cooperating fully with the NBA in the hope of clearing our name as soon as possible."
If the league office's probe -- which was initiated around the time of the NBA draft in late June -- can prove that the Lakers tampered with George while he was under contract with Indiana, they can be punished in several ways, including a loss of draft picks, fines up to $5 million, future restrictions on acquiring George and possible suspensions of offending officials.

If the NBA finds evidence that the Lakers had engaged in a side agreement with George, he could be prohibited from signing a free-agent deal with Los Angeles or being part of a trade to the Lakers.
Nevertheless, it is unclear whether any evidence exists that could incriminate the Lakers or Johnson. The NBA is using the law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz to probe the matter, the NBA said.
Editor's Picks Tampering FAQ: How will NBA respond to Pacers' charges against Lakers? The Indiana Pacers charged the Los Angeles Lakers with tampering over Paul George, but what will the NBA do about it? How has the NBA handled tampering recently?
The story on the tampering charges involving George was first reported by Peter Vecsey.
Team officials aren't allowed to make contact with players or their agents to discuss future plans unless it's after the opening of the players' free-agency year on July 1.
The Pacers' charges represent a growing concern among many NBA teams that some potential suitors are reaching out to players and agents with one or two years left on current deals, trying to manipulate opt-outs and trades, league sources said.
George informed the Pacers in June that he planned to opt out of his contract in 2018 and intended to sign a free-agent deal with the Lakers. He was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis on June 30 in a deal that was finalized on July 6. George has been public in his desire and interest to potentially play for his hometown Lakers.
George could be eligible to sign a four-year deal worth approximately $130 million in free agency.
George, 27, has long been connected to a possible return to his Southern California roots to play for the Lakers. The Lakers have started to clear salary-cap space to pursue George and Cleveland's LeBron James in 2018 free agency.
George averaged 23.7 points, 6.6 rebounds and 3.3 assists in 2016-17. George, a four-time All-Star, was part of the 2016 USA Olympic gold-medal team less than two years after suffering a broken leg.
Classicist says she wrote reference for one troll because she feared name-and-shame response would harm his job prospects
Academic and TV historian Mary Beard has disclosed her innovative approach to dealing with her vitriolic Twitter trolls – writing them a job reference.
The Cambridge University professor, one of the country's foremost classicists who have fought a very public battle about online etiquette after receiving a torrent of abuse on Twitter, said she has taken to befriending her vilifiers.
They include the university student Oliver Rawlings, whom she publicly named and shamed in July last year after he sent her an abusive message. Speaking in an interview with the New Yorker magazine, Beard revealed the pair had remained in touch after he took her to lunch to apologise for sending her a tweet that read: "You filthy old slut" followed by a derogatory comment about her genitalia.
Beard retweeted it to her 47,000 followers to out her abuser, but said she had now taken to writing job recommendations for Rawlings so he didn't suffer in the long term for "one moment of idiocy".
"He is going to find it hard to get a job, because as soon as you Google his name that is what comes up," she said. "And although he was a very silly, injudicious, and at that moment not very pleasant young guy, I don't actually think one tweet should ruin your job prospects."
She added: "In general, I am more concerned to be sure that people don't use the internet in this way (or don't do so again) than to seek 'punishment'."
Beard's tactic of naming-and-shaming also prompted Rawlings to make a public apology on his own Twitter account, writing: "I sincerely apologise for my trolling. I was wrong and very rude. Hope this can be forgotten and forgiven. I feel this had been a good lesson for me. Thanks 4 showing me the error of my ways."
The 59-year-old has been one of the most outspoken voices on trolls, condemning their behaviour as "vile playground bullying" and "generic, violent misogyny" after an appearance on BBC Question Time last year led to a torrent of vile sexual taunts and abuse directed at her on social media.
Beard told the New Yorker she had taken a similarly benevolent approach with another internet abuser who called her evil following her Question Time appearance. After an exchange of emails she discovered the troll was in fact upset about a problem with his healthcare. Beard then stepped in to lend assistance to him.
She said: "It took two minutes on Google to discover the reciprocal healthcare agreement, so I sent it to him. Now when I have a bit of internet trouble, I get an email from him saying: 'Mary, are you all right? I was worried about you.'"
Beard said she had also received an apology for another man who had doctored an image of her with genitalia on her face, who then revealed himself to be a married father of two. He had sent her a letter, she said, that described "how he should never have done it, in a way that was very eloquent".
Describing her constructive approach, Beard said she did not simply want to be perceived as a "long-suffering female parent" scolding her errant teenager, adding: "If being a decent soul is being maternal, then fine. I'll call it human."
A 2013 report from the organisation Working to Halt Abuse Online revealed that 72.5% of people who reported being abused on the internet in the last decade have been female. Speaking to the Guardian last year, Beard said that the ongoing trend of online harassment directed at women was nothing more than "misogyny, but it is also alienation and resentment, understandably, about the voice and the right to speak".
She added: "The web is democratising and also the voice of people who don't think they have another outlet. And that voice can be punitive."
On her personal blog, A Don's Life, which she has kept since 2006, Beard expressed further concerns on the destructive nature of internet trolling, adding: "It would be quite enough to put many women off appearing in public, contributing to political debate."
Charles Leadbeater, a former policy adviser to the Labour government, recently advocated a prize in the classicist's name to recognise those who tackled such online misogyny. "I'd love to create something like the Mary Beard prize for women online to support people who are supporting women to be able to use the internet safely," he said.
A judge has called for a review of security on internet dating websites after handing a life sentence to a "devious and manipulative" serial rapist who attacked seven women he met via Match.com.
Judge Gregory Dickinson QC ordered Jason Lawrance to serve at least 12 years and six months before the Parole Board can even consider his release.
The judge told Lawrance, 50, he had reached the "dreadful conclusion that you enjoy raping women" and that he would rape again if he was at liberty.
Lawrance, a father of three, contacted thousands of women online and committed three sex attacks months after getting married to someone he met via the site.
Four of Dickinson's victims had contacted Match.com to report him as a rapist, but the website did not remove his profile or bar him and did not pass the information on to police.
The judge suggested a centralised helpline for women to report date rape attacks by people they meet on lonely hearts websites.
“Is there any form of supervision on the use of dating sites? I would like to see if lessons can be learned from the use of such sites" Judge Gregory Dickinson QC
He said: "The seriousness of this case provides both the need and the opportunity to learn something and to take steps to increase protection for others in the future.
"It does seem to me that, in this age of easy access to data and records, there should be a system which allows one authority to be a central point of contact for any complaint of this nature.
"Most if not all of the victims had not tried to hide from their families and friends that they were on a dating site - they had told them that they were meeting the defendant.
"It does seem to me consideration should be given to a system of automatic referral to the police or some other central agency of any complaint that is made."
Judge Dickinson told the court - in which none of the victims was present - that no one person or organisation had been in a position to "join the dots" or have an overview of the complaints made to the website.
The court had earlier heard that Match.com told one woman it could not remove Lawrance's profile because he had not breached its terms and conditions. He had tricked women into contacting him from private email accounts to ensure he left no trace of his crimes on the website.
The 50-year-old, of Liphook, Hampshire, was convicted of raping five women and was also found guilty of attempting to rape and sexually assault two other women after chatting to them online.
Sentencing Lawrance for the attacks between June 2011 and November 2014, Judge Dickinson said: "I am convinced that you are devious, manipulative and highly dangerous to women.
"In my judgment these offences taken together - so many victims, the trail of terror and agony for which you are responsible - mean that the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for life is fully justified."
"Given the chance, you will rape again. I do not know when it may be safe to release you into the community." Judge Gregory Dickinson QC
After stressing that the minimum term equated only to the earliest stage at which Lawrance could be considered for release, Judge Dickinson told the self-employed builder: "I am compelled to the dreadful conclusion that you enjoyed raping women.
"After these terrible crimes you acted as if nothing had happened.
"You have shown no remorse - zero appreciation of the seriousness of these offences - for the pain you have inflicted on these ladies, their families and their friends.
"Your aim was to get (the victims) into a compromising situation and then to do whatever you liked to them - anticipating that they would be too frightened or embarrassed to make a complaint, or that they would not be believed if they did come forward.
"Given the chance, you will rape again. I do not know when it may be safe to release you into the community."
Rapist map
Lawrance attacked women in Crick, Northants; Lincolnshire; Buxton, Derbys; St Ives, Cambs; twice in Leicestershire and finally another attack in Derbyshire.
Judge Dickinson also read out a series of victim impact statements from the women - aged between 40 and 59 - who were targeted by Lawrance.
His first victim, who was raped in the back of Lawrance's van in a field in Northants in June 2011, said: "Since this happened I have not been able to enter into any form of relationship with a man. I met someone recently but when he went to hug me at the end of the night I freaked out."
The second woman attacked by Lawrance, a Lincolnshire single mother, said she had been forced to quit her job and move home 'far away' after he attempted to rape her in her own bed.
• Match.com refused to block alleged rapist from using the site
She said: "I could not face going back in my bedroom. I could not settle in that house, and slept on the sofa. I've been left anxious and uneasy. I still find meeting men hard as I'm apprehensive, and my guard automatically goes up.
"I have flashbacks and panic attacks about him lying on top of me and suffocating me."
"I feel worthless and ashamed at what he did to me. I honestly thought I was going to die." A 44-year-old woman raped by Jason Lawrance
Lawrance's third victim, a 52-year-old company director who was raped in her own home in Buxton, Derbys, said: "I keep waking up in the night thinking I have heard the doorbell ring. I no longer trust anyone, mainly men, but also females as well. I would like a long-term partner but have lost all enthusiasm for meeting anyone."
Lawrance's next rape victim was a 44-year-old woman he forced himself on in a hotel in St Ives, Cambs, in October 2014, tying her up with her own tights.
In her statement, she told how she constantly felt "vulnerable, scared and nervous", adding: "I get shaky and scared when doing day-to-day things like walking the dog.
"I feel worthless and ashamed at what he did to me. I honestly thought I was going to die. He has destroyed my self-confidence and self-respect. I regularly burst into tears and rarely get a good night's sleep. My life changed forever after I was raped."
The following month, Lawrance violently raped a 56-year-old woman in a hotel in Rutland, leaving her with injuries. She said: "I felt shame about my daughter seeing the marks."
And Lawrance's final victim, a widow he raped in her own home after their on/off relationship ended, said: "It is difficult to put into words the effect this assault had on my life. I feel tainted and spoiled, and I'm left with a fear of being pinned down.
"My home is no longer the haven it was, with cherished memories of my late husband and children. It is now the place where I was violated by this man."
The statement of Lawrance's fourth victim, a 40-year-old singleton he sexually assaulted in a hotel car park in Leics, was not read to the court.
In summing up the statements, prosecutor Shaun Smith QC said none of the women had wanted to attend court to see Lawrance sentenced, instead wishing to "put his behind them".
He added: "Each speaks in eloquent terms of how this has affected their relationships with men, and trust in men, how they have lost self-confidence, and how they have suffered from anxiety and tearfulness.
"Some have continued to suffer fear in their own home, and fear Lawrance will come and seek them out."
Match.com said: "Having worked with the police on this case for more than a year, we welcome the jury's verdict and today's sentence.
"We are very sorry for those affected, and appalled by these terrible acts. Sadly, there is a tiny minority of people who set out to harm others.
"While this is not confined to dating sites or even the internet, those who do so should be convicted and sentenced, as has happened in this case.
"Our members' safety is our highest priority."
Match.com added that it was committed to working with the dating industry as a whole to raise standards and ensure the best possible protection and support for its users.
Movies have a way of mirroring reality. They are cultural products, even if written by a single person. Our creative mind is formed and shaped in the reality we live. With that in mind, I have been thinking about the guys who wear red shirts on Star Trek episodes. In popular lore, they are the ones who are expendable. They show up in a single episode, maybe beam down to a planet's surface with Spock or Kirk. And, you just know that at least one of them is never beaming back up.
That stands in stark contrast to the main characters. You can remove Spock's brain, put it in a machine, and he'll have it back before the episode ends. Heck, in the movie versions, you can kill him and he still comes back! Spock does not wear a red shirt.
Who are the Red Shirt people? They are the people on the periphery. They are not the stars or principal actors. Red Shirt people are stage props. You'll probably never know their names. In terms of the story, their identities have no necessity or meaning. And that is very significant.
We imagine ourselves to be the stars in our own drama (we do not wear the red shirt). But we live in a culture where everyone is somebody else's Red Shirt. Perhaps there are a privileged few, those whose names show up regularly in the news feed, those whose lives and opinions are supposed to be so important that we must notice them. But today's star is probably only a few steps away from the red shirt.
The difficulty in our culture is that a large number of Red Shirts is always factored in. When we read the number of the unemployed or the number who have no medical insurance, it is a number. Red Shirts can be counted. The media like to do “human interest stories,” when they treat Red Shirts as though they were stars, for a couple of minutes. When the story is over, they'll be lying face down dead, unable to beam back up to the Enterprise. Red Shirts.
The narrative of Star Trek (its treatment of characters) is quite common in our entertainment media. It is, tragically, rooted in the larger narrative of our culture as well. That narrative is bound up with hard work, success, and good luck. We are largely satisfied with a cultural narrative that treats losers (the lazy, unsuccessful, unfortunate) as worthy of less interest than others.
In an odd similarity, our cultural religions tend to run in the same direction. Americans are saved as individuals. Individuals are responsible to have made the right religious choice and found gainful hope of the Kingdom of Heaven. Sadly, we admit that there are many Red Shirts: they will never be beamed up.
Charles Taylor, in his magisterial Sources of the Self, noted that with the coming of the Reformation, the Church is no longer the ship of salvation, but rather a collection of rowboats.
Salvation as a collective reality (in which there are no red shirts) has lost a place in the popular imagination.
However, the faith teaches an infinite value to each soul (“the least of these”). St. Maximos the Confessor describes human beings as a “Microcosm,” that is, an incarnate reality that contains within itself the entire cosmos. And we are more than a microcosm; we are a communion of microcosms, worlds within worlds, in which the life of one is the life of all.
It has been said somewhere, “No one is saved alone. If we fall, we fall alone, but no one is saved alone.” It is possible to err in both directions in these thoughts. The individual has value and a unique role in his own life. But we are not merely, or purely individual. This is precisely the case when viewed from the angle of salvation itself. In the New Testament, salvation is incorporation, a joining into the Body of Christ.
I once encountered a woman whose son was being brought to the Church by his grandmother for Baptism. The mother was from an Evangelical background. She was willing, she said, for her son to be Baptized, but not to “join the Church.” The two were very distinct things in her mind. That conversation became an extended opportunity for teaching.
We are a culture that is comfortable with its many Red Shirts – community is time-consuming and requires an extension of the self that we have come to dislike. True Christianity raises the matter of community (communion) to an actual mode of existence. It is more than a mere moral activity – it is a manner of being.
Of course, our culture was founded and built on individualistic notions. It has always had an underclass of Red Shirts, and may very well have more now than at any time in its history. It is not given to us to change the culture (that remains a matter of God's providence). But the Christian life must, in this respect, separate itself from the norms of its culture. Mutual responsibility, shared existence, and true communion are the only form in which salvation is given to us. No one is saved alone.
Scotty, beam us all up.

NOT one of the 19,000 homes in Gaza destroyed during last summer's war with Israel has been rebuilt. Six months after would-be donors pledged to raise $3.5 billion, the situation is bleak. Barely a quarter of the promised cash has arrived (see chart). Around 100,000 of Gaza's 1.8m people remain homeless after families spent a rainy winter in tents, trailers and amid the rubble.

The main reason is that Israel's government lets Gazans import only a fraction of the cement they need, arguing that it can be used for military purposes—and for building tunnels. * Israel blames Palestinian infighting for preventing implementation of a mechanism to import building materials under the control of the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the West Bank. European, Arab and UN officials agree the bickering has delayed reconstruction. So what little Gazans get is on the black market. “It's like cement is a radioactive material,” says Naji Yusuf Sarhan, Gaza's deputy minister of housing.
The UN is supervising the flow of material. Just one tightly controlled crossing from Israel into Gaza allows commercial goods. Only a tenth of the 5m tonnes of materials required has so far been let in, says the UN. At this rate, it would take 20 years to rebuild the territory, says Mr Sarhan. To buy on the black market you need a lot of cash. Most Gazans are poor. Half have no job.
Omar Fayyad worries that his four-storey house in Beit Hanoun, a town on the northern edge of the strip, may collapse and bury his family. An Israeli shell landed next door, so the columns supporting it are buckling. “We've received nothing: no money, no materials, no cement, no iron, nothing,” he says. He has rigged up a pulley system to clear the debris, moving slabs of concrete and twisted metal into a sewage-filled pit nearby, hoping to sell the material.
Israel has blockaded Gaza since 2007, when Hamas, the Palestinians' Islamist movement, took over after winning an election and violently forcing out its rival, the nationalist Fatah group. More recently Egypt's government, which in 2013 ousted a short-lived Islamist one at home that was friendly to Hamas, has imposed even tighter restrictions. This year the main crossing between Gaza and Egypt, at Rafah, has been open for just five days.
Robert Serry, the UN's outgoing envoy to the Palestinian territories, has proposed a five-year truce to provide for Israel's siege to be lifted if Hamas disavows violence. Not everyone likes the idea. “It's like morphine to pacify the people,” says Khaled al-Batsh of Islamic Jihad, which is even more militant than Hamas. But a senior Hamas man says Mr Serry's idea is being considered. Three wars in six years have not helped Hamas, except by showing Israelis that Hamas cannot be wished away.
If a truce were to hold, Hamas would first have to settle its differences with Fatah. The two groups agreed on a unity government last April, but it never really got going. Hamas still controls security forces in Gaza, whereas the Palestinian Authority, which is dominated by Fatah, the bigger part of a would-be Palestinian state, refuses to pay salaries for civil servants in Gaza. Rami Hamdallah, the Palestinian prime minister, has made only three brief trips there since June, accomplishing little.
A recent downpour flooded Gaza's roads and makeshift shelters. Traders in the market in Shati, a crowded waterfront refugee camp, idle over cups of tea. Customers are few. Many shopkeepers earn too little to pay the rent. To provide food for a family is a big achievement, says Abu Rizzaq, a baker. “It's all we can hope for. There is no future.”
* This article has been amended to include the fact that reconstruction is being hampered by Palestinian factional rivalry.
Religious items associated with Jesus and the Saints are housed in churches across the globe
Every year, tens of thousands of faithful Christians travel to see the cherished relics of Jesus and the saints. These artifacts are up to 2,000 years old, and are housed and revered across Christendom, from Rome to the Holy Land.
Here are some of the most iconic relics to inspire your own pilgrimage.
Scourging Pillars of Saints Peter and Paul — Photo courtesy of Kenneth Nowell
Scourging Pillars of Saints Peter and Paul
When in Rome, don't miss the Scourging Pillars. Displayed on each side of the altar of Santa Maria in Traspontina, these partial pillars are said to be those to which Peter and Paul were bound and scourged before they were killed. Located close to St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City, you can easily see both in one day. The current church structure was built in 1566.
Head of St. John the Baptist
The Bible says that St. John the Baptist, the forerunner to Jesus Christ, was beheaded by King Herod, and Rome's San Sylvestro in Capite claims to have his head. Today, the church displays this crowned head on an altar built by Michelangelo within a gold and silver bejeweled reliquary.
Other churches dispute the head's authenticity and claim they have the true head - although Pope Benedict XVI did tacitly endorse San Sylvestro in Capite's relic's authenticity.

St. Paul's Chains
At San Paolo Fuori Le Mura (St. Paul Outside the Walls) you can see the chains that bound St. Paul before his martyrdom. They are publicly visible, encased above his sarcophagus. The church is one of the four major papal churches in Rome, and was originally built in 324 by order of Emperor Constantine. It burned in 1823, but was rebuilt as it stands today.
Beheading Column of St. Paul
San Paolo alle Tre Fontane, located in the outskirts of Rome, is built on the actual site of St. Paul's martyrdom where he was decapitated. According to Nowell in Rome and the Vatican, when he was decapitated, his head bounced three times. From those spots, springs began to flow, which visitors can see from behind metal grates in the church. Inside, ancient stone pavers that St. Paul would have walked are preserved, as is the base of the column on which he was beheaded.

Shroud of Turin
Thought by many to be the burial shroud of Jesus Christ, the Shroud of Turin is a linen sheet, which bears a striking, ghostly image of a man. The shroud has been kept in Turin since the 16th century and is now in the custody of the Vatican. It is not generally viewable by the public and is only available for viewing during expositions set by the Vatican.
"The shroud draws our attention to the tormented face and body of Jesus and, at the same time, directs our attention toward the face of every suffering and unjustly persecuted person," said Pope Francis during a public exposition in June 2015.
St. Thomas' Finger
The Bible says that St. Thomas, for whom the modern phrase "doubting Thomas" refers, doubted Jesus' resurrection until Jesus allowed him to actually stick his finger into his wounds.
The Basilica of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, located in Rome, claims to have one of Thomas' fingers, perhaps the very one that touched the resurrected Jesus. The church also houses a fragment of Jesus' cross found by St. Helen in Jerusalem, a nail used in his crucifixion and two thorns from the Crown of Thorns.
Jesus' Crown of Thorns
The famous Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris houses several relics from Jesus' passion, including the Crown of Thorns placed upon his head, as well as a piece of Jesus' cross and a nail used in the crucifixion.
The Cathedral notes that despite numerous studies and research, the crown's authenticity cannot be certified, though it has been revered for more than 16 centuries.
The crown is made of canes bound with gold threads, which once held the thorns. It is on public display the first Friday of each month and on every Friday during Lent.

Incorrupt Bodies
The Catholic Church declares as miracles the lack of decomposition experienced by many bodies of those considered to be saints. Such "incorrupt" bodies either entirely or partially lack decay, some in part preserved with wax.
One example is Blessed Anna Maria Taigi, whose remains are displayed at San Crisogono Church in Rome.
Other incorrupt saints include St. Catherine of Bologna, St. Francis, St. Bernadette and St. John Vianney.
Scourging Column of Jesus Christ
St. Helena, the mother of Roman Emperor Constantine, who made Christianity legal in the Roman Empire, is credited with saving and bringing many Christian relics from the Holy Land to Rome in the 300s.
A fragment of the marble scourging pillar of Jesus Christ is one such item and is kept in Santa Prassede Basilica in Rome where it has been housed since 1223.
The Byzantine church is also the burial site of some 2,000 saints, including two early church saints who were sisters, Saints Prasede and Pudentiana, and was a popular pilgrimage stop in the Middle Ages.

Burial Slab of Jesus Christ
In Jerusalem, tourists flock to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, built on the site where St. Helen is said to have discovered Jesus' cross. Christians thus revere the church as the site of his crucifixion.
According to the Israel Ministry of Tourism, Jesus' tomb was on the site, though it was largely destroyed in 1009. There are now just a few surviving portions, concealed from public view. Also inside is a slab, on which Christian tradition says Jesus' body was prepared for burial, as well as the cave tomb of Joseph of Aramathea.
You don't have to read many Arsene Wenger interviews to recognise his constant emphasis on the collective of football. His most devoted students, such as Robert Pires, Thierry Henry and Cesc Fabregas, have all been inherently unselfish players, noted as much for their goal provision as their goal scoring. Yet it's not just an emotional bond the manager seeks to foster. Good football teams are all about chemistry, the right blend of qualities working in concert.
You won't win the league title with eleven Ray Parlours but you also won't win one with eleven Thierry Henrys either. In an age where people are as married to their opinions as they are their football teams, the temptation is to identify individual players and isolate them when a team is playing badly. Especially if we've previously insinuated that we've always suspected that they're bobbins. It's entirely possible and even probable that every team has its weak links. Yet more often than not, form, be it good, bad or indifferent, is usually a result of how the collective is functioning.
Injuries are a prolific frustration for an Arsenal fan nowadays. Yet much of the Gunners current woes lie not just in how many injuries they have to key players, but also in the types of player that they have missing. (I'm not suggesting that our poor form of late is entirely attributable to the treatment room. I wouldn't expect our U-21s to lose by some of the score lines we have suffered this season). The manager suggests there is an issue of confidence at the moment, which I think is plain to see.
Yet it's not just hearts and minds that are wavering. To embrace colloquial football parlance, Arsenal's “legs have gone.” That's not (just) to say that our dwindling collection of healthy footballers are gripped by fatigue, but all of the players that give the team energy, movement and purpose have all been simultaneously unavailable. This has led to Arsenal looking one paced, predictable and easy to nullify.
Everton and Chelsea were able to press Arsenal high and harry them in possession safe in the knowledge that nobody would run into the space behind them. It's not just that Arsenal have had key players unavailable, but the ones we do have relied on our more kinetic players to cover their weaknesses. The reception Olivier Giroud received upon his substitution on Sunday was acidic. Mikel Arteta has also begun to feel the wrath of Arsenal fans too.
Whilst Arsenal could certainly improve on Olivier Giroud as a first choice striker, I think it's fairly well documented that without the likes of Walcott and Ramsey around him, his attributes are rendered impotent. Likewise, the complaints abound about Arteta, that he's too slow, that his legs are creaking and that he's too cautious with the ball.
I would argue that he's no slower, or less adventurous than Gilberto Silva, or Claude Makelele or Didier Deschamps or Dunga or many other screening midfielders you can name. Gilberto had Vieira or Parlour partnering him, Alonso had Mascherano, Makelele had Essien and so forth. Almost every player on the planet has weak points which need to be veiled by the qualities of his teammates. Without Ramsey or Wilshere, or even Koscielny in the back four, Arteta's lack of mobility is much starker. It's for this reason that Gilberto and Edu were hardly ever partnered together in the heart of midfield in the Invincibles side.
This at least partially explains why Santi Cazorla has looked rather average in recent weeks. He too isn't hugely mobile. He opens up the pitch with his technique and he wanders into space, but he doesn't pull defences around with his alacrity. Cazorla provides the conditions for others that like to do so. Rosicky has become such an important player for us of late because he possesses this kind of vitality. Unfortunately, his briskness troubles opposing midfielders more than it does defenders.
On Sunday, Arsenal's back four was robbed of Gibbs and Koscielny too, with Vermaelen and Monreal deputising. This made Arsenal's defence less portable. Basically Arsenal's weaknesses are a neon welcome sign for opposing teams at the moment because we are missing the qualities to offset those weaknesses. Losing Özil, who is good enough to shoulder the creative burden alone, was the stray pube in Arsenal's shit sandwich. I submit the situation would be much the same if we were to reverse the injury situation and peer into an alternate universe.
If, for instance, Arteta, Mertesacker, Giroud, Podolski and Cazorla were injured, a team containing the blue arsed fly qualities of Ramsey, Wilshere, Koscielny, Sanogo and Walcott without the disciplined, more positional presence of the likes of Arteta, Mertesacker and Giroud would be pulled apart due to its impetuousness. A big part of Arsenal's issue at the moment is that there's a touch too much valium and not enough amphetamine. But the reverse formula would probably be just as damaging.
For these reasons it is quite baffling that Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain did not start at Goodison on Sunday on the right hand side. Especially given what we know about the attacking vigour of Everton's full backs. The Toffees were able to harangue Sagna and Monreal and Wenger actually aided that strategy by playing a pair of wingers in Cazorla and Podolski that rarely offer the full backs a passing option. Martinez slit Arsenal's throat, but Wenger handed him the knife.
The manager spoke after the game about “going back to basics” and it will be interesting to see if he reverts to the more cautious approach favoured at the end of last season. Arsenal urgently need to get over the line now and achieve their two glaring targets, Champions League qualification and winning the F.A. Cup. I do wonder if we'll make a conscious attempt to having men behind the ball and becoming hard to beat as a first priority as we did last spring.
The glamour of the F.A. Cup may have faded over the years, but I cannot think of a year in my lifetime when it was so central to Arsenal's ambitions. In 2003 and 2005, when we were truly spoiled, it felt like a consolation prize having finished second in the Premier League. In 2002 and 1998 the cup formed part of a ‘Double' and therefore was not really recognised in its individual right. In 1993, we had already attained the league cup going into the F.A. Cup final against Sheffield Wednesday.
Even in 1980, Arsenal played a F.A. Cup Final and a Cup Winners Cup Final in the same week. So the domestic pot formed part of a dual storyline. You probably have to go back to 1979 for the last time the old trophy was this central to an Arsenal season. The Gunners must reconnect with their self belief; they've beaten Spurs, Liverpool and Everton to get to the semi final. They're not there by felicity. Saturday ought to be viewed as an opportunity to relish rather than an itch to be scratched. LD.

GNU Global is pretty cool as an Emacs tagging tool. However, its gtags.el package integrating GNU Global inside Emacs doesn't support cycling through multiple tag results. I whipped up some Elisp to do the trick. It supports cycling all kinds of GTAGS result: tag, rtag, symbol, etc. Here's in my .emacs file.
( require ' gtags ) ( defun ww-next-gtag () "Find next matching tag, for GTAGS." (interactive) ( let ((latest-gtags-buffer (car (delq nil (mapcar ( lambda (x) (and (string-match "GTAGS SELECT" (buffer-name x)) (buffer-name x)) ) (buffer-list)) )))) ( cond (latest-gtags-buffer (switch-to-buffer latest-gtags-buffer) (forward-line) (gtags-select-it nil)) ) ))
Here's my key binding for using GNU Global.
(global-set-key "\M- 'ww-next-gtag) ;; M-; cycles to next result, after doing M-. C-M-. or C-M-, (global-set-key "\M-." 'gtags-find-tag) (global-set-key [(control meta .)] 'gtags-find-rtag) (global-set-key [(control meta \,)] 'gtags-find-symbol)

Many homeowners may not see the importance of having a sump pump simply because their basement has never been flooded; they believe that purchasing a sump pump is wasting their money. The ugly truth is that if you own a home and it has a basement, it is best to have a sump pump for your basement before the need arises. Prevention is always better.
These pumps save many property owners many bucks by protecting the basement and, later, the home, the furnace, perhaps the laundry and some stored equipment. Almost every person with a home that has a basement, whether it's a basement or a crawling space, requires a sump pump. Besides relieving flooding, these pumps also assist in keeping the basement moisture at a low level, reducing the risk of mold building up in your basement. Basements that are wet tend to be a fertile ground for other issues, such as cracked floors, rust, cracked floors, and peeling paint.
Currently, the installation of the sump pumps includes a battery backup system for homeowners with sump pumps that use electricity. Contractors will always explain the reason for this back-up system. The most important is the loss of energy that can have disastrous consequences. Even in a basement that is flooded, the backup system continues to operate with the ability to pump water from your building for some time without power.
Before you make your mind to go for a sump pump, you have to be sure about the size of the pump pit. A good number of homes always have the pit where the sump will be installed in place. So the first thing to do if you don't have a sump pit is to have somebody dig for you if you cannot do it yourself.
After you have dug next is to establish the pit diameter. If the size of the width is not more than fourteen inches, then you can opt for a sump that uses a diaphragm switch or a mechanical float. On the other hand, if your sump pit diameter is more than fourteen inches you can go for either tethered or automatic switches,
In the market, there are various types of high-quality sump pumps you can choose from No matter the brand or the quality you purchase the fact remains that your basement is well protected from flooding. Like any other machine or equipment sump pumps also need to be well maintained for maximum performance. Service your sump pump at least once a year. Engage the float manually in checking if the motor is functioning properly and remove water or any dirt that may have collected in the pit or around the switch and float.ln case of those pumps run by batteries always make sure they are fully charged because you never knew when thunder would strike.
If homeowners took good care of their sump pumps as is always the case with their vehicles, they could save themselves from stress and money. Restoring your home after water damage is not an easy task. Preventing the problem by regularly checking the state of their sump pumps should be on their spring to-do list annually.

While reviewing new Android reverse engineering questions on Stack Overflow, I came across this request to decompile an .xapk . A brief, non-technical description of the format is described on APKPure's website:
XAPK is a brand-new file format standard for Android APK package file. Contains all APK package and obb cache asset file to keep Android games or apps working, it always ends in “.xapk”. To ensure games, applications run perfectly, APK Install one click install makes it easy for Android users directly install .apk, .xapk file to the root directory.
obb cache data?
The “OBB cache files” are usually pretty big for games and include all of the assets like maps, models, images, music, whatever.
Ok, so it looks like we have a new APK format specifically designed for games and it comes with its own installer. Since there's an installer, that might mean the actual .apk is encrypted and embedded in the OBB. Maybe there's some metadata in the .xapk that tells the installer how to look up the decryption key from their servers? Maybe I'll need to search for the ZIP magic bytes and carve out the .apk ?
Nope. The original .apk is at the root of the .xapk archive. EASY. (read: boring) Shit, I was looking for a challenge!
I downloaded and examined Side Lift King.
Here's the shasum:

The .xapk is just a ZIP file:
1 2 $ file Side\ Lift\ King_v2.0_apkpure.com.xapk Side Lift King_v2.0_apkpure.com.xapk: Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract
The original org.ammarz.MT.apk is just floating around:

It's not encrypted or anything.
1 2 $ file org.ammarz.MT.apk org.ammarz.MT.apk: Java archive data (JAR)
It decompiles fine with apktool:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 $ apktool d org.ammarz.MT.apk I: Using Apktool 2.0.1 on org.ammarz.MT.apk I: Loading resource table... I: Decoding AndroidManifest.xml with resources...

The manifest.json must be the file used by the installer. It must be the metadata used by the installer app. Here is a pretty formatted version:
