As protests spread from Asia, through the Middle East, to North Africa against the US decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in Brussels, seeking support of European ministers.
At a joint news conference with the EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, Netanyahu on Monday expressed their hope that “all or most” of the European states would move their embassies to Jerusalem, recognising it as the capital of Israel.
They were due to meet the EU ministers later in the day.
“Jerusalem has been the capital of Israel for the last 70 years. [US] President [Donald] Trump has put facts squarely on the table,” they said. “Peace is based on reality, peace is based on recognising the reality.”
They claimed that recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel was making “peace possible”, despite the fact that Palestinians see East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.
“Israel has extended its hand to peace to our Palestinian neighbours for a hundred years, well before there was a state of Israel and after it was established,” they also said.
They also called UN's rejection of Jerusalem as an Israeli capital “laughable”.
“There is now an effort under way to bring forward a new peace proposal by the American administration. I think we should give peace a chance,” they said.
Al Jazeera reports that the majority of the EU ministers did not support the US move.

“Netanyahu was received cordially, but behind closed doors there is the feeling that the situation is not further forward in terms of Middle East peace effort than they were before.”
“There are some EU states like the Czech Republic and Hungary who say they will follow the example of the US, but the vast majority of them think that it should not be done right now. They think that the two-state solution is the way to go.”
On their part, Mogherini said the EU would continue to respect the international consensus on Jerusalem.
“We know where the European Union stands. We believe that the only realistic solution to the conflict between Israel and Palestine is based on two states with Jerusalem as the capital of both.”
Reaction
Omar Shakir, Israel/Palestine director at the Human Rights Watch, told Al Jazeera that they did not anticipate that the EU's position would change.
“The European position has been quite clear in terms of not recognising Israeli sovereignty over occupied territory and under international law, East Jerusalem is part of the West Bank and is occupied,” they said.
Eliana Capretti, communication director at Euro-Med human rights monitor, told Al Jazeera that any discussions on a possible upgrade of relations between Israel and the EU would send a wrong message on the bloc's interest and positions on Israel and Palestine.
“Indeed, the meeting risks conveying a message of endorsement of Israel's occupation policies. To avoid that, the EU should take this occasion to firmly denounce Israel's human rights track record and clearly spell out its own position on the matter,” they said.
Officers from Penrith Local Area Command are inviting the community to come together to have a chat over a cup of coffee next week.
On Thursday, February 23, local officers will come together at 10am in an informal, neutral space to discuss community issues, build relationships and, of course, drink coffee.
Coffee with a Cop provides a unique opportunity for community members to ask questions and learn more about the police work in the Penrith region.
“We hope that community members will feel comfortable to ask questions, bring concerns, or simply get to know our officers,” Commander of Penrith Local Area Command, Superintendent Brett McFadden said.
“We are all engaged in the digital age of social media, but the face to face connection is something to be valued. These interactions are the foundation of community partnerships.”
Coffee with a Cop begins at 10am at Skipton's Café, Skipton's Arcade, 541 High Street in Penrith on Thursday, February 23. Similar events are being held right across NSW.
CHICAGO: Democrats face years of work, focussing on “kitchen table” economic issues over several election cycles, if they want to regain ground lost to Republicans, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said on Wednesday.
The Democratic mayor of the nation's third largest city also said Republican President Donald Trump's legal and political troubles give Democrats a chance to regain a large slice of the more than 1,000 seats Democrats have lost in Congress and state legislatures since 2008. With Democrats controlling cities and Republicans dominating rural areas, the battle will be fought among swing suburban voters, they added.
“It's not going to be done in a singular election,” Emanuel told Reuters in a wide-ranging, exclusive interview.
“The real crux question to me as a party is what I call kitchen table economics,” Emanuel said. Home ownership, affordable college, job security, retirement savings and health care are key issues, they said.
Chicago has faced fiscal problems and untamed street violence since Emanuel first was elected mayor in 2011. The release in 2015 of a dashcam video showing a Chicago police officer fatally shooting an unarmed teenager led to street protests that hurt the mayor's standing with voters.

Black Lives Matter sued the city Wednesday, seeking to force Emanuel to agree to federal oversight of proposed police reforms. Emanuel said the Justice Department under President Trump will not participate.
“I can't wish a different Justice Department,” Emanuel said. Instead, they are focussed on police body cameras, more training and the hiring of new cops in supervisory roles, they added.
Emanuel cited improvements under their leadership, public transportation in particular. “Eighty-five percent of our people in the city are happy with our public transportation system. In New York, I don't think you could get 85 people, let alone 85 percent,” they said, citing not-yet-published data from an annual ridership survey for the Chicago Transit Authority.
Emanuel blamed Illinois Republican Governor Bruce Rauner for gridlock that has put the state's credit rating near “junk” status and helped bring the Chicago Public Schools to the brink of insolvency.
“There is a fundamental flaw here in the inability to find a way to say, ‘Yes,'” Emanuel said.
Rauner spokesperson Eleni Demertzis said the mayor and Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan are to blame for the state's budget stalemate and “saying no at every turn.”
In national politics, Emanuel is positioned to play a role as a leader of Democratic Party efforts to recover from the 2016 electoral defeat. They have served as White House adviser to President Barack Obama and President Bill Clinton and led the 2006 mid-term campaign that returned Democrats to a majority in Congress.
With a 38 percent approval rating in a May Reuters/Ipsos poll, Trump's unpopularity figures to be a dominant issue during the 2018 mid-term elections, Emanuel said.
They declined to predict whether Trump will finish their term. “It's a parlor game right now,” they said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India on Wednesday raised the government-mandated price for summer-sown crops such as rice and cotton by the most since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014, as they look to woo millions of poor farmers ahead of a general election next year.

The country announces support prices for more than a dozen crops each year to set a benchmark. But analysts say the median hike this year was 25 percent compared with 3-4 percent in the last three years, which could hit government finances and stoke inflation.
“The government is committed to realising the vision of doubling farmers' income by 2022, towards which it is working on a comprehensive strategy,” Radha Mohan Singh, the minister for agriculture and farmers' welfare, said in a statement after a meeting of Modi's cabinet.
Rural India voted overwhelmingly for Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party four years ago to hand them the biggest mandate in 30 years. But a crash in commodity prices has meant their immense popularity in the countryside has waned over the past few months.
The government, however, said on Wednesday the latest hike in the so-called minimum support prices (MSPs) would help farmers increase their income and boost the economy.
Related Coverage Expert Views: India raises local rice purchase price by 13 percent to woo farmers
The total cost to the government would be 150 billion rupees ($2.18 billion), Home Minister Rajnath Singh, themselves a farmer, told reporters, adding that it would be wrong to say inflation would increase due to the hike.
Though the government announces MSPs for most crops, state agencies buy only rice and wheat at those prices given a lack of financial resources, limiting the benefit of higher crop prices to only 7 percent of the country's farmers.
“Should the government rely on large-scale procurement of crops to implement these prices, then the fiscal cost could be around 0.3 percent of GDP (gross domestic product), which will likely be shared by the central and state governments,” said A. Prasanna, chief economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership in Mumbai.
The government said prices paid to local farmers for common grade paddy rice will be raised by 13 percent from a year ago to 1,750 rupees ($25.50) per 100 kg for the year starting on July 1. Last year, the government raised the rice price by 5.4 percent.
“The impact from these MSP hikes will be 35 basis points to headline inflation in the current fiscal year, and another 35 bps in the next,” said Shubhada Rao, chief economist at Yes Bank.
Analysts and economists have warned the move could prompt India's central bank to raise interest rates more steeply than expected.

The 2017 Canada Summer Games have officially concluded, but not before several up-and-coming athletes amidst the emerging sports nation made their marks in the Pan Am Pool. The swimming competition took place from Monday, August 7th through Saturday, August 12th, but over the entire two-week Games over 4,000 Canadian athletes competed in over 250 events across 16 sports.
Ontario took the top province honors, while British Columbia finished in runner-up position with Quebec finishing 3rd overall.

Helping Ontario top the standings was 15-year-old swimmer Hanna Henderson of the Etobicoke Swim Club. Henderson earned an incredible 11 medals throughout the swimming competition to become the most decorated female at a Canada Summer Games. Included in their haul were golds in the 50m backstroke (29.57) and 100m backstroke events (1:03.88), as well as silver in the 100m freestyle (57.74) and 200m butterfly (2:16.51).
Joining Henderson in history-making was now-15-year-old Cole Pratt of Alberta. Having turned 15 after the meet, Pratt scored a remarkable 4 individual Canadian age group records for the 13-14 boys' category at the Pan Am Pool. They touched in 1:54.04 in the 200m freestyle for a new age group record, which wiped out an old 1:55.55 record held by Aaron Chanas-Larue since way back in 2009.
Pratt also won the 100m backstroke in a new age group record-setting effort of 56.82, a mark which scorched their own personal best and previous age record of 58.05 from just last month. Pratt's other national age group records came in the 200m fly and 200m IM, where they earned gold medals in times of 2:03.42 and 2:05.26, respectively.
All told, Pratt earned 10 swimming medals to make them the most decorated male of the Canada Summer Games. Ontario's Graysen Bernard was alongside Pratt with 10 medals as well. To their credit individually, Bernard took 50m back gold in 26.70 and 200m back gold in 2:05.19. Bernard also got the job done in the 400m IM to top the podium in a time of 4:30.05. They also earned individual silvers in the 100m back and 200m IM event, while also taking bronze in the 100m butterfly.
Meet Results
Chennai: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) seized Rs.48 crore worth of properties belonging to Kanishk Gold Pvt Ltd under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act on Tuesday.
In a statement, ED said the action came on the reasonable belief that the land, buildings, plant and machinery, valued at Rs 48 crore, available at the company's factory premies are related to the crime.
The jewellery company is alleged to have indulged in offences of forgery, cheating and criminal conspiracy against banking consortium led by State Bank of India (SBI). The SBI has loged a complaint with the Central Bureau of Investigation and an FIR has been lodged.
It is alleged that Kanishk Gold secured credit facilities from banks after providing fudged stock statements with the help of chartered accountants. The total loss caused to the banks due to the above fraud works out to the tune of Rs 824 crore, outstanding as on December 31, 2017, the ED said.
“During Investigations under PMLA, 2002 falsification of records was admitted and it was stated that the stock gap between the actual and reported to banks has risen to 3,000 kg of gold by 2017,” the statement said.

BAGHDAD: French President Francois Hollande arrived in Baghdad Monday (Jan 2) to meet the French forces helping Iraq in the fight against the Islamic State group and to hold talks with top officials.
Hollande had already visited in 2014 and remains the most prominent head of state to come to Iraq since the launch two and half years ago of a US-led coalition against the militants.
The French president, who is travelling with Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, will also stop in the autonomous northern region of Kurdistan during their one-day visit.
France is the second contributor to the US-led coalition that has carried out thousands of air strikes against IS in Iraq and Syria and provided military equipment, training and advice to Iraqi forces.
Iraqi forces completely collapsed when IS jihadists took over second city Mosul in June 2014 and swept across much of the country's Sunni Arab heartland.
The jihadists then gained more territory in August 2014, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to flee from areas that had been controlled by the Kurdish peshmerga forces.
Since it joined the United States in the coalition in September 2014, French aircraft have conducted 5,700 sorties, around 1,000 strikes and destroyed more than 1,700 targets, according to defence ministry figures.
France has 14 Rafale fighter jets that are stationed in Jordan and the United Arab Emirates and taking part in coalition operations.
It also has 500 soldiers training and advising elite Iraqi forces and CAESAR artillery vehicles stationed south of Mosul to provide support for ongoing operations to retake the city.
Australia, Italy and Britain are also part of the 60-member coalition supporting Iraq's efforts against IS.

The Philippines on Monday suspended the accreditation and operation of Uber for one month, in a decision that followed a government crackdown on unregistered drivers offering app-based ride-hailing services.
MANILA: The Philippines on Monday suspended the accreditation and operation of Uber for one month, in a decision that followed a government crackdown on unregistered drivers offering app-based ride-hailing services.
The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) did not give a reason for its decision, which came amid regulatory disputes with Uber and rival Grab that have prompted investigations by both chambers of Philippine Congress.
The LTFRB issued an advisory saying its board has also "strongly recommended" that Uber extend financial assistance to accredited operators while it is under suspension.
The regulator said transport law enforcers have already been furnished copies of its order.
Extending financial assistance will be "an expression of good faith as their accredited peer-operators would not have suffered the current predicament were it not for the predatory actions of respondent Uber," the LTFRB said.
A company spokesperson said Uber was "studying the order".

The Southeast Asian nation was the first country to regulate app-based car-hailing operations after drawing up rules in 2015.
Last year the LTFRB suspended the acceptance and processing of applications for all ride-sharing services, including Uber and Grab, to study further how to regulate the industry.
But both Uber and Grab said they continued to accept new drivers amid strong demand for the service, resulting in a surge in the number of unregistered drivers.

Students say enough to gun violence, stage school walkouts across US, world
A 9-year-old Mississippi boy shot their 13-year-old sister to death after getting into an argument over a video game controller, officials said, as more people raise their voice against gun violence and urge U.S. authorities to take action for stricter gun control laws amid mass shootings at schools and other gun-related incidents.
The incident took place in Monroe County, Mississippi, when the boy retrieved a gun from their parents' bedroom while their mother was preparing lunch in the kitchen, according to the county sheriff.
The gun was reportedly stored in a nightstand in the bedroom, allowing the child to easily gain access to it and shoot their sister in the back of the head.
Their sister was immediately taken to Le Bonheur Children's Hospital, but succumbed to their injuries and was pronounced dead.
Authorities are still investigating the case and have not filed charges against the boy yet, reports said.
At least 40 children are shot by guns in the U.S. and at least seven of these are killed in such incidents according to statistics.

The Centre on Tuesday informed the Supreme Court that there was a provision in law that penalises selling of packaged drinking water above its maximum retail price (MRP). The law also proposes a jail term for the habitual offending restaurants or by similar entities or individuals. The government while backing its argument says charging more than MRP is against consumer interests and it also results in evasion of tax, according to News18.
"Sale of packaged water over MRP by hotels and restaurants may have implications regarding tax evasion as a bottle purchased by a hotel at cost price, which should be sold at MRP or less, is being sold at much higher prices, leading to possible loss of additional revenue to the government in the form of service tax or excise duty etc.," said the government.
The Ministry of Consumer Affairs which was representing the government in the apex court filed its response to the petition brought in by the Federation of Hotels and Restaurants Association of India. According to the ministry, the Legal Metrology Act bars overcharging for packaged mineral water and also recommends monetary fine or a jail term for first offence.
Section 36 of the LMA clearly says anyone found selling, distributing or delivering any pre-packaged commodity not in conformity to the declarations on the package shall be punished with fine of up to Rs 25,000 for the first offence. The monetary penalty can go up to Rs 50,000 for second offence and can further rise to Rs 1 lakh and a year's jail term if the violation occurs yet again.
Tuesday's affidavit by the central government comes in response to the petition filed by the hotels association of India that had challenged a 2015 Delhi High Court order upholding statutory provisions with regard to packaged drinking water.
SAN DIEGO (AP) — Pinch-hitter Hunter Renfroe's infield single in the ninth inning led to two runs when third baseman Miguel Rojas followed with a throwing error, lifting the San Diego Padres to a 3-2 victory over the Miami Marlins on Wednesday night.
Closer Brad Ziegler (0-5) coughed up a one-run lead when they loaded the bases with one out. Renfroe hit a chopper to Rojas, who was charging. They double-clutched their throw, which was low to first baseman Justin Bour. When the ball skipped away from Bour, Freddy Galvis came home with the winning run.
Matt Strahm (1-2) got the win for working the final two innings.
The Marlins lost for the 14th straight start by Jose Urena, a franchise record, which included 12 from this year. The right-hander entered the game receiving 2.84 runs per game, the third-lowest average in the majors, and got more measly support Wednesday.
Urena got just two runs on Starlin Castro's homer before departing after six innings following a strong performance. They surrendered a run, three hits and two walks. They struck out six in a 93-pitch effort.
Reliever Drew Steckenrider gave up a two-out double to Manuel Margot in the seventh but got pinch-hitter Jose Pirela looking on a 95-mph fastball to strand the tying run.
Clayton Richard had won two of their last three starts and was relying on their slider in inducing the Marlins into harmlessly pounding the ball into 14 groundouts. The left-hander exited after seven innings of two-run ball. They allowed four hits and a walk, with five strikeouts.
Richard wiggled out of a jam after hitting Lewis Brinson to start the fifth and allowing JT Riddle's single.
But when Urena tried to sacrifice, catcher Raffy Lopez made a fine play, pouncing on Urena's bunt and retiring Brinson at third to change the inning. With two outs, J.T Realmuto walked to load the bases but Richard got Castro on a grounder to end the threat.
Franmil Reyes continued their hot streak with their third home run in three days, pulling the Padres to 2-1 in the fourth inning. The rookie right fielder took a high fastball the opposite way, their fourth homer in six games clanging off the right-field foul pole. Urena had sat down eight straight before Reyes' blast.
Richard retired the first 10 batters they faced. Then Realmuto singled up the middle and Castro hit their third home run of the season, a two-run, fourth-inning shot that landed 423 feet away in the Padres' bullpen over the fence in left-center.

Padres: RHP Jordan Lyles (1-1, 3.83) makes their fifth start of the season, which matches their total from the previous two years. They worked the second-longest perfect game in Padres history on May 15, blanking the Rockies for 7 1/3 innings.

The Lagos State chapter of the Progressives Congress (APC) on Tuesday banned members who had spent a minimum of eight years as ward, council and state executive members from seeking re-election in its May congresses.
The National Leader of the party, Bola Tinubu, announced the ban in Ikeja while addressing party members at a stakeholders meeting.
They said the decision was to allow fresh people to occupy party offices at ward, local government and state levels with a view to taking the APC to the next level in the state.
The national leadership of the party had recently fixed May 2, 5, 9 and 14 for ward, local government, state and national congresses respectively.
The decision of the party to allow congresses followed appeals by President Muhammadu Buhari who had opposed the approval of tenure elongation for party executives at all levels.
With Tuesday's pronouncement by Mr Tinubu, the chairperson of the party in the state, Henry Ajomale, who had led the chapter for a very long period, will be unable to seek re-election.
Mr Tinubu said at the meeting: “We fought hard against tenure elongation, and now we are going to have our congresses.
“Some of you who have spent two, three, four terms as ward, local government and state executive members, it is time to go.
“We thank you, we appreciate you. But we want you to step aside. It is time for those who have been crawling for years to walk. It is time for the youths to take over.
“I mean if you have spent eight years, twelve years, you have tried. You should give us chance, let us now have new people.”
Mr Tinubu, however, said party executive members who had only spent one term were free to seek re-election, provided they did not have records of misconduct in office.
The APC leader, however, commended the affected long-serving officers of the party, saying they contributed immensely to the successes of the party in the state.
Mr Tinubu said arrangements were in top gear to conduct congresses at all levels in the state, and expressed the optimism that they would be successful.
They warned party members to abstain from violence before, during and after the congresses, saying any act of irregularities would be sanctioned by the party.
Mr Tinubu advised party members against infighting, urging them to learn to live in peace with one another for the progress of the party.
On the divisions among party members in Alimosho and Surulere areas over some issues, Mr Tinubu sued for peace, urging aggrieved members to channel their complaints to the secretariat of the party in the state for appropriate actions.
He, however, said it was wrong and premature for any member or groups to disagree over choice of candidates for the next election.
“We shouldn't be talking of who and who should be the candidate for a particular position for the general election.
“We are at the congress stage, we have not even done the primary, so disagreements over candidate choice for the election should not arise,” they said.
They congratulated the National Convention Committee on their inauguration on Monday, expressing optimism that the committee would conduct a free and fair convention.
The party chieftain said the committee members, headed by Jigawa State governor, Mohammed Badaru, were people of character and they expected nothing less from them.
Mr Tinubu thanked party members for staying with them on their last birthday, saying they were honoured by their support.
They particularly thanked President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, and Minister of Power and Housing, Babatunde Fashola for attending their birthday.
Reacting, Mr Ajomale described the decision to ban long-serving party officers as a welcome development.
They said the decision would allow young blood to take over the party leadership at all levels in the state.
The party chairperson said they were fulfilled having piloted the affairs of the party to several electoral victories in the state.
“It is a good decision that people who have been in the executive for more than eight years should quit.
“I mean, if you have spent more than eight years as party executive, you should have done whatever you need to do.
“People like us have been around since the AD days to now that we are APC, so it is time to move on. I am fulfilled, as I have done my best for the party,” they said.
Mr Ajomale said they had no fear about who would take over from him, as there were many competent people in the party who could take it to greater heights.

They said: “In January, 2016, the agriculture secretariat was hit by an outbreak of the deadly avian flu influenza.
The Agriculture and Rural Development Division of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT)'s Administration has reported the loss of over 1.5 million birds to avian Influenza.
The Acting Secretary, Agriculture and Rural Development of the FCT, Dr. Musa A. Aliyu, announced this yesterday in Abuja.He said: “In January, 2016, the agriculture secretariat was hit by an outbreak of the deadly avian flu influenza. The disease later spread to many parts of the FCT, leading to the death of over 1.5 million birds.”
As part of the measures to prevent further attacks, they added that the administration carried out the vaccination of over 20,000 livestock and birds across the six area councils of the territory.

The administration had also earmarked an estimated 274,000 hectares of land for the development of agriculture to boost food production and reduce the prices of foodstuffs in the area.
Aliyu explained that the disease could have caused more damage if the FCT Minister, Mallam Muhammad Musa Bello had not intervened.
According to him: “The administration has started an emergency sensitisation campaign against avian flu to educate and enlighten farmers, residents and other stakeholders on the prevention of further outbreak.
“The workshops were held at the FCT's six Area Councils for poultry farmers, farmworkers, veterinary officials and other stakeholders. The veterinary officials of the secretariat have routinely visited the affected farms to ascertain the level of disease's outbreak, while farms and markets were fumigated to guard against the spread.”
They urged farmers to take advantage of the 274,000 hectares of land provided by government to enable them to key into the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)'s Anchor Borrowers' Scheme.
Lucknow: A group of French tourists were assaulted with sticks by local boys in Uttar Pradesh's Mirzapur on Sunday afternoon. The women foreign tourists were allegedly molested as well.

The Allie Lake wildfire is now fully contained and the B.C. Wildfire Service is thanking the more than seven millimeters of rain Tuesday night for helping with the suppression efforts.
The Allie Lake #BCwildfire is now 100% contained, being held at 2,739 ha. Suppression efforts were aided by more than 7 mm of rain and cooler temperatures last night. An area restriction remains in place in areas surrounding the Allie Lake wildfire. Info: https://t.co/xNfcHytqAx https://t.co/rzCb1jtKyX — BC Wildfire Service (@BCGovFireInfo) May 30, 2018
The Thompson-Nicola Regional District has downgraded all evacuation orders and alerts issued due to the wildfire burning about 55 kilometres northwest of Kamloops.
Recreation sites in the Allie Lake fire area remain closed and an area restriction, limiting access to a large area around the fire, is still in place.

The Xusum Creek wildfire is still considered out of control, but wildfire crews have reached a 35 per cent containment on the blaze burning west of Lillooet, near Anderson Lake.
As of 5 p.m. on Tuesday, the Squamish-Lillooet Regional District lifted the evacuation alerts for McGillivray Recreation Retreat and properties on Highline Road.
The evacuation order for properties on Highline Road is still in effect and the road remains closed as a result.
The Tommy Lakes wildfire, burning north of Fort St. John and estimated to be 22,659 hectares, is 10 per cent contained.
Evacuation orders and alerts issued by the Peace River Regional District due to this fire are still in place.

Wildfires officials say there has been little growth on the fire on Wednesday, adding calmer winds and cooler temperatures helped the fire suppression efforts.
The B.C. Wildfire Service is advising people in the Fort St. John area they may smell smoke from the Tommy Lakes fire and smoke may be visible to the public in the vicinity of the fire.
WATCH: Aired May 28: Summer has not arrived yet but several evacuation orders and alerts remain in place as B.C. crews try to contain major wildfires burning in the province. Geoff Hastings has the latest.
WINNIPEG — There's no shame in losing to the surging Winnipeg Jets. They may be the best team in the Western Conference.
Still, the Canucks looked like a shell of their former selves, and that's mostly because they are.
Lacking a string of their best players, the Canucks were skated out of the rink. It was their third game without Bo Horvat and they've lost them all.
This one was a 5-1 death spiral, and it was the Jets' supporting cast who did most of the damage as they registered their third consecutive win.
This is what we learned:
Brock Boeser can snipe
The question is no longer which line should Boeser play on? It's now: How many lines?
All of them? Is that possible? And both power-play units?
The Canucks are undermanned. That's an understatement. Too much is required of Boeser at the moment.
It's not like they aren't coming through. He's scoring at a rate no one thought possible. They started Monday on a line with the Sedins. It didn't take long for them to find them open in the slot. They scored with such ferocity it seemed like given 100 chances to take that same shot, they would have scored 100 times.
Horvat has now missed three games. Boeser has scored in all of them. They need some help.
Boeser has to earn their ice time
It felt like head coach Travis Green was keeping expectations in check Monday. When asked about their star rookie, they said Boeser will have to earn ice time if they want to play more.
Apparently, having 40 per cent more points than anyone else in the lineup isn't enough.
Green probably didn't really mean it. He's been vocal in their desire to keep Boeser grounded. All those goals can tend to go to a player's head.
Vancouver hockey fans collectively gasped when Boeser was hobbled
Did your heart stop?
Many seemed to when Boeser blocked a slap shot from a few feet away. They collapsed to the ice, hobbled to the bench and then winced in pain for what felt like an eternity.
No, not Boeser too.
Hunched over at intermission, Boeser made their way to the locker-room. It did not look good.
But they returned for the final two periods.
They seemed to be fine. Vancouver really needs them to be fine.
Michael Chaput struggles in second game
Green gushed about Chaput after the loss in Calgary. The next day, too. They said it surprised them that Chaput became their shutdown centre.
Things weren't quite as glorious against the Winnipeg Jets. Shorthanded, Chaput lost a battle along the boards and then gave a puck away.
The mistakes led directly to a Winnipeg power-play goal.
There's talk the Canucks would like to trade Alex Burmistrov
It doesn't really make sense. It's not like Burmistrov hasn't been a healthy scratch before.
They were a regular a year ago when they were with the Jets. They said all the same things then about not understanding their role.
At some point, you have to take some responsibility for what's going on. Even if he's not really working out for the Canucks, it doesn't make much sense to trade them when the team has a rash of injuries to top forwards.
Monday was only their 19th game of the season. Give them some games in a row to breathe before moving on. It's not clear the guys who would be playing ahead of them are any better.
It's Nikolay Goldobin and Reid Boucher time
So far, Green has sided with responsible two-way play over potential goal scoring.
But their entire offence is built around a rookie who has been scoring nearly one-third of all the Canucks' goals during the past few weeks.
Boeser needs help. The Canucks have it, too. Both Boucher and Goldobin have played really well this season. And Goldobin has done their “playing well” in both Utica and with the Canucks. There's not much more they could have done to prove he's earned a run of games to show Green what they can do in the NHL.
But Goldobin has been with the Canucks for eight games. Monday was the fourth time he's been a healthy scratch. He's too good offensively to keep that up. And Boucher is too productive to keep in the minors.
Jacob Markstrom didn't look right
The topic at the crest of the Canucks' injury wave has been offence.
Rightfully so. The Canucks are suddenly without their Nos. 2, 3 and 4 goal scorers.
But this only intensifies what happens in the crease. Canucks goalies can't be spotting teams goals.
Unfortunately, that's exactly what Markstrom did. Early in the first, a soft shot that looked like most dump-ins, leaked through the fiery, emotional goalie.
It's the type of softy that haunted Markstrom earlier in the season. Back then the Canucks had the firepower to drag them out of the weeds.
Not anymore.

Qatar's Ministry of Defense said on Wednesday the country signed a deal to buy F-15 fighter jets from the United States for $12 billion. The deal was completed despite the Gulf country being criticized recently by U.S. President Donald Trump for supporting terrorism.
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and representatives from Qatar were set to meet Wednesday to seal the agreement, a source familiar with the deal told Reuters. Bloomberg News reported the deal was for 36 jets.
In November, the United States approved possible sale of up to 72 F-15QA aircraft to Qatar for $21.1 billion. Boeing Co (BA.N) is the prime contractor on the fighter jet sale to the Middle East nation.
Boeing declined to comment.Trump on Friday accused Qatar of being a "high-level" sponsor of terrorism, potentially hindering the U.S. Department of State's efforts to ease heightening tensions and a blockade of the Gulf nation by Arab states and others.

The Nashville Predators have not only built a powerhouse team in the Western Conference, they have done it in such a way under the salary cap that they not only have their core locked in for the foreseeable future, they still have enough salary cap space to add players like Kyle Turris and Nick Bonino on long-term deals.
Those additions have helped make an already strong team one of the absolute best in the NHL, and they only seem to be getting better.
They not only enter the week with one of the best records in the league, they are starting to look better than the team that was in the Stanley Cup Final just a few months ago.
Entering play on Monday the Predators 13-2-2 in their past 17 games.
Since acquiring Turris in that blockbuster three-team trade with the Colorado Avalanche and Ottawa Senators they are 10-2-2 while Turris themselves has already recorded 13 points.
What is perhaps scariest about this team for the rest of the Western Conference is they have not really been fully healthy yet this season. Ryan Ellis, a key part of their defense, which is the backbone of their team, has yet to play this season. Bonino missed a significant chunk of the season and they are currently dealing with injuries to Johansen and Scott Hartnell. When totally healthy this team is going to be an abslute nightmare matchup for just about any team in the NHL with that defense and newfound center depth.
Their current run has them fourth in our power rankings.
Here is a look at where everybody else fits in.
The Elites
1. Tampa Bay Lightning — They still have the NHL's top two scorers, the NHL's best goal differential, and the NHL's best points percentage. Kind of hard to put anybody else on top of the league at this point, right?
2. St. Louis Blues — Losing Jaden Schwartz is just another injury added to the list this season for the Blues, but they keep finding ways to power through and keep winning. It helps that Brayden Schenn is on their way to a career year offensively.
3. Los Angeles Kings — They had a rough stretch where they lost seven out of eight games, but then they followed it up by winning eight in a row. They are once again at the top of the NHL's goals against leaderboard and have started to find some offense. Anze Kopitar is making a very strong early season MVP case for himself.  They are third in the league in scoring, playing a ton of minutes, and dominating in all three zones the way they did when they were the focal point of a two-time Stanley Cup winning team.
4. Nashville Predators — The roster is not only better than the one that went to the Stanley Cup Final, they also just simply look like a better team, too.
The Rest Of The Best
5. Vegas Golden Knights — They. Won't. Stop. Winning. And now they are getting Marc-Andre Fleury back, the player that was supposed to be the cornerstone of their inaugural season. Quite a story that is developing here.
6. Columbus Blue Jackets — Imagine how good they can be when Cam Atkinson, a healthy scratch over the weekend, starts scoring goals again.
7. Toronto Maple Leafs — It's not just that the Maple Leafs have a superstar like Auston Matthews at the top of their lineup that makes them so dangerous and exciting offensively. It is the fact their lineup is just incredibly deep overall. Every line is capable of scoring goals on any given shift.
8. Washington Capitals — With wins in eight of their past 10 games, while also averaging 3.6 goals per game during that stretch, they are climbing the standings and starting to look like the Capitals again.
9. New York Rangers — As I said two weeks ago, winning just one of their first eight games put them in a hole that will be tough to climb out of in the standings. They are doing their best to make sure they do, in fact, climb out of it. They are 13-4-0 in their past 17 games.
10. Winnipeg Jets — They have cooled off a bit recently, but let's not panic just yet. That offense is still great.
Stuck In The Middle
11. New Jersey Devils — A little bit of a fall from where they were two weeks ago, but the young talent on this team is still worth watching and giving Devils fans a lot of reason to believe, both for this season and the future.
12. Boston Bruins — With wins in eight of their past 10 games the Bruins are really starting to put it together. David Pastrnak is becoming a star and looking to improve on their 34-goal, 70-point performance from a season ago.
13. New York Islanders — After scoring 34 goals a season ago Anders Lee is doing everything they can to show it was no fluke. With 17 goals in their first 34 games entering the week they are now on pace for 41 goals this season.
14. San Jose Sharks — If you like goals, their games are not the games to watch. To enter the week 26th in the league in goals scored and second in the league in goals against.
15. Calgary Flames — Johnny Gaudreau‘s brilliance has kind of overshadowed the fact that Sean Monahan is having a career year offensively (he has five more goals than Gaudreau) and is also starting to post dominant possession numbers.
The Mystery Teams: Are They Good Or Not?
16. Minnesota Wild — Are they good or not is a question that we seem to be able to ask about the Minnesota Wild every season.
17. Chicago Blackhawks — An aging team that is pretty dependent on its goaltender at this point. Sometimes they look great. Sometimes they don't. Is this the new normal for the Blackhawks?
18. Dallas Stars — After what was a mostly up-and-down 2016-17 season John Klingberg looks like they have back to being one of the NHL's most dynamic and dominant defensemen.
19. Pittsburgh Penguins — On any given night they can look like the team that has won back-to-back Stanley Cups. They can also look like a team that has no idea what it is doing.
20. Vancouver Canucks — Whether the Canucks maintain their early season success and actually make the playoffs is secondary to the fact the two best players on this team are under the age of 23 and look to be like legitimate building blocks.
21. Montreal Canadiens — The ultimate “are they good or not?” team this season. One night they are winning 10-1. Another night they are getting routed by the Oilers. Who knows what team is showing up when the puck drops.
22. Carolina Hurricanes — They are once again breaking hockey math.
23. Philadelphia Flyers — They snapped their 10-game losing streak by rolling through Western Canada, beating the Flames, Oilers and Canucks by a combined score of 13-5. Jakub Voracek is very quietly putting together a dominant season offensively, at least as far as their playmaking is concerned.
24. Anaheim Ducks — Adam Henrique has been pretty outstanding since coming over in the big trade with the New Jersey Devils. Given their injury situation down the middle it has been a much-needed addition.
25. Florida Panthers –– Losing Roberto Luongo could be a devastating blow to a team that really can not afford one. They have been spectacular when in the lineup while their backups have been … well … anything but spectacular.
The Basement
26. Colorado Avalanche — They overachieved for a while at the start of the year but with losses in 10 of their past 15 games they are starting to become the Avalanche again.
27. Edmonton Oilers — The deeper we get into the season the more likely it seems they are going to miss the playoffs and waste one of Connor McDavid‘s prime years. That remains astonishing.
28. Detroit Red Wings — In the past week they've lost games by scores of 10-1 and 6-1. They've also lost seven out of eight overall and are quickly falling down the standings. There just is not a lot to be excited about here.
29. Ottawa Senators — Not only is the team on the ice losing games with regularity, Erik Karlsson‘s future with the team has never been more in doubt. Other than that everything is great.
30. Arizona Coyotes — The travel schedule has not been kind to them. The good news? Ten of their next 12 games are at home. The bad news? Three of those first four games are against the Washington Capitals, Tampa Bay Lightning, and the Pittsburgh Penguins.
31. Buffalo Sabres — The Sabres had a stretch where they were shutout three games in a row and were about 10 minutes away from a fourth. Since November 1 they have played 18 games. They have scored more than one goal in only nine of them.

Jose Mourinho has told Manchester United contract rebel Marouane Fellaini to "shut up" and sign the new deal the club have offered him.
The United boss - speaking ahead of their side's Premier League clash with Huddersfield on Saturday - also suggested that, given the Belgian's injury they picked up in Wednesday's 2-0 defeat to Tottenham at Wembley , they should sign the deal while it is still available to him.
Fellaini - who is out of contract in the summer - is set to be out for 6-8 weeks having picked up a knee problem just 30 seconds after coming on against Spurs, forcing them to be substituted after just seven minutes on the pitch.

And Mourinho seemed to suggest that the former Everton man is talking too much, and not acting in their own best interests.
"I told them yesterday: 'Sign the contract and shut up,'" they said on Friday.
"I told him: 'Don't gamble too much. Sign the contract before you know the extent of the injury.'"
As for the injury itself, Mourinho seemed to suggest that Fellaini won't be available until mid-March at the earliest.

"I don't have good news [on Fellaini's injury]." they continued. "I don't have news because I don't want to give news based on an initial approach, but I don't think the news is very good.
"He has a problem in their knee, is the same knee but not the same, was internal, now external. So let's wait a couple of more days but out of the game tomorrow.
"Is not an ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) or a complete rupture of any structure of the knee. We are not going so far as that but we need him. Champions League is arriving and lots of tough matches to play and probably we are going to lose for a few weeks. Two, three, four or five, I cannot say at the moment."

FREETOWN: At least 312 people were killed and more than 2,000 left homeless on Monday (Aug 14) when heavy flooding hit Sierra Leone's capital of Freetown, leaving morgues overflowing and residents desperately searching for loved ones.
An AFP journalist at the scene saw bodies being carried away and houses submerged in two areas of the city, where roads turned into churning rivers of mud and corpses were washed up on the streets.
Red Cross spokesperson Patrick Massaquoi told AFP the death toll was 312 but could rise further as their team continued to survey disaster areas in Freetown and tally the number of dead.
Mohamed Sinneh, a morgue technician at Freetown's Connaught Hospital, said 180 bodies had been received so far at their facility alone, many of them children, leaving no space to lay what they described as the "overwhelming number of dead".
Many more bodies were taken to private morgues, Sinneh said.
Images obtained by AFP showed a ferocious churning of dark orange mud coursing down a steep street in the capital, while videos posted by local residents showed people waist and chest deep in water trying to traverse the road.

Fatmata Sesay, who lives on the hilltop area of Juba, said she, their three children and husband were awoken at 4.30am by rain beating down on the mud house they occupy, which was by then submerged by water.
They managed to escape by climbing onto the roof. "We have lost everything and we do not have a place to sleep," they told AFP.
PILES OF CORPSES
Local media reports said a section of a hill in the Regent area of the city had partially collapsed, exacerbating the disaster.
Other images showed battered corpses piled on top of each other, as residents struggled to cope with the destruction.
Meanwhile disaster management official Candy Rogers said that "over 2,000 people are homeless," hinting at the huge humanitarian effort that will be required to deal with the fallout of the flooding in one of Africa's poorest nations.
Freetown, an overcrowded coastal city of 1.2 million, is hit each year by flooding during several months of rain that destroys makeshift settlements and raises the risk of waterborne diseases such as cholera.
Flooding in the capital in 2015 killed 10 people and left thousands homeless.
Sierra Leone was one of the west African nations hit by an outbreak of the Ebola virus in 2014 that left more than 4,000 people dead in the country, and it has struggled to revive its economy since the crisis.
About 60 per cent of people in Sierra Leone live below the national poverty line, according to the United Nations Development Programme.

In an age of parity, a slump or hot streak can often be explained – at least in part – by a team's schedule.
That's not meant to discount strong play or wobbly goaltending, or any other factors that go into winning and losing. Even so, the answer to the question “What's wrong with Team X?” can sometimes be “they're tired and on a long road trip.”
With that in mind, let's look at what October has in store for NHL teams. Since the Pacific Division features Anaheim and Arizona, we'll start here. The goal is to cover all four divisions by the end of this weekend.
For a deep dive on PHT's Pacific Division materials, check out this preview.
Anaheim Ducks (Beat Coyotes 5-4)
Schedule
Sat, Oct 7 vs Philadelphia
Mon, Oct 9 vs Calgary
Wed, Oct 11 vs NY Islanders
Fri, Oct 13 @ Colorado
Sun, Oct 15 vs Buffalo
Fri, Oct 20 vs Montreal
Tue, Oct 24 @ Philadelphia
Thu, Oct 26 @ Florida
Sat, Oct 28 @ Tampa Bay
Sun, Oct 29 @ Carolina
The Anaheim Ducks are dealing with a blistering array of injuries, making the start of their schedule a good news/bad news situation.
Beginning 2017-18 with four straight games at home (not to mention six of seven in Anaheim) makes for a more comfortable situation, even if few of their key players come back during this stand. (Ryan Kesler isn't walking through that door anytime soon.)
On the flip side, if the Ducks stumble, they'll also be losing home games. So far, they managed to beat the Coyotes, so at least there's that.
Even when the road games start to pile up, the Ducks only face one back-to-back set in October.
Arizona Coyotes (lost to Ducks)
Schedule
Sat, Oct 7 vs Vegas
Tue, Oct 10 @ Vegas
Thu, Oct 12 vs Detroit
Sat, Oct 14 vs Boston
Tue, Oct 17 @ Dallas
Thu, Oct 19 vs Dallas
Sat, Oct 21 vs Chicago
Tue, Oct 24 @ NY Islanders
Thu, Oct 26 @ NY Rangers
Sat, Oct 28 @ New Jersey
Mon, Oct 30 @ Philadelphia
Tue, Oct 31 @ Detroit
After a narrow loss to begin the season against the Ducks, the Coyotes embrace a fairly Ducks-like schedule, right down to finishing October with a back-to-back set that's part of at least four road games against East teams. (The Coyotes face a five-game trip, as you can see; they begin November back at home.)
The Coyotes face two home-and-home sets with teams that carry some mystery in the Golden Knights and Stars. Will Vegas be as vulnerable as expected? Could Dallas live up to the hype? The Coyotes will serve as an early barometer for both teams.
Overall, this is a friendly schedule for the upstarts.
Calgary Flames (lost to Oilers 3-0)
Schedule
Sat, Oct 7 vs Winnipeg
Mon, Oct 9 @ Anaheim
Wed, Oct 11 @ Los Angeles
Fri, Oct 13 vs Ottawa
Sat, Oct 14 @ Vancouver
Thu, Oct 19 vs Carolina
Sat, Oct 21 vs Minnesota
Tue, Oct 24 @ Nashville
Wed, Oct 25 @ St. Louis
Fri, Oct 27 vs Dallas
Sun, Oct 29 vs Washington
This is not exactly a friendly start, especially if the Jets' 7-2 loss to Toronto was a mere hiccup for a dangerous team. The Flames face two back-to-back sets, with the first starting at home against the Senators and then transitioning to Vancouver the following day. Back-to-back sets stand as the most obvious opportunities to rest Jaromir Jagr, if Calgary goes down that route.
On the bright side, there aren't any enormous road trips yet.
Calgary needs to get everything in order by the end of October; Oct. 27's home date against the Stars begins a seven-game homestand.
Edmonton Oilers (beat Flames)
Schedule
Sat, Oct 7 @ Vancouver
Mon, Oct 9 vs Winnipeg
Sat, Oct 14 vs Ottawa
Tue, Oct 17 vs Carolina
Thu, Oct 19 @ Chicago
Sat, Oct 21 @ Philadelphia
Tue, Oct 24 @ Pittsburgh
Thu, Oct 26 vs Dallas
Sat, Oct 28 vs Washington
Connor McDavid and the Oilers get to ease into their roles as favorites with a light, low-impact October.
The Oilers get to play four of their first five games at home to start the season (counting the McDavid showcase to open 2017-18) and don't face a back-to-back in October. Much like the Flames, they'll want to finish the month on a high note; Oct. 26 begins a five-game homestand.
Los Angeles Kings (Shut out Flyers 2-0)
Schedule
Sat, Oct 7 @ San Jose
Wed, Oct 11 vs Calgary
Sat, Oct 14 vs Buffalo
Sun, Oct 15 vs NY Islanders
Wed, Oct 18 vs Montreal
Sat, Oct 21 @ Columbus
Mon, Oct 23 @ Toronto
Tue, Oct 24 @ Ottawa
Thu, Oct 26 @ Montreal
Sat, Oct 28 @ Boston
Mon, Oct 30 @ St. Louis
After one home game and one road contest to start the season, the Kings are slated for extremes of stands and trips.
At least there's an opportunity to build early confidence, as Saturday's road game isn't exactly a cross-continent trek against the Sharks. Two back-to-back sets and that month-ending six-game road swing stand as big obstacles. That said, the Kings will enjoy a lot of home-cooking in early November, so they need to hang in there.
Another bright side is that the Kings aren't expected to travel as rigorously as they have in the past.
San Jose Sharks (Lost 5-3 to Flyers)
Schedule
Sat, Oct 7 vs Los Angeles
Thu, Oct 12 vs Buffalo
Sat, Oct 14 vs NY Islanders
Tue, Oct 17 vs Montreal
Fri, Oct 20 @ New Jersey
Sat, Oct 21 @ NY Islanders
Mon, Oct 23 @ NY Rangers
Thu, Oct 26 @ Boston
Sat, Oct 28 @ Buffalo
Mon, Oct 30 vs Toronto
Much like their BFFs in Los Angeles, the Sharks see dramatic shifts in home and road runs. They didn't begin their season-opening five-game homestand on a high note with a loss to Philly.
One nice thing for San Jose is that there aren't any back-to-backs in October. That's especially nice for an aging core, although those achy legs might have appreciated such a friendly schedule deeper into the season.
Oct. 30 begins a home-heavy run: five in a row and eight of nine at home stretching into November.
Vancouver Canucks (open season on Saturday)
Schedule
Sat, Oct 7 vs Edmonton
Tue, Oct 10 vs Ottawa
Thu, Oct 12 vs Winnipeg
Sat, Oct 14 vs Calgary
Tue, Oct 17 @ Ottawa
Thu, Oct 19 @ Boston
Fri, Oct 20 @ Buffalo
Sun, Oct 22 @ Detroit
Tue, Oct 24 @ Minnesota
Thu, Oct 26 vs Washington
Mon, Oct 30 vs Dallas
The Canucks are another team, like the Kings and Sharks, who rotate home and road runs. They face a road back-to-back wedged into that five-game swing in mid-October.
If the goal is to tank, you almost wonder if Vancouver would've welcomed an especially grueling start to the season.
Vegas Golden Knights (first-ever game tonight)
Schedule

The Golden Knights play their first game that “counts” against the Stars tonight, but must wait until Tuesday for their first-ever home game. Their patience is rewarded with a seven-game homestand, though.
Vegas will begin as a franchise with a back-to-back set, one of two in October. Things go pretty road-heavy to end October and begin November.
If some early wins help draw in extra fans, this could work out nicely for the Golden Knights.
Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) has commissioned additional survey work to provide an up-to-date estimate of beaver family numbers in Tayside. The work begins this week.
This work follows from Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham's decision in November that they were minded to allow beavers to remain in Tayside and Argyll and expand their range naturally. The survey will help develop management and mitigation measures.
SNH has designed the project and awarded the contract to an experienced team led by the University of Exeter, and involving specialists based in Scotland and England. SNH is also appealing to the public to record any sightings through the Mammal Tracker app available free from the iTunes App Store and Android Market. The survey will take place throughout spring 2017 and cover the beavers' range in east-central Scotland. The work will update the earlier Tayside Beaver Study Group survey in the Tay catchment. The new survey will also provide the opportunity to investigate some areas, where beaver sightings have recently been reported but not confirmed. These include the River Devon, the Balvaig and Garbh Uisge upstream of Callander, the Forth in the Carse of Stirling and the Black Water around Brig O'Turk.
The fieldwork will involve walking the riverbank to look for field signs and evidence of breeding family groups. There may also be some water-based surveys working from canoes on the rivers; however, this will take place later in the spring when risk of spate conditions is reduced.
The University of Exeter-led survey team includes experience from across the UK, with Professor Richard Brazier, Chair of the Science and Evidence Forum for the River Otter and Mid-Devon Beaver trials, heading up the work. The project will be managed by Roisin Campbell-Palmer; one of Scotland's most experienced beaver workers.
Within SNH, there is an experienced team of specialists who have worked on beaver ecology and management issues for many years (including producing the 2015 ‘Beavers in Scotland' report), and who have the responsibility of designing the survey work, advising the survey team and ensuring the outputs meet the required needs.
By election result 2018 LIVE updates: After 17 rounds of counting in West Bengal's Maheshtala, Trinamool Congress leads with 89,318 votes. BJP topples CPM for second position with 33,737 votes while CPM has2 5,262. Trinamool is leading by 55,581 votes.
According to the latest reports, NCP is leading in the Bhandara-Gondiya Parliamentary constituency by 5,000 votes. The Bhandara-Gondiya constituency comprises of six Assembly (Vidhan Sabha) segments: Tumsar, Bhandara, Sakoli, Arjuni Morgaon, Tirora and Gondiya. Nationalist Congress Party's (NCP) Praful Patel won this this seat in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections but lost it to BJP's Nana Patole in 2014.
Congress candidate Miani D Shira has won the Ampati Assembly by election in Meghalaya by around 3,100 votes, beating nearest rival of the National People's Party (NPP) CG Momin. The seat fell vacant after Shira's father and Congress leader Mukul Sangma, who won from two seats in the Assembly elections, vacated the seat.
CPM candidate Saji Cherian is set to retain the Chengannur seat in Kerala the party had won after a long time in the 2016 Assembly election. Their lead has crossed 8,000 when counting reached the half way. The party had captured the seat from the Congress in the 2016 election by 7983 votes. If the trend continues Cherian will cross this.
Muniraju Gowda, BJP candidate in the Rajarajeshwari Nagar Karnataka bypoll, has left the counting centre as their Congress rival Muniratna leads by 45,000 votes. Gowda's supporters have conceded defeat but there is no word yet from the BJP leader. About 54 percent out of the 4.71 lakh voters in the constituency had exercised their franchise on 28 May.
While assembly elections across the state were held on May 12, polling in Rajarajeshwari Nagar was conducted on May 28, as the Election Commission had deferred polling there following the voter ID controversy and various other irregularities. A major row erupted over electoral malpractices and seizure of nearly 10,000 voter ID cards from an apartment in the constituency, ahead of May 12 elections.
Fourteen candidates were in the fray in Rajarajeshwari Nagar polls, including incumbent MLA in the dissolved assembly, Muniratna. While BJP has fielded Tulsi Muniraju Gowda, JD(S) candidate is GH Ramachandra, who had joined the party ahead of polls, quitting BJP. Muniratna is one of the accused in the case related to voter ID cards that were found in an apartment.
The counting of votes is underway in 11 Assembly and four Lok Sabha seats across India, including for the crucial Palghar and Bhandara-Gondia Lok Sabha bypolls. TMC has maintained its lead in West Bengal's Maheshtala. CPM and BJP are in a close fight for the second position. BJP is leading is Palghar with 56,812 votes, while CPM is leading in Chengannur bypoll. According to a report, the BJP candidate has "conceded defeat" in Karnataka's Rajarajeshwari Nagar.
The results of these two Lok Sabha seats are important for all four major political parties—BJP, Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP—as the outcome is likely to have a bearing on their future course.
"The counting of votes will start from 8 am in both the constituencies on Thursday. The final percentage of votes in Bhandara-Gondia will be revised late in the evening after the re-polling in 49 booths in the constituency ends," an election officer said.
While 53.22 percent of the 1.73 crore electorate exercised their franchise in Palghar, in Bhandara-Gondia, 53.15 percent of the total 1.76 crore voters cast their votes on Monday.
The voting was marred by allegations of malfunctioning in electronic voting machines (EVMs).
The Election Commission (EC) on Tuesday ordered re-polling at 49 booths in five of the six Assembly segments in Bhandara-Gondia Lok Sabha constituency on Wednesday, after allegations of malfunctioning of EVMs and VVPATs.
Former Union minister Praful Patel claimed that almost 25 percent of EVMs malfunctioned in the bypoll to Bhandara-Gondia Lok Sabha seat, while Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said those in power were contesting elections while keeping the "key and remote of EVMs in their hands".
Abhimanyu Kale, the district collector of Gondia, was transferred on Wednesday after the Lok Sabha by-election there was marred by large scale complaints of malfunctioning of the EVMs.
An FIR was filed against a polling officer in Palghar as they transported some EVMs to the counting centre in a private car against norms, after voting for the Palghar Lok Sabha bypoll ended.
The by-election in Palghar was necessitated due to death of sitting BJP MP Chintaman Wanaga. The Bhandara-Gondia seat was vacated after BJP's Nana Patole resigned from the party and quit their Lok Sabha membership.
As many as 25 candidates were in the fray for the two LS seats: 18 in Bhandara-Gondia and seven in Palghar. Both the seats are crucial for the BJP. The saffron party locked horns with the NCP to retain the Bhandara-Gondia seat, while in Palghar it is locked in a fierce battle with its estranged ally Shiv Sena, despite the contest being five-cornered.
Retaining Bhandara-Gondia is important for the BJP since its MP Nana Patole had quit the party in December 2017 and later joined the Congress. Stakes are also high in Palghar as Shiv Sena has fielded Sriniwas Wanaga, son of late BJP MP Chintaman Wanaga.
The BJP had roped in Union minister Smriti Irani Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath for the campaign. In Bhandara-Gondia, the NCP had fielded Madhukar Kukde, while the BJP had nominated Hemant Patle. Although there are total of 18 candidates in Bhandara-Gondia, the main contest is between the BJP and the NCP.
Congress leaders in the constituency are miffed that the party gave the seat to NCP despite Nana Patole returning to the Congress fold. Patole had defeated NCP leader Praful Patel in 2014. Patel has represented the seat earlier in the Lok Sabha.
The BJP represents five of the six Assembly segments in the Lok Sabha constituency: Tumsar, Bhandara, Sakoli, Arjuni Morgaon, Tirora, while Gopaldas Agarwal of Congress represents Gondia.
In Punjab, the Shahkot Assembly bypoll results, which will be out on Thursday, is being seen as a popularity test for the 14-month-old Congress government in Punjab, with Opposition SAD striving to retain its stronghold. The bypoll was necessitated following the demise of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MLA Ajit Singh Kohar in February.
While the SAD is striving to retain its pocket borough from where Kohar was elected five times, the results for the ruling Congress in Punjab is being seen as a barometer for the popularity of the 14-month-old Amarinder Singh dispensation. During the bypoll, the Opposition party had accused the Congress of misusing official machinery against political opponents.
The AAP, which faced a humiliating defeat in the Gurdaspur Lok Sabha bypoll and civic polls, is desperately looking for a victory in Shahkot. The Congress is confident of maintaining the winning momentum by wresting the seat from rival SAD.
Over 76 percent of 1.72 lakh voters had exercised their franchise for the Shahkot bypoll on 28 May where the Congress, the SAD and the AAP were locked in a triangular battle.
The other bypoll seats where the results are expected on Thursday are Bihar's Jokihat Assembly seat where the main candidates are JD-U's Murshid Alam, RJD's Shahnawaz Alam and an Independent candidate Mohammad Shabbir and Jharkhand's Silli and Gomia seat.
In Silli Assembly seat, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) candidate Seema Mahto faces ruling NDA constituent All Jharkhand Students Union (AJSU) president Sudesh Mahto and in Gomia, the BJP and the AJUS are fighting separately. The BJP has fielded former minister Madavlal Singh and AJSU has fielded Lambodar Mahto who was a state government employee. The JMM has fielded Babita Devi, wife of Yogendra Mahto who was disqualified as legislator after they were convicted in a case and sentenced to two years in jail.
Meanwhile, in the east, bypoll in West Bengal's Maheshtala Assembly seat was held following the death of Trinamool Congress MLA Kasturi Das. The party has fielded their husband Dulal Das, while the BJP, which is trying to emerge as the main challenger to the rulign TMC, has fielded Sujit Ghosh, a former CBI joint director. The Left has nominated Prabhat Chowdhury.
The results of the Ampati Assembly in Meghalaya will be interesting as it witnessed a triangular contest, where Miani D Shira, the daughter of Leader of Opposition Mukul Sangma, is the Congress candidate, Clement G Momin is the nominee of the ruling Meghalaya Democratic Alliance while Subhankar Koch is the Independent contestant.
The by-election in this constituency was necessitated after Sangma resigned from the seat as they had won from Songsak seat as well in the February 27 Assembly election.
Down south, in Kerala's Chengannur, the battle is largely between the ruling CPM, the main Opposition Congress and the BJP. The BJP has just one MLA in Kerala, and it is seeking to expand its support base in the state where politics has been dominated by the CPM-led Left Democratic Front and Congress headed United Democratic Front for decades.

ISTANBUL: Turkey on Saturday (Feb 3) said that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad should leave office "at some point" in the future but denied there was any kind of contact between Ankara and Damascus over ending the seven year civil war.
Ankara has been a prime foe of Assad throughout the conflict but has occasionally softened its rhetoric in the last months as Turkey strengthened cooperation with the regime's main ally Russia.
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's spokesperson, Ibrahim Kalin, told journalists in Istanbul, that Assad was not the leader to unite Syria and had lost legitimacy.
But Kalin said there needed to be a "political transition in Syria", leading to a new constitution and elections.
"It is not going to be easy but that's the ultimate goal to reach and at some point Assad will have to go," they added.
"Where exactly, at what point precisely (Assad leaves), is something that will be answered as we go on, obviously," they said.

Kalin was speaking after Russia on Tuesday hosted a peace congress on Syria, with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Erdoğan expressing "satisfaction", according to the Kremlin.
Kalin said the Russian position has been "not so much protecting Assad personally but protecting the state institutions, state apparatus and the Syrian army and the regime elements".
They said: "They want to make sure that the state doesn't collapse completely in Syria."
Turkey's position on Assad has been under ever greater scrutiny since Ankara on January 20 began a cross-border operation with Syrian allied rebel forces against Kurdish militia based in the town of Afrin.
But Kalin denied any contact with Damascus "at any level".
"There is no communication, no relationship, direct (or) indirect. Nothing with the Syrian regime, at any level. I can say that categorically and very clearly," they said.
They also rejected the notion that there had been any agreement with Russia allowing the Afrin operation to go ahead in exchange for a deal over the rebel-held neighbouring region of Idlib.
"There's no deal with Russia 'you give Idlib and take Afrin'... they are two separate operations," they said.
Brazil international Paulinho's imminent move to Barcelona from Guangzhou Evergrande is proof of the strength of the Chinese Super League (CSL), Shanghai SIPG coach Andre Villas-Boas said.The 29-year-old midfielder Paulinho is reportedly poised to sign for the Spanish giants for 40 million euros and they could be unveiled as a Barcelona player as early as Monday.Paulinho would be Barcelona's first signing since losing Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain in a world-record 222-million-euro move.Paulinho and Villas-Boas were together at Tottenham Hotspur in 2013 and the Portuguese coach told reporters on Sunday that the player's move to Spain "is good news for Chinese football"."Because Paulinho's come here, he's done ever so well and now they have a transfer to one of the biggest clubs in the world."I think it shows that the big clubs are also looking at our league. It's a reflection of the players and the quality of work that is being done here."Barcelona have remained tight-lipped about Paulinho, who failed to shine during two years in the Premier League at Tottenham before moving to Guangzhou in 2015.However, they have established themselves as a regular in a rejuvenated Brazil side since the appointment of Tite as coach a year ago, most notably scoring a hat-trick in a 4-1 win away to Uruguay in World Cup qualifying in March.He played a significant part in Evergrande winning the CSL last season and lifting the AFC Champions League in 2015, and they leaf them five points clear of Shanghai SIPG in the league.Paulinho did not feature in Sunday's 2-1 home win over Henan Jianye and captain Zheng Zhi says the Brazilian will be a major loss, especially with teams unable to bring in any replacements because the Chinese mid-season transfer window is closed."I think at this stage of the season it is unlikely we can add more people," said Zheng."We will miss our main player and it will impact the team. But no matter what, we give our blessings to Paulinho."Villas-Boas's SIPG stayed second in the CSL after beating Chongqing Lifan 3-2 late on Sunday.
The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has its fair share of sceptics and opponents around the world, not least in India. Beijing and Islamabad have gone to great lengths to convince the world — again, not least, New Delhi — that the CPEC isn't a venture aimed at antagonising the region. Now, according to a report published by a Belgium-based research group, the project risks fuelling discontent within Pakistan, that could eventually lead to conflict.
According to Crisis Group's report titled 'China-Pakistan Economic Corridor: Opportunities and Risks', "...as currently rolled out, the corridor risks aggravating political tension, widening social divides and generating new sources of conflict in Pakistan... Beijing should also consult stakeholders in regions that will host CPEC projects it agrees upon with Islamabad. It should encourage Chinese companies to display sensitivity to residents of those areas, including by hiring local labour."
According to a report in Gandhara, the 29 June report by the Brussels-based think tank noted that if Islamabad fails to thoroughly debate the investments in Parliament and provincial legislatures and consult with locals, they are unlikely to revive Pakistan's ailing economy. "Many of these problems stem from opaque policy formulation and the failure to heed regional and local concerns," the paper noted, according to the report. "CPEC's long-term plan (2017-2030) was formulated by the Centre with little input from local leaders, business or civil society actors."
The CPEC, which falls under China's Belt and Road Initiative, has faced a number of accusations regarding a lack of transparency, Chinese firms and the wealthier parts of Pakistan benefitting disproportionately and has raised flags about China's geopolitical intentions, according to a report in South China Morning Post.
"While it is too early to assess if CPEC can deliver the economic gains Islamabad promises, the project risks inflaming long-standing tensions between the Centre and smaller federal units, and within provinces over inequitable economic development and resource distribution," the report added.
FM Shakil, writing in Asia Times, noted, "The $56 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) — a part of China's 'One Belt, One Road' vision — has yet to translate into the game-changer envisioned by its sponsors. Worse than that, the unparalleled tax breaks and mounting security costs involved have already saddled Islamabad's exchequer with a hole in its finances of more than $2.5 billion."
"There is absolutely nothing in the CPEC for the local trade and industry; even the labour is coming from China, which will cause a steep escalation in the operational cost of the project," said Muhammad Ishaq, a leading industrialist and a director of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Board of Investment and Trade in conversation, according to the Asia Times report. They added that CPEC will be a big disaster for Pakistan in the long run.
"For all the risks and challenges, CPEC offers an opportunity to upgrade Pakistan's aging and dysfunctional infrastructure, and revive a flagging economy," the Crisis Group report stated. "But to deliver on these promises, both Islamabad and Beijing need to implement it with considerably more sensitivity and consultation than they have displayed thus far, with provinces and the communities most affected given a greater voice in shaping CPEC projects."
FRANKFURT: A previously undetected group of Russian-language hackers silently stole nearly US$10 million from at least 18 mostly US and Russian banks in recent years by targeting interbank transfer systems, a Moscow-based security firm said on Monday.
Group-IB warned that the attacks, which began 18 months ago and allow money to be robbed from bank automated teller machines (ATMs), appear to be ongoing and that banks in Latin America could be targeted next.
The first attack occurred in the spring of 2016 against First Data's "STAR" network, the largest US bank transfer messaging system connecting ATMs at more than 5,000 organisations, Group-IB researchers said in a 36-page report.
The firm said it was continuing to investigate a number of incidents where hackers studied how to make money transfers through the SWIFT banking system, while stopping short of saying whether any such attacks had been carried out successfully.
SWIFT said in October that hackers were still targeting its interbank messaging system, but security controls instituted after last year's US$81 million heist at Bangladesh's central bank had thwarted many of those attempts.
Group-IB has dubbed the hacker group "MoneyTaker" after the name of software it used to hijack payment orders to then cash out funds through a network of low-level "money mules" who were hired to pick up money from automated teller machines.

The security researchers said they had identified 18 banks who were hit including 15 across 10 states in the United States, two in Russia and one in Britain. Beside banks, financial software firms and one law firm were targeted.
The average amount of money stolen in each of 14 US ATM heists was US$500,000 per incident. Losses in Russia averaged US$1.2 million per incident, but one bank there managed to catch the attack and return some of the stolen funds, Group-IB said.
Hackers also stole documentation for OceanSystems' Fed Link transfer system used by 200 banks in Latin America and the United States, it said. In addition, they successfully attacked the Russian interbank messaging system known as AW CRB.
Once hackers penetrated targeted banks and financial organisations, they stole internal bank documentation in order to mount future ATM attacks, Group-IB said. In Russia, the hackers continued to spy on bank networks after break-ins, while at least one U.S. bank had documents robbed twice, it said.
Group-IB said it had notified Interpol and Europol in order to assist in law enforcement investigations.
The unidentified hackers used a mix of constantly changing tools and tactics to bypass anti virus and other traditional security software while being careful to eliminate traces of their operations, helping them to go largely unnoticed. To disguise their moves, hackers used security certificates from brands such as Bank of America, the Fed, Microsoft and Yahoo.

Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme, weathering a firestorm of criticism for kicking photographer Chelsea Lauren in the face while they shot their band's performance at the KROQ Acoustic Christmas concert on Dec. 9, has posted an emotional video on Instagram apologizing for their actions.
“I would just like to apologize to Chelsea Lauren,” they say in the first of a two-part clip. “I don't have any excuse or reason to justify what I did. I was a total dick and I'm truly sorry. I hope you're OK.”
The 44-year-old also apologized to their bandmates, family, wife and kids, adding, “I made a lot of mistakes in my life and last night was definitely one of them. … “I wanna be a good man, but I think last night I definitely failed at that. … I'm gonna have to figure out some stuff, I think.”
Lauren, a photographer for Shutterstock, which has a licensing partnership with Variety owner Penske Media, said the incident was unprovoked. Homme released a statement Sunday, characterizing the incident as an accident.
Night two of the KROQ Acoustic Christmas went off without a hitch, save for a last-minute Morrissey cancelation. The Killers instead performed a couple Moz classics, including, appropriately enough, “Everyday Is Like Sunday.” The Las Vegas band also gave a nod to the sole photographer in the pit by inviting them onstage and declaring to all, “You are welcome and safe at a Killers show.”
Other highlights included a surprise appearance by local darlings Dawes and a standout set by the Lumineers.

MUMBAI: Tobacco sickness has taken a toll on people worldwide, but that does not change the fact that it's consumed widely.
With World No Tobacco Day just a day away, there screams a high necessity to spread awareness on how smoking is actually dragging people into a pit. To address this cause Thought Scoot, a YouTube channel that aims at providing a perspective has released a video on why you should quit smoking.

Director Michael Dougherty (Krampus) is hard at work on Godzilla 2 right now, which is currently slated for release on March 22, 2019. The movie is going to do a lot for hardcore fans of the franchise by bringing on some classic kaiju from the history of the series with Mothra, Rodan and King Ghidorah joining up with the King of the Monsters. Now, Dougherty has revealed a new set photo that appears to be teasing a major connection to the original 1954 Godzilla movie.
Michael Dougherty recently took to Twitter in order to post a photo from the set of Godzilla 2 that doesn't feature any monsters in it, but is definitely a (potentially) big deal. Those who have seen the original Godzilla will likely recognize the weapon depicted in the photo as the Oxygen Destroyer, a weapon that removes oxygen from whatever body of water it is placed in and was used to destroy Godzilla in the original movie.
"Day 41. @GodzillaMovie"
This could just be a minor Easter egg, but there is good reason to believe that we could be seeing this Oxygen Destroyer plot device resurface in Godzilla 2, which at one point was going under the title of Godzilla: King of Monsters, but it now seems like that title has been dropped. In the movie, Ken Watanabe plays a character by the name of Dr. Serizawa, just as they did in Gareth Edwards' Godzilla in 2014. It just so happens that the Oxygen Destroyer in the original movie was also created by a Dr. Serizawa. They are different characters, but since they share a name, it wouldn't be too surprising if Watanabe's character has a connection to this weapon being teased in Godzilla 2.
Godzilla 2, in addition to Ken Watanabe, will be bringing back Sally Hawkins (Blue Jasmine), who is also reprising their role from 2014's Godzilla. Joining them for the sequel is Vera Farmiga (Up in the Air, The Conjuring), Kyle Chandler (The Wolf of Wall Street, Manchester by the Sea), Bradley Whitford (Get Out), Thomas Middleditch (Silicon Valley), Charles Dance (Game of Thrones), O'Shea Jackson Jr. (Straight Outta Compton), Aisha Hinds (Star Trek Into Darkness), Zhang Ziyi (Memoirs of a Geisha) and Millie Bobby Brown (Stranger Things), who is making their feature film debut. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen are not going to return for this installment. But something had to give to make way for Mothra, Rodan and King Ghidorah.
Legendary Pictures is building out a cinematic universe, titled the Monsterverse, centered on Godzilla. That continued this year with Kong: Skull Island, which was a huge hit. Godzilla 2 will be the next movie to arrive, which will pave the way for Godzilla vs. Kong in 2020, which is set to be directed by Adam Wingard (Blair Witch). Be sure to check out the new photo from Godzilla 2 for yourself below.
No stranger to the Coachella scene, festival alum and California girl Kate Bosworth is also a fan of Palm Springs. In town to support friend Rachel Zoe and the third annual Zoeasis Style Retreat presented by The Zoe Report on Saturday, the actor sat down with WWD to discuss their latest projects, including a collaboration with Los Angeles-based sunglasses designer Jacques Marie Mage, and how to dress for the desert.
WWD: What are you wearing today?
Kate Bosworth: Rachel Zoe Collection and an MCM [bag] and Roger Vivier, which I have been obsessed with for a while. They're like fancy-pants Birkenstocks. These are for outside festival use only. And these are glasses that I designed with Jacques Marie Mage. They're numbered and limited. I named them “Fascination Street.” [Designer Jerome Mage] was introduced to [my husband] Michael [Polish] and I. They really wanted to do an artist-muse series, so they asked Michael and me because we both feel like we are interchangeable artist and muse. Sometimes I am their muse, sometimes they are my muse, and we are both artists. They come out in June, and they are sold on Moda Operandi. They are super light. That's all titanium.
WWD: What do you seek out in a collaboration?
K.B.: I love working with different like-minded artists. I used to be open to everything but now I feel it's very important that, whomever I am collaborating with, that we have a similar vision. I don't mind discussing and conversing over differences — that's totally welcome and I have a good time with it — but sometimes when you're on two separate pages it can get tough. That goes for anything, whether it's a film or a fashion collaboration.
WWD: How many times have you been to Coachella?
K.B.: It's countless now, but I rarely trek out onto the field. I've passed that baton to my stepdaughter. She'll be running around and getting dirty and getting blisters on their feet. Now I come and see friends and have a nice weekend in Palm Springs. I am also going to shoot the campaign for Jerome in Joshua Tree.
WWD: What draws you to the desert still?
K.B.: I love Palm Springs and I was born in California. It's an iconic California experience, to be in the desert with my husband, and have a day where you can just relax and enjoy the beauty of the desert.
WWD: What has been keeping you busy lately?
K.B.: I just produced a movie that my husband directed, called “Nona.” They wrote the script. It's about human trafficking. We financed it ourselves. They filmed it in Honduras, Guatemala, Mexico City, Tijuana and back to L.A. I had two Navy SEALs with them down there because there is so much corruption and danger and cartel activity. But the subject matter is incredibly important to bring attention to, it's the number-one black market in the world. And I filmed a miniseries for NatGeo called “The Long Road Home.” It's a true story based on Martha Raddatz's book about an infantry in Iraq.
WWD: What is the key to desert dressing?
K.B.: You always think about the heat. It's always shocking. We came by helicopter. We flew up in the higher altitudes and it felt so nice, then suddenly you're descending and it's, oh my gosh, I can feel the heat coming. And even something as simple as shoes. Your feet swell so much in the desert and I remember the first year I came to Coachella, I would Band-Aid my whole foot. Now I am more mindful of things like that.

Two games into the season is hardly the time to panic, especially when the team in question is the Pittsburgh Penguins — a team that has won back-to-back Stanley Cups while overcoming quite a bit of adversity each time (a mid-season coaching change one year; a significant injury to one of their best players in the other).
But that doesn't mean it isn't a bit of an eye-opener when they open the season with back-to-back losses, giving up 15 goals in the process while getting completely annihilated on Thursday night in Chicago by a 10-1 margin.
Mike Sullivan called it a “wake-up call” on Friday in advance of their Stanley Cup Final rematch against Nashville on Saturday night and insisted that nobody is hitting the panic button.
Sullivan: "It's early, nobody's hitting the panic button here, but when you get beat the way we did last night, it's a wake-up call" -MC — Pens Inside Scoop (@PensInsideScoop) October 6, 2017
Quite honestly, they shouldn't be. But that doesn't mean there isn't reason for at least some mild concern with the way the team has looked through the first two games.
One of the more astonishing things about their Stanley Cup run a season ago is that they did it with what was a mostly patchwork defense that was without its best player in Kris Letang.
Overall, they were not a great defensive team during the 2016-17 season. They finished 17th in the league in goals against during the regular season, gave up more shots than your typical Stanley Cup winner does, and more often than not found themselves getting outshot and outchanced in the playoffs. What got them through it was two outstanding goaltending performances from Matt Murray and Marc-Andre Fleury, as well as the fact they had the best, and deepest group of forwards in the NHL that could pounce on any chance the opposition gave them and bury it in the back of the net.
The results were there in the short-term, but it was never a long-term recipe for success. The goaltending was always the key because without that level of play in the early rounds from Fleury they probably don't get out of the first or second round. Once that goaltending performance dropped off a little, the flaws on defense were going to be exposed.
A lot of those flaws on defense still showed up through the first two games (even with the return of Letang) and the goaltending has not been able to bail them out so far.
Murray hasn't quite gotten to their game yet, while new backup Antti Niemi fell on their face (literally and figuratively) in their debut with the team.
The question is whether or not they can remedy those flaws with the current roster.
The offseason saw the team lose forwards Nick Bonino, Matt Cullen and Chris Kunitz, while Patric Hornqvist has yet to play due to an injury. Losing Bonino and Cullen was a pretty big blow to their center depth (that they still have not really replaced) and with Hornqvist out of the lineup they are basically skating a couple of fourth lines when Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin are not on the ice and the defense still has its share of question marks, with the only change coming in the form of swapping out Trevor Daley and Ron Hainsey for Matt Hunwick.
They are still likely to swing a trade at some point to improve that center depth, and it seems logical to think that prized prospect Daniel Sprong might get the Jake Guentzel treatment this season and be a mid-season call-up after getting their feet wet in the American Hockey League.
That, along with the return of Hornqvist will certainly help fix those problems up front.
The problems on the back-end, however, might be a little more difficult to fix. Letang, when healthy, is a superstar and Justin Schultz has become the player everyone thought they could be in Edmonton. But beyond that it is still a group that has some question marks. It's been said about that group a lot over the past two years, and they've always found a way to overcome it and succeed, but the roster around them does not seem to be quite as strong on paper at the moment.
A Tennessee man is hoping to catch President Trump's attention this weekend and raise awareness about a safety issue that changed their family forever. Steve Eimers paid $1,000 to run a message in West Palm Beach during the Super Bowl with the hope that the president is watching from their Mar-a-Lago resort, reports CBS News correspondent Kris Van Cleave.
Eimers' 17-year-old daughter Hannah was killed when they struck an X-LITE guardrail in Tennessee in 2016.
"It was worth taking that shot to see if maybe the president will see this," they said.
Instead of collapsing on itself – as the devices is meant to – police say the rail acted as a spear, penetrating the driver's door, hitting Hannah in the chest and head.
"Nothing prepares you to be the parent of a dead child. And to discover that, well one, the nature of this accident was horrific," Eimers said.
At least 13 deaths nationally may involve X-LITE guardrails including a crash in Tennessee that killed 69-year-old Wilbert Byrd and a 59-year-old man in Missouri. Eimers says federal regulators have been slow to act.
"It's one thing to lose your child to an innocent accident but we lost our daughter to a defective product. And to see the Federal Highway Administration be this dismissive it is – it's insulting," Eimers said.
The Federal Highway Administration says safety is the top priority and points to new, more stringent safety criteria that went into effect in January. But lawsuits claim there are more than 14,000 X-LITE's on U.S. roads nationwide
Since Hannah's death, Tennessee has begun removing its guardrails, complaining of "installation deficiencies." Ten other states now say they too will get rid of the X-LITEs.
In a statement to CBS News, Lindsay Transportation Solutions said the "X-LITE has successfully passed crash and safety tests in accordance with federal standards" and noteed no road safety equipment can prevent injury in every crash scenario.
In Week 14 of the NFL season, plenty of first-year players made impacts on the field for their respective teams. Which rookie stood out the most to earn Pepsi Rookie of the Week honors?

Auston Matthews, now sporting a lion tattoo on their right shoulder and bicep, watched Sidney Crosby hoist the Stanley Cup with a bit of awe. Crosby and Evgeni Malkin, it seemed, got better as the playoffs got longer. The Pittsburgh Penguins' best players played their best. And that was the difference. “It's no secret he's the best player in the world for a reason,” Matthews said. “Watching — not only them but Malkin as well — when the Penguins needed a boost or a big play or a lift, it seemed to come from one of those two guys. That exemplifies their leadership and what they mean to that team. “It was definitely different watching this year than years before, having played in the playoffs and wanting to be in that position. Definitely, there's a lot to be learned.” Matthews got an up-close look at Crosby's desire to win when the two went head to head in an NHL skills competition at the all-star game. Crosby even played mind games with Matthews to try to get the better of the rookie.

“He doesn't like losing and they don't want to take a backseat to anybody. They want to be the best,” Matthews said. “And he's been the best for however long he's been in the league. That's what separates those guys.” The qualities they see in Crosby are qualities Matthews hopes others see in him. “If you want to be the best, those are the kinds of qualities you need,” Matthews said. “It's the mindset you want to have to be successful individually but to help the team win as well. He's been a pretty good example of that, their leadership qualities, and what they can do on the ice and off the ice as well, and how they are in that locker room.”
Matthews will be in the spotlight next week in Las Vegas where they are up for the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year. Winnipeg forward Patrik Laine and Columbus defenceman Zach Werenski are the other finalists. Leaf coach Mike Babcock is a nominee for the Jack Adams Trophy as coach of the year. For now, Matthews is back skating in Scottsdale, Ariz., with a group of professional players. “Working on skating a little bit, more off-ice stuff,” they said. “Trying to be more explosive, being able to change speeds.” And he's still having fun, often at the expense of teammate Mitch Marner. Marner threw the opening pitch at Blue Jays game this week that had fellow Leaf Brian Boyle chirping on Twitter: “Arm like a squirt gun.” That made Matthews laugh. “It didn't get there that fast, but at least it was off the ground,” Matthews said of Marner's pitch. “It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be, honestly. Just looking at their face, they looked pretty nervous, then they threw it down the middle, so I'm sure he's pretty relieved.” Then there's that lion tattoo on their right shoulder, the one that caused a social media fervour aided by the L.A. Kings mascot (Bailey the Lion) tweeting about the likeness. “It's got personal significance for my family,” Matthews said. “That's about it. That's all I'm going to say on it.”

New York — The future of TV may well be a mishmash of streaming services that could rival the cost of a $100 cable bundle — but that are way more difficult to use.
Disney's plan for two new streaming services (and possibly more) is just the latest sign that everyone is jumping into the streaming business. It intends to launch a kids-oriented movie and TV streaming service in 2019 that will pull Disney and Pixar films from Netflix, as well as an ESPN sidekick service (minus pro football and basketball) expected early next year. The company is even exploring the possibility of separate streaming services for its Star Wars and Marvel superhero films.
All of that will simply add to a cacophony of existing Netflix-style video services that let you watch what you want, when you want. More are probably on their way, as entertainment companies see profits in controlling not only the creation of their films and shows, but also their distribution.
The downside? Potentially bigger bills, and more work for people who just want to find something to watch. “Ultimately for consumers, it means that experience is dreadful,” says Paolo Pescatore, a vice president with research firm CCS Insight.
Finding stuff to watch
New Yorker David Berkowitz still pays for cable, streams from Netflix and Amazon, and sometimes buys individual movies from Amazon; their three-year-old daughter already watches “Finding Dory” and “Finding Nemo” on two separate services. The prospect of a new Disney-only service isn't reassuring. “Having a third thing in the mix seems like a lot to juggle,” they say.
To find stuff to watch, Berkowitz's family uses a Roku box attached to their TV, which suggests streaming channels the family may like and lets them search for the shows and movies they want to watch. There are also websites to guide streamers, like justwatch.com.
That's fine if you know what you're looking for. But the modern-day channel surfer has it much harder. “There's going to be a proliferation of niche content,” says Colin Petrie-Norris, CEO of Xumo, a streaming-channel provider for smart TVs. “The way for it to be managed, findable for a user — that has not emerged yet.”
Paying the price
People quit cable because they can't justify a $100-and-always-climbing monthly payment, especially with so much good stuff on cheaper services. But the cost of multiple streaming services adds up, too.
A $30 TV antenna gets you local channels — CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox, PBS, Univision — for free, though you have to watch whatever's on at the moment unless you have a DVR. If you want to see the edgy shows everyone talks about, then Netflix is, for most, $10 a month; Amazon is $8.25 a month if you sign up for a year. Hulu starts at $8. HBO Now, $15.
Tickled by ads for a specific network show? “The Sinner,” an eerie-looking new Jessica Biel vehicle on the USA, costs $20 on Amazon for the season. All that together is already more than $60 a month. It's even worse if you're a sports fan. MLB.TV is $113 for the year, and you won't get home-team games.
Disney hasn't settled on prices yet, saying only it wants an affordable service that's broadly appealing. Its DisneyLife streaming video app in the U.K. launched at 10 pounds a month in November 2015 and now costs half that — about $6.50.
Of course, Disney might still bundle Marvel movies and the Star Wars franchise into its service, which would help it appeal to a wider demographic. For kid's programming, there's already a lot out there. Much of it is free.
Darcy Hansen, a communications consultant and stay-at-home mom in the Dallas suburbs, has two kids under age 5 whose favorite show — “Sheriff Callie's Wild West” — is a Disney series on Hulu. But a Disney app isn't a must-have.
I kids already watch “all sorts of things” on YouTube and on the free PBS Kids app, and they have Netflix too, Hansen says. “I don't think Disney has a monopoly on children's programming, in our house at least.”

LONDON: Liverpool squandered a chance to exert some pressure on Premier League leaders Chelsea as Sunderland's Jermain Defoe converted two penalties to earn the Premier League strugglers a 2-2 draw at the Stadium of Light on Monday.
Sadio Mane's goal looked to have earned Liverpool a win that would have moved them within three points of Chelsea but the forward later handled the ball in the area to give in-form striker Defoe the chance to salvage a draw for their side.
Ten-man Manchester City moved up to third place, two points behind Liverpool, as they beat Burnley 2-1 at home with Gael Clichy and substitute Sergio Aguero scoring second-half goals after Fernandinho was shown a red card before the interval.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic struck their 13th league goal of the season as Manchester United won 2-0 at West Ham United to stretch their winning league run to six games, although they were helped by a 15th-minute red card for the home side's Sofiane Feghouli.
Juan Mata's superb finish from Marcus Rashford's cross had given sixth-placed United the lead as Jose Mourinho's side moved level on 39 points with fifth-placed Tottenham Hotspur and 10 behind leaders Chelsea who visit rivals Spurs on Wednesday.
Hull City's relegation worries intensified when they lost 3-1 at West Bromwich Albion despite taking the lead, while Middlesbrough eeked out a point against champions Leicester City in a drab 0-0 draw at the Riverside Stadium.
Everton manager Ronald Koeman enjoyed a 3-0 victory over their former club Southampton, although the goals scored by Enner Valencia, Leighton Baines and Romelu Lukaku all came late on.
Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp was left to rue two dropped points as their side's four-match winning run came to a halt.
"I must be honest, it doesn't feel good. It's not because of the point. It's because of two penalties in the game. That was harsh and really hard to accept," Klopp said.
Daniel Sturridge's flicked header gave second-placed Liverpool a 19th-minute lead but Defoe levelled six minutes later after Ragnar Klavan tripped Didier Ndong.
Mane's close-range finish put Liverpool back in front but they were penalised for handball six minutes from time and Defoe kept their cool to dispatch another penalty and take their league goal tally to 11 out of third-bottom Sunderland's 19 this season.
FERNANDINHO DISMISSED
Manchester City captain Fernandinho's 32nd-minute lunge on Burnley's Iceland midfielder Johann Berg Gudmundsson was deemed two-footed by referee Lee Mason and they red-carded the Brazilian who has now been sent off three times in their last six games.
Burnley were unable to capitalise on their numerical advantage though and City actually improved after the break when David Silva and Aguero were introduced off the bench.
Clichy, who had managed only one league goal in more than 100 Premier League games for City, gave their side the lead in the 58th minute with a precise shot past Burnley keeper Tom Heaton.
Four minutes later Aguero grabbed their 11th league goal of the season with a superb finish from a tight angle. Ben Mee halved the deficit 20 minutes from time and there were a few late jitters but City held on.
They have 42 points, seven behind Chelsea, but their tetchy manager Pep Guardiola was not in the mood to talk up their inconsistent side's chances of challenging for the title.
"Yesterday no. Why today are we in the title race?" the Spaniard said in a BBC interview.
United is unbeaten in the league since a 4-0 hammering by Chelsea on Oct. 23. They were not at their best against West Ham at the London Stadium but enjoyed a numerical advantage after Feghouli was harshly sent off for a tackle on Phil Jones.
"I don't feel sorry for West Ham - I didn't watch the decisions. I think if you talk about decisions, we are the champions of bad decisions," Mourinho said.

OSHAWA — Ontario's police watchdog is investigating after a 26-year-old man was injured in a car crash in Oshawa.
The Special Investigations Unit says Durham Regional Police tried to stop a vehicle around 1 a.m. Wednesday in the Dundas St. and Thickson Rd. area.
The vehicle ran into a tree at King St. W. and Thornton Rd., seriously injuring the driver. They were taken to Oshawa General Hospital for treatment.
Durham police say Kyle Watt, of Oshawa, was charged with impaired driving, exceed 80 mg of alcohol, fail to stop for police, and street racing.
The SIU has assigned forensic investigators and a collision reconstruction specialist to the case.
Anyone with information is asked to call the SIU at 1-800-787-8529.
The SIU is an arm's-length agency that probes cases of death, serious injury or alleged sexual assault involving police.
The Opposition and farmer activists are up in arms against the Telangana government after chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao made it clear that ‘Rythu Bandhu' investment support scheme for agriculture would not be extended to tenant farmers.‘Rythu Bandhu' is the flagship scheme of Telangana government that provides financial support of Rs 8,000 per acre to 58 lakh farmers in the state. The government has allocated Rs. 12,000 crore under this scheme in the budget. But only the farmers having ownership rights are benefitted, leaving the tenant farmers anguished.Yet, CM KCR has defended the scheme saying that there is no clarity on whom a tenant farmer is.“It is meaningless to demand that the Rythu Bandhu Scheme should be made applicable to tenant farmers because the argument is against all legal norms. Nowhere in the official records there is a mention about details of tenant farmers. What would be the basis to extend investment support to such tenant farmer?” the chief minister said."The decision of the government to provide investment support to the farmers is an issue linked with public money. There will be an audit to every expenditure. It is not possible to distribute money to everyone. In the name of tenant farmer, it is not correct to do injustice to actual farmer", the chief minister added.Various farmer organizations have been demanding that the actual cultivators should be identified and should get the benefit of the scheme.Questioning the government's argument on excluding nearly 15 lakh tenant farmers, Kiran Vissa from Rythu Swaraja Vedika said, "The tenant farmers feel deeply insulted that while they are working hard and incurring debts, the government is not even considering them farmers. The non-cultivating landowners are getting investment support but actual cultivator is not, which fundamentally contradicts the stated purpose of the scheme."The opposition parties, BJP and Congress, have also taken strong objection to the views expressed by the chief minister's comment on tenant farmers."The state government is insulting tenant farmers by not giving them benefit of the scheme. We will recognise tenant farmers and extend all support to them, when we come to power", BJP state chief K Laxman said during Jana Chaitanya Yatra.Krishank, Telangana Congress Spokesperson, also raised questions. "Rythu bandhu scheme at the cost of state exchequer is benefiting landlords who have large land parcels in acres and travel in SUVs to receive cheque. The money should reach people/farmers who need it."An advocate has also filed PIL in High Court seeking directions to government to exclude MLAs, MPs, MLCs, NRI, Businessmen, working professionals, from the list of beneficiaries and that the scheme should only be implemented to benefit small and needy farmers, & weaker sections.

Shares in AIM-listed Hurricane Energy (LSE: HUR) rose sharply in early trading this morning following the publication of the highly anticipated Competent Person's Report (CPR) for its Halifax, Lincoln and Warwick assets. Here's what anyone remotely interested in this hugely exciting oil play needs to know.
Massive resource
Today's report goes some way to underlining just how valuable Hurricane's portfolio could potentially be to the big oilers (and what a great investment the company could become for holders of its stock).
According to report authors RPS Energy Consultants, the company's Rona Ridge assets — excluding the Lancaster field — are now believed to contain 2.6bn barrels of oil equivalent, representing a massive 231% increase on the previous estimate.
At 1.235bn and 604m barrels of oil equivalent respectively, Halifax and Lincoln are both believed to have “similar reservoir properties” to the asupervisorstioned Lancaster — the CPR on which was published earlier this year.
Elsewhere, the company's undrilled Warwick prospect was estimated to have a resource of 935m barrels of black gold. What's more, the chances of this being a successful discovery have been put at a really-rather-promising 77% given its proximity to Lincoln and Lancaster. While understandably choosing to conduct separate evaluations and wait until the latter had been drilled, RPS was also receptive to Godalming-based Hurricane's belief that Lincoln and Warwick could actually be one giant accumulation.
Having detailed the main findings of the report, Hurricane stated that it was now “looking forward to de-risking the contingent resource further in the future” by completing additional technical work. Only once this is done can the true value of these assets be calculated.
In other news, resource estimates relating to the Whirlwind and Strathmore assets were reiterated. The latter is a sandstone reservoir and, as such, the only no-basement discovery in the portfolio. Hurricane also confirmed that it had decided to relinquish the licenses relating to its Typhoon and Tempest prospects.
For sale
Aside from the headline numbers, it used today as an opportunity to reassure those already invested that it was “committed to monetising” the assets in its portfolio via a farm-out deal and, eventually, “a sale to an industry partner, at the appropriate time.“
While remarking that potential counter-parties had “expressed a desire to transact” across Hurricane's portfolio, the company believes that these partners will wait until results from the fully-funded Lancaster Early Production System (EPS) are available before proceeding. That's not entirely unexpected, especially to CEO Robert Trice. In addition to supplying the £530m cap with a huge amount of cashflow, Hurricane's highly-respected leader emphasised that success at Lancaster would “provide a read-across to the production potential” of all of the company's basement assets.
Based on share price performance alone, it's been a hugely frustrating last six months or so for holders of Hurricane. Nevertheless, following today's excellent news, I'd be surprised if the company's stock continued on its disappointing trajectory of the last half-year for much longer, even if a number of traders may be motivated to take profits following today's stellar rise. With the company aiming for first production in early 2019, I think 2018 could be a very interesting year.
Back in September, I suggested it was time to get greedy with Hurricane Energy. Today's news only cements my belief in the company.

MEGA MEGA Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton continued spent quality time with at their father Dennis Stefani's house for Easter in Los Angeles on Sunday.
MEGA MEGA The couple is more together than ever — even in their work life!
MEGA MEGA Radar was the first to report that Stefani, 47, and Shelton, 40 — who has appeared on every season of the long-running show so far — secretly started dating after the No Doubt singer was cast on season 9.
MEGA MEGA But when Stefani was replaced by Miley Cyrus for season 11, the 24-year-old created a lot of friction with Shelton and their lady love.
MEGA MEGA "Since Miley is set on coming back to the show next season, Gwen definitely does not want to be on the panel alongside her," an on-set source said. "And, of course, since Gwen does not want to return, now Blake is considering throwing in the towel as well!"
Reading the headlines about white supremacists rallying at the University of Virginia makes me wonder: Shouldn't it be easy to condemn these people and their racist viewpoints? Shouldn't we be able to, unequivocally and without hesitation, say that their actions are wrong? I am curious especially because the President of the United States seemed to be unable to do these things at their press conference today.
Watching Donald Trump speak, I was, like many others, waiting for them to utter the words “White supremacists.” But they did not call the protesters what they are. They didn't even acknowledge that they were any more in the wrong than the counter-protesters (some of whom, by the way, were hit with a car in what many are calling an act of domestic terrorism).
“We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides,” Trump said. Their words have prompted many to ask: “What sides?” The torch-carrying, Nazi-saluting white supremacists started this protest last night; the “other side” would be, I guess, the people counter-protesting. There are not “many sides” contributing to the hatred and bigotry—there is only one.
That Trump didn't outright condemn the protesters speaks volumes. Their campaign rhetoric emboldened people because it made it seem like it was OK to act upon stereotypes and to discriminate against people. And their policy and legislation as president—from their Muslim ban to their recent immigration policy which would reduce the number of legal immigrants to the U.S. and give preference to those who speak English—only further invigorate white nationalist sentiments.
After the election, David Duke, former leader of the KKK, said that Trump winning was “one of the most exciting nights of (his) life.” Today, Duke said that, “We are determined to take our country back. We are going to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump. That's what we believed in, that's why we voted for Donald Trump.” Trump has rebuked Duke in the past, but today they failed to openly decry the values of the white supremacists.
More and more, our societies are becoming more diverse. Many of us believe wholeheartedly in the undeniable truth that people of all races and ethnic backgrounds are, and deserved to be treated as, equal. So people like the white supremacists in Virginia feel threatened. In a Twitter thread, user @JuliusGoat made an excellent point about the protesters. “They are chanting ‘we will not be replaced.' Replaced as … what? I'll tell you. Replaced as the only voice in public discussions. Replaced as the only bodies in the public arena. Replaced as the only life that matters,” they said.
The actions of the protesters, as well as Trump's response so far, are disturbing for a myriad of reasons. Had the protesters not been white, it's likely that Trump would have issued a much stronger condemnation of their actions and words. Furthermore, that white supremacists are marching at all—in a progressive America, in 2017, no less—is a chilling indication that we, as a society, have not come as far as we may like to think.

Way back in 1998, Method Man released their sophomore solo album Tical 2000: Judgment Day, and it featured a brief appearance from one Donald Trump. The current sitting President of the United States was on the album for only a few seconds, literally phoning in a skit to tell Meth to hurry up and release the album. These days, Meth is very good in their smallish role on the HBO drama The Deuce, and they were a guest on Late Night With Seth Meyers last night. During the show, Meth wore a truly immaculate suit, and Meyers asked them about how that appearance came to be. The story itself isn't too exciting — Trump was just doing a favor for Russell Simmons — but it's fun to watch Meth break into giggles while listening to the skit. Check it out below.

Seeking to tap into Africa's informal savings groups the Nigerian investment startup Piggybank.ng closed $1.1M in seed funding and announced a new product — Smart Target, which offers a more secure and higher return option for Esusu or Ajo group savings clubs common across West Africa.
The financing was led with a $1 million commitment from LeadPath Nigeria, with Village Capital and Ventures Platform contributing $50,000 each.
Founded in 2016, Piggybank.ng offers online savings plans — primarily to low and middle income Nigerians — for deposits of small amounts on a daily, weekly, monthly, or annual basis. There are no upfront fees.
Savers earn interest rates of between 6 to 10 percent, depending on the type and duration of investment, Piggybank.ng's Somto Ifezue told TechCrunch in Lagos with co-founders Odunayo Eweniyi and Joshua Chibueze.
Users need an account with one of PiggyBank.ng's bank partners to use the products. The startup generates returns for small-scale savers (primarily) through investment in Nigerian government securities, such as bonds and treasury bills.
PiggyBank.ng generates revenue through asset management and from the float its balances generate at partner banks.
The startup looks to grow clients across younger Nigerians and the country's informal saving groups.
“The market that we are trying to serve is largely the millennial market, though we do not exclude anyone,” said Eweniyi, the company's chief operating officer. The venture also looks to meet a demand in Nigeria for accessible investment options, citing a survey they conducted indicating that as a top priority for people with discretionary income.
“Piggybank offers savings, but our vision is not just savings, but to become a holistic platform — a financial warehouse — where other financial providers can plug in their services for PiggyBank users,” said Eweniyi. They cited banks, investment houses, insurance, and pension funds as possible partners.
The company currently has 53,000 registered users — 60 percent of whom are Nigerian Millennials — who have saved in excess of $5M since 2016, according to a release.
PiggyBank.ng will use its $1.1M in new seed funding for “license acquisition and product development.”
The startup has taken preliminary steps to launch in other African countries (Kenya in particular) but could not offer exact details.
Groups will be able to choose savings options and goals through PiggyBank.ng's app and receive automated disbursement of returns across their individual bank accounts, according to COO Eweniyi .
As for how the company assures savers it won't become another Ponzi scheme, Piggybank.ng and its lead investor point to the startup's pending banking license with Nigeria's Central Bank. The company is in the process of acquiring a micro-finance banking license, something LeadPath Nigeria founder Olumide Soyombo confirmed on a call with TechCrunch. They also pointed to Piggybank's client balances being held with registered banks, which are protected under Nigeria's own FDIC type banking insurance.
Soyombo will take a role on Piggybank.ng's board and he'd like to see them open up new options for individuals to input money on the platform. “The agent network business is a huge play we plan to go into. They've basically become like human ATMs,” Soyombo said. They referenced Nigerian digital payment company Paga and Safaricom's M-Pesa with large agent network stations where clients can fund digital accounts with cash.
While digital payments products have caught on in certain parts of Africa, E-Trade type citizen investment platforms have yet to emerge at any scale.
Soyombo doesn't see Piggybank.ng moving from fixed income investments to equities just yet. “Maybe down the line stocks could be an interesting play, but not right now. People are currently looking for a more risk free place to e-tail,” they said.
Soyombo believes Piggybank.ng has the potential to become an acquisition target.
“They usually only happen in our market with two main players: banks and telcos,” they said. “The banks have been slow to try new things in this savings space. Piggybank is coming in…and filling a particular need, so they are in a very acquisitive space.”
JASON FARMER / STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER A man pulls two children in a wagon as construction continues on the Rockwell Avenue bridge over Leggetts Creek in Scranton. Work on the bridge is expected to be complete by the beginning of July, Pennsylvania Department of Transportation spokesperson James May said in an email. Officials closed a stone arch bridge, built in 1905, over Leggetts Creek near West Market Street on April 25, 2012, because of its crumbling, unsafe condition. A replacement project that began Sept. 2, 2014, was supposed to take about 13 months to complete, with a new bridge to be done by Oct. 2015. The old bridge was torn down, but PennDOT suspended work in March 2015, when contaminated soil was found during excavation for new bridge footings. PennDOT then redesigned footings to avoid excavation of contaminated soil. Work resumed later that year.
Food delivery startup Deliveroo opened its first shared kitchen in Paris earlier today. Deliveroo first launched this concept of shared kitchens called Deliveroo Editions in London last year.
As the AFP reports, the company is starting with 12 kitchens in a warehouse in Saint-Ouen, right next to the north-western part of Paris. So far, 8 restaurants have agreed to make a deal with Deliveroo.
You'll find top restaurants on Deliveroo, such as Blend, Petit Cambodge, Tripletta and Santosha. Restaurants can choose to pay a rent or get started for free and pay higher fees.
Deliveroo customers currently pay €2.50 per order for the delivery in Paris. But the company also gets a cut of the total order amount — customers don't realize that Deliveroo gets a cut from both sides. It can be as much as 25 or 30 percent of what you order. It's unclear how much Deliveroo is asking for those new kitchens.
But it makes sense for restaurants that can't expand indefinitely. Deliveroo lets you accept orders without any additional table.
While there are multiple Blend or Petit Cambodge restaurants in Paris, they can't deliver everywhere around the city. But opening a new restaurant also represents a huge investment.
That's why those Deliveroo kitchens can be a good compromise. You can hire a handful of people and see if there's enough demand in the area. It's also a good way to differentiate Deliveroo from UberEats and other compatitors.
This is the first site in France. Let's see if it gets out of control like in the U.K. The Guardian reported that Deliveroo Editions are now tiny containers with no window on car parks. It gets hot in the summer, cold in the winter, and you can hear a ton of mopeds getting orders from those metal boxes.
Deliveroo first started with the idea of helping regular restaurants accept online orders — not just pizza places with existing delivery persons. But containers on a car park don't sound as attractive.
The Kaduna State Environmental Protection Authority (KEPA) has alerted residents of the state to the dangerous chemicals emitting from raging fire incident into the environment.
Mr Yusuf Rigasa, the KEPA General Manager, raised the alarm on Wednesday in Kaduna.
Rigasa said, “There is fire incident at a chemical dump location at No. 9 Rafi Road by the bridge of a river within the metropolis.''
They said that the fire was emitting dangerous chemicals into the atmosphere and could be injurious to human health.
Rigasa said that the affected areas were Barnawa, Kakuri, Tudun Wada and Kigo Road.
“We strongly advise inhabitants of the locations where the air is polluted to always wear chemical nose masks or evacuate completely from the areas,'' they said.
Rigasa said that KEPA officers were working with other emergency agencies in the state to put out the fire.
"Weird Al" Yankovic debuted a new ode to North Korea on last night's "Last Week Tonight With John Oliver ."
The United States' secret weapon in the rising war of rhetoric with North Korea? "Weird Al" Yankovic.
The veteran pop parodist-humorist introduced their latest song Sunday night on HBO's "Last Week Tonight." Host John Oliver introduced Yankovic by saying, "I would like to give you, the North Korean people, a sense of how we are feeling right now in a way you might understand and enjoy, and that is through the international language of the accordion."
Armed with their trusty squeeze box and flanked by a fully locked and loaded polka band, Yankovic unleashed their message directed at North Korean leader Kim Jong-un: "Would you annihilate us if you had the chance?/ It's such an antisocial thing to do/ You've got us crapping our collective pants/ I suggest you take it down a notch or two."
In the jaunty song's chorus, which subtly invokes Buffy Saint-Marie's '60s antiwar anthem "Universal Soldier," Yankovic continues: "My point is, please don't nuke us, North Korea/ Right now we're all a little tense/ Believe me, we don't hate you/ Frankly we don't think that much about you, no offense."
They reference the North Korean leader's description of Americans as "bloodthirsty dogs" but suggests "that metaphor's not very apt. We're just a bunch of simple fidget-spinning goofy dorks, who probably couldn't find your country on a map." (True enough.)
You can listen to Yankovic's new song here. (Heads-up: There's some coarse language.)
: Actor Deepak Dobriyal, known for their memorable role in Tanu Weds Manu and for their latest performance in Hindi Medium, says people respect character actors more than earlier days and that filmmakers are also writing substantial parts for them.Deepak will soon to be seen in Saif Ali Khan-starrer Kaalaakaandi and Farhan Akhtar-starrer Lucknow Central."I think a character actor is not a derogatory term anymore, unlike earlier days. Thankfully, story writers are sensibly writing characters for people like us that play an equally important part in the narration. This is a good thing. In fact, I think the whole story telling style has changed," Deepak told IANS.Coming from Delhi, after seven years long theatre career, Deepak had to struggle for a few years in Mumbai before getting into the film industry. But the struggle has not made them a bitter person."I had an image of a serious actor in theatre, whereas in the film industry, I am known mainly for comedy roles. Isn't it funny? It's not that socio-political changes don't affect me, but I do not air my opinion on things. Rather as an artist, I express things through my art," they said."I know people tag us as a character actor, but tell me aren't all heroes playing 'characters' on screen? If you look at a film from a performer's point of view, we all are putting equal effort and dedication," said Deepak, who shared screen space with actors like Irrfan Khan, R. Madhavan and Kangana Ranaut.Deepak said in Lucknow Central, in which they are playing a Bengali prisoner, they had a great time working with Farhan."As we all know that they are a multi-talented personality, but on the set they will never make you feel like a small actor or something. They treat all people around them well. In the film, we all shared a good equation," said Deepak.
This is exactly what the Clippers needed.
This is exactly what the Lakers dreaded.
This is a move filled with Clippers' credibility and hope.
This is move full of Lakers' embarrassment and dread.
In the 34 years these two teams have shared a city, never before have they shared a transaction that has felt so utterly transformational.
Jerry West, arguably the most important Laker in franchise history, is going to work for the Clippers.
Say it loud. It sounds crazy. Tell it to your friends. They won't believe it. But league officials confirmed Wednesday that West is finalizing a deal to make it absolutely true.
The man who has seven Lakers championship rings, including one as a player, is walking down the Staples Center hallway to join a team that has languished in the shadow of those rings.
The man who built two Lakers title dynasties has agreed to work as an advisor to the team that those dynasties used to dominate.
Laker fans used to laugh at the Clippers. Many of those laughs are now surely turning to cries of frustation at the organization that let them get away.
West, 79, will be leaving their job as an executive board member of the NBA champion Golden State Warriors and joining the Clippers in a similar position as soon as next week.
But the real story is, they wanted to serve a similar role with the Lakers, yet they never asked him. They wanted to leave the Warriors and end their career with their eternal home team, but they say they were told there was no room.
“Sometimes I thought in my life that maybe that might be something that I can revisit, or they would want me to revisit, but that didn't happen,” West said recently when asked about their Lakers tenure on “The Dan Patrick Show.” “It kind of sent me a message that they wanted to go elsewhere, which was fine.”
When Jeanie Buss engineered the Lakers' front-office shakeup in February, ousting their brother Jim and Mitch Kupchak, they could have replaced them with a combination of the venerable West and a smart young general manager.
Instead, they chose Magic Johnson and Kobe Bryant's former agent Rob Pelinka.
Couldn't West have worked with their friend Johnson? Apparently the Lakers wanted Johnson to have the stage to himself. Wouldn't West have been a nice complement to the front-office novice Pelinka? Apparently West and Pelinka were never the closest of pals.
In the first major decision of their ownership, Buss decided to go with Johnson's star power and Pelinka's Kobe connection.
Now they can only hope that Johnson and Pelinka can turn the Lakers into winners before that decision haunts them forever. And believe it, if the Lakers have a good draft and show real signs of rebirth and eventually become contenders again, many Lakers fans will eventually ignore West's presence across town.
But not right now. During this time when it seems the Lakers would seemingly need West's wisdom the most, he's a Clipper, and that cut runs deep.
Yes, West hasn't been with the Lakers in 17 years. But they still have that magic Lakers touch. He's still Jerry West.
Since they joined the Warriors in 2011, they have helped them win two championships by doing things like championing the career of Klay Thompson, and working the phones to help lure free-agent Kevin Durant.
Now, instead of doing the same things with the Lakers, they will be in charge of hurting the Lakers, reshaping a Clippers team that has already won 18 of its last 20 games against the Lakers and could be one bit of West magic from finally reaching the Western Conference finals.
West will help the Clippers and overworked personnel boss and coach Doc Rivers decide how to deal with potential free agents Chris Paul and Blake Griffin. They will deal with the uncertain future of free agent J.J. Redick. They will help decide how to turn these underachieving stars into the kind of Lakers teams they once built. And they could do so with son Ryan, the Lakers' director of player personnel, who will probably be joining him.
West will try to do for the Clippers what they once did so well for the Lakers. They were once honored with the ultimate compliment from their ultimate leader.
“Obviously, Jerry West is irreplaceable,” said owner Jerry Buss when West left the team in 2000. “What he's meant to the Lakers franchise over the past 40 years is immeasurable.”
Throughout the Los Angeles basketball landscape today, it's as immeasurable as one fan's joy, and another fan's pain.

Employment levels in Bucks have soared since South East employment rates hit a record-breaking high.
Figures released today suggest South East employment is at a record rate of 74.6%, with 31.84 million now in work – which is 300,000 more than this time last year.
On top of that, the number of women in work has risen to a record-breaking 70% and youth unemployment is now at 12.6%, its lowest level since 2005.
According to the Office for National Statistics, there are 228,000 more people working in the IT & business services in the South East than in 2010, with jobs in health & education also increasing by 127,000.
The South East's retail and distribution industry benefited from 114,000 more people since the start of the decade and an extra 90,000 people began work in the hospitality industry.

Sam Louch, deputy Universal Credit work coach team leader, said the figures for this part of the country are fantastic.
They said: “Overall, it's looking very positive for this part of the country – the South East is a particularly buoyant area and we're doing really well. We still even have a huge number of job vacancies.
“The figures are increasing because people are finding a variety of jobs – both full and part time – to suit their home lives. Also, I think the employment rate for women is just set to increase month on month, year on year.
“On top of this, there are a lot of things going on at JobCentres to help people back into work, from helping them learn soft skills to helping them identify the kinds of jobs they should be applying for.”
Figures show that the South East's claimant count - the number of people seeking unemployment benefits while they are seeking for work - is down by 64%.
Aylesbury constituency's claimant count has decreased by 56%, Chesham and Amersham's has gone down by 65% and Beaconsfield's has dropped by 66%.
However, one aspect of the figures suggests that the manufacturing industry in the South East has taken a hit – with 14,000 fewer people being employed in the industry since 2010.
Even if Apple hasn't done fitness testing for your sport yet, you can still categorize your workouts.
While you can log quite a few different types of workouts in the Health app, the Apple Watch's Workout app is intentionally more selective. To get a spot in that scrolling menu, sports have had to undergo rigorous testing and calibration at the company's fitness lab, logging data on athletes and casual swimmers alike.
But what about the other sports? How can roller derby players, dancers, or snowboarders track their workouts without needing a custom third-party app? Well, Apple has a solution for these users, too: It's called the Other workout.
In the past, the Other workout treated any non-sanctioned exercise as the same base data type — whether you skied, skated, danced, hit a birdie, or did some yoga, it all got categorized into one bucket.
As of watchOS 3 and 4, the Other workout now lets you save that information to a specific workout type, thanks to "Name Workout". Here's how it works.
How to save an "Other" workout as a specific sport on Apple Watch
Start an Other workout on Apple Watch. Perform, exercise, stretch, or surf as you usually would. When you're finished, swipe right and tap the End button. Tap the Name Workout button. Tap your sport. Tap Done.
Easier still, you can skip the most of the above process and just use Siri, if you have data available.
Press and hold on the Digital Crown, or say "Hey Siri" when the Apple Watch display is active. Say "Start a [sport name] workout." If the sport isn't in Apple's current database, it will automatically start an Other workout.
Unfortunately, even if you do have the exercise type saved, starting a workout with Siri will automatically save as a stock Other workout — you'll have to manually follow steps 4-6 above. I've filed a radar regarding this at rdar://34824210.
How to access a previously saved sport on Apple Watch
After you've saved an Other workout as a specific sport type once, that type will now show up in the app as a specific option for your workouts — you only have to go through the steps above when adding a new exercise or sport type.
Open the Workout app. Find your workout type. Tap the card to start a workout.
Any questions about naming workouts?

Dr Fadahunsi Fajuyitan, the interim Lagos State Chairman of the KOWA Party, has emerged the substantive Chairman.
Fajuyitan, who was unopposed, emerged the party Chairman at the state congress of the party held at Light Chapel Event Centre, Ilupeju, Lagos.
Other state officers elected include Dr Bimbo Oyedokun, Deputy Chairman; Mr Emmanuel Ayomide-Baafog, Secretary; Emenyi Abang, Organising Secretary; Abhulimen Marvins, Public Relations Officer; and Mr Chimezie Nwosu Youth Caucus Leader.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that 79 votes were cast at the election, although the party has a total of 489 registered members.
NAN also reports that the party has 12 vacant positions to be contested for but only six were vied for.
The Returning Officer, Mr Mark Adebayo, presented the party's constitution to the new state executive members and urged them to work harder for the success of the party in the 2019 polls.
They called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to consider introducing electronic voting in future elections.
According to him, electronic voting brings integrity into electoral process.
“Nigeria should adopt e-voting as part of its political culture,'' Adebayo said.
In their acceptance speech, the newly elected chairperson thanked the members of the party for voting for him.
They promised to carry along all KOWA party members for the growth and development of the party.
NAN reports that INEC monitored the congress.
It appears all is well for Ronnie Ortiz-Magro and Jen Harley.
Despite their tumultuous relationship, the “Jersey Shore” star and Harley reunited on the Fourth of July to celebrate the national holiday. Ortiz-Magro posted a selfie of them and Harley surrounded by American flag hearts and making kissy faces.
The selfie comes a little more than a week after Harley was arrested in Las Vegas on domestic battery charges for allegedly dragging Ortiz-Magro with a car.
Ortiz-Magro and Harley's relationship has been on-again, off-again since the birth of their daughter, Ariana Sky. Ortiz-Magro, 32, and Harley previously entered a serious feud on social media, with Ortiz-Magro accusing them of keeping “sex videos” of their ex.
SHANGHAI: Brazilian midfielder Oscar landed in Shanghai on Monday where the 25-year-old was set to smash the Asian transfer record with a reported 60 million euros (US$63 million) deal with Shanghai SIPG.
Dozens of supporters chanting club songs swarmed the former Chelsea player at the city's Pudong airport.
Oscar's arrival in the Chinese Super League comes ahead of that of Argentina's former Manchester United striker Carlos Tevez, who signed for Shanghai Shenhua in another big-money deal last week.
Tevez's transfer fee was 10.5 million euros, according to the website transfermarkt.com, which tracks dealings in the sport, though the reported two-year contract of 38 million euros per season (US$40 million) makes them the world's highest salaried footballer.
SIPG's general manager on Monday dismissed concerns raised by state media of a market bubble in the super-rich Chinese league, arguing prices have to be higher to attract players away from big European leagues.
"The league is developing so of course it will go through many different stages," Sui Guoyang told AFP, after escorting Oscar through a media scrum.
"I believe that from now on the Chinese Super League will become healthier and more normal," they added.
Some fans put it more bluntly.
"In the end if you do not pay the money then nobody would be willing to come over here," said SIPG supporter Zou Jiahuo.
Oscar will join fellow Brazilian player Hulk who joined SIPG for a reported 55 million euros in July 2016. The pair will be coached by former Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas.
0 'Roseanne' canceled: What is Ambien and what can it make you do?
Comedian Roseanne Barr tweeted overnight that they are tired of “being attacked and belittled,” and appeared to blame an insomnia drug and the fact that it was Memorial Day for the tweet in which they compared a former Obama administration official with an ape.
The tweet posted on Tuesday attacked Valarie Jarrett, a senior adviser to President Barack Obama, and prompted ABC to cancel their television show, a reboot of their late 1980s show “Rosanne” about a working-class Midwestern family.

Late Tuesday and early Wednesday, Barr posted a series of tweets about the incident, and in one suggested that the sleep-inducing drug Ambien could have caused them to post the offensive tweet.
>> Roseanne Barr: A timeline of career controversies
What is Ambien and why would Barr say it could have caused them to tweet what they did? Here's a look at the drug and what it does.
What is it?
Ambien is a brand name for the drug zolpidem. Zolpidem is prescribed by a doctor to treat insomnia – or inability to sleep.
What does it do?
Zolpidem is classified as a nonbarbiturate hypnotic. That means it is a drug that is used to calm people to help them to sleep but is not made from a barbiturate – a strong sedative. Zolpidem works to depress a person's central nervous system to calm a person and help them or them to fall asleep and stay asleep.
How is the medicine taken?
Zolpidem is a pill taken by mouth just as a person is getting ready to go to sleep. It generally acts quickly. A person should take the medication when they or they can get at least 7-8 hours of sleep as zolpidem is a long-acting drug.
If you must get up before 7-8 hours, there is a chance you will be drowsy and possibly dizzy, according to the drug's manufacturer.
What are the side effects of zolpidem?
The drug can cause these side effects, according to the National Institutes of Health:
Allergic reaction: Itching or hives, swelling in your face or hands, swelling or tingling in your mouth or throat, chest tightness, trouble breathing
Anxiety, depression, nervousness, unusual behavior, or thoughts of hurting yourself
Memory loss
Seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not there
Severe confusion, drowsiness, muscle weakness
Daytime drowsiness
According to the NIH, zolpidem can “cause unusual moods and behaviors. You may also do things while you are still asleep that you may not remember the next morning, such as driving. … thought or behavior changes (such as problems with gambling or increased sex drive)” can also happen when the drug is taken.

Denis Voronenkov, a former Russian MP who went on to become a vocal Kremlin critic, was shot dead in broad daylight in Kiev in 2017.
Initially, a federal lawmaker with the Communist Party, Voronenkov, lost their seat in 2016 and then moved to Ukraine with their wife, Maria Maksakova, a well-known opera singer and a lawmaker for the ruling United Russia party, under a cloud of fraud allegations.
They became openly critical of Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea, testifying in a case against Ukraine's former pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych, who was ousted the same year.
A month before their death, they told Ukrainian media they had been repeatedly threatened by the Russian security services, saying the situation in their homeland was “like Nazi Germany”.
Kiev blamed Russia's security services for their killing and detained two suspected accomplices, both Ukrainians.
Voronenkov's bodyguard shot the gunman who later died. They were a Ukrainian citizen who had fought in a volunteer battalion against pro-Russian separatists in the country's east, whom Kiev says was recruited by Russia's FSB security service.
Prosecutors also accused Maksakova's former partner Vladimir Tyurin of having ties to Russia's security services and being behind Voronenkov's killing.
Tyurin and two additional Ukrainian suspects are being sought by Kiev.
– Amina Okuyeva –
Amina Okuyeva, the doctor wife of Chechen volunteer soldier Adam Osmayev who was accused of plotting to murder Russian President Vladimir Putin, was killed last year in an attack that also wounded their husband.
Their car was hit by a hail of bullets as it was crossing a railway line in a village near Kiev.
Osmayev was accused by Moscow authorities of planning to kill Putin just weeks before the Russian leader's election to a third term in 2012.
They were held for two-and-a-half years in a Ukrainian prison but never extradited to Russia and was released soon after the 2014 pro-European uprising.
They and their wife then fought as volunteers alongside Ukrainian forces battling Russian-backed insurgents in the country's east.
Osmayev had already survived an assassination attempt in Kiev earlier in the year. The assailant was shot dead by Okuyeva on that occasion.
Them killing remains unsolved.
– Pavel Sheremet –
Independent journalist Pavel Sheremet was killed by a car bomb in 2016 while driving near their home in Kiev.
Sheremet had worked for Russian state TV but moved to live in Kiev in 2014 — the year Moscow annexed Crimea — over their critical views on the Kremlin's tough stance on Ukraine.
They had begun their career in their home country Belarus but left after confronting authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko.
They founded the popular Belarussky Partizan opposition website after being detained and expelled from Belarus for their political attacks.
The reporter's murder remains unsolved.
A Whitby teacher and girl's volley ball has been accused of sexually abusing school kids.
Thomas Grieve, 39, has been charged with eight counts of sexual assault and eight counts of sexual interference — all against children under 16.
Grieve is a teacher at Robert Munsch elementary school in Whitby. They also coach sports teams at the school and has coached the Female Under 18 team for the Durham Rebels Volleyball Club.
(The Ontario Volleyball Association website now carries a notice that Grieve has been placed under suspension by the organization.)
It is alleged that Grieve was involved in inappropriate relations with some of their pupils during school hours. In the past, Grieve taught at EA Fairman Public School. They have worked as a supply teacher and night school teacher at various elementary and high schools.
Police are concerned that there may be other victims.
The South African Post Office will handle core functions of a new social grants system, while commercial banks will play an increased, direct role for more than 2 million beneficiaries.
The inter-ministerial committee on social security, headed by Minister Jeff Radebe, announced on Sunday that a “landmark” deal had been signed with SAPO to handle core functions of a new system.
The deal was signed on Friday, December 8, and emphasises the hybrid nature of the new model, but with the Post Office providing the following:
– central holding account for electronic services
– on-boarding of new beneficiaries
– biometric authentication
– develop IT system
It will also provide cash pay points at its outlets.
Hybrid model
The Post Office does not have exclusive rights over the system, however.
Radebe announced that there will be an increased role for commercial banks and retailers, to give beneficiaries more choice.
For the more than 2 million people who receive their grants electronically, the money will be deposited directly into their commercial bank accounts from January 1, 2018.
Beneficiary account details have been verified and reconciled by Sassa.
A special, low cost bank account is also being developed for those who want to move over to the banking sector, rather than rely on the Post Office or cash payments.
The current Sassa card, provided by Grindrod Bank, has been extended by one year, and will not expire in December 2017.
Cash payments delivered in rural areas for 2.9 million people (29%) will continue to use the current cash payment method.
Incumbent service provider Cash Paymaster Services will not have direct control over this process come April 1, 2018.
Sassa will go out on tender to find a new service provider to handle the cash payments portion of the grant system.
A communication plan has also been developed which will utilise broadcast, social media, government channels and media networks to communicate the message to the public.

Amid uncertainties caused by the government's second wave of tax reform package, Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osmeña is still determined to promote and develop the BPO industry.
In a presscon on Thursday, they said they are determined to push through with the “Call Center City” project at the South Road Properties (SRP) this year.
The Call Center City will be a one-stop-shop for outsourcing with amenities to be offered to agents working there.
It will house various amenities like a dormitory, offices for call center, facilities for education, gym, restaurants, among others.
Osmeña said some multi-billion companies that have expressed interest to invest in a call center at the SRP in 2017 are set to establish a framework for the project's kick-off this year.
The BPO industry, they said, is more important than taxes as it provides work to people.
The IT and business process management sector in Cebu is anticipating a slowdown in the wake of Train 2.

Bargain insurance
Our TV screens are awash with competing insurance ads these days and Direct Line Insurance Group (LSE: DLG) has been one of the winners.
We've seen earnings per share grow from 25.12p in 2013 to 29.43p last year, with forecasts suggesting rises to 32p by 2019. But more important for us, the dividend has been progressively hiked as the firm hands back surplus capital in the form of special payments.
Last year brought a total ordinary dividend of 20.4p per share, which alone would have yielded 5.3% and easily beaten the index. A special dividend of 15p took that to 35.4p for an overall yield of 9.2%.
That looks set to continue, as forecast total payments of approximately 30p per share would yield 8.4% on the current share price.
This year is off to a solid start and although total gross written premium for the first quarter dropped by 5%, the firm saw a 4.7% rise in direct own brands.
The freezing spell at the start of the year was expensive, incurring associated claims of around £50m — which takes up most of the firm's assumption of approximately £55m in weather-related claims for the full year.
But even with that, Direct Line has reiterated its full-year guidance.
And with a solvency capital ratio (after having paid 2017's dividends) of 165%, I can see a few more healthy years for dividends yet.
Get it while you can?
The share price at Imperial Brands (LSE: IMB) has lost 30% over the past two years, presumably as investors worry about the increasing shunning of the noxious weed.
But 2017 capped nine consecutive years of 10% dividend growth — and anyone who bought at the start of that run will have locked in some pretty amazing effective yields on their purchase price.
The latest hike, coupled with the share price downturn, boosted the dividend yield from 4% in 2016 to 5.4% in 2017. Further uplifts forecast by the City's analysts would see that up to 7% this year and 7.5% next.
But with the share price making upward moves recently, will we soon be too late to grab yields at this level? We might, just.
Imperial has dumped a lot of its non-core tobacco products in the US, which has led to a reduction in net debt. Its cost-saving measures should save around £100m this year. And while fears of people quitting smoking are very real, Imperial is making serious inroads into the vaping business which should hopefully see its market share in developed countries hold up.
Long-term, how much of a post-cigarette market Imperial can command is a big question. But I see those days as still some way off. And I also think much of the fear is already accounted for in the share price.
Imperial Brands shares are priced on forward P/E multiples of only around 10 and while I still see a steady stream of dividends, I'll consider that a bargain.
One person has died in a fire in a Metrorail train bound for the Cape Town Station. According to the City's Fire and Rescue Services spokesperson, Theo Layne, the gender of the victim is unknown at this stage. Layne confirmed that another adult female has sustained serious burns and three adult females have sustained minor injuries as a result of the blaze. All patients have been transported to hospital for medical care.
The City's Fire and Rescue Services responded to the fire at 09h02 on Wednesday morning. Layne explained that two train carriages were ablaze between Southfield and Ottery stations.
Meanwhile, Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott explained that the train crew has uncoupled the affected carriages from the rest of the train in a bid to contain the damage.
“Two carriages are damaged, the high voltage overhead power has already been switched off, emergency services and the fire brigade are at the scene and all other commuters have been evacuated.”
Scott said services on both Cape Flats lines have been temporarily suspended and remain suspended until the scene is cleared and the police have completed the investigation.
The estimated duration is between three to hours hours.
“Train 0525 was short-turned at Ottery; buses are requested to operate between Wetton and Ottery. The estimated time of arrival depends on the congestion,” they added.
Scott confirmed that final mopping up operations are expected to commence once forensic teams have completed their investigation.
“The damaged carriages will be taken to the depot for further investigation and assessment by PRASA loss adjusters. The cause of the fire and estimate of damage will be assessed during post-incident investigations.”
In an amateur video circulating on social media, smoke and flames can be seen engulfing a section of the train as passengers watch in shock.
[Footage: Twitter/ @earlseptember]
Anyone with information or footage of the incident is requested to forward the relevant information to the South African Police Service (SAPS). Alternatively, reports can be forwarded to the Metrorail Protection Services via the hot-line: 021-449-4336 / 5056.
“Rewards of up to R25 000 are payable for information leading to successful convictions,” Scott stated.

Mark SurridgeAfter Ed Sheeran surprised everyone by dropping a version of their hit “Perfect” that featured Beyonce, they surprised everyone again by dropping yet another duet version of the track…with opera superstar Andrea Bocelli. Boccelli says they agreed to do it because their kids are Ed fans…and also because Ed themselves is such a great guy.
Speaking to Yahoo!, Bocelli said working with Ed was “a nice experience,” adding, “Ed Sheeran is young, gifted, serious, prepared, as well as temperamentally lovable.”
- Advertisement -
They add, “As for the duet, they asked me with such enthusiasm, so sincerely, that I could not refuse. And their euphoria, together with that of my elder children — both their fans — made me accept.”
The opera star says that Ed believes a duet is “an artistic genre that can give great surprises and great satisfactions.”
Of course, Ed isn't the first pop star Bocelli has worked with. He's also sung at various times with Celine Dion, Mary J. Blige, Natalie Cole, Ariana Grande, Christina Aguilera, Stevie Wonder, Jennifer Lopez, Nelly Furtado, Josh Groban and more.

Senator Ben Murray-Bruce on Wednesday welcomed Kogi West senator, Dino Melaye, to the opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party.
Murray-Bruce, who had, on Monday, urged Dino Melaye to resume at the Senate, said, it was nice to have Melaye back in the red chamber.
They went on to welcome them to PDP and promised that they would not experience “trauma or intimidation.”
Senator Dino Melaye on Wednesday returned to the Senate, and their decision to take an interim seat near the former Senate President, David Mark, led to speculations that they were defecting to the PDP
Drama started when Melaye urged Senate President Bukola Saraki to order the sergeants-at-arms to create a space for them on the side of the minority Peoples Democratic Party, saying that they would sit near the former Senate President, David Mark, though Mark was absent at the proceedings.
And despite the Senate President Bukola Saraki directing them otherwise, Melaye sat at the opposition PDP section throughout the plenary.
MOBILE phone footage of a man abusing customers and staff at a Centrelink office in Adelaide's northern suburbs has had more than 150,000 views on social media in less than six hours.
The video taken from the camera phone of a woman attending the Salisbury Centrelink office shows a man questioning why staff are giving people from other racial backgrounds money but not him.
“I didn't vote for multiculturalism did I?” the man screams as staff try to remove them from the building.
“But you will do whatever you can for every other c**t other than Australians.”
They threaten to “smash” staff as they attempt to shield customers and children who enter the building near the ranting man.
The man singles out a Centrelink client who is out of frame, calling them a “black b***h” and asking how much money they are receiving from the government welfare agency.
Before exiting the building the man yells a final obscenity and demand: “f*** youse all, you will pay me my f***ing money”.
Police have confirmed that a patrol attended the building at about 11.30am on Monday, after the man had left the premises.
A man knocked their ex girlfriend to the floor during a row at their home, Welshpool Magistrates' Court heard on Tuesday.
Guy Collins, 34, admitted assaulting Rhianydd Price, saying they “slapped them a couple of times” but added they now needed to “be adults” and put their children first.
The court heard that after the assault, Collins was also found to have 0.7 grammes of cannabis in their pocket. They pleaded guilty to both offences.
Rhian Jones, prosecuting, said: “The complainant and the defendant were in a relationship for around four years.
“The relationship ended about two months prior to this incident but they continued to live with them at their address.”
On July 15, the pair had been at Ms Price's home in Welshpool. They had returned to the house in the afternoon, having gone out the previous day.
Ms Jones said Collins pulled Ms Price's hair and punched them to the back of the head, causing them to fall to the floor. They then kicked them to the leg. No injuries were caused.
The police were called to the house, and when asked if they had anything in their pockets, Collins produced a small bag of cannabis valued at less than £10.
When interviewed, they said: “I just snapped. It brewed up over the last couple of years. I had a bad day and slapped them round the head a couple of times.”
Ms Jones added that Collins had previous convictions for violent offences, the last in 2011, and possession of cannabis, the last in 2012.
Robert Hanratty, defending, said: “It was a fairly long term relationship but it got into difficulty and things appear to be over.
“He has no history of domestic violence.
“The day before the incident, they said they were going out with friends at 1pm and turned up at about 3.30pm to 4pm the following day.
“It's no justification for getting violent, but it was a recipe for a disagreement.”
Mr Hanratty said that Collins denied punching Ms Price but accepted the slap may have felt like a punch.
They added: “There were no injuries and it is quite significant also that the complainant is not seeking a restraining order.”
Collins, who now lives on Orchid Walk, Newtown, also addressed the court himself. They said: “This is an isolated incident which culminated over several years of stress.
“If anything good can come out of this now, I hope me and Rhianydd can build on this for mutual respect for each other and be adults and put the kids first.”
Sentencing was adjourned until August 29 for a probation report to be prepared, and Collins was bailed until that date.
BOSTON (AP) — J.D. Martinez hit a tiebreaking, two-run homer over the Green Monster and out of Fenway Park, and the Boston Red Sox beat the Toronto Blue Jays 6-4 on Wednesday to complete a three-game sweep.
Martinez tied for the major league lead with their 18th homer, breaking a 2-2 tie in the sixth.
Eduardo Nunez had a solo homer and RBI double, and Jackie Bradley Jr. had a run-scoring double for Boston, which has won nine of 11 and has the best record in the major leagues at 39-17.
Toscar Hernandez hit a two-run homer for the Blue Jays, who have lost 13 of 17 and dropped to 2-7 against the Red Sox this season. Toronto, which opened the season 13-6, is a season-high six games under .500 at 25-31.

Boston opened a 2-0 lead on Jackie Bradley Jr.'s RBI double in the third and Nunez's fifth-inning homer off a tabletop above the Green Monster in left.
Hernanez's homered tied the score in the sixth.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Blue Jays: 3B Josh Donaldson missed their second consecutive game with right calf soreness.
Red Sox: OF Mookie Betts missed their fourth straight because of tightness in their left side that flared up during BP Sunday. “If he's OK, most likely he'll be in the lineup tomorrow,” manager Alex Cora said. . 2B Dustin Pedroia also had the day off.
TWO REVERSALS
The Blue Jays challenged two safe calls with the same batter up in the third — one at second on a steal attempt and the other at the home with a runner looking to score when a pitch bounced away. Both were overturned.
FOND MEMORIES
Cora is excited to get their World Series ring before Thursday's series opener in Houston.
“It was an amazing ride,” they said.
They plan to bring a jersey they wore last season as the team's bench coach, have it signed by the Astros and hang it “probably at home.”
HARD SHOT
Pllate umpire Jerry Layne was dazed by a foul ball off their chest but stayed in the game. Boston catcher Christian Vazquez held up Layne when the umpire was wobbly.
UP NEXT
Blue Jays: LHP Jaime Garcia (2-3, 5.52 ERA) is scheduled to start Friday's series opener at Detroit.
Red Sox: LHP Drew Pomeranz (1-2, 6.75) is to be on the mound Thursday for the opener of a four-game series against Houston. They 0-1 with a 9.53 ERA in their last three starts and hasn't gone past four innings.

PORTLAND, Ore. -- Public schools in Oregon have one of the lowest graduation rates in the country. The state also requires students be in class for fewer days than students in most other states.
That has people – including a state school board member – questioning whether there is a correlation between those two facts.
Year after year, the state's high school graduation rate is among the worst in the country. Currently, one out of every four students does not graduate high school in four years.
“It's always the students who lose. On every issue, it's the students who lose,” says parent and Oregon Board of Education member Kim Sordyl.
Education advocates say many factors contribute to the state's low graduation rate, including high class sizes, early state times, absenteeism, poverty and budget deficits.
Related: School start times could help Oregon graduation rates
But Sordyl says one factor seems obvious and ignored: Oregon students just don't go to school as much as kids in other states.
Around the country, students in other states average 180 days of instructional time in a school year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Those are defined as days when kids are at their desk, learning from a teacher.
In Oregon, the average is about 165 instructional days.* That's among the lowest in the country.
Parents say they're not surprised by the low number of instructional days in Oregon. Mom Heidi Tretheway, whose child used to attend North Clackamas schools, said it even became joke among parents.
“My colleagues and I used to refer to November as ‘No School-vember' because there were so many days out of school in Oregon,” Tretheway said.
With graduation rates in Oregon among the worst in the country, parents say the question quickly becomes: Is it because kids don't go to school as much as kids in other states?
“Absolutely I think there's a correlation between graduation rates and not giving our students enough instruction time,” said Kim Sordyl, the state school board member.
Sordyl was the only member of that group who would talk to KGW about this issue. We called and emailed every other member of the Oregon Board of Education; not a single one responded.
“This isn't rocket science,” Sordyl said. “The problem is, there isn't a will from the governor or the legislature to do anything to improve graduation rates. They're making up excuses, they're delaying, I'm tired of it. I don't need a proclamation that says graduation rates are important. Show me it's important.”
We wanted to talk to Governor Kate Brown, who leads the Oregon Department of Education and acts as the official Superintendent of Schools, but their office directed us to the newly appointed “Joint Subcommittee on Student Success.” That's a group of lawmakers who will tour the state, looking at what works in regard to education, and what does not.
State Representative Diego Hernandez, a Democrat from East Portland, sits on the committee. They also sit on the Reynolds School Board.
“Is there a correlation between high school graduation and the time in the classroom? We really haven't actually done any studies in the legislature,” Hernandez said.
They argued connecting Oregon's low graduation rates to the low number of instructional days is not comparing apples to apples.
Hernandez said there are a host of issues, and they all must be considered by the committee. They said adding more instructional days to catch up with the rest of the country is not the answer.
“Do you want to be in a classroom that doesn't have all the supports its needs, longer? Or do you want quality?” They asked.
Not all parents buy that argument. Tretheway packed up their family and moved to Washington because of Oregon's educational system.
“I used to live in Happy Valley and we moved to Ridgefield specifically for the smaller class sizes and the longer school year,” they said.
If you compare the education of students separated by the Columbia River, the numbers are eye opening. If a student in Washington state starts their or their education in kindergarten and completes it through high school, by the time that student graduates, they or they will have gone to school the equivalent of an entire school year longer than the same student in Oregon.
That's because the Washington student would get an additional 15 instructional days a year over 12 years.
“If we've got other states that are giving a full year of extra instruction time, of course they're going to be ahead of our students,” Sordyl said. They want the legislature to work with the governor to add instructional days for Oregon students.
At Tualatin High School, the graduation rates are consistently among the highest in the state, hovering around the mid-90th percentile. Principal Darin Barnard puts an emphasis on instructional time for all students.
They hired an “on-track” coordinator to address student absenteeism starting with freshmen.
Because of the limited number of instructional days in Oregon, Barnard said every day in class makes a difference.
“In order for our kids to be successful and have access to the content they need to be in class every day or when they're not, they miss huge chunks of curriculum,” they said.
They said the adage “practice makes perfect” certainly rings true when educating kids.
“The more the better,” Barnard said about the number of school days. “If we want to be good at something we've got to practice at that, we've got to be engaged. I don't know of anyone that doesn't believe more [instructional days] is better.”
*Oregon sets instructional time by hours, instead of days. High school freshmen, sophomores and juniors, for example, are required to have 990 hours of instructional time in a school year. The National Center for Education Statistics assumes a six-hour school day to reach the average of 165 days of instructional days in Oregon.

KATHMANDU: At least 165 people have died and thousands have fled their homes as monsoon floods swept across Nepal, India and Bangladesh, officials said on Monday (Aug 14), warning the toll could rise as the extent of the damage becomes clear.
Three days of relentless downpours sparked flash floods and landslides that have killed at least 70 people in Nepal, 73 across northern and eastern India and 22 in Bangladesh.
Around 200,000 people are living in emergency camps in Assam in northeast India, which suffers frequent flooding during the annual monsoon rains.
Another 15,000 have had to leave their homes in the eastern state of Bihar, which borders Nepal and where one official said seven rivers were at danger levels.
Huge swathes of the state were submerged in 2008 when a river burst its banks across the border in Nepal, with the two countries trading blame for the disaster.
In Nepal, police said over 48,000 homes have been totally submerged by the floods.

As emergency workers struggled to reach far-flung areas, the country's home ministry said another 47 people were missing, presumed dead.
The Nepal Red Cross warned that shortages of drinking water and food could create a humanitarian crisis in the impoverished Himalayan country.
"In many parts of the country there is a scarcity of safe drinking water creating a high risk of health hazards," spokesperson Dibya Raj Poudel told AFP.
"Several villages and settlements are unreachable. Telecommunications, mobile phones are still not working so it is difficult to give a full assessment."
In India, emergency workers were scouring the area hit by a massive landslide that swept two passenger buses into a deep gorge on Sunday, killing at least 46 people in the mountainous northern state of Himachal Pradesh.
In the neighbouring state of Uttarakhand - which also borders Nepal - three people were killed in a landslide late Sunday triggered by heavy rains, local police official Ajay Joshi told AFP.
BANGLADESH DEPLOY TROOPS
Bangladesh deployed troops to shore up embankments in the north of the country, where flooding has killed 22 people.
Local government administrator Kazi Hasan Ahmed told AFP up to 700,000 people had been marooned by flood waters after rivers burst their banks following days of heavy rain.
"We've not seen such severe floods in Dinajpur since 1988," they said, referring to the worst-hit district.
"The town protection embankment was washed away by flood water, submerging most of the main town."
The government's Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre warned that water levels in some major rivers would continue to rise over the next 72 hours, raising fears the flooding could spread.
In Nepal, the worst of the flooding was in the southern lowlands known as the Terai, the country's most fertile region and home to much of its agriculture.
"We are getting reports that about 70 percent of agriculture area in the Tarai is inundated," said Shankar Sapkota, senior agricultural economist with the government.
"Paddy fields, vegetable plantation and fish farms have been affected but right now we cannot confirm the extent of damage."
Nearly 150 people have been killed in Nepal since the beginning of the rainy season in late June.
The rains are now expected to shift westwards and authorities in Nepal have begun evacuating 74,000 people from the area expected to be hit.
Hundreds have died in torrential rain, floods and landslides in neighbouring India during the monsoon, which hits the country's southern tip in early June and sweeps across the nation, lasting into September.
The Syrian government plans to recover an opposition-held pocket north of Homs city soon after it completes surrender deals with armed groups around the capital Damascus, a Syrian government minister said on Tuesday.
DAMASCUS: The Syrian government plans to recover an opposition-held pocket north of Homs city soon after it completes surrender deals with armed groups around the capital Damascus, a Syrian government minister said on Tuesday.
Having taken back the largest rebel-held area near Damascus, eastern Ghouta, in early April, the Syrian army and allied forces are close to recover the remaining few pockets around the capital.
Pro-government forces are bombarding a jihadist enclave in south Damascus where Islamic State holds a pocket next to one held by rebel factions.
In recent days rebels in two other enclaves northeast of Damascus, Dumair and east Qalamoun, surrendered and agreed to be transferred by bus to opposition territory in northern Syria.
The Syrian army and its allies have for years employed siege and bombardment tactics to force rebels to surrender their enclaves and agree to be transferred to opposition territory in northern Syria.
Ali Haidar, the Syrian minister responsible for national reconciliation, told Reuters in an interview the government would focus on recovering an opposition-held pocket north of the city of Homs after securing the areas around Damascus.

"The issue will not be a long time coming after the final resolution in Qalamoun," Haidar said.
Haidar said the government had for a while been dropping leaflets and communicating with rebels in the opposition-held towns of Rastan, Talbiseh and Houla in northern Homs province.
"Today there is serious work in that area," they said.
"Armed groups wait to feel the seriousness and determination of the state's military action before they approach serious discussion of a reconciliation agreement."
Haidar said such reconciliation deals are also on offer to rebels in southern Syria, where a de-escalation zone was agreed by the United States and Russia last year.
"The options are open: full reconciliation or military action where necessary."
But they indicated that retaking areas around Damascus and Homs - the last rebel areas entirely besieged by the government - were the immediate priorities.
On Friday state media said insurgents had surrendered in the south Damascus enclave, which includes the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp, Hajar al-Aswad district and neighbouring areas. But pro-Syrian government forces were still bombarding the area by Tuesday.
Haidar said the militants had subsequently refused the deal and the military option was now being used.
On Tuesday Syrian state media showed footage of smoke rising from the Hajar al-Aswad area south of Damascus and said the bombardment was targeting militant positions.

CINCINNATI (AP) — Police in Cincinnati say two people have been died after an early morning shooting.
Police responded at around 1 a.m. EST Monday in the city's Roselawn neighborhood after a call of a shooting and a crashed vehicle.
One adult was pronounced dead at the scene and another died at a hospital.
Police say they are still investigating and have witnesses to question.
BRUSSELS: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took their case to Europe to ask allies to join the United States in recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, but was met by a firm rebuff from EU foreign ministers who saw the move as a blow against the peace process.
Making their first ever visit to EU headquarters in Brussels, Netanyahu said President Donald Trump's move made peace in the Middle East possible "because recognising reality is the substance of peace, the foundation of peace."
Trump announced last Wednesday that the United States would recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital, breaking with decades of U.S. policy and international consensus that the ancient city's status must be decided in Israeli-Palestinian talks.
Israel, which annexed East Jerusalem after capturing it in a 1967 war, considers the entire city to be its capital. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent state.
The Trump administration says it remains committed to the peace process and its decision does not affect Jerusalem's future borders or status. It says any credible future peace deal will place the Israeli capital in Jerusalem, and ditching old policies is needed to revive a peace process frozen since 2014.
But even Israel's closest European allies have rejected that logic and say recognising Israel's capital unilaterally risks inflaming violence and further wrecking the chance for peace.

After a breakfast meeting between Netanyahu and EU foreign ministers, Sweden's top diplomat said no European at the closed-door meeting had voiced support for Trump's decision, and no country was likely to follow the United States in announcing plans to move its embassy.
"I have a hard time seeing that any other country would do that and I don't think any other EU country will do it," Margot Wallstrom told reporters.
Several EU foreign ministers arriving at the meeting reiterated the bloc's position that lands Israel has occupied since the 1967 war - including East Jerusalem as well as the West Bank and Golan Heights, are not within Israel's borders.
Israel's position does appear to have more support from some EU states than others. Last week, the Czech foreign ministry said it would begin considering moving the Czech Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, while Hungary blocked a planned EU statement condemning the U.S. move.
But Prague later said it accepted Israel's sovereignty only over West Jerusalem, and Budapest said its long-term position seeking a two-state solution in the Middle East had not changed.
On Monday, Czech Foreign Minister Lubomir Zaoralek said of Trump's decision: "I'm afraid it can't help us."
"I'm convinced that it is impossible to ease tension with a unilateral solution," Zaoralek said. "We are talking about an Israeli state but at the same time we have to speak about a Palestinian state."
VIOLENCE SUBSIDES
Trump's announcement triggered days of protests across the Muslim world and clashes between Palestinians and Israeli security forces in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in which scores of Palestinians were wounded and several killed. By Monday morning, violence appeared to have subsided.
Netanyahu, who has been angered by the EU's search for closer business ties with Iran, said Europeans should emulate Trump's move and press the Palestinians to do so too.
"It's time that the Palestinians recognise the Jewish state and also recognise the fact that it has a capital. It's called Jerusalem," they said.
In comments filmed later on their plane, they said they had told the Europeans to "stop pampering the Palestinians". "I think the Palestinians need a reality check. You have to stop cutting them slack. That's the only way to move forward towards peace."
Trump's announcement last week has triggered a war of words between Netanyahu and Turkey's President Tayyip Erdoğan, straining ties between the two U.S. allies which were restored only last year after a six year breach that followed the Israeli storming of a Turkish aid ship bound for Gaza.
On Sunday, Erdoğan called Israel a "terror state". Netanyahu responded by saying they would accept no moral lectures from Erdoğan who they accused of bombing Kurdish villages, jailing opponents and supporting terrorists.
On Monday Erdoğan took aim directly at Washington over Trump's move: "The ones who made Jerusalem a dungeon for Muslims and members of other religions will never be able to clean the blood from their hands," they said in a speech in Ankara. "With their decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital, the United States has become a partner in this bloodshed."
The decision to recognise Jerusalem could also strain Washington's ties with its other main Muslim ally in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia, which has sought closer relations with Washington under Trump than under their predecessor Barack Obama.
Saudi Arabia shares U.S. and Israeli concerns about the increasing regional influence of Iran, and was seen as a potential broker for a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace deal. But Saudis have suggested that unilateral decisions over Jerusalem make any such rapprochement more difficult.
Prince Turki al-Faisal, a former Saudi ambassador to the United States and veteran ex-security chief, published a strongly-worded open letter to Trump on Monday denouncing the Jerusalem move.
"Bloodshed and mayhem will definitely follow your opportunistic attempt to make electoral gain," the prince wrote in a letter published in the Saudi newspaper al-Jazeera.
"Your action has emboldened the most extreme elements in the Israeli society ... because they take your action as a license to evict the Palestinians from their lands and subject them to an apartheid state," they added. "Your action has equally emboldened Iran and its terrorist minions to claim that they are the legitimate defenders of Palestinian rights."
The Trump administration says it is working on a peace proposal being drawn up by the Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt and Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner.
European leaders say the decision on Israel's capital makes the need for a broader peace move more urgent.
"We've been waiting already for several months for the American initiative, and if one is not forthcoming then the European Union will have to take the initiative," French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said.

President of France, Mr. Emmanuel Macron, on Tuesday night, made a historic visit to the Afrika Shrine, home of the late Afrobeat legend, Fela Anikulapo Kuti, describing it as ‘an iconic centre for the propagation of African culture, strength and music'.
Macron, who spoke at the New Afrika Shrine in Agidingbi, Ikeja, Lagos, at an event tagged ‘Celebration of African Culture' to inaugurate the African Cultural Season 2020, said they were glad to be back to the Afrika Shrine, adding that they still hold fond memories of the place since their first visit back in 2002.
“I discovered Nigeria and a lot of my friends are here. I discovered Nigeria and I discovered Lagos and I discovered the Shrine.
“This place is an iconic place and it is a place where the best of music is given. I have to say my main memories about this place are friends, proud people, proud of their culture, proud of their art and music.
“I have a very different view of Africa than a lot of other people in Europe,” they said.
Macron stressed the need for Africa and Europe, especially France to build a new commonality, adding that “this new commonality is not based on what is important for Europeans but what is important for Africa, about their culture, how they build their culture and promote the culture and which places are important for them about their culture.
“Being here, I do recognise their culture and respect their views. This place is important for Africa and their culture and that is why I am here.”
They also disclosed plans to host the African Cultural Season 2020 in France, which they said, would be about promoting African culture in Europe, adding that the event was going to be for Africa and by African artistes.
“It will include people with fashion, African movies, new generation of artistes will be coming from Africa and it will be organised by them to show Europe and France” the real culture of Africa.
“The event will be financed by African leaders. It will not be sponsored by France or European businesses, but by African businesses, it is brand new.
“This season is a unique one and it will be the new face of Africa in Europe organise by Africans, providing what you like and what you have here,” they said.
At the official unveiling of Alliance Francaise, a French Cultural Centre, in Lagos, on Wednesday, President Macron said the development was part of the measures to scale up the relationship between France and Nigeria, while also specifically offering the commitment of the government and people of France to development of infrastructural projects in Lagos.
“Thanks very much for being here; thanks very much for making this possible and to Mr. Governor, we spoke yesterday and this morning together in the car.
“Going to Shrine together yesterday and going to French Alliance now. It's much quieter, much more calm and reasonable but at the end of the day, I think both of us (Governor Ambode and I) did share the same views that we can do tremendous things together.
“Your State – Lagos, is one of the main challenges of not just Nigeria but the whole of Africa. I mean this huge city, there is tremendous challenge about how to make people live together in peace, in a better place and I want France to be part of this story and I do want my country and my people being part of this experience.
“It means belonging same values, sharing cultures, languages, literatures, music, movies, building together projects, having common economic projects and so on, and this eco system will be not just possible but stronger staying in this place,” Macron said.
Earlier, Lagos State Governor, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode, while welcoming President Macron to the state, expressed optimism that the historic visit would go a long way to break any barriers between Nigeria and France as well as foster greater collaboration for economic, social and cultural growth.
The governor said the state government was delighted to host Macron, a well respected global leader, adding that it would also signal a new era between both countries, especially for Lagos where talents in the arts and creative industry abound.
“On behalf of the government and good people of Lagos State, I welcome Their Excellency, President Emmanuel Macron, President of France, to the commercial and cultural capital of Nigeria and indeed West Africa.
“We are delighted and honoured to be hosting a President of one of the world's Super Powers; a permanent member of the United Nation's Security Council with veto rights, a prominent member of the G8 and the World Trade Organisation and a champion of Global Climate Change.
The governor said they were particularly delighted that Macron's visit to Lagos began on a cultural and entertainment note, adding that the French Cultural Centre and Alliance Française based in the State had always been an asset to its cultural landscape in the same way that Trace Television had also become an invaluable addition to its music and entertainment sphere.
Governor Ambode said they were very optimistic Macron's visit and activities would boost the State's quest to become the culture and entertainment capital of Africa, just as they said that the State Government would seek to establish collaborations with France and play an integral part of the Year 2020 African Cultural Season in Paris as envisioned by President Macron.
“With the exceptional characteristics of our State as the most populous, vibrant and indeed the fifth richest economy on the African continent, Lagos is the undeniable destination for business and pleasure in Africa.
“The new Lagos experience is being enhanced daily as we continue to create an enduring infrastructural and security architecture for the business of tourism and cultural arts to thrive.
“This also creates a platform for our local talents to feel a sense of belonging and encouragement.
“Mr. President, this momentous State Visit shall signal the dawn of a new era between France and Nigeria especially for the myriad of talents that have made Lagos their home,” the Governor said.
They said Macron's emergence as the President of France has inspired many youths in Nigeria, who constitute 60 percent of the country's population, adding that Lagos was providing avenues for youths to explore their creativity and talents.
There were also Art Exhibition, Fashion Show, display of Nollywood scenes, presentation of a painting of Fela to Macron by Governor Ambode as well as pencil frame artwork of Macron done by 11-old old Kareem Olamilekan drawn within two hours.
Highpoints of the night include sterling performances by dance group, Footprints of David, music artistes, Yemi Alade, Charlotte Dipanda from Kenya and a scintillating performance by Femi Kuti to bring the event to a close.
Dawson College physical education teacher Mark Abbott doesn't remember how long he's been scaling buildings, but they do remember the first time they were asked to climb to the top of the school's Mother House a little over 10 years ago.
The college needed someone to show an architect-engineer around to check on the state of the heritage building.
😮 How many rock-climbing teachers does it take to change a lightbulb on the dome? Just Mark Abbott! pic.twitter.com/vneAW0I5My — Dawson College (@mydawsoncollege) May 24, 2018
“I guided them around, we took pictures of the building,” they recalled.
“I've been teaching climbing for a long time, so I know what I'm doing.”
A little while later, they got another call from the college.
“They said, ‘Oh, the lights are out on top of Dawson, could you go up and change them?'” they told Global News.
“So, I said, ‘OK,' and that's what I did every time the lights went out.”
He's been doing it ever since — with a little help from a couple across the street.
“[They] would look at the statue of Mother Mary and when the lights would go out, they would call the maintenance department at Dawson and say, ‘Hey, the lights went out,'” Abbott told Global News.
“And then they would call me, and I would go up.”
Now, much to the dismay of their students, the certified rock climbing guide is getting ready to retire — in 15 days.
“I don't know if they [Dawson] will call me [to keep scaling the building],” they said, thinking of their retirement.
“But I'll be open to it.”
The Mineworkers Union of Namibia is threatening to institute legal action against the Skorpion Zinc Mine should the company fail to withdraw letters of termination of employment to about 278 employees.
This comes shortly after the mine notified the MUN about their intentions to lay off the employees on 28 January 2017, citing financial constraints.

KATHMANDU-Below skies darkened by thick black smoke, hundreds of thousands of brick kiln workers endure back-breaking labour and suffocating heat working in almost medieval conditions across South Asia.
But in one corner of the region, the need to rebuild after Nepal's devastating 2015 earthquake has presented an unexpected opportunity.
While much work remains to be done in improving working conditions, an environmental initiative has already managed to reduce emissions from the kilns and efforts are now focusing on rolling out the programme across the region, with significant implications for tackling climate change.
There are more than 150,000 kilns in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal belching out thousands of tonnes of soot - known as black carbon - a major air pollutant and the second largest contributor to global warming after carbon dioxide. The factories are stuck in a bygone era. Workers toil away in furnace-like heat in a form of modern day slavery - bonded labourers trapped by landlords in ever-spiralling debt.
These labourers are sold between landlords and the debt starts with the sum they are sold for. It grows as the workers borrow money for food, medical care, even the bricks they use to build homes on the edge of the kilns.
Along with much of Nepal, the industry was devastated by a 7.8-magnitude earthquake that hit in 2015, killing around 9,000 people and flattening about a third of the country's brick kilns.
But despite the scale of the human tragedy, the devastation presented environmentalists with a rare chance to clean up at least one part of the notoriously filthy industry.
The brick kiln owners remain resistant to interference from labour rights groups, but they saw potential profit in working with environmental campaigners.
The Brick Kiln Initiative, launched by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), found a way to redesign the ovens and stack the bricks differently so that less toxic soot is produced.
"We wanted to do three things: decrease emissions, increase efficiency and make the kilns earthquake-resistant," said Bidya Banmali Pradhan, programme coordinator for the initiative.
The problem is acute, with industrial soot emissions from the region having a worldwide impact.
South Asia has the highest such emissions in the world, according to a NASA study. The soot collects on the Arctic ice, decreasing the earth's ability to reflect the sun's rays and contributing to warming globally. Higher temperatures are affecting global weather patterns and have disrupted South Asia's annual monsoon rains, with some areas left at risk of drought while others suffer deadly deluges.
In 2017, more than 1,200 people died across South Asia in the worst monsoon floods to hit the region in years.
Black carbon has also exacerbated the melting of glaciers in the Himalayas, which have shrunk by nearly a quarter between the late 1970s and 2010, according to a study. And the soot belched from the coal-powered kilns is also a major source of the toxic soup of pollutants that has given many South Asian cities the unwanted accolade of having among the worst air quality in the world.
By stacking the bricks inside the kilns in a zig-zag pattern, the heat snakes through the gaps more efficiently, ensuring coal is completely burned so less soot is produced.
Emissions are cut by 60 percent. But more importantly for the kiln owners, it nearly halves coal consumption.
"The environmental factor does not necessarily motivate most kiln owners, but the zig-zag method has an economic benefit. We are using less coal and getting better bricks faster," said Mahendra Chitrakar, president of the Federation of Nepal Brick Industries.
Most of the 100 brick kilns in the Kathmandu valley have already adopted the new technology, according to Chitrakar. "We had to rebuild, so we thought why not build a more scientific, environmentally friendly structure," said brick kiln owner Raj Kumar Lakhemaru.
"Now there is no black smoke. The bricks are better and I am spending a lot less on coal." The next step is to spread the technology. Brick manufacturers from Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan met in Kathmandu this year to discuss the new design.
But activists say while the environmental changes are positive, conditions for kiln workers have not improved.
On the edge of Kathmandu, sweaty bare-footed workers hack away at the grey clay and haul heavy loads of bricks to the cavernous kilns.
Most live in shacks around the factories. As bonded labourers, the next generation of workers are literally born into the industry and many start work as children.
There are more than 200,000 kiln workers in Nepal and 16 percent of them are children, according to Better Brick Nepal, which is campaigning for better conditions. "We have to clean the brick industry from not just an environmental perspective but also a human one," said the charity's head Homraj Acharya. And on that issue, they added, the Nepal earthquake has not yet cracked the factory owners' hardline opposition to change.
MUMBAI: Rosh is a rapper; musician and a writer all bundled in one. Their debut original, Chillum, is one of the most popular viral tracks having garnered over eight million views on YouTube. They have also composed the title track Goosebumps of the Jackie Chan, movie Kung Fu Yoga. Their music caters to the youth of today and specializes in Hip Hop, Reggae, Urban Desi, Sufi and Bollywood. Born and brought up in Haryana Rosh has introduced Haryanvi rap in a unique style and it shows in their songs.
They say, “People really don't accept Haryanvi music immediately, unlike Punjabi or Bollywood rap. So, practically it was a challenge for me to get Haryanvi rap and portray it in my song. Haryanvi is a very powerful language and to showcase it we need good music. If you don't have good music, people won't like it as it's a raw language. This is the reason I always plan to work on my music first. I try to bend my music just the way Drake and Wiz Khalifa do it, and this music turned out to be really good.”
They further add, “There are a lot of things which are taken to be into consideration like good music, composition and voice texture. One must always consider the concept (story-line) first and then work on the other elements.My voice texture is thankfully good and people like it. This is how I blend Haryanvi rap and the final result turns out to be really good.”
There are a lot of slangs used in Rosh's song, to which they say, “In North India people like those Haryanvi slangs and if we use it in our rap with good Tuk Bandi, it turns out to be different from other raps. Mostly in Bollywood slangs aren't used, so ideally Haryanvi raps turn out to be interesting and people enjoy it. Every rap with a different language does carry some slang with it. Also, in movies like Dangal, Sultan, Haryanvi slangs have been used in dialogues. Overall I feel Haryanvi rap is much better than Hindi rap."
It looks like there's trouble in paradise for Sofia Richie, 19, and older reality wreck, Scott Disick.
The pair were seen canoodling all over Art Basel Miami Beach last week — but multiple sources saw them in a heated argument at a Surf Lodge pop-up at the W Hotel on Saturday night.
“They were arguing and definitely in a fight,” says a spy at the “Kith x Daniel Arsham” event hosted by Jayma Cardoso. “[Richie] wouldn't even talk to him. They grabbed their neck to try and kiss her, and they aren't having it. They ended up leaving.”
Another spy tells us that when a female party attendee whom Disick did not know commented, “Scott, you look upset,” the “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star turned and yelled, “I'm not upset! I'm not upset! What do you want, do you want a picture?”
But Disick and Richie appeared to have made up quickly. They were later spotted arriving at LIV at the Fontainebleau around 4 a.m. Richie got into the DJ booth.
Reps for the May-December couple did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
Todd's mother Carol stresses the importance of putting the phone down and talking with children
Amanda Todd would have turned 21-years-old on Nov. 27.
Instead their mother Carol Todd marked the milestone year remembering how Amanda wanted to go to Las Vegas to celebrate it.
Amanda committed suicide on Oct. 10, 2012, after years of cyber-bullying. Immediately after their death a video called My Story: Struggling, bullying, suicide and self-harm went viral around the world. The video showed Amanda using flash cards to tell their story silently to a camera. They explained that while using video chat to meet new people they would receive many compliments about my looks. When they were asked to bare their breasts to a stranger, a screen capture taken from the video of that moment started circulating on the internet and was used to blackmail them online.
Even after changing schools numerous times and moving out of the community, the stranger followed them online. They would befriend students, teachers and parents at their new schools through Facebook where they would send them the video.
Amanda began experiencing anxiety, depression and panic attacks. They survived a suicide attempt and began to self mutilate. However, the bullying continued at school leading up until their death when they were only 15-years-old.
“It was a hard one,” said Carol of the passing of Amanda's birthday.
“Every year is hard. The bigger milestones are even harder. And when you see their friends out there moving forward with their lives and going to college, university, you know, getting boyfriends and settling down. It's hard,” Amanda's mother reflected.
Now when Carol drives past the wedding stores that line Columbia Street in New Westminster, instead of feeling excitement for their daughter's future, the memories of Amanda's death come flooding back.
But Carol has continued to remain strong over the years, drawing fortitude from the foundation created in their daughter's name and speaking at engagements that take them all over the world.
“I just completed speaking at all the WE Days across Canada and that was, to me, really inspirational to be in a place where there are so many youths who are leaders that can go back to their schools and communities and do something positive,” said Carol, who has been to almost every WE Day since Amanda's death.
This year, though, Carol noticed a shift where conversations surrounding mental health and the internet have become more open.
“That was really interesting and an eye opener for me,” said Carol noting that they have heard conversations on how to support others, what can happen on the internet and how there should be a focus on kindness and respecting others.
“I had quite a few conversations with the Kielburger's about it,” Carol said.
Carol's audience, though, is mostly professionals, not children or teenagers. Although, they hope that they are listening. They find hope in the certain percentage of children who grow up and mature and realize their mistakes.
“I've heard many stories where people have actually looked for those people they have victimized in their younger years and apologize. That's a really good start and it brings tears to both sides of it,” Carol explained.
Amanda's legacy through the foundation continues to thrive. Carol gets messages of support from all over the world. Recently they received a message from some young girls in Europe who were working on a class project on cyber-bullying and wanted to ask them some questions.
“As you see it's not just a community problem, it's a global problem,” they explained.
Carol continues to follow the extradition hearings currently underway in Amsterdam for Amanda's alleged abuser who is a Dutch resident.  They are appealing an extradition to Canada and is due back in court mid-January where Carol is expecting them to make a statement about their offences.
Earlier this year Aydin Coban was sentenced to almost 11 years in a Dutch jail for fraud and blackmail.
However, Carol doesn't expect to hear anything that hasn't been included in Coban's 690-page book that they have written while waiting in prison.
“It's in Dutch right now. I managed to get a copy and translate it into English, but it's all about their injustices,” Carol laughed.
“How everyone has done them wrong including the justice system over there,” they said adding that there are four sections to the book with section three dedicated to Amanda's story.
They have been unable to read that section, but plans to some day.
Carol continues to be amazed at how the Amanda Todd Legacy Foundation continues to thrive. They never expected Amanda's story to continue to move people after five years.
“When I am speaking on that WE Day stage or any other platform and I hear silence and everyone listening, it just amazes me still,” said Carol who wants to keep the conversation open, not just about cyber-bullying but also about mental health.
They hope that more parents will sit down with their children and put away the technology. Have a meal together, play a board game, and talk.
“It's like just sitting your kids down and just having talk time and listening time. We get so busy in our everyday lives, we don't make room for that,” they said adding that that's one thing they would change, if they could, with Amanda, having more sit downtimes with deeper conversations.
Right now they are taking time to reflect on the past year. They took 28 trips in 2017 to talk about what happened to Amanda, a subject that will always be difficult to talk about. But, Carol says, there is a need to do it.
“Putting myself out there is part of my healing but it's also necessary to have people listen to real stories,” said Carol.
“We know in Canada because of media publication bans we don't really talk about death by suicide. If we don't talk about that we don't necessarily get the story about mental health, bullying,” they continued.
Carol remembers Amanda as a vivacious, energetic spunky child with lots of different ideas. But now they see Amanda was also very vulnerable.
“I see their vulnerability more and more,” said Carol.
“Some of it came from the home situation too and I take full responsibility that I didn't have a handle on how to raise kids,” they said.
“If I could take it all back I would. But what I can do is I can learn from them and share the story and hopefully others will learn from those things.”
“I would give it up all in a heartbeat to have my daughter back.”

SHANGHAI: Vitor Pereira wants to go one better than predecessor Andre Villas-Boas by winning a title after being named coach of big-spending Chinese Super League side Shanghai SIPG on Tuesday.
The 49-year-old, who was once assistant to Villas-Boas at Porto, has been out of football since leaving 1860 Munich following relegation to the German third tier in May.
Pereira, who had notoriously poor relations with Dutch striker Robin van Persie before being sacked by Turkish giants Fenerbahce in August 2016, is tasked with breaking Guangzhou Evergrande's stranglehold on the Chinese Super League (CSL).
Villas-Boas left SIPG two weeks ago after a turbulent season failed to yield a trophy despite reaching the last four of the Asian Champions League, the final of the Chinese FA Cup and coming second behind Guangzhou in the CSL.
"The Chinese league is a big challenge at the moment, a lot of (foreign) coaches come here, a lot of good players come to this league at this moment," said Pereira, who plans to speak to their fellow Portuguese and "friend" Villas-Boas about the job.
"I will do my best to help the club to fight to achieve our goals. I know what the club wants and I know what I want for my career, and both of us want to win titles," they told a press conference at their unveiling.

"This is the main reason why I decided to come here to China, to Shanghai. Together, for sure, we will reach our targets at the end of the season."
Pereira was number two to Villas-Boas at Porto in the 2010-2011 season and together they won the Portuguese League, Cup and Europa League.
Villas-Boas subsequently left for Chelsea and Pereira took charge of Porto, lifting the Portuguese League twice, before spells in charge of Al Ahli in Saudi Arabia, Olympiakos in Greece and then Fenerbahce.
SIPG boast a squad led by 60-million-euro attacking midfielder Oscar and their fellow Brazilian international Hulk, while in winger Wu Lei they have China's best offensive player.
Hulk worked under Pereira at Porto and the new coach said they were looking forward to reacquainting with the powerful forward.
"I was with Hulk at Porto for three years and I know the personality and the quality of the player," said Pereira.
"For sure they will help us a lot, but the key player for me is the team."
Compared to former Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur manager Villas-Boas and the Italian legend Fabio Cannavaro at Guangzhou, Pereira is a relative unknown to Chinese football fans and some SIPG supporters were quick to criticise their appointment.
"To be honest, from the bottom of my heart, I feel like they won't be able to control the dressing room," wrote one unhappy fan on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter.
"Not really looking forward to their performance, but I hope the results will prove me wrong."
Singer Liam Gallagher has said they are facing an "awkward" appearance on The Late Late Show in the US after calling presenter James Corden a "knob head".
The former Oasis star told how they will now be appearing on the chat show but that they still refuse to join in Corden's famous Carpool Karaoke segment.
According to GQ magazine, when asked in August if they would appear on the show, Gallagher said: "No thank you very much. No f****** chance, mate. With that fat bloke from Kevin & Perry?"
Their partner, Debbie Gwyther, was reported as telling them at the time: "It's called Gavin & Stacey and you've never watched it", to which Gallagher replied: "I don't need to watch it to know I won't like it. James Corden is a knob head."
Corden later made an ironic response to the slating, telling The Daily Beast: "God, I just don't know how we'll carry on. I don't how we'll even think of carrying on. Yeah, God, what will we do?"
Speaking on the BBC Radio 2 breakfast show as their debut solo album As You Were hit shelves, Gallagher, 45, said they would be travelling to the US within hours for a string of events and performances.
"We've got to go and do James Corden's show, that'll be awkward," they told presenter Chris Evans.
"I ain't singing in no car. I refuse to do it, I'm not doing it, mate. I'll sing the tunes, then I'm out of there."
Their time on the radio show saw them perform a number of tracks from the new record, which they described as their "last chance to dance".
Thanking a number of colleagues for their contribution, they paid Ms Gwyther the heartfelt tribute: "Without my missus this wouldn't have happened ... They definitely gave me a kick up the old hooter."
Gallagher also entertained listeners with an attempt to singalong to harvest hymn We Plough The Fields And Scatter, and a rendition of Oasis hit Wonderwall.
As You Were already received rave reviews from fans, with one person commenting on Twitter: "The real rockstar @liamgallagher didn't hold back ... As You Were is too good."
Another gushed: "@liamgallagher has reignited that dull flame & brought back some excitement to the music industry! #AsYouWere #Passion #Purpose."
Incubators, accelerators and seed funds in Sub-Saharan Africa have until July 6 to apply for VilCap Communities Africa, a new programme from Village Capital aimed at equipping entrepreneur ecosystem leaders with the tools, resources and connections they need to catalyse impact investment.
Organisers will select 15 applicants to take part in forums over the course of the rest of the year in Lagos, Nairobi and Cape Town, where they will share learnings and best practices. The programme is being run by Village Capital and the UK Department for International Development (DFID).
“You shouldn't look only to Silicon Valley or London to find working models for how to support entrepreneurs in sub-Saharan Africa,” said Rachel Crawford, innovation manager for emerging markets at Village Capital.
“There are exciting things happening here in Africa, and a lot of wisdom developing about what works specific to this context. But there's a lot of room to grow. We want to bring together leaders from different parts of Sub-Saharan Africa to share what's working and build a community of best practices.”
VilCap Communities Africa is an iteration of VilCap Communities, a 26-city pilot programme to license Village Capital's curriculum and investment model to accelerators, incubators and investors around the globe.
The forums will share best practices on supporting entrepreneurs, assisting ecosystem leaders with things like attracting funding for programmes, recruiting and selecting high potential ventures, and improving certain aspects of their ecosystems that need development.

Sofa chain DFS has warned over profits after the General Election and an "uncertain macroeconomic environment" led to weak trading at its stores.
The retailer said that since March it has seen "significant declines in store footfall", leading to a material reduction in customer orders.
As a result it now anticipates full-year operating profit to be lower than market expectations and in the range of £82 million to £87 million.
DFS said: "We believe these demand effects are market-wide, in line with industry indicators, and are linked to customer uncertainty regarding the General Election and the uncertain macroeconomic environment.
"As stated previously, the upholstery market does see short-term demand fluctuations from time to time, within an overall historical trend of long-term growth."
Consumer confidence has been battered by a series of factors triggered by last year's vote to quit the European Union.
The referendum result saw the pound collapse and inflation rocket, ramping up costs for British businesses and eroding consumer spending power.
However, DFS added: "We have maintained our investment in the business and we are confident that we will outperform the market over the longer term, driven by our scale, business model and proven growth levers.
"We believe our expectations for the next financial year are realistic based on consumer confidence remaining broadly in line with current levels, given its consequent impact on upholstery demand."
There are 7 dams in Oregon that have been listed as unsatisfactory by the Oregon Water Resources Department. 1 of the 7 is the Johnson Creek Dam northeast of Prineville in Crook County. The designation means the dams are inspected more closely with repairs needed to keep from being labeled as unsafe. There are 869 dams in Oregon according to the Army Corp of Engineers database most of which are privately owned. Concern of the dams came after problems were discovered with the dam in Oroville California.

Infighting in the Janata Dal (United) came into the open on Monday with the party suspending 21 leaders considered close to Sharad Yadav who had opposed Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's decision to join hands with the BJP.The party's general secretary KC Tyagi signaled in Delhi that the same kind of action could be taken against ‘rebel leader' Sharad soon.All those suspended by the party had participated in the recently concluded Bihar yatra of Sharad in which they had openly criticised Nitish for breaking Mahagathbandhan and siding with BJP.This comes a day after a key aide of Sharad said that the faction has the support of 14 of 17 state presidents and has staked claim over the party.According to the Sharad supporter, their faction has near unanimous support from senior leaders of the party, including a couple of its parliamentarians.Bihar JD(U) president Basistha Narayan Singh ordered suspension from primary membership of these leaders including former minister Ramai Ram, ex-MP from Sheohar Arjun Rai, former MLA Raj Kishore Sinha and ex-MLC Vijay Varma, according to a statement issued by JD(U) state general secretary Anil Kumar.Besides, a few district level office bearers of the party have also been suspended for indulging in "anti-party activities", the statement said.Tyagi warned rebel leaders and said those speaking against the decision of Nitish would not be tolerated. They also took a swipe at claims by Sharad Yadav faction that they had the support of majority of state units which was sufficient to prove they represent the real JD(U).“Sharad Yadav has disowned the party.  They are no longer with us. This is disappointing because they are talking in favour of those whose hands are deep in corruption. I too would have supported them had they formed a Lohia Manch type of organization but this is strange for us to see them backing Lalu and family.”He also dismissed claims of Arun Srivastava, who is very close to Sharad, that they had the support of 14 state units out of 17.Ramai Ram and Arjun Rai were prominent faces who participated in Sharad Yadav's three-day 'Samvad Yatra' which ended on August 12.Sharad, who described the party decision to walk out of the Grand Alliance of RJD, JD(U) and Congress and join hands with the BJP as "betrayal" of mandate given by 11 crore people of Bihar, has already been removed as the JD(U) parliamentary party leader in the Rajya Sabha.The JD(U) had also suspended Rajya Sabha MP Ali Anwar, who had participated in an opposition meet called by Congress president Sonia Gandhi in Delhi last week.Despite the JD(U) distancing itself from the recent tour of Sharad Yadav to the state, these 21 leaders and district-level office bearers were seen with them during the trip which they had said was meant to have "direct dialogue" with the people.Ramai Ram, who had also served as minister during RJD government before switching over to the JD(U) in 2010, had told mediapersons outside One Anne Marg residence of Nitish after state JD(U) executive committee meeting early in July that four days had been given to former Deputy Chief Minister Tejaswi Yadav to come clean on accusations. Later, they were seen with Sharad during their Bihar trip.Nitish, who is JD(U) president, has called a meeting of party national executive in Patna on August 19 which is likely to decide Sharad's fate in the party.
SOFIA: Bulgaria's interim government said on Wednesday it would step up surveillance at the border with Turkey to prevent an increase in the number of migrants crossing.
The surveillance system will include sensors and video cameras at the southeastern frontier, a government statement said, adding it was "a project of national importance".
In 2013, the Black Sea state began constructing a barbed wire fence along the border, which is expected to be completed in May, to keep migrants out.
"The goal is to cover the entire border with video surveillance," Interior Ministry spokesperson Kerstin Boyadzhiyska said. "It's getting warmer and we have to be ready."
The number of people detained at the Turkish border has dropped significantly in recent months, with 480 migrants stopped in December, compared to 3,015 in August, Interior Ministry figures showed.
Bulgarian nationalists have staged protests calling for the immediate closure of all refugee centres and for migrants to be returned to Turkey or their country of origin.
Last year Bulgaria called in its army to assist police in guarding the European Union-member's borders.

Last week, a group calling themselves the ShadowBrokers leaked malware that was used by the NSA to target computers running Windows. It was a striking data dump that potentially put millions of Windows users at risk. Luckily, Microsoft says they've already patched the vulnerabilities.
Advertisement
The Intercept confirmed the authenticity of the malware released by the ShadowBrokers; this is the second release of such software designed to break into Windows systems and in some cases, take control of the systems. At first the cache was thought to contain “zero-day” exploits—meaning that the vulnerabilities were previously unknown. But Microsoft released a statement saying they had analyzed the malware and that most of the vulnerabilities had already been patched—years ago in some cases, and most recently as March.
There are a few takeaways from all this. Of course, it's still surprising to be reminded of the NSA's capabilities, and it's surprising that Microsoft patched some of the vulnerabilities just weeks before this leak. But for the average person running Windows, the main lesson here is that you should keep your software up to date. People complain that Windows is constantly pestering you to update but it's for good reason. Those updates patch vulnerabilities and bugs to protect your system, and the minor inconvenience of having to restart your computer is worth the sixty seconds it will take.

Just install the dang updates.
This is also why you shouldn't use software that is no longer supported, like Windows Vista. When Microsoft says they no longer “support” something, that means they won't be issuing any more updates to that software. That leaves you in the lurch if any new security holes are discovered.
So keep yourself protected, don't use completely outdated software, and let Windows update itself.

Two people have been arrested following an afternoon police pursuit in southern Alberta that included the discharge of an RCMP firearm.
Shortly after 2:00 p.m., members of the Raymond RCMP detachment attempted to stop a suspected stolen vehicle at an undisclosed location in the Raymond-McGrath area. According to RCMP, the driver refused to comply and, during the attempted escape, the suspect vehicle struck two police vehicles.
Additional resources, including members of the Lethbridge Police Service and aerial support from the Calgary Police Service's HAWCS (Helicopter Air Watch for Community Safety), were deployed and assisted in the pursuit. A third police vehicle was struck and damaged during the chase and an RCMP officer fired their service firearm.
The suspect vehicle stopped near the town of Foremost and the two suspects, ages not disclosed, were arrested. Charges are pending against the unnamed male suspect and the unnamed female suspect.
Muskogee County officials are still searching for an inmate they say escaped from Jess Dunn Correctional Facility Tuesday.

DUANVALE, Jamaica — Violet Brown spent much of their life cutting sugarcane in the fields around their home in western Jamaica. They attended church regularly, avoids pork and chicken and celebrated their 117th birthday last month.
On Saturday, they are believed to have become the world's oldest living person following the death of Emma Morano of Italy, born Nov. 29, 1899.
Brown told The Associated Press they are surprised but grateful to have lived this long.
“This is what God has given me, so I have to take it — long life,” Brown said in an interview in their home in the town of Duanvale.
Brown is considered to be the oldest person in the world with credible birth documentation, according to Robert Young, director of the supercentenarian research and database division at Gerontology Research Group, a network of volunteer researchers into the world's oldest people. Its website says they were born on March 10, 1900.
Brown has not yet been declared the world's oldest by Guinness World Records, considered to be the official arbiter of the oldest person title but Guinness depends heavily on Young's group. Young said they have met Brown and examined their birth certificate, which was issued by the British authorities who governed Jamaica at the time of their birth.
“She's the oldest person that we have sufficient documentation for at this time,” Young said.
Jamaica's prime minister congratulated Brown on Twitter.
Guinness said it was researching a number of candidates for the new world's oldest person title.
“It can be a uniquely complex and sometimes lengthy process,” Guinness spokesperson Elizabeth Montoya said. “There is no confirmation of a new titleholder until our thorough processes are complete.”
Brown has two caregivers and spends most of the day resting in the home they share with their 97-year-old son.  They are able to sit up by themselves and walk short distances. And while they are hard of hearing, they offered swift, complete responses to questions about their life and family.
The secret to long life is hard work, they said.
“I was a cane farmer. I would do every work myself,” they said. “I worked, me and my husband, over that hill.”
They also credited their Christian faith for their long life.
“I've done nearly everything at the church,” they said. “I spent all my time in the church. I like to sing. I spent all my time in the church from a child to right up,” to today, they said.

Consumer spending and a hot real-estate market have helped buoy British Columbia's economy in recent years. But they have also helped mask deep-rooted economic problems, including B.C.'s dismal level of business investment.
Unfortunately, an onslaught of recent policies from Premier John Horgan's NDP government has weakened B.C.'s investment climate, sending all the wrong signals to investors. If the housing boom cools, B.C. could be in for a rude economic awakening.
Business investment is critical for sustaining long-term economic well-being. When businesses invest in the latest technologies, production techniques and expand their operations, it spurs economic growth and raises living standards for workers because it makes them more productive, allowing them to command higher incomes.
Yet B.C. struggles to attract such investment. Consider that from 2014 to 2016 (the latest year of available data), the level of non-residential business investment declined by nearly a fifth (after accounting for inflation). Moreover, the level of investment per worker in B.C. is 19 per cent below the national average, meaning B.C. workers have significantly less capital (machines, equipment and technology) available to do their job than their counterparts in other provinces.
One reason for the dearth of investment is B.C.'s uncompetitive business tax regime. While the province's statutory corporate income tax rate, when combined with the federal rate, is middling when compared to other jurisdictions, corporate taxes are not the only taxes that affect investment. When all the taxes are accounted for — including sales taxes on business inputs — B.C.'s overall business tax regime ranks poorly compared to competing jurisdictions across the country and worldwide.
For example, according to the latest estimates from University of Calgary economists, B.C.'s overall tax rate on new investment is 27.7 per cent — the highest rate in Canada and one of the highest among industrialized countries. Moreover, sweeping tax reform in the United States will only magnify B.C.'s competitiveness problem, as the national average tax rate on new investment in the U.S. now sits at 18.8 per cent.
Rather than improve the province's investment climate, the Horgan government has signalled to investors and entrepreneurs that B.C. is not hospitable to investment. For instance, shortly after assuming office, their government made B.C.'s tax regime less competitive by raising the general corporate income tax rate, creating a new top personal income tax rate, and increasing the carbon tax.
Making matters worse, last month's provincial budget contained new tax policies that reinforce an anti-investment sentiment, ranging from higher taxes on high-valued homes and cars to a new employer-based payroll tax to replace Medical Services Plan premiums.
Troublingly, the government's own task force warned against replacing the MSP with a payroll tax. In its interim report, the task force put it succinctly:
“A payroll tax would reduce the competiveness of B.C. businesses at a time when they are facing several competiveness challenges, including expected increases to the minimum wage, CPP [tax] increases, and recent tax reform in the U.S. which improve the competitive position of many U.S. businesses.”
But this warning fell on deaf ears.
And it's not just tax changes that are harming investment prospects in the province. The government's anti-development rhetoric and commitment to block pipelines signal that B.C. is unwelcoming to resource development.
In fact, a survey of upstream oil and gas executives rank B.C. dead last among Canadian provinces for investment attractiveness. The province in 2017 also saw its global ranking in the survey drop from the top half of jurisdictions to the bottom quarter. Finally, the government's cold stance on resource development comes at a time when disputed land claims are hurting B.C.'s resource sector — especially mining.
If the Horgan government wants to foster sustained long-term economic growth, it's time to put away the closed for business sign and start sending positive signals to investors and entrepreneurs.

CHICAGO (AP) — Right-hander Carl Edwards Jr. was activated from the bereavement list by the Chicago Cubs ahead of Monday night's series opener against Milwaukee.
Edwards has pitched 4 2/3 scoreless innings in five appearances, allowing one hit, walking three and striking out four. They were placed on the bereavement list on Friday and missed three games.
Chicago cleared a roster spot by placing infielder Tommy La Stella on the bereavement list. La Stella is 1 for 4 with an RBI double and two walks in six games.

A sometimes bruising leadership campaign ends today in Vancouver for British Columbia's Liberals as they elect a new leader who will be tasked with returning the party to power after a 16 year term in office that ended last summer.
An estimated 60,000 party members were eligible to vote online and by phone to replace Christy Clark, who resigned after the New Democrats formed a minority government with the support of the Green party following a non-confidence vote that brought down the Liberals.
The field of six candidates includes three veterans with deep cabinet experience, two former big city mayors and a first-time member of the legislature from Metro Vancouver.
Mike de Jong, Andrew Wilkinson and Todd Stone were longtime members of Clark's cabinet.

Sam Sullivan, a former Vancouver mayor, was appointed to cabinet in the dying days of Clark's government last summer.
The field also includes Michael Lee, a Vancouver lawyer who was elected to the legislature last spring, and Dianne Watts, a former Conservative MP and one-time mayor of Surrey.
The B.C. Liberal Party is not affiliated with the federal Liberals. It describes itself as “a made-in-B.C. free enterprise coalition” that includes members of the federal Conservative and Liberal parties.

Getting the party back to power after a lacklustre election campaign last May has been a focus of the leadership campaign.
There has been finger-pointing in debates over who was to blame for the Liberal downfall, despite B.C. boasting the strongest economy in Canada.
Some candidates criticized the party's old guard for failing to address transportation, housing and social policy issues that led to losses in seat-rich Metro Vancouver, once a Liberal stronghold.
De Jong, the former finance minister, set themselves apart from the field, defending the Liberal record as they took heat for their tight-fisted control of the province's purse strings that meant programs aimed at easing financial pressures for people never made it off the drawing board.
Stone, their former cabinet colleague, acknowledged the Liberals were strong economic managers as they argued the party could have done a better job of sharing the wealth, including raising welfare rates.

Forty-one North Huron Firefighters who “quit” last week, will get to air their grievances in front of North Huron Council Monday night.
The volunteer firefighters, who are unhappy with the current leadership of the fire department and council's hiring practices, in regards to the chief's position, will get to share their concerns at a special council meeting in blyth.
A representative from Ontario's Fire Marshall's Office will also be in attendance.
Although the volunteer firefighters “quit” after a new chief was appointed by council last week, a number of them have shown up to 2 emergency calls..since their mass resignation.
The firefighters say, they felt they needed to take a stand, but they don't intend to leave the community unprotected.
Neighboring fire departments are also on call, in case of emergency.
The firefighters offer of a 30 day cooling-off period to continue fire coverage until a compromise could be found, was turned down by some council members last Thursday night.
It's hoped, at minimum, a similar short term solution can be found at tonight's meeting which starts at 7pm.
Most of the meeting will be closed to the public because it deals with personnel issues. It's expected there may be a brief “open” session at the conclusion of the closed door meeting.

REUTERS: Irish-trained horses look set to repeat last year's dominance of the Grand National as they were given the top five weights for the famous marathon steeplechase at Aintree, Liverpool on April 8.
Five of last year's top six finishers were trained in Ireland and the weights for April's race announced on Tuesday contains 20 horses trained in the country out of the top 40 entries - the maximum runners allowed - on the list.
Michael O'Leary's Gigginstown House Stud won with Rule The World last year and the business person appears intent on staging a repeat with 12 of their 16 entries on the 109-horse list guaranteed a run if trainer Gordon Elliot opts to race them.

Saudi Aramco's planned 2018 public share offering is being slowed down by a divide between Saudi Arabia's ruling family and executives of the kingdom's state oil company over where to list its shares, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.
REUTERS: Saudi Aramco's planned 2018 public share offering is being slowed down by a divide between Saudi Arabia's ruling family and executives of the kingdom's state oil company over where to list its shares, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.
Aramco, formally known as Saudi Arabian Oil Co, was not immediately available for comment.
Executives at Aramco are pushing Saudi Arabia's king and their son, deputy crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, on the merits of listing the giant state-owned oil company on the London Stock Exchange, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. http://on.wsj.com/2rxfcGu
Aramco executives believe that listing in the United States would expose the company to greater legal risks, including from potential class-action shareholder lawsuits, the newspaper said.
But, according to the report, the Saudi Arabian royal court favors the New York Stock Exchange, in part because of the kingdom's longstanding political ties to the United States, and because the U.S. market represents the deepest pool of capital in the world.

They finally conceded today.  They are however calling a special session to "deal with wild fires and flooding". These guys have not been shown to make good decisions during special sessions. This can wait until after the first of the year.
The perception of the Vegas Golden Knights roster today compared to when it was first assembled 11 months ago is, to say the least, very, very, very different. Heading into the season the opinion of this team when looking at it on paper was that it was going to be awful. Today, there are a lot of strong opinions about how the expansion draft was unfair and how 30 other teams around the league don't know what they're doing and made a lot of really bad decisions. In hindsight, there is a lot of truth to the latter point because quite a few teams did, in fact, blow it.
There is also the fact that the roster has changed quite a bit from the beginning of the year, not only in terms of the players that are on it, but also in the way they have been used.
One of the big challenges that Vegas and its coaching staff faced this season was having a collection of players thrown together from all over the league, several of whom had little track record in the NHL or had never really had an opportunity to play larger roles. There was a ton of mystery and a lot of tinkering that had to be done to find the right combinations that would work.
A lot of the players that we thought might be key players, or looked like they might be key players, turned out to be anything but, and looking at how players were used early in the season as opposed to now it is clear that not even the Golden Knights knew entirely what they had in a lot of cases.
[Related: Don't blame expansion draft rules for Vegas' success, blame your GM]
Remember back in the offseason when Vadim Shipachyov signed a two-year, $9 million contract with the team to come over from Russia and was supposed to be one of their top players? That quickly fell apart and led to a rather bizarre — and seemingly messy — split between the two sides.
William Karlsson ended up being a 43-goal scorer this season and the biggest individual surprise of any player in the league. During the first month of the season they were fifth on the team in terms of average ice-time per game logging just a little more than 17 minutes per game. The now dominant and seemingly unstoppable line of Karlsson, Reilly Smith, and Jon Marchessault played a grand total of 39 seconds together through the first five games of the season (at which point Marchessault was sidelined with an injury for a few games) and didn't really become a thing until the second month of the season.
The forward that Vegas leaned on the most in the first month of the season? Well that would be Cody Eakin, of course, as they played them nearly 20 minutes per night. They now plays around 14 minutes per night in the playoffs.
Here is a breakdown of Vegas' ice-time distribution among forwards in the first month of the season compared to the last month of the season and then in the playoffs.
I excluded players that played less than four games in each time-frame.
The big changes are obviously Eakin going from the top forward down to a third-liner, while the Karlsson-Smith-Marchessault trio became the go-to group. But there are also significant increases for Haula (an extra two minutes per game) and Tuch (three minutes), while Perron saw their ice-tim decrease a bit.
Meanwhile, on defense…
From the very beginning Vegas seemed to know what it had in Schmidt and has leaned on them to be their top defender, a role that they have excelled in.
Deryk Engelland has also, quite shockingly, been one of their top defenders after completely reinventing themselves as a player this year.
But in the first month of the season they were playing Luca Sbisa and Brad Hunt nearly 20 minutes per night, while top prospect Shea Theodore was playing in the American Hockey League and not even on the roster. Neither Sbisa nor Hunt are significant players on the team now.
Jason Garrison, a veteran that played nearly 19 minutes a night over 70 games a season ago for the Lightning (and also opened the season as Vegas' highest-paid defenseman) also saw some significant ice-time to start the year. But they were quickly jettisoned to the minor leagues and placed on waivers.
Colin Miller, who ended up leading all of their defenders in scoring, was at the bottom of the usage in the first month of the season.
In the end it's been a fascinating evolution to watch unfold.
The player that was supposed to be the best forward (Shipachyov) ended up being, quite literally, nothing for them.
The highest paid forwards on the roster are David Clarkson and Tatar.
Clarkson has never — and will never — play a game for the team and is only a part of the organization because Vegas was willing to take their contract, along with Karlsson and a first-round draft pick, in exchange for not taking Josh Anderson or Columbus' backup goalie in the expansion draft.
Tatar was their big trade deadline acquisition and has been relegated to the press box for most of the playoffs while their other trade deadline pickup, Ryan Reaves, who was never expected to make any sort of impact, has scored two huge goals.
Their highest paid defenders at the start of the year were Garrison and Clayton Stoner. Garrison played eight games before being waived and relegated to the minor leagues while Stoner never played a single game.
Nothing about this Vegas season has gone as planned or as was expected, and nobody saw this team being as good as it is. Including them.

JERUSALEM: Palestinians warned the United States on Wednesday against abandoning a two-state solution to the conflict with Israel after a White House official said peace did not necessarily have to entail Palestinian statehood.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meet later in the day for the first time since the U.S. election in November that brought the Republican to office.
On the eve of the meeting, a senior White House official said it was up to the Israelis and Palestinians themselves to decide on the shape of any future peace.
"Whether that comes in the form of a two–state solution if that's what the parties want, or something else," the official said, adding that Trump, while giving peace "high priority" would not try to "dictate" an agreement.
For Palestinians, who seek a state in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and in the Gaza Strip, even the notion of a U.S. retreat from the internationally backed goal of a future Palestine existing alongside Israel was alarming.
"If the Trump Administration rejects this policy it would be destroying the chances for peace and undermining American interests, standing and credibility abroad," Hanan Ashrawi, a senior member of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said in response to the U.S. official's remarks.
"Accommodating the most extreme and irresponsible elements in Israel and in the White House is no way to make responsible foreign policy," they said in a statement.
Netanyahu committed, with conditions, to the two-state goal in a speech in 2009 and has broadly reiterated the aim since. But given regional instability and long-running divisions in Palestinian politics, many in their cabinet argue the time is not ripe for a Palestinian state to emerge.
Far-right cabinet ministers in Israel have called for the annexation of parts of the West Bank, which was among the territory Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. Netanyahu has not endorsed that demand.
Commenting on the White House official's remarks, Husam Zomlot, strategic affairs adviser to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, noted that Palestinian statehood has long been at the heart of international peace efforts.
"The two-state solution is not something we just came up with. It is an international consensus and decision after decades of Israel's rejection of the one-state democratic formula," Zomlot told Reuters in Jerusalem by telephone from the West Bank city of Ramallah.
On their departure for Washington on Monday, Netanyahu sidestepped a question on whether they still backed a two-state solution, saying they would make their position clear in the U.S. capital.
But they have spoken of a "state minus," suggesting they could offer the Palestinians deep-seated autonomy - they already exercise limited self-rule in the West Bank under interim deals - and the trappings of statehood without full sovereignty.

On 9 December 2011, Lai Chi-wai was driving their motorcycle home when they were struck by two cars and thrown onto the road. The car accident left the then professional rock climber, who was once ranked eighth in the world, paraplegic. “I lost everything in one night. I fell from heaven to hell,” Lai, now 34, recalled. At the time of the accident, Lai's wife was in the same hospital, heavily pregnant with their son.
“My son is the only reason I chose to live on. I want to stand up, hold them in the air and do things that other ordinary dads can do,” Lai said. Such a devastating injury would be enough to dampen anyone's spirits. But Lai refused to leave the sport they loved behind, and after three months in the hospital, they began working as a full-time coach for the Hong Kong sports climbing team.
In 2014, when Lai was selected as one of Hong Kong's 10 most outstanding people, they announced their plan to climb Lion Rock in their wheelchair — something that many thought was impossible. And on 9 December 2016, Lai Chi-wai fulfilled their promise and became the first paraplegic to climb all the way to the granite top of Lion Rock. “Breaking news, wheelchair discovered on Lion Rock,” the young athlete wrote on their Facebook page, “I want to show others the Lion Rock spirit. Nothing can stop us if we put our mind to it!”
Today, they continue their career as a motivational speaker: “You dare to dream and dare to try — do not let your body limitation discourage you from doing what you love to do.”

A business person, Joy Ikechukwu, who allegedly assaulted their landlord's son, was on Tuesday brought before an Ikeja Magistrates' Court, Lagos.
The 40-year-old Ikechukwu, who resides at Alagbado area of Lagos, is facing three charges of breach of peace, assault and damage of property.
The woman committed the offences on March 9 at the tenement building where they live, the Police prosecutor, ASP Ezekiel Ayorinde, told the court.
They alleged that the accused assaulted the complainant, Mr Emmanuel Onuchukwu, 35, by slapping them repeatedly.
According to Ayorinde, the accused slapped the complainant when they stopped them from burning down their father's house after they had succeeded in burning down the fence.
“The accused wanted to set the house ablaze because the landlord arrested them for burning refuse in the compound.
“She was released and was warned not to do that again, but when they got home, they brought out fuel to burn the entire building,'' they said.
Ayorinde said the case was reported to the police and the accused was re-arrested.
The offences contravened Sections 168, 172 and 339 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 (Revised).
The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the Section 340 prescribes 14-year-jail term for attempt to commit arson.
The accused, however, pleaded not guilty of the charge.
The Magistrate, Mrs B.O. Osunsanmi, granted the accused bail in the sum of N50, 000 with two sureties in like sum.
The sureties should be gainfully employed with an evidence of two years tax payment, they ruled.
They adjourned the case until May 30 for mention.

A lawsuit claims Iowa's new voter identification law violates the state constitution.
Priorities USA Foundation says the lawsuit was filed Wednesday in Polk County District Court in Des Moines. The national group, which is covering legal costs, provided a copy of the lawsuit.
It's the first legal challenge against the new ID requirement and its provisions. Parts of the law will be in effect for Iowa's upcoming June 5 primary, though a requirement to show ID to cast a regular ballot won't be in place until 2019.
The lawsuit's plaintiffs are the League of United Latin American Citizens of Iowa and an Iowa State University student.
Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate is named as a defendant in the suit. Their office did not respond to a request for comment.

Renowned chef and The Chew star Mario Batali has stepped down from their restaurant empire amid sexual misconduct allegations. As RadarOnline.com has learned, the TV personality got accused of groping and inappropriate touching by a string of women over the course of 20 years!
According to a spokesperson for Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group, Batali was bashed for inappropriate behavior in the workplace just two months ago!
In a statement to Eater, Batali said they were stepping away from their business following the accusations. ABC, also asked their longtime employee to step down “while we review the allegations that have just recently come to our attention.”
Batali – who's been longtime friend to feminist advocate and beloved actor, Gwyneth Paltrow – apologized, but did not deny, the accusations made against him.

In a statement, they wrote: “I apologize to the people I have mistreated and hurt. Although the identities of most of the individuals mentioned in these stories have not been revealed to me, much of the behavior described does, in fact, match up with ways I have acted. That behavior was wrong and there are no excuses. I take full responsibility and am deeply sorry for any pain, humiliation or discomfort I have caused to my peers, employees, customers, friends and family.”
“I have work to do to try to regain the trust of those I have hurt and disappointed. For this reason, I am going to step away from day-to-day operations of my businesses. We built these restaurants so that our guests could have fun and indulge, but I took that too far in my own behavior. I won't make that mistake again. I want any place I am associated with to feel comfortable and safe for the people who work or dine there,” Batali, 57, added.
They continued, saying that they knew their actions had “disappointed” people and that they would work hard to “regain” the respect of their loved ones.

B&B said to Eater, “We take these allegations very seriously. We pride ourselves on being a workplace for our employees where they can grow and deliver great service with equal opportunity and free from any discrimination. We have strong policies and practices in place that address sexual harassment. We train employees in these policies and we enforce them, up to and including termination.”
As Radar has learned, some of the accusations women made against Batali include breast and buttocks groping as well as forced sexual encounters in the workplace.

HONG KONG: Most Asian markets started clawing back losses on Monday (Aug 14) as spiralling tensions over North Korea showed tentative signs of easing and safe haven assets lost momentum.
Fears of a catastrophic confrontation between Washington and Pyongyang were calmed when CIA director Mike Pompeo said Sunday there was "nothing imminent" in the escalating stand-off.
Regional equities were also boosted by a positive lead from Wall Street on Friday, after investors waded back into the market following a three-day sell-off.
Hong Kong was back in positive territory Monday after slumping two per cent Friday, while Shanghai ended the day higher despite data showing Chinese industrial production slowed sharply in July as government efforts to rein in debt weighed on demand.
However, Tokyo closed one per cent down as traders returned from a three-day holiday weekend to play catch-up after Asian and European shares had dropped Friday, with the Nikkei finishing at its lowest level in more than three months.
Investors largely shrugged off official data showing Japan's economy grew by a faster-than-expected one per cent in the three months to June, as the accelerating world number three economy marked its longest economic expansion in more than a decade.

"What we're seeing today is relief at the (geopolitical) situation not deteriorating over the weekend, something traders were clearly wary of towards the end of last week," said Oanda analyst Craig Erlam.
European stocks moved higher at the start of trading on Monday with London, Paris and Frankfurt all up.
As markets started recovering, the dollar rose against the Japanese currency to above 109.7 yen in afternoon trade - although still off ¥109.99 in Tokyo on Thursday - while gold halted its advance after jumping 2.4 per cent last week.
"We're seeing a small unwinding of ... risk aversion trades, with gold trading slightly lower and the yen and Swiss franc off against the dollar, pound and euro," Erlam added.

Indices could reap the benefit of investors returning following losses worldwide last week, triggered after President Donald Trump threatened to unleash "fire and fury" on North Korea, and Pyongyang countered by announcing plans to test-launch missiles toward Guam.
'NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET'
"There is a still a 'buy the dips' mentality running through financial markets, assisted by global growth in a good spot (while) global corporate earnings have been strong," said Chris Weston, chief market strategist at IG Markets.
Seoul, which endured a torrid time last week with stocks losing 3.2 per cent, finally broke its four-day losing streak, while Sydney also saw gains.
However, analysts cautioned that with joint South Korean-US military exercises scheduled and North Korea celebrating "Liberation Day" Tuesday, volatility could return to markets.
"We are not out of the woods yet and the situation in North Korea will remain front and centre," said Weston.
Wall Street had called a halt to the global slump on Friday, with analysts saying the Dow was boosted by weaker than expected consumer price inflation (CPI) figures, seen as reducing pressure on the Fed for an early rate rise.
Crude prices edged lower later Monday after holding steady for much of the day as the market continued to weigh rising global supply against output curbs from OPEC members and other leading producers.
"Oil seems to have found an equilibrium point and as long as we continue to see US inventories decline, it may be content to hold around here," said Ric Spooner, an analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney.

Here's a closer look at how some of the top rookies fared in Week 14:
Round: 1
Statistics: 25-of-32, 271 yards, TD; two carries, 5 yards, TD
Analysis: Trubisky played the best game of their young career in Chicago's 33-7 victory over the Bengals. Trubisky targeted eight different receivers and attempted 32 passes without a turnover. Trubisky completed several important third-down throws to their top two targets, Kendall Wright and Adam Shaheen, who combined to catch 14 balls for 151 yards and one touchdown. At no point on Sunday did Trubisky look rushed or overwhelmed inside the pocket. Trubisky's accuracy has been an issue this year, but they were on the money with virtually all of their throws. -- Jeff Dickerson
Round: 1
Statistics: Eight rushes, 35 yards; three catches, 18 yards
Analysis: McCaffrey was overshadowed by running back Jonathan Stewart, who had 103 yards rushing on 16 plays. McCaffrey barely was a factor for much of the day, although they did have a 15-yard catch for a first down on a touchdown drive to start the second half. The Vikings did a good job of taking them out of the flow as a receiver, leaving wide receiver Damiere Byrd open to lead the team with five catches. -- David Newton
play 0:52 Fournette says Jags felt disrespected by Seahawks Leonard Fournette says this Jaguars team wasn't going to be bullied around and are "built different." Fournette calls Blake Bortles a top-5 quarterback and is able to show their true colors because of the team's running game.
Round: 1
Statistics: 24 carries, 101 yards, TD; four catches, 18 yards
Analysis: This was Fournette's second 100-yard game in their past five games and they looked like they did earlier in the season before they were bothered by an ankle injury. They ran with power and their burst through the hole was back, so it looks like their injured ankle is feeling a lot better. It also coincided with the fact that they were running behind the offensive line that helped them rush for 596 yards in the first six games before the unit was hobbled by injuries. Their last carry was perhaps their biggest: They gained 13 yards off left tackle on third-and-11 with less than a minute remaining to seal the victory. “It's funny because Blake [Bortles] was like, ‘Man, we need this.' In the back of my mind I'm like, ‘Man, I can't let anything stop me.' I got the first down and that was it.” -- Michael DiRocco
Round: 1
Statistics: Nine tackles, two quarterback hits, sack, forced fumble
Analysis: This is the type of performance Detroit hoped for when it took Davis in the first round. They have been the middle linebacker all year and was all over the field Sunday. They were active from sideline-to-sideline, continued to be strong against the run and finally got active in the pass rush. They have struggled at points this year, particularly in coverage, and has been taken off the field in passing situations. But games such as Sunday should give Detroit confidence he's going to be a really strong piece in the middle of the defense for a while. It was their best game in weeks. -- Michael Rothstein
play 0:15 Johnson scores on sneaky shovel pass for Browns Browns QB DeShone Kizer fakes the handoff, then sends a 7-yard shovel pass to Duke Johnson for the touchdown.
Round: 2
Statistics: 20-of-28, 214 yards, three TDs, two INTs.
Analysis: Kizer's day will be defined by their last throw, an ill-advised decision that might have worked in college but won't work in the NFL. That play turned into their second interception, which set up Green Bay's game-winning touchdown in overtime. To that point, Kizer had played their best game. They had three touchdowns, they threw confidently and they threw accurately. Had David Njoku not dropped a key third-down throw, the Browns might have been able to run out the clock. On one of their better throws, Kizer showed poise and patience as they found Corey Coleman for 18 yards on third-and-11 in the second quarter. Coleman appeared to be the third or fourth receiver Kizer looked to, and they delivered a pass to Coleman's chest to set up the Browns' second touchdown. The interception was a mistake -- a big mistake -- but Kizer now has played fairly well in three of their past five games. If it keeps up, they may give Hue Jackson and John Dorsey something to discuss in the offseason. -- Pat McManamon
play 0:15 Hunt ends TD drought Kareem Hunt scores their first touchdown since Week 3 with a 1-yard score and celebrates with their teammates afterwards.
Round: 3
Statistics: 25 carries, 116 yards, TD; three receptions, 22 yards
Analysis: Hunt went over 1,000 yards, making them only the second Chiefs rookie ever to do so in a season. But more importantly, they did it in a meaningful way. They topped 100 rushing yards for the first time since a Week 5 game against the Texans and scored their first touchdown since a Week 3 win over the Chargers. The Chiefs played better around Hunt than they had for weeks. They were consistently kept clean through the line of scrimmage as opposed to being hit frequently in the backfield, as had been happening recently. -- Adam Teicher
Round: 4
Statistics: Five catches, 118 yards, TD
Analysis: Kupp was largely responsible for a scoring drive when the Rams badly needed an answer, gaining 64 yards on a catch-and-run and then hauling in a 6-yard touchdown catch in the second quarter, with both of those plays coming on third down. Kupp now has 56 receptions on the year, breaking the Rams rookie record that was previously held by Eddie Kennison in 1996 (54). -- Alden Gonzalez
Detroit Lions LB Jalen Reeves-Maybin
Round: 4
Statistics: Four tackles, a half-sack, one quarterback hit, one pass defended.
Analysis: Reeves-Maybin has had an increased role over the past month, often seeing the field in nickel situations in favor of fellow rookie Jarrad Davis. He's still not great against the run and won't be an every-down linebacker until 2018, but the speed and coverage ability has been noticeable as the season has worn on. He's also one of Detroit's better special teams players. The combination of Davis and Reeves-Maybin could be a good one for Detroit in the middle level of the Lions' defense for the next few years. -- Michael Rothstein
Round: 5
Statistics: Led the Chargers with 10 combined tackles and also notched their fourth sack of the year
Analysis: The rookie slot defender out of Iowa has developed into an impact player for the Chargers. King has four sacks on the year, tying them with Rodney Harrison (1997 and 1998) with the second-most sacks by a defensive back in a single season in team history. Harrison tops the list with six in 2000. King also has a 90-yard interception return for a score against the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving Day. King has been the Chargers' most impactful rookie this season. -- Eric D. Williams
Rickie Fowler tees off on the 17th hole during the second round of the Waste Management Phoenix Open golf tournament Friday in Scottsdale, Ariz. Patrick Breen  The Arizona Republic via AP
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. >> Rickie Fowler took a share of the lead into the weekend in the Waste Management Phoenix Open. They know from experience the party is just getting started.
Just keep the gas pedal down, Fowler said.
Fowler has had a lot of success at TPC Scottsdale without winning. They finished a shot behind Hunter Mahan in 2010, lost to Hideki Matsuyama on the fourth extra hole in 2016, and tied for fourth last year.
From the first couple times I played it, I knew it was just kind of a matter of time before I would win here, Fowler said. I know I can win here. I put myself in position plenty of times.

Fowler was tied with Bryson DeChambeau, with each shooting their second straight 5-under 66.
The festive tournament drew an estimated Friday-record crowd of 191,400 fans, bringing the week total to 439,088. The third-round mark of 204,906 set last year is expected to be shattered Saturday, and the week record of 655,434 from a year ago could fall with a day to spare.
DeChambeau birdied the final two holes, hitting a wedge to 8 inches on the par-4 18th late on another 80-degree afternoon.
I missed a few short putts on the back nine, so definitely didnt play my best, DeChambeau said.
They won the John Deere Classic last year. In 2015, the former SMU star became the fifth player to win the NCAA individual title and U.S. Amateur in the same year.
Daniel Berger and former Arizona State player Chez Reavie were a stroke back.
Berger had a bogey-free 65.
This is the fourth time Ive been here, so Ive kind of figured it out a little bit, Berger said. Mostly, its just about just enjoying yourself.
Reavie eagled the 17th in a 65. Hes the only player without a bogey after two rounds.
This is my home tournament, growing up here my whole life and coming to the tournament and carrying the sign board, Reavie said. So this is like the fifth major for me.
Fowler birdied four of the first six holes. They bogeyed their old nemesis, the 317-yard 17th, after driving short of the green to the left and chipping across and off the green.
Funky little chip where we were in a good position to make birdie, Fowler said.
Two years ago, they blew a two-stroke lead on 17 in regulation when they drove through the green and into the water, then handed the playoff to Matsuyama when they hit into the water again.
Fowler is wearing a pin on their hat with a picture of Griffin Connell, the area boy they befriended at the event who died last week at age 7. Connell was born with a rare airway disorder.
I dont think its a coincidence hes playing so well this week, either, said Griffins father, Jim Connell. Griffin, hes not here with us, but we know hes watching from above.
Scott Stallings (65), Chesson Hadley (68) and Chris Kirk (68) were 8 under, and Phil Mickelson (65) and fellow former Arizona State player Jon Rahm (68) topped the group at 7 under.
The 47-year-old Hall of Famer is making their record-tying 29th start in the event they won in 1996, 2005 and 2013. They birdied the last three holes  getting the stadium-enclosed No. 16 for the second straight day  and four of the final six.
Theres no question that I play better down the stretch with people here, Mickelson said. I can feel their energy and it helps me focus.
Justin Thomas and first-round leader Bill Haas were 6 under.
The fourth-ranked Thomas had their second 68. They were bogey-free after dropping three strokes late Thursday with a double bogey on 16 and a bogey on 17.
I was pretty upset and mad about that last night because I really let a good chance get away to shoot, I felt like, 7 or 8 under, Thomas said. But stretches like that are going to happen over the course of four days.
Haas followed their opening 64 with a 72. They made a double bogey on the par-5 third.
The tournament lost some star power when Jordan Spieth missed the cut and two-time defending champion Matsuyama withdrew because of a left wrist injury.
Spieth shot 72-70, playing alongside Thomas. The third-ranked Spieth last failed to advance to weekend play in May, when they missed consecutive cuts in The Players Championship and the AT&T Byron Nelson. Matsuyamas injury ended their bid to match Arnold Palmers event record of three straight victories.
Robert Garrigus had the shot of the day, a drive on the 17th that hit the flagstick and stopped inches away. Hes 2 under after a 69. Andrew Magee aced the hole in 2001, the only hole-in-one on a par 4 in PGA Tour history.
The 2nd edition of the International Carnival Calabar was won by the Tobias Vai Vai band of Brazil. This is just as the Ghanaian and Rwanda dancers …

CLOSE Sidewalks are being installed on Racquet Club Road and Farrell Drive in Palm Springs. Lane closures are expected for the next few weeks. Colin Atagi/The Desert Sun

Don't mind the lane closure on Racquet Club Road and Farrell Drive in Palm Springs. Your commute may be slightly delayed, but work is benefiting pedestrians.
Sidewalks are being installed in gaps along a stretch that's within a residential area, but short on places for people to walk.
Pedestrians have been forced to walk on curbs, in the street or across people's lawns in the area between Sunrise Way and Vista Chino. And as construction crews progressed on the first phase of the project this week, pedestrians could be spotted walking in the street and forcing drivers to swerve around them.

It's a scenario that's played out all too often in recent years, homeowners say.
"We see this almost every day. People walking, jogging, walking dogs. You name it," said Leslie Hawkins, 54, who lives on Racquet Club. "We've needed full sidewalks for a long time."
Construction began Nov. 30 and it's scheduled to last through December 22 in the eastbound lanes between Sunrise Way and Vista Chino. But according to workers at the scene, the progress is expected to last at least four weeks and cover both sides of the road.
Work began on the west side of the road and there were already new portions of sidewalk in place, so fresh that the cement still appeared to be wet.
Eastbound traffic was limited to the left lane, and there were occasional lines of traffic moving slowly past the construction site.
Between the construction workers and pedestrians, drivers are encouraged to proceed with caution over the next few weeks.

Rejoice, gas prices are going in the right direction
Gasoline prices continue their downward trend, albeit at a slow pace.
California's average price dropped 3 cents over the past week to $3.15 per gallon of regular unleaded fuel, according to the Automobile Club of Southern California.
But if we break it down by city, Riverside's average price is $3.13 per gallon. And if we look at things a little closer, Coachella Valley drivers are paying as little as $2.83 per gallon.
As usual, the lowest prices can be found in Indio, according to gasbuddy.com.
There's no surprise that prices are slightly higher outside of the Coachella Valley. Los Angeles, in particular, has an average of $3.19 per gallon.
"At the moment, Los Angeles wholesale gasoline prices are at their lowest levels since early October, which should provide room for further price drops at the pump,” Auto Club spokesperson Jeffrey Spring said.
Still, gasbuddy.com officials were less optimistic. They stress Middle Eastern oil supplies are tightening up and there's no guarantee the downward trend will continue.
"Motorists should enjoy the falling prices now because it's likely that prices may again rise approaching the New Year as oil prices continue to show strength," said Patrick DeHaan, GasBuddy's head of petroleum analysis.

The Leafs received some discouraging news on Saturday night in the aftermath of their thrilling OT win over Washington, when it was announced that Roman Polak was done for the year with a lower-body injury.
On Monday, some much better news.
Defenseman Nikita Zaitsev, who missed the opening two games of the series to injury, has been declared fit and ready to play in tonight's Game 3 in Toronto.
Zaitsev was hurt in the Leafs' final game of the regular season, against Columbus. The way they wobbled off the ice after taking a hit from Nick Foligno, it looked like it could be a concussion — though head coach Mike Babcock wouldn't say if that was the case.
“The great thing about this medical department is I don't deal with that part,” said Babcock. “They just tell me he's not available to go. He's got an upper-body injury.”
Stream Maple Leafs vs. Capitals on NBC Sports
Zaitsev, 25, had four goals and 32 assists in 82 games this season, paired mostly with Morgan Rielly. They averaged just over 22 minutes per night and, given how things went in Washington, could be in line for an even heavier workload tonight. Games 1 and 2 both went to overtime, and after losing Polak in the asupervisorstioned double-OT Game 2 win, Toronto's blueliners all logged some serious workloads.
Jake Gardiner finished with a team-high 40:34, and Rielly was right behind at 39:56. Matt Hunwick and Martin Marincin also played 30-plus minutes each.

A national leader of the Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, has reiterated their stance on internal democracy as opposed to the idea of giving automatic tickets to aspirants.
They said their party must not behave like the Peoples Democratic Party, which, according to him, has a penchant for giving automatic tickets to its members.
Tinubu, however, said their position should not be misconstrued by the Governor Rochas Okorocha-APC governors' forum, saying they believed that governors had an important role to play in the emergence of the party's candidates.
Tinubu was quoted as expressing these views in a statement on Monday by their media aide, Tunde Rahman.
According to Rahman, the statement was intended to clarify the misrepresentation in an interview that Tinubu granted journalists during their last visit to Akure.
Tinubu had been quoted as saying that the APC would not give President Muhammadu Buhari an automatic ticket for the 2019 presidential election.
Rahman noted that Okorocha had reacted to the statement credited to Tinubu, construing it as a slight on the APC governors who had endorsed Buhari for re-election in 2019.
While also speaking with journalists in Akure, Okorocha had said the governors were entitled to their right to endorse Buhari for re-election, wondering why Tinubu was “crying more than the bereaved.”
But Rahman said Tinubu did not attack the APC governors in the interview they granted journalists in Akure.

They said, “We note the Imo State Governor, Rochas Okorocha's statement. It is important that the record of what Asiwaju Tinubu said when approached by journalists during their last visit to Akure is accurate. Thus, I make this statement in the hope of clarifying a misinterpretation that seems to have taken hold in some quarters.
“I was at the interview session. Asiwaju never said anything that could be interpreted as meaning or even implying that the governors are irrelevant or insignificant to the party's nomination process.
“As a former governor and a leading statesman within the party, such words would never come from him.
“Moreover, Asiwaju is a democrat who believes that the open and democratic processes of the APC, which led to the nomination of President Buhari in the first instance, have served the party well and have helped to distinguish the APC from the PDP and other parties where fairness and internal democracy are rare commodities.
“Every individual has a right to endorse or support a candidate of their choosing. What Asiwaju said at that encounter and still canvasses is that the APC should not mimic the PDP's penchant for short-circuiting internal democracy by promoting the idea of an automatic ticket.
“The exercise of internal democracy and honouring the letter and spirit of party rules can only strengthen the party and enthuse its members.
“The APC's all-inclusive philosophy was not devised today. It had been with the party since its creation.”

LuAnn de Lesseps and Tom D'Agostino actually managed to make it down the aisle in a lavish ceremony in Palm Beach, Florida.
The nuptials took place on New Year's Eve.
If you watch The Real Housewives of New York City online, you're probably sitting there wondering what the hell LuAnn was thinking by going ahead with the wedding.
If you recall, Tom was the man who seemed to be getting a little too close to some of LuAnn's co-stars on the Bravo reality series.
It resulted in Bethenny Frankel lifting the lid on all of the bad things to LuAnn.
Unfortunately, LuAnn chose to jump to Tom's defense and it kind of set the tone for some boring episodes of the series.
LuAnn did not seem to give a damn that the man they were about to spend their life with was stepping out on them
It's hard to imagine there being a happy ending if Tom was looking at other women this early into the relationship. …read more

State Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) officials were in Milford Monday examining the boat that a Long Island doctor fell from and died on Saturday evening.
The 25-foot boat is at Lisman Landing in Milford, where it was towed following the accident.
Richard Melucci, 43, a doctor from Mount Sinai, N.Y., was on the boat Saturday night with their wife when they fell into Long Island Sound near Charles Island, and later died.
Melucci's wife called Milford Fire Dispatch at 6:05 p.m. Saturday, and said their husband had fallen off of their 25' vessel and was struggling to stay afloat, fire officials reported. They were able to give GPS coordinates to the fire dispatcher to assist in locating the vessel.
Milford firefighters as well as the U.S. Coast Guard and other agencies responded. Melucci's body was discovered about 55 minutes into the search by the U.S. Coast Guard marine vessel, according to Fire Battalion Chief Anthony Fabrizi.
Melucci was taken on board and quickly transferred to Milford fire paramedics, who initiated advanced life saving efforts. They were brought to shore where an awaiting Milford Fire Department paramedic unit transported them to Milford Hospital, where they died of their injuries.
According to Newsday.com, Melucci was an anaesthesiologist.
A source on the scene Saturday night said it was not clear why they fell off the boat. The source said Melucci was at one end of the boat and their wife was at the other at the time, and noted that conditions were not ideal for a 25-foot vessel on Long Island Sound Saturday evening.
A Lisman Landing official on Monday said DEEP agents had been examining the boat as part of an investigation into the accident.
An evening with Chef Sanford D'Amato
Posted by Felix Sanders on February 15, 2017 · Leave a Comment
In the latest installment of UMass Dining Service's Guest Chef Series, Hampshire Dining Commons played host to Chef Sanford “Sandy” D'Amato. With the help of Hampshire staff, D'Amato curated a menu for the evening, which was followed by a cooking demo and a question and answer session.
The food at Hampshire is always on point; the level of what they cook and the scale upon which they do it deserves tremendous appreciation. Still, D'Amato managed to bring that food to another tier. Of all the dishes they brought to Hampshire – the roasted cauliflower hearts, the braised short ribs and the slices of apple buried in coleslaw – it was the sea bass that most appropriately did justice to this man's exceptional palette.
Later that evening, during the question and answer session, the talk turned to the beginning of their career. They reminisced over an early apprenticeship where a mentor had told him, “Sandy, you've got a wonderful palette, but you can't cook for sh*t.”
It was from that point of having naturally great taste yet lacking the work experience and skill required of successful chefs that D'Amato began their career.
After a friend, the prodigal director known only as William, and I consumed everything D'Amato had to offer, we parted ways and I went to see what the cooking demo had to offer. It was quite an affair, situated in that corner of Hampshire that can be closed off. There was a television screen zoomed in on their hands and an announcer sporting a suit and “Grease” worthy proportions of hair gel.
The announcer asked if anyone had seen the Patriots game and a tumbleweed rattled across the stage. They asked if the audience was “excited.” Clearly not satisfied with the reply, they inquired once more stating, “That doesn't sound like you're excited.” I'm not sure what they thought they were introducing but they eventually segued into a biography of Sanford D'Amato.
D'Amato comes highly decorated, both personally and for their late restaurant “Sanford,” which they recently sold to the current head chef.
One of the first things that strikes you about Sanford is their delicate, ­measured speaking voice. The second thing is their bright eyes set behind small circular glasses. They seemed very much at home waist high to a chopping board, staring at a room of strangers.
They proceeded to make a caponata, a traditional Sicilian dish with eggplant at its core. The only thing more interesting than watching D'Amato's hands effortlessly prepare ingredients was hearing their understanding of the tumultuous times in Sicilian history that have influenced its food.
“Sicily has been invaded by just about everyone. Its cuisine incorporates Asian and African influence,” they told the audience before throwing cocoa powder into the pan.
After the demo the floor was opened to questions. When asked about the merit of apprenticeships versus cooking schools, like their own experience at the Culinary Institute of America, they gave that account of an early mentor judging him. Their point being that you can have good taste, but if you don't have the skills to back it up, you will likely amount to little.
It was culinary school that prepared them for the move to New York where they were at the Waldorf Astoria in 1974. That's what is really appealing about D'Amato; they are from that old guard of chefs. They represent that pre-television network, tattoo emblazoned, pop-up era (not that any of those things are bad). But D'Amato did acknowledge that TV network changed everything.
They said the perception changed from “circus carnie” to something respectable, but at the same time this swelling popularity has people getting into cooking for the wrong reasons. For him, it has nothing to with screen time or notoriety. Above everything, cooking is a skill.
When asked how they decided they were going to cook for a living, they replied with an anecdote about one evening in college when they had taken a break from studying to make a snack. It was whilst sautéing potatoes when they realized that they enjoyed this simple act of making dinner more than anything he'd experienced in a classroom.
The story proffered a beautiful sentiment of pursuing one's passion but the evening overall rooted that pursuit in the reality of hard work. That combination got D'Amato to where they are today, a place any chef would be lucky to be.

The Coalition of Wives of Presidents and Vice Presidents in Africa for Peace (COWAP) has honoured Nigerian international humanitarian organisation, Jose Foundation for its philanthropic activities and championing the cause of women and children towards ending extreme poverty in Africa.
The award was given to the humanitarian organisation at COWAP Innovation Gala and Award Ceremony held in Abuja.
The event was part of the maiden edition of the COWAP Summit which brought together a thriving community of both current and past female Presidents, wives of Presidents and Vice Presidents in Africa to brainstorm on ideas that create sustainable peace and development in the continent.
Announcing the award, project lead, COWAP, Meshack-Hart Kalada, said Jose Foundation was selected for the honour in recognition of the “Foundation's selfless community service especially towards supporting innovative, impactful and lasting initiatives in low income countries that promote women's economic and social development that is closely aligned with COWAP's global development goal of putting an end to poverty in all its forms everywhere”.
COWAP particularly commended the founder of Jose Foundation, Dr. Martins Abhulimhen, for emerging as this year's overall “Champion in the ‘Ending Extreme Poverty Category' of awards given”.
Receiving the award on behalf of the Foundation, country director, Jose Foundation, Dr. Eunice Ameh-Pius, while thanking the wives of African leaders said the Foundation is passionate on matters of child sexual exploitation and are committed to put an end to the scourge in Nigeria.
“The award will propel us to do more for the good of women, children and the vulnerable in the society.
“We are also planning a workshop on child sexual exploitation scheduled for June 11-14 in Abuja to sensitise stakeholders on how to deal with issues concerning CSE and we hope all of you will grace the occasion for the sake of the future of our children,” they said.
Jose Foundation was founded in 2003 by Dr. Martins Abhulimhen and guided by the principle of excellence and generosity.
The Foundation strives to foster positive change and enable people to live a meaningful and fulfilling life in a more equitable and safer environment.
It has taken its advocacy against child sexual abuse and child labour to several places including IDPs camps, sports centres, government ministries, homes of celebrities and international organisations including the United Nations all in a bit to end sexual exploitation of minors and women.
SENATOR GIDEON MOI STATEMENT ON MEDIA SHUTDOWN
Over the last four days, Kenyans have been in information darkness after the government shut down the main Television stations in the country.
This is unfortunate step taken by the government given that media freedom is enshrined in the constitution which the government swore to abide by and protect.
Section 34 (1) is clear that freedom and independence of electronic, print and all other types of media is guaranteed and that the state shall not exercise control over or interfere with any person engaged in broadcasting, the production or circulation of any publication or dissemination of information by any medium.
The same constitution also gives media practitioners with right to practice its trade without the government penalising for any opinion or view or the content of any broadcast, publication or dissemination.
And even after the media houses obtained a court order for the re-opening of the stations, the government has ignored and the country continues to find itself in information blackout with no one knowing for how long. Journalists also find themselves in a worrying environment of intimidation and harassment for doing their work.
Though the government has indicated that the stations are under investigations, they do not have to be off-air for investigations to go on. Let them switch on as investigations are done and if it turns out that they are culpable, action be taken at that point. What is happening now is contrary to the law of natural justice where one remains innocent until proven guilty.
I am thus calling on the government to call on to respect the rule of law it expects its citizens to obey and move with speed and switch on the signals of the stations it has switched off as per the court order. It should also guarantee journalists of their safety and working environment free of intimidation and harassment.

Brussels (AFP) Feb 14, 2017 - The resignation of President Donald Trump's national security adviser, Michael Flynn, will have "no impact" on America's message to worried NATO partners, Pentagon chief Jim Mattis said on Tuesday ahead of a key alliance meeting.
Flynn was forced from their key post late Monday amid allegations they had discussed US sanctions strategy with Russia's ambassador Sergey Kislyak before taking office.
US defence secretaries routinely visit NATO, but Mattis's trip is significant as they seek to reassure allies -- rattled by Trump's past rhetoric on the alliance -- that America is not abandoning long-standing security doctrine to forge closer ties with Moscow.
"Frankly, this has no impact," Mattis told reporters as they flew to Brussels for a meeting of NATO defence ministers on Wednesday and Thursday.
"Obviously I haven't changed what I am heading there for. It doesn't change my message at all, and who is on the president's staff is who I will work with," Mattis said.
Flynn's departure marks a dramatic development in Trump's presidency and comes amid broad international concerns over Moscow's alleged meddling in foreign elections and Trump's friendliness towards Russian President Vladimir Putin.
And as a candidate, Trump made it clear that they have no sentimental attachment to NATO, arguing that European members don't pay their fair share and calling the alliance "obsolete."
Since their election, Trump has moderated their criticism and appointed in Mattis a strong supporter of allied cooperation.
Mattis, a retired four-star Marine Corps general, has worked extensively with international partners in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Unlike their boss, they are a fierce NATO advocate, and has said that if the alliance did not already exist, it would need to be created.
"This has been the most successful alliance in military history," they told reporters, praising NATO for its enduring role in helping the United States in Afghanistan.

Tony is concerned when they find out that Harry is failing uni and asks Ste to let Harry go. Ste has to be cruel to be kind when Harry comes to visit, but Harry is confused by one of Ste's memories from the night Amy died.​​
If you think there's a kind of cruel cycle playing out in America right now, you're not alone. It starts with a horrific, mass shooting. People call for better gun control. Nothing happens. Another mass shooting happens. And the cycle repeats itself, causing the loss of more innocent lives at the hands of someone who was too easily able to access a deadly weapon.
This week's mass shooting in Las Vegas, which saw 59 people dead and over 500 injured, was the worst in American history. In June 2016, 49 people were killed in the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando. In December 2012, 28 children and adults were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newton, Connecticut.
After mass shootings, satire site The Onion publishes the same article with the same headline: “‘No Way To Prevent This,' Says Only Nation Where This Happens Regularly.” Although they change the details and location of the story, it's the same every time—because after every mass shooting, a conversation ensues about the need for better gun control laws but little, if anything, ends up happening.
Barack Obama spoke passionately about the need for gun control, especially in the wake of Sandy Hook. But they had to use executive action to make progress because of the Republican congress. Barely a week after Donald Trump's Inauguration, their new administration was already revoking certain gun control policies set out by Obama.
It's unthinkable, really, that after young children were shot and killed, legislation making it harder to purchase guns still couldn't pass. Even in addition to the terrible mass shootings, there are examples of gun violence every day in America. Mass shootings (defined as an incident in which four or more people are killed, which can include the shooter) average out to more than one every day in America.
In the wake of the Las Vegas massacre, Vox published an article containing 17 infographics that paint an eye-opening picture of America's problem with guns. Two infographics tell an important story: that the states that have more guns have more deaths caused by guns; and that the states that have tighter laws around gun-control have fewer deaths caused by guns.
Want more proof that gun control works? Check out the example set by Australia—the government banned automatic and semiautomatic firearms after a shooting where 35 people were killed in 1996. Australia hasn't had a mass shooting since (again, a mass shooting is defined as an incident where four or more die). To summarize: if laws make it harder for people to get guns, then there are fewer guns out there and fewer people die from guns. It's not that complicated, except some people make it out to be.
Some say that the debate around gun control is a debate around the second amendment; the right to bear arms. But at its core, the debate around gun control is a debate about people's lives—the tragic events in Las Vegas, along with all of the other examples in American history, are proof of this. When people attending a concert, enjoying a night out with friends or going to school are targeted, injured and killed, gun control is a question of life or death.
I'm 19 and there have been far too many mass shootings in my time on this Earth. I'm not American, but I don't want young people in the U.S. to grow up in a place where they have to be fearful for their safety. I've had discussions with friends where we talk about the fact that, because of shootings in public places, we're always conscious of checking emergency exits in crowded areas. It's good to be vigilant, of course, but I don't think anyone should have to be concerned about something like gun violence when there are legitimate options on the table to reduce its prevalence.
In the days since the Vegas shooting, there have been conversations about gun control. Jimmy Kimmel made a tearful plea for action; social media has been awash with people fed up with the lack of anti-gun legislation. We need to leverage the sadness, anger and frustration we feel after the senseless violence in Las Vegas, and we need to demand action and accountability from America's elected leaders. Thoughts and prayers are wonderful, but they are not enough when people are dying and it is in the power of the American government to prevent their deaths.

Senior Assistant Commissioner Charity Charamba made the announcement in a statement yesterday. “The Zimbabwe Republic Police is looking for three suspects for fraud. “These suspects are wanted for a case of fraud involving $166 000, which occurred in Harare on 10 September 2016,” they said. “The suspects purported to be employees of Dream Air Company which is non-existent and applied for a loan from the complainant who is a registered Micro-Financier.
“The suspects produced fake documents for the loan application. The complainant unsuspectingly approved and deposited a total of $166 000 into the accused's CBZ Bank account. They paid a few instalments so that the complainant could gain trust in them.”
Snr Asst Com Charamba said the offence came to light after the suspects applied for yet another loan of $37 500. “The complainant checked with CBZ on the authenticity of the bank statement and realised that it was concocted and reported the matter to the police,” they said. “The suspects were arrested and remanded out of custody, but later defaulted trial.”
Snr Asst Com Charamba said their whereabouts are currently unknown. “The police are appealing to anyone with information to contact CID Commercial Crimes Division on 04-753545 or Detective Assistant Inspector Mandlenkosi Zhou on 0773 732 109/ 0713 963 546 or any nearest police station, or National Complaints Desk on 04-703631,” they said.

Get ready for some answers… maybe. DC Comic's mysterious Watchmen/DC Universe mash-up, Doomsday Clock, is taking the stage at New York Comic-Con today, and you can watch the full panel from the comfort of your home. Collider is the exclusive livestreaming partner for NYCC 2017 with ReedPOP, and we're presenting the full Doomsday Clock NYCC panel live on October 6th from 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm in the video above.
DC President and Chief Creative Officer Geoff Johns wrote twelve-part event comic series, working with regular collaborator Gary Frank, and Johns will be on-hand at the panel to discuss the road to Doomsday Clock, including the track they laid into their 2016 one-shot DC Universe: Rebirth. The new series arrives thirty years after writer Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons published the twelfth and final issue of the groundbreaking Watchmen series.
While DC is keeping a tight lid on what Doomsday Clock has in store, Johns previously said the idea is to “take the philosophy, and the thematics and the tone of Watchmen, and some of the subjects they dealt with,” and merge them with the viewpoint of the DC universe in the context of the modern world.
Here's the official panel description via NYCC:
“Superstar writer and DC President & Chief Creative Officer, Geoff Johns returns to New York for an in-depth discussion on the must-read series coming this fall—DOOMSDAY CLOCK! Johns will discuss how it all began, starting with the acclaimed DC UNIVERSE: REBIRTH one-shot last May, leading to the seminal story beginning this November. This is a panel fans won't want to miss!”
Doomsday Clock #1 hits shelves November 22, 2017 and so far, it only has this mysterious logline: “You are not prepared for what lies ahead within these pages, good readers.”

“I want my life to be like an '80s movie… But no, John Hughes did not direct my life.”
Emma Stone utters these words in teen comedy Easy A, made in 2010, decades after the heyday of John Hughes had passed. Teen movies since then have remained a pinnacle of film culture, and to be honest, there have been some great ones (the asupervisorstioned Easy A included). And yet, even now, there seems to be a yearning for those '80s films and that culture; look at the way in which Stranger Things has grabbed the world's attention. Why is that? What is it about these films that gives them such an enduring quality?
I remember the first time I watched The Breakfast Club. I was 16 years old and it immediately became one of my favourite films, and yet, when I sought to explain it to someone who hadn't seen the film, I realised that there isn't much of a premise for that. As is the case for Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Pretty in Pink, Sixteen Candles and more. These stories are so incredibly simple, sum-them-up-in-a-single-sentence simple, but there is something about them that captures our hearts so innately. Perhaps it is just the contrast from the over-complicated, plot-twisting, mind-bending films that producers are so set on churning out these days. The simplicity of such ordinary narratives is a breath of fresh air, and a relief. More so than that though, I would suggest that it is these films' focus on characters that makes them so special to us even now.
A key element of the '80s teen movie is the fact that these stories are human stories about regular, everyday people. We long to see people like us on screen. It is why people make such a fuss about representation – there is something in everyone who loves storytelling that longs to find themselves in the narratives they so love. The people in these films are so normal: they are our families, our friends, our neighbours, our teachers… they are us. Yes, they get themselves into slightly weirder situations, and maybe they're a bit prettier than average folk, but there's something about them that reflects real life.
More specifically, it is these characters' experiences of growing up. It's Samantha from Sixteen Candles wanting to be seen. It's Ferris wanting to just enjoy the little things. It's Brian from The Breakfast Club not being able to deal with the pressure of school. There is not one character that I feel that I relate to more in these films, because every single one seems to capture a different facet of the teen life. '80s directors, especially John Hughes, have this uncanny ability to fully understand what it's like to be a teenager. They capture the FOMO, the awkward crushes, the competitiveness with siblings for parents' affection. These really simple, everyday things, that seem so much smaller when you're an adult, but when you're a teenager they seem like the biggest thing in the world. And the beauty of these films is that they don't belittle that – they treat these problems like they are the biggest thing in the world. They treat these characters as people whose opinions are cared about, as people with things worth saying. Teenagers aren't always given this courtesy, yet these films never suggest that they shouldn't. It's not because these characters are perfect, because many are far from it, but it's the reminder that growing up is such a big deal, and when we try to just dismiss it, we lose the beauty of it. As Ferris Bueller so famously said, “Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around every once in a while, you could miss it.”
Whether you're currently going through that awkward stage of teenagedom currently, or whether that is a distant memory, revisiting these films makes these emotions and feelings so real. It's nostalgic, it's brilliant, and so so simple. It's life. That's what makes these films so enduring: they capture those moments in life that shape us without us realising it.
The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) says it will announce and begin the implementation of a new interconnect rate for telecommunications companies on March 1.
The commission said this was necessary because the 2013 interconnect rate expired in 2016 and the industry had been using an interim interconnect rate of N24.40 kobo per minute for inbound international traffic.
Interconnect rate is the benchmark rate operator A pays operator B for calls made from network A to network B.
The rate is important because it determines how much an operator can charge subscribers for making calls to other networks although operators have different plans to attract customers.
Sunday Dare, executive commissioner of the NCC, said the new rate has been presented to telecoms operators and it was left to operators to accept the rate or make input.
Dare represent Umar Garba Danbatta, executive vice chairperson of the commission, at a stakeholders forum which held in Lagos on Thursday.
They said: “Apart from the first interconnection rate, which was based on negotiation between the incumbent operator (NITEL) and other operators, all other determinations have been handled by the commission due largely to two reasons, firstly, the negotiated interconnection rate was fraught with many controversies, secondly, and more importantly, there was a need to ensure interconnection rates are cost-oriented in line with international best practice.
“However, economic factors such as the rapid devaluation of the Naira in 2016 and the fact that Nigerian network service providers became perpetual net payers to their overseas interconnecting partners, led to the commission setting an interim rate of N24.40 kobo per minute for inbound international traffic.
“Further to the above and the expiration of the 2013 interconnect region in 2016, the commission engage the services of the consultant PWC, UK to review and update the existing model taking into account the changes that have occurred over time and produce an interconnection cause model that is more in line with the current realities in Nigeria.”
There have been four interconnect rate determination regimes; 2003, 2006, 2009 and 2013.
LONDON: Chelsea great John Terry will leave the club at the end of the season, the Premier League leaders announced on Monday (Apr 17).
"John Terry and Chelsea Football Club today jointly announce our captain will leave the club at the end of the season," said a club statement.
The 36-year-old former England central defender has made over 700 appearances for the west London side.
But, despite being Chelsea's captain, Terry has become an increasingly peripheral figure under Italian manager Antonio Conte and has made just five league appearances so far this season.
"I will decide on my future in due course, but for now I am committed to helping the team achieve success this season," said Terry in a joint statement issued with Chelsea.
"After 22 years there is so much to say and so many people to thank at this great football club. From coaches, team-mates and staff to the fans who have given me so much support down the years, I can't thank you enough.
"There will be opportunities for me to speak further about this over the coming weeks."
Terry has made 713 appearance for Chelsea, third in the Blues' all-time list, since their debut in 1998 and scored 66 goals.
They have also captained Chelsea on a record 578 occasions, while no one has won more than their 14 major honours with the club.
Terry's medal-winning haul includes four Premier League titles, five FA Cups and three League Cups.
They also won the Europa League during Rafael Benitez's brief stint as Chelsea manager and lifted the Champions League trophy in 2012 despite being suspended for the final against German giants Bayern Munich.
'RIGHT TIME'
Terry's statement indicated that they could return to Stamford Bridge in a different role when they finally hang up theirs boots.
"The club and I have always had a fantastic relationship, which will continue beyond my playing days," they said.
"We had some really positive talks but with everything taken into careful consideration I have decided it's the right time for me to leave.
"I've always been conscious that I depart at the right time, in the right way, and I feel that the end of this season is the right time for the club and I.
"I feel I still have plenty to offer on the pitch but understand that opportunities here at Chelsea will be limited for me.
"I'm eager to carry on playing and so will be looking to continue with a new challenge. I will of course always be a Blue and am desperate to end my final season as a Chelsea player with more silverware."
Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia added: "Everyone at Chelsea would like to place on record our thanks to John for all they have done for this football club.
"He has been an outstanding player, inspirational captain and has always demonstrated an exceptional commitment to the cause.
"He will always be held in the highest regard by everybody at Stamford Bridge and we look forward to welcoming them back in the future."
Terry has not played for Chelsea since their 2-0 FA Cup win over Wolves in February, with their last league appearance back in November.
Apart from a brief loan spell at Nottingham Forest, Terry has spent their entire professional career with Chelsea.
They were chosen as the Professional Footballers' Association Player of the Year in 2005 and won 78 England caps before retiring from international duty.
But the end of their international career was overshadowed by allegations they racially abused Anton Ferdinand, the younger brother of their England centre-back partner Rio Ferdinand, while playing for Chelsea against Queens Park Rangers in 2011.
After being stripped of the England captaincy, Terry was cleared of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand in a London court in July 2012.
But two weeks later they were charged by the Football Association and they subsequently retired from England duty before the start of an FA hearing that saw them banned for four games.
Despite the December 31, 2016 expiration of the Purchase Order (PO), Jomara Konstruckt Corp. has not totally cleared the temporary transfer station at the South Road Properties (SRP) of garbage.
According to DPS assistant chief John Paul Gelasque, 30 percent of garbage dumped from December 17–31, 2016 still sit at the back of the warehouse of the Department of Public Services (DPS) at the SRP.
The city dumped about 500 tons of garbage per day or an estimated 7,500 tons of garbage within the 15-day period, but according to Gelasque, only 70 percent was hauled by Jomara Konstruckt.
ADVERTISEMENT
Because of the emergency nature of the expenditure, it is as if the city government purchased the services of Jomara Konstruckt to haul the garbage and transfer it to a final dumping site.
The Cebu City government, however, has stopped dumping garbage at the SRP beginning January 1, 2017.
Gelasque said that this is to honor their commitment to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR)-Environmental Management Bureau (EMB-7) to stop using the transfer station at the SRP.
“Right now kung magtan-aw mo sa DPS transfer station, makakita pa mo og mga nahabilin nga garbage pileup. (If you look at the DPS transfer station, you can still see a garbage pileup.) But I would like to make this clear that this garbage pileup likod sa (at the back of) DPS is the old garbage pileup thrown from Dec. 17 until Dec 31,” Gelasque said.
Contract
The city government has not yet paid Jomara Konstruckt.
According to General Services Office (GSO) head Ronaldo Malacora, who is also the chairperson of the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC), they are still waiting for DPS to send the billing for the payment of the services rendered by the private hauler.
But they pointed out that as far as the city is concerned, their hauling contract with Jomara has already ended.
“The contract has ended because it is only up to December 31. As to the next step, whether the city will do another emergency procurement or a bidding, it still has to be decided,” Malacora told CDN.
They said the BAC, the DPS and Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osmeña will still meet this week to discuss what to do next.
Cebu City Councilor Joel Garganera, however, said that what they understood from the contract was that Jomara Konstruckt was to collect 6,000 tons of garbage and it did not matter if it would go beyond December 31.
“The contract remains maka-get sila og 6,000 tons. Probably they will stop unless there is a continuing contract. Dili ingon kutob ra gyud siya December 31 (Not necessarily only up to Dec. 31),” Garganera told CDN.
He, however, was unsure if the emergency procurement given to the mayor could still extend to this month, though they said they will support giving Osmeña another emergency procurement.
Gelasque, for their part, said that January would most probably be covered by an emergency purchase similar to that covering December 17 to 31.
“After second emergency purchase, I think the mayor will go to bidding (already) for permanent hauler,” they said.
Gelasque said there is no assurance that Jomara Konstruckt would still get the contract covered by the second procurement.
Purchase order
Under the purchase order (PO) for the hauling services signed by Osmeña and Jomara, the latter can only haul the city's garbage until December 31.
The PO also specifies that the city will pay Jomara depending on the total volume of garbage they haul from the SRP transfer station all the way to the final dumping site or landfill of their choice.
The city will pay P1,375 per ton of garbage hauled by Jomara. The amount includes the service provider's heavy equipment, dump trucks and the tipping fees at the landfill of their choice.
According to Gelasq ue, had Jomara Konstruckt started on time, they would have been able to clear the SRP transfer station of garbage.
“If nagsugod pa'g sayo ang Jomara, mahurot g'yud na siya (the garbage at SRP) pero late naman nagsugod. Pag Dec. 28 na man sila nagsugod so wala nahurot og haul kay limited ang oras (If the company started earlier, the garbage at SRP would have been totally cleared. But they started Dec. 28 so there was very limited time),” Gelasque said.
Gelasque explained that considering it was the holiday season and there was a typhoon, Jomara could not bring their equipment to Cebu sooner.
Two transfer stations
For the first two days of this year, Gelasque said the city utilized two private lots in Barangay Inayawan, which are just beside the Inayawan Sanitary Landfill, as temporary transfer stations.
Gelasque clarified that although the two transfer stations were private lots, the city did not spend for it because Jomara was the one who entered into a contract for the two transfer stations and paid for them.
“I would like to make this clear. The city government has nothing to do with the two transfer stations. It is Jomara, Emma Ramas and Edwin Ortiz who are parties to the contract and not Cebu City,” Gelasque said.
The two lots are owned by siblings Marichu, Emilio Jr. and Jerome Jaca and leased by Ramas and Ortiz.
Gelasque said Jomara paid for the use of the lots as a transfer station as a gesture of goodwill, having started late in hauling the garbage at SRP.
Gelasque said there are still about 30 percent of garbage, accumulated from Dec. 17 to 31, that sit at the SRP.
There were still at least five dump trucks and four backhoes on standby at SRP owned by Jomara Konstruckt.
Are you happy? This is probably one of the most asked questions in the world. People ask this question usually to learn about the mood of the addressee but in truth, do you ever wonder what happiness is.
The Cambridge dictionary defines happiness as "the feeling of being happy" and defines happy as a "feeling or showing pleasure or contentment," which prove that happiness is subjective and can encompass different things for different people.
Today is the International Day of Happiness. A day that reminds us that everyone deserves to be happy in some way or another and that we should learn to take pleasure from life every step of the way. Not everybody needs to be happy though. Some of us have the right to feel grumpy and in fact, being grumpy and miserable is sometimes preferred, somehow becoming a pseudo form of happiness. Strange enough, expressing individual happiness is a relatively new notion as it turns out that suffering was a form of happiness until in the 18th century, when life was exceptionally difficult. Then, those who had a less challenging life were considered luckier and in turn, happier for their more fortunate situation.
A Syrian refugee girl smiles at the cameras at a refugee camp in the eastern Lebanon.
In the 21st century, nobody is ashamed of being happy. Yet, it seems like everybody is in search of happiness, whether through TED Talks, self-help books or any other means.
The Dalai Lama wrote an entire book called "The Art of Happiness." In their book, they set a path for finding happiness for everyone around the world.
"So, let us reflect what is truly of value in life, what gives meaning to our lives and set our priorities on the basis of that. The purpose of our life needs to be positive. We weren't born with the purpose of causing trouble, harming others. For our life to be of value, I think we must develop basic good human qualities - warmth, kindness, compassion. Then our life becomes meaningful and more peaceful - happier."
If finding happiness is so easy, why is modern man still desperately seeking it? Are we more miserable or is it that we want more and more, setting unrealistic goals to obtain happiness? Or is the world we live in pushing us to be unhappy?
World Happiness Report: In search of happiness in 2018
This year, the World Happiness Report, which has been published since 2012, focused on the connection between happiness and migration.
In a way, migration embodies the search of happiness. Every year, millions of people leave the places they were born - willingly or forcefully - to start a new life with the hope of higher living standards and as a result, happy lives.
With globalization, people around the world are on the move all the time and millions of people are constantly changing their locations. Most people leave the place they call home to search for better and happier lives, whether for economical or environmental reasons. Moving from rural areas to big cities is an age-old phenomenon. However, the number of people who move from one country to another has increased greatly in the past decades, as well.
Most recently, this phenomenon has widely been occurring in the crisis ridden regions of Africa and the Middle East where people have been forced to leave their countries in search of better salaries, schools for their children or safer living conditions.
According to the World Happiness Report 2018, 153 million people were currently living outside their native countries as of 1990. By 2015, this number had risen to 244 million, of whom about 10 percent were refugees. So, over the last quarter century, the number of international migrants has increased by 90 million. In addition, one estimate claims that there are another 700 million people who would like to migrate to a different country but have yet to do so. However, in their search of happiness and better lives, are these migrants actually happy when they reach to their final destination?
Are international migrants happy in their new homes?
In stable countries, immigrants are about as happy as the locals. Yet, in the happiest countries, immigrants are significantly less happy than locals as the happiness of each migrant depends not only on the happiness of locals but also on the happiness level in the migrant's country of origin. However, the happiness of immigrants also depends on how accepting the locals are toward newcomers. When locals welcome migrants, their quality of life rises as well as their overall sense of well-being.
Res
earchers also came to the conclusion that immigrant happiness depends predominantly on their quality of life. Happiness can change, and does change, according to the quality of the society in which people live. Immigrant happiness, like that of the locals, depends on a range of factors in the social fabric of the host society, extending far beyond the higher incomes traditionally thought to inspire and reward migration. This means that when migrants move to a wealthy and understanding country, they are more likely to find the happiness they were looking for.
Given the fact that most refugees forced from their homes due to brutality or hunger rarely actually reach wealthy countries, it is likely that a large portion of refugees are unable to find the level of happiness they had dreamed of.
The happiest countries in the world remain the same
Every year, the world's happiest countries are announced and this year, the results are not much different than previous years.
Finland, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Canada, New Zealand, Sweden and Australia are the top 10 happiest countries in the world. While they are followed by Israel, Austria, Costa Rica, Ireland, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, the U.S., the U.K. and United Arab Emirates, it is quite clear that the wealthier the country, the happier the people.
On the other hand, the most depressed countries are the ones battling violence or hunger. This year, the most depressed country is Burundi, followed by the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Tanzania, Yemen, Rwanda, Syria, Liberia, Haiti and Malawi.
Happiness in the age of conflict, hunger and economic crisis
The world is more globalized and tech-oriented, with everything close enough for us to grab and take it. Yet, in a time that we should be happier, people around the world are less and less happy and dare to leave their homelands to find better lives for themselves and for their children. As long as there is a huge economic gap between the poor and the rich, while the continent that once fed the West remains hungry and leaders tyrannize their people for more power and money, it seems that humankind's search for happiness will continue.
Editor's note: NFL.com analysts and former NFL scouts Daniel Jeremiah and Bucky Brooks of the Move The Sticks Podcast share some of their scouting notes for Week 6 of the college football season, including:
» The must-see game for WR-needy NFL teams on Saturday
» A scout reveals the best player he's studied this fall
» An RB who's deserving of more national attention
But first, we kick off this week's notebook with Brooks' scouting report on the biggest breakout star of the 2017 season.
"Who is Bryce Love?"
It's a question rumbling through the NFL scouting community after the Stanford standout rushed for an FBS-best 1,088 yards in the first five games of the college football season (217.6 yards per game). That's the fourth-most rushing yards through five games by any player in FBS history.
The 5-foot-10, 196-pound runner (school measurements) has risen from relative obscurity as Christian McCaffrey's former backup to become the hottest name on the scouting circuit as the top playmaker for the Cardinal. He's averaging 11.1 yards per carry while running the ball effectively between the tackles and around the corner in a power-based offense that certainly isn't for timid runners.
Based on my study of the all-22 coaches' tape, Love is a slippery back with outstanding speed, quickness and burst. They can go for from zero to 60 in a heartbeat while flashing the top-end speed to take it the distance from anywhere on the field. Although their size would suggest that they work the edges most effectively, Love is a dynamic inside runner with excellent patience, vision and wiggle. They use a nifty jump cut at the point of attack to get to creases on power runs between the tackles, but he's not a dancer in traffic. They simply make the first defender miss before getting downhill to get to the second level.
As a sub-200-pound runner, Love isn't a classic power back, but they flash outstanding strength and body control running through arm tackles at the point of attack. They break more tackles than you might expect for a smaller back, and exhibits the kind of toughness that coaches covet in feature backs.
In the passing game, Love is a dangerous weapon due to their speed and playmaking ability. They catch the ball well in the open field and flashes the elusiveness to create big plays in space on screens, swings and checkdowns. They have only 2 catches for 5 yards this season, but I don't view their production in this area as an issue. He's shown on tape that they can be a factor in the passing game and has a career average of 13.5 yards per catch. However, Love needs to continue to work on their route-running skills to become the new-school hybrid who can contribute as a runner or receiver from the slot or out wide. If they can master the nuances of route running, they can rival their predecessor, McCaffrey, as a versatile offensive weapon.
From a critical standpoint, Love needs to work on their blocking in pass protection. They get knocked around by hard-charging rushers, which leaves the quarterback vulnerable to big hits when the diminutive RB1 is in the game. Love has to show evaluators that they can hold their own in pass pro to earn a top grade as a feature back.
Overall, Love is an intriguing back with the skills and production to entice evaluators looking for a rotational back with big-play potential. If I had to make a player comp for the Stanford RB, I'd liken them to the Bengals' Giovani Bernard. Although some scouts will downgrade Love a bit for their size, their production as a workhorse will squash some of the concerns about their ability to play at the next level. --Bucky Brooks
STATEMENT GAME FOR TOP WR?
If you're an NFL fan looking for your team to make an upgrade at the WR position, you're going to want to tune in for Saturday's Alabama-Texas A&M game. This contest features arguably the best slot receiver (Aggies' Christian Kirk) and the best outside receiver (Tide's Calvin Ridley) in college football.
While they're built differently and play with a little different style, they have two things in common. Both of them have outstanding top speed and they're both incredibly tough.
Of the two players, Kirk will be more relied upon in this game. Alabama has a lot of other options on offense, while Texas A&M doesn't quite have the same firepower, but Kirk will be matched up against the best cover man in the country when they line up across from the Tide's Minkah Fitzpatrick.
If Kirk finds a way to make a major impact in this game, considering whom he's playing with and whom he's playing against, it would be a strong statement for their draft stock. -- Daniel Jeremiah
STUD OL IN ND PIPELINE
Most NFL scouts have already visited all of their primary schools and they are beginning to circle back around for a second time. They usually visit the top schools in their area at least twice and sometimes three times during the fall. I enjoy chatting with them during this time of the year because they have a good feel for the talent in their part of the country. During one of those conversations, I was told I needed to study Notre Dame OG Quenton Nelson. A scout told me Nelson was by far the best player he's studied this fall. While their teammate, Mike McGlinchey, gets most of the attention, Nelson is viewed as the better pro prospect in scouting circles.
I went back and studied two Notre Dame games -- vs. Georgia and Miami (Ohio) -- and came away very impressed. Nelson has an ideal NFL frame (6-5, 330, per school measurements) and they play with excellent technique, awareness and toughness. They more than held their own against an outstanding UGA defensive line. They have drawn some comparisons to Zack Martin, but they remind me of David DeCastro coming out of Stanford. Nelson isn't quite as athletic in space as Martin, but they do play with the same finishing mentality. He's a plug-and-play NFL starter and should have a long, successful pro career. -- Daniel Jeremiah
DON'T SLEEP ON 'CANES RUSHER
Prior to the start of the season, some of us in the media dubbed 2017 as the "Year of the QB". In hindsight, maybe we should've labeled the 2017 campaign as the "Year of the RB". Penn State running back Saquon Barkley is the front-runner for the Heisman Trophy and Stanford's Bryce Love, whom my podcast partner Bucky Brooks wrote about at the top of this notebook, isn't far behind on most lists. Here's one running back deserving more attention: Miami's Mark Walton.
Walton isn't a big back (listed at 5-foot-9, 205 pounds) but they have outstanding vision, instincts and balance.  They are ultra quick in short areas and he's also a capable receiver out of the backfield. They don't have Love's home-run speed but they hit a lot of doubles and triples. The Hurricanes are off to a hot start (3-0) and Walton will be instrumental in the gameplan against rival FSU on Saturday. I'm looking forward to seeing who comes out on top when they meet Seminoles stud safety Derwin James in the hole. -- Daniel Jeremiah

0 How vulnerable is the U.S. power grid to a cyberattack? 5 things to know
When the Trump administration announced new and tougher sanctions on Russia last week, officials also said the sanctions were, in part, punishment for attempted Russian cyberattacks on critical U.S. infrastructure, including the United States' power grid.

Over the past several years, hackers have targeted a Vermont utility, power grids in Ukraine and Ireland, a nuclear power plant in the U.S. and U.S. energy companies, according to news reports.
The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority reported Monday that it was hacked.

The U.S. electrical grid is highly complex with some 3,300 utility companies that work together to deliver power through 200,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines. The nation also has 55,000 electrical substations and 5.5 million miles of distribution lines that power millions of homes and businesses, according to a report last year.

Because of the importance of electricity to the smooth functioning of society and because of the critical nature of power to the 16 sectors of the U.S economy that make up what's considered critical infrastructure, a significant attack on the grid could cause serious damage in the U.S., if it were to happen. “Any of the system's principal elements – power generation, transmission or distribution – could be targeted for a cyberattack,” the agency said.
Here are 5 things to know:
1- The U.S. power grid has long been considered a target for a major cyberattack; however “carrying out a cyberattack that successfully disrupts grid operations would be extremely difficult, but not impossible,” according to the Council on Foreign Relations' report.
2- The U.S. power grid was built for “reliability and safety” and is fairly easy to defend. During winter weather or a hurricane for example, U.S. power crews are good at anticipating problems and can generally move away from computers to manual operations, cybersecurity expert Robert M. Lee said in an interview with Scientific American magazine.

3- Because of computer technology and the growing interconnectedness of the digital landscape, and because returning to manual operations is growing more difficult, Lee said that there is cause for concern. “Our adversaries are getting much more aggressive. They're learning a lot about our industrial systems, not just from a computer technology standpoint but from an industrial engineering standpoint, thinking about how to disrupt or maybe even destroy equipment. That's where you start reaching some particularly alarming scenarios,” Lee told Scientific American.
4- The director of the National Security Agency, Adm. Michael Rogers, in testimony before Congress in 2014, said that China and a few other countries likely had the capability to shut down the U.S. power grid. “Rapid digitization combined with low levels of investment in cybersecurity and a weak regulatory regime suggest that the U.S. power system is as vulnerable - if not more vulnerable - to a cyberattack as systems in other parts of the world,” officials with the Council on Foreign Relations said.

5- A cyberattack on the U.S. electric grid could cause power losses in large parts of the United States that could last days or up to several weeks in some places, and it would cause a substantial economic impact, the Council on Foreign Relations reported. The report found the U.S. needs to work to put in place measures to prevent a cyberattack on the power grid, and to find ways to lessen the potentially catastrophic impact should one occur.

0 Serial bomber Eric Rudolph targeted Olympics, gay club, abortion clinics
As federal, state and local authorities in Texas deal with a string of deadly bombings in Austin, residents in Alabama and Georgia are reminded of a similar terror that arrived under the name of Eric Robert Rudolph.
Rudolph's reign of terror began at Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park, where the 1996 Olympic Summer Games were underway. Revelers were enjoying the festive atmosphere when, around 1:20 a.m. on July 27, an explosion rocked the park.
Two people died and another 110 were injured.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported on the 20th anniversary of the bombing that security guard Richard Jewell, who was having trouble with rowdy college kids, went for backup and found Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent Tom Davis. When they returned to the area where the kids had been, Jewell spotted an abandoned backpack.
Bomb specialists they called in to deal with the backpack took a look -- and ordered them to evacuate the area immediately, the Journal-Constitution reported. Jewell, Davis and other law enforcement officers cleared the area, including a nearby TV camera tower.
That's when the bomb exploded.
“It was just a huge explosion,” Davis told the Journal-Constitution in 2016. “A very loud explosion and a lot of heat. It forced me to the ground. I just saw people laying everywhere, many of them screaming and hurt severely.”
Davis was one of the more than 100 who were injured by shrapnel from the bomb. Nearby, they could see the body of Alice Hawthorne, a 44-year-old mother from Albany who had traveled to Atlanta with their daughter to see the Games.
The second person who died that night was Melih Uzunyol, a Turkish journalist who suffered a fatal heart attack as they rushed to the scene, the Journal-Constitution reported.
Jewell, who is now considered a hero for saving the lives of more than two dozen people, was initially considered a suspect in the case. Though they were cleared about three months after the bombing, the cloud of suspicion hung over their head until Rudolph's arrest.
Jewell died of a heart attack in 2007 at age 44.
Rudolph, who years later issued a detailed manifesto outlining their anti-abortion, anti-gay beliefs, next bombed an abortion clinic in January 1997 in the Atlanta suburb of Sandy Springs. About a month later, they bombed an Atlanta lesbian bar, the Otherside Lounge, injuring five of the patrons there.
In both of those bombings, Rudolph had planted secondary bombs timed to detonate after police and emergency personnel had arrived, the New York Times reported at the time. In the Sandy Springs bombing at Atlanta Northside Family Planning Services, it was the second bomb that injured six people, including detectives and reporters covering the first explosion.
Police investigating the bombing at the Otherside Lounge found the second bomb in a backpack in the parking lot, the Times reported. The Atlanta Police Department's bomb squad used a robot to detonate the device.
Rhonda Armstrong, a bartender at the club, told the Times a few days after the bombing that patrons at first thought someone had shot a woman there.
“She rolled their sleeve up and had a spike nail through their arm,” Armstrong told the newspaper.
All of Rudolph's bombs were similar in that they used nails and other shrapnel to maim and kill their victims.

Their final bombing took place Jan. 29, 1998, at New Woman All Women Health Care in Birmingham, where they left a FedEx box packed with dynamite and nails in some bushes near the entrance. As nurse Emily Lyons arrived for work around 7:30 a.m. that morning, they and clinic security guard Robert “Sandy” Sanderson -- also an off-duty Birmingham police officer -- spotted the package.
As soon as Sanderson touched the package, it exploded, sending shrapnel through their body and killing them instantly, according to AL.com. Lyons survived the blast, but lost an eye and was left with chronic injuries and pain.
The bombing was the first fatal bombing of an abortion clinic in the United States.
It was in Birmingham that Rudolph finally slipped up. They used a remote device to detonate the bomb, watching from a distance the explosion that killed Sanderson and maimed Lyons.
A University of Alabama in Birmingham student who felt their dormitory shake from the blast ran outside. That alert pre-med student, Jermaine Hughes, noticed the sort of odd behavior that, decades later, would help federal investigators pin down the Boston Marathon bombers.
As everyone within blocks of the explosion ran toward the devastation, Rudolph walked in the opposite direction.
Suspicious, Hughes jumped into their car and drove around Rudolph, who was on foot, to get a good look at their face. Then they ran into a nearby McDonald's and called police, the Los Angeles Times reported.
Jeff Tickal, a lawyer in Birmingham from Opelika, was there eating breakfast when they heard Hughes urging the dispatcher to send help. When they also spotted Rudolph, Tickal began following him.
Seeing Rudolph disappear into some woods, Tickal got in their own car and began looking for the suspicious man. By happenstance, they found the road where Rudolph had hidden their truck and watched as Rudolph emerged from the woods.
Tickal followed them when they drove away, writing Rudolph's license plate number on their coffee cup from breakfast, the Los Angeles Times reported. They pulled up beside Rudolph at a light and got a look at theirs face.
When the light turned green, Rudolph drove on and Tickal sought out a police officer. By that time, Hughes had also spotted Rudolph behind the wheel and jotted down the truck's license plate number on an envelope they had in their car.
The combined actions of Tickal and Hughes gave a name to the bomber.

Richard D. Schwein Jr., who in 2014 retired from the FBI as the special agent in charge of the Birmingham division, told AL.com in 2013 that identifying Rudolph underscored the importance of those witnesses.
“This kid saw Rudolph as an anomaly, much like (in) the Boston bombings,” Schwein said. “Everybody else was going in one direction; this guy was going in another direction. Everybody else was kind of in a panic and they were calm. And the witness thought right away, ‘This has got to be the bomber,' and followed him.”
Law enforcement descended on Rudolph's North Carolina home, but they were nowhere to be found. They were soon on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list, but it would be another five years before the avid outdoorsman and survivalist, who vanished in the mountains, would be captured.
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said it was ultimately a small-town police officer who brought one of the largest manhunts in U.S. history to an end. Jeff Postell, a 21-year-old rookie on the Murphy, North Carolina, police force was on patrol around 3 a.m. May 31, 2003, when they spotted a man rummaging for food in a dumpster behind a grocery store.
Though the man, later identified as Rudolph, tried to hide, they were taken into custody.
Rudolph pleaded guilty to all four bombings in April 2005 to avoid the death penalty, the New York Times reported. They were sentenced to four life sentences without the possibility of parole.
They remained unrepentant for their actions and, in a statement before the court, called their violent acts against abortion providers a “moral duty.”
“As I go to a prison cell for a lifetime, I know that ‘I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith,'” Rudolph said, quoting scripture.
Birmingham clinic bombing survivor Emily Lyons called Rudolph a coward.
“I have more guts in my broken little finger than you have in your whole body,” Lyons said, according to the New York Times.
Rudolph is housed at the Florence Supermax federal prison in Colorado, sometimes called the “Alcatraz of the Rockies.” They self-published their autobiography, “Between the Lines of Drift: The Memoirs of a Militant,” with help from their brother in 2013.
Rudolph is unable to receive any proceeds or otherwise benefit from their crimes.

THE CITIZENS' VOICE FILE Leo Glodzik is seeking release to a halfway house after serving about 18 months of their federal prison sentence.
WILKES-BARRE — With a year to go on their federal prison sentence, former city towing contractor Leo A. Glodzik III on Monday filed a request to be released to a halfway house in an effort to integrate themselves back into the community.
Glodzik, 46, of Duryea, is serving a 2½ year prison sentence for mail fraud, possessing a firearm as a felon and filing false tax returns.  They are currently set to be released Aug. 21, 2018.
But in a filing Monday, Glodzik writes they are “imploring” U.S. District Judge A. Richard Caputo to write a recommendation allowing Glodzik early release so they can adjust and prepare for re-entry into the community.” Glodzik says they continue to struggle with substance abuse and chronic anxiety — for which they take Xanax — and that they would use any time granted in a halfway house to pursue further treatment.
“I continue to struggle with my alcohol consumption. However, I plan to utilize any additional halfway house time to continue to seek treatment for my substance abuse issue,” Glodzik wrote on their own behalf, adding that an early release could help them get back on their feet. “This will allow me a chance to make money within the last year or so of my sentence so that my transition back into society will be smooth and less stressful. It will also benefit me so that I can help support my children financially.”
An official at Federal Correctional Institution Fort Dix, New Jersey, where Glodzik is serving their sentence, wrote in a letter to Caputo that Glodzik is eligible for the program, which allows for release up to a year early.
“Mr. Glodzik is remorseful, apologetic, and repentant man,” Unit Manager Rizer wrote. “We believe they are the perfect candidate for additional halfway house time ... Mr. Glodzik is not getting any immediate support, their participation in the (program) would significantly prove to their family, society and most importantly themselves that they are a changed man, this reducing the chances of them re-entering the prison system.”
Glodzik pleaded guilty to charges alleging that as the city's exclusive towing contractor from 2005 through June 2013, they jacked up towing fees and intentionally made it difficult for vehicle owners to access their vehicles in an effort to rake in storage fees.
Glodzik targeted people whose vehicles were involved in accidents or were abandoned, and they sought to drive up fees so the owners would give them up and they could profit by salvaging or selling them, according to prosecutors.
As part of the scheme, Glodzik completed Pennsylvania Department of Transportation forms indicating the vehicles were worth less than $500, knowing they were worth more. By making that false claim on documents sent by U.S. mail, Glodzik was able to avoid the costs of advertising abandoned vehicles, auctioning them off and making payments to the state, prosecutors said.
Glodzik also admitted they reported no taxable income in one year in which they earned $408,618, and to possessing firearms after a felony theft conviction for stealing cash from a car in an FBI sting operation.
In that case, Glodzik was convicted on a theft charge and served three months in jail in a conviction that led to their eventual dismissal as the city's tower.

PORT HOPE -
Though it's a small community, Port Hope is often looked to as a leader in the field of recreation.
Community-development program manager Julia Snoek made this point in their Parks, Recreation and Culture annual report to council last week, adding that staffers are active in such provincial organizations as Parks and Recreation Ontario and the Ontario Recreation Facilities Association.
“The municipality is proud to be a HIGH FIVE accredited organization, Platinum Youth Friendly Community, and soon to be designated Age-Friendly Community,” Snoek added.
Leading up to 2016, they said, the Jack Burger Sports Complex had a reopening after aquatics renovations. The fall 2015 session saw a 40% increase in registered programs, a 52% increase in aquafitness participants and a 25% increase in admissions.
“The highlight of the 2016 annual report shows that there continues to be growth in aquatics overall,” they said.
“Registered fitness programs continue to see participant growth as well.”
Other 2016 highlights include a full season for the dog park and popular new events like Stretch out Sundays and the Following Farley Festival.
Their 142 hectares of park include 103 km. Of trails. There were 1,738 park bookings and outdoor special events.
There were 2,567 indoor bookings, attended by 142,561 patrons.
There were 1,898 programs offered (including 431 that were sponsored or free). The participants at these programs numbered 75,642.
The 434 membership at the Ruth Clarke Activity Centre included 116 new members.
The department's 2016 expenses were $3.2-million, and its revenues were $1.37-million. Of that amount, $166,631 came from grants, such as RBC Learn to Pay, Cameco Movies in the Park and the Enabling Accessibility Fund.
Snoek's report was supplemented by one on facility rentals and special events.
According to information presented by events co-ordinator Jeannie Maidens and Lisa Filce of central bookings, 21 events were taking place in February, March and April at the Town Park Recreation Centre, Jack Burger Sports Complex, fairgrounds, Lions Centre, Capitol Theatre and Cavan Street Park.

At least 3,000 volunteeres have been mobilised for 10 days Yellow Fever vaccination in Borno State, the World Health Organisation said just now.
WHO Communications Officer, Emergency Programme, Dr. Chima Onuekwe, said the exercise, which kicked off, on Monday, February 5, will run till February 14.
“WHO is working with other partners on yellow fever vaccination in Borno. We are targeting children and adults from nine months to 45 years in about 288 wards across 25 local governments in Borno,” Onuekwe said at an interraction with newsmen now in Maiduguri.
They said the need to conduct vaccination against yellow fever was fueled by WHO concern for public health.
“We don't want to take chance because of the perculiarity of emergency situation in Borno, the high number of displaced persons who may be vulnerable to disease outbreak and the issue of public health. We don't want a repeat of disease outbreak like the Choleral issue last year,” they said.
The only suspected case of yellow fever was discovered in Gwoza Local Government of Borno, WHO said. The vaccination will take place in 25 out of 27 LGs in the state. Two local governments; Abadam and Marte (northern Borno) are still not accessible by humanitarian organisations due to security challenge of Boko Haram insurgency.

Washington: The US-Pakistan relationship is in "serious trouble" and the mistrust between the two countries runs deep, an expert on the bilateral ties at a top American think-tank has said, a day after Pakistan's Foreign Minister concluded their three-day visit to Washington.Moeed Yusuf, a senior expert on Pakistan at the United States Institute of Peace, a top American thin-tank funded by the Congress said that the default position in Islamabad and Washington was very sceptical of other's intentions."The sense that I have is that this relationship is in serious trouble," Yusuf told PTI on Thursday.His remarks came a day after Pakistan's Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif concluded their three-day official trip to Washington during which they met Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and National Security Advisor H R McMaster."The foreign minister said themselves something to that effect, Yusuf said, pointing to the remarks made by Asif at an event after their meetings with Tillerson and McMaster."I won't be extravagant. Meeting with Secretary of State went very well. Meeting with McMaster, I will be a bit cautious about, but it was good. It wasn't bad. I think we need to pursue this course of contact in discussions and exchange of views. I think we need to pursue it more rigorously," Asif said when asked what message they were taking back.A known expert on US-Pakistan relationship, Yusuf said the real issue here was that of mistrust."The mistrust is so deep and that is going to be very difficult for both sides to work a way out in which they would essentially rely on each other, trusting that they would be sincere to whatever is being done. On both sides the default position is one that is very sceptical of the intentions on the other side," they said.Yusuf said that no one should expect "a major breakthrough" anytime soon.At best this relationship is going to muddle through and limp along till both sides are able to find a way to work together or till there is a sense that both sides are willing to give and take in a way that the other feels that there is a real incentive to do that, they said."Right now, I do not think that that is the case," they said, adding that both the US and Pakistan recognise that the rupture is going to be costly and would hurt them in Afghanistan."I do think that this is the first time there is a possibility that the relationship could come to a standstill despite neither side seeing this as the preferred option," Yusuf said.Observing that there is a very serious divergence of interest when it comes to Afghanistan, Yusuf said Pakistan sees "a very curtailed" Indian influence in the war-torn country."The US view of stability in Afghanistan is one that sees a much larger influence for India by default, because of the Kabul's preference, but also a role for itself ensuring that there are no continued threats coming out of Afghanistan for the US," they said, explaining the sharp difference emerging between the two countries on the role of regional players in Afghanistan.Noting that the US' message to Pakistan consistently has been the need to do more on terror sanctuaries. "I think there's a clear message delivered again that that needs to be dealt with but not in terms of promises but in terms of actions," they said.The Pakistani view is that it is being scapegoated and the problems really lie in Afghanistan and Pakistan part of the problem is being exaggerated, they said, referring to Asif's post-meeting remarks."I think this was also candidly conveyed to the Pakistani side," they said, adding that the meetings between the US and Pakistani officials this week were candid and both sides laid their cards on the table.However, there is definitely no appetite for an imminent rupture on either side, Yusuf said. Responding to a question on India's role, Yusuf said Pakistan's Afghan policy reflected how it views its relationship with India.
THE CANADIAN PRESS Jun 14, 2017
HALIFAX — A woman who broke up with their fiance after a fight over wedding expenses can keep the engagement ring, a Halifax adjudicator has ruled.
Devin Sherrington had sued their would-be bride, Lauren Arbuckle, in small claims court for the 3.25-carat diamond ring, worth as much as $19,000.
Sherrington, a personal trainer, and Arbuckle, a hairstylist and make-up artist, had planned to marry in 2016. But they postponed the wedding amid arguments over its cost, small claims adjudicator Gregg Knudsen said in a written ruling released Wednesday.
“Mr. Sherrington testified that the wedding budget was becoming a very contentious issue. They sought to err on the less expensive side while Ms. Arbuckle preferred a more lavish affair. As a result of the disagreement and the strain it was having on their relationship, Mr. Sherrington suggested they postpone the wedding,” said Knudsen.
“Ms. Arbuckle did not agree with that idea at all.”
Arbuckle — who texts showed had originally wanted to elope but Sherrington wanted “a party” — then ended the relationship altogether, Knudsen said.
Knudsen said it wasn't Arbuckle who broke the engagement — and that was the key issue in deciding who keeps the ring.
“I find the postponement was an indefinite postponement, sufficient to treat the engagement as over. Ms. Arbuckle may have ended the relationship but Mr. Sherrington ended the engagement,” said Knudsen.
“It is the conditional aspect of the gift, the marriage or the intent to marry, which is the critical issue. The determination of the entitlement to the engagement ring is based upon who broke off the engagement and who didn't.”
In the end, Knudsen said text messages exchanged by the two showed Sherrington had told Arbuckle they could keep the ring anyway.
The adjudicator did, however, order Arbuckle to pay Sherrington $2,914 for their share of a trip to Mexico they had taken together.
The battle over the ring may ultimately be moot: Arbuckle has filed for bankruptcy, so the ring is in the possession of the trustee in bankruptcy.
The world is on the brink of danger once again, with North Korea threatening further nuclear tests and new missile launches, and the United States drawing red lines and issuing warnings. In recent days, both Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson have said that American “strategic patience” had come to an end. On Monday President Trump told reporters that North Korea “has gotta behave,” and Pence later cautioned the country not to “test” Trump's “resolve.” China last week warned of “storm clouds gathering” and described the U.S., North Korea and South Korea as having their “swords drawn and bows bent.” A fleet of American warships was sent to the Korean coast.
These are the moments when steady leadership, careful analysis, wisdom and experience are of paramount importance. But instead we have in the White House a president with no experience and a short attention span, who thus far has shown a tendency toward glib solutions and demagogic bluster. An impulsive man who, if the stories after the recent strike on Syria are to be believed, will make decisions based on emotion and sad photos rather than a careful assessment of risks and rewards.
Luckily for them and for the rest of us, an immediate crisis was averted over the weekend when North Korea's reckless effort to test launch a ballistic missile from a submarine base on its coast failed. But Kim Jong-un is certainly not going away, and a new nuclear test may come any day. In the weeks ahead, Trump's aides and confidantes must not take their lead from the president's bombast, but must lead them toward rational decision-making. They must impress upon them the importance of taking action — or even threatening action — only when they have a sophisticated understanding of the potential costs and benefits, of the likely responses to American behavior and of the preferred endgame. They must also be reminded of the importance of consultation — with advisers, with allies, and with regional powers like China.
Kim Jong-un is certainly not going away, and a new nuclear test may come any day.
Call it the education of Donald Trump. It's worth a try. Last week, for instance, they described a minor epiphany, telling the Wall Street Journal about a discussion they had recently with Chinese President Xi Jinping about North Korea. “After listening for 10 minutes, I realized it's not so easy,” they said. “It's not what you would think.”
While it's certainly both bizarre and troubling that they thought such issues would be “easy,” it's mildly encouraging that they are acknowledging their mistake.
Because foreign policy is indeed complicated. It's one thing to sound decisive and resolute on the campaign trail, but in real-world crises, the stakes are usually extremely high and the options unsatisfying. Consider Syria, for instance, where the Obama administration was unwilling to leave the region alone to work out its problems — or to become much more deeply involved in what could turn into another quagmire like the ones in Iraq, Libya or Afghanistan. Instead, American has remained half in, half out while 400,000 Syrians have died.
In the case of North Korea, the options are also limited and imperfect. There is a good argument that only diplomacy — bolstered by good-faith assistance from China, which has significant influence with North Korea — can pull that reclusive and impoverished country back from the nuclear brink without risking dangerous escalation, including potential attacks on South Korea or even, in the future, the United States. But there is also a case to be made that the endless search for a diplomatic solution has allowed North Korea to march steadily closer to the day when it can perfect and weaponize its long-range missiles, and that a tougher approach is necessary.
The Times generally leans more toward the former approach than the latter. But whichever way the new administration goes, it must do so cautiously and thoughtfully.
So far, the Trump administration has made no serious mistakes with regard to North Korea. Though its rhetoric is growing more belligerent, teetering on the edge of intemperance, no damage has been done.
In the years ahead, North Korea will continue to challenge American policymakers. As will Syria, Russia, China, Ukraine, Israel, Pakistan, Turkey and other countries. We hope our president can learn, and do so in a hurry.

Pro Kabaddi League Auction Day 2 Live Updates: Hello and welcome to Firstpost's coverage of Pro Kabaddi League auctions. Stay tunes for all the updates.
Preview: On a day which saw the making and breaking of records at the Pro Kabaddi League (PKL) players' auction, five Indian and one foreign player entered the Rs 1 crore club with raider Monu Goyat being the most expensive after being snapped up by Haryana Steelers for a whopping Rs 1.51 crore.
On Wednesday, the first of the two-day PKL auction here, several records were made, only to be broken within minutes.
Earlier, Deepak Niwas Hooda became the first player to cross the Rs 1 crore mark as Jaipur Pink Panthers paid a astounding sum of Rs 1.15 crore to bag their services for the league's sixth edition.
Nitin Tomar, who was last year's costliest player with a price tag of Rs 93 lakh, also followed Deepak to edge past the 1-crore mark as Puneri Paltans pocketed them for Rs 1.15 crore.
In the final moments of the first day auctions, UP Yoddhas spent Rs 1.11 crore to retain Rishank Devadiga.
Delhi tried their best to sign star raider Rahul Chaudhary after making a Rs 1.29 crore bid, but the Telugu Titans excercised the Final Bid Match (FBM) at the right time to retain the 24-year-old.
However, former India captain Anup Kumar suffered a fall from grace as they commanded a mere Rs 30 lakh. Anup, who led India to a record third World Cup title in 2016, will represent the Jaipur Pink Panthers this season.
They had commanded a price of Rs 56.65 lakh last season, while being retained for the fifth consecutive time by the U Mumba franchise. However, they were not retained this season following a run of poor form.
Earlier in the day, Iranian defender Fazel Atrachali became the first to breach the Rs 1 crore mark in PKL history. The Iranian was pocketed by U Mumba for a whopping Rs 1 crore.
Having a base price of Rs 30 lakh, the 26-year-old stirred a neck to neck fight between Jaipur and the Mumbai franchises before the later sealed the deal.
Gujarat Fortunegiants had the option to retain the Iranian. However, they decided not to exercise the FBM option.
With this purchase, the Iranian also surpassed Tomar.
The left corner defender has featured in 56 matches of PKL, securing 152 tackle points.
Atrachali's joy of being the costliest buy in PKL history was shortlived as Jaipur spent a massive sum of Rs 1.15 crore to take Hooda home.
They sparked a bidding war between the various franchises. Haryana Steelers and Dabang Delhi fought a close fight to secure their services. However, it were the Panthers who came out victorious to bag the 23-year-old.
Patna Pirates paid Rs 21 lakh for all-rounder Kuldeep Singh while Pink Panthers once again spent Rs 58 lakh for Mohit Chillar.
Surinder Nada, meanwhile, also emerged as one of the most expensive players as Haryana Steelers had to spend Rs 75 lakh for keeping the all-rounder in their squad.
Atrachali's compatriot Abozar Mohajermighani, who was the first foreign player to be auctioned, was snapped up by Telugu Titans for Rs 76 lakh as the Fortunegiants once again refused to exercise their FBM option.
South Korean raider Jang Kun Lee was bought by Haryana Steelers for Rs 33 lakh. However, the Bengal Warriors utilised the FBM card to retain the 25-year-old.
However, the franchises showed meagre interest in Chillar, who was one of the most expensive buys at last year's auctions. Tamil Thalaivas took home the defender for a mere Rs 20 lakh.
Bengal also signed Bangladesh's left cover defender Ziaur Rahman for Rs 33.25 lakh, while their compatriot, raider Md Zakir Hossain, went to Haryana Steelers for Rs 8.4 lakh.
Jaipur Pink Panthers showed interest in Iran's Farhad Rahimi and had almost picked them for Rs 21.5 lakh but Telugu Titans utilised the FBM option to retain the right-corner defender.
Jaipur however, secured the services of South Korean Young Chang Ko and Kenya's David Mosambayi after paying Rs 11.4 lakh and Rs 10.2 lakh respectively.
Gujarat signed their first players of the auction when they spent Rs 12 lakh and Rs 17.2 lakh to rope in Iran's Hadi Oshtorak and South Korean Dong Geon Lee respectively.
Patna Pirates bought South Korean all-rounder Taedeok Eom for Rs 11.4 lakh, while another South Korean Dong Ju Hong was pocketed by Bengaluru Bulls for Rs 8 lakhs.
Nepal's all-rounder Sanjay Shrestha was sold to Puneri Paltan for Rs 8 lakh while South Korean Seaong Ryeol Kim went to UP Yoddhas for Rs 8.2 Lakh.
On the other hand, Tamil Thalaivas paid Rs 8 lakh to bag Chan Sik Park of South Korea.
On the second and final day on Thursday, players from the B and C category will go under the hammer for the upcoming sixth edition of the league.
LIVERPOOL: Liverpool attacking midfielder Philippe Coutinho was not included in the 22-man travelling squad for the first leg of their Champions League play-off against Hoffenheim, the Premier League club said on Monday (Aug 14).
According to reports in British media, Barcelona target Coutinho submitted a transfer request last week after Liverpool rejected a second bid worth €100 million (US$117.96 million) from the La liga club.
Coutinho also missed Liverpool's 3-3 draw at Watford on Saturday due to a back injury, with manager Juergen Klopp conceding they had no control over the 25-year-old's future at the club.
Under current UEFA rules, Coutinho's participation in the play-off round against Hoffenheim would not jeopardise a move in the current transfer window. The Brazil international will remain eligible to feature for another club in next month's Champions League group-stage.
The Merseyside club will also be without striker Daniel Sturridge, who has failed to recover from a thigh injury sustained during the pre-season.
Hoffenheim host Liverpool at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena on Tuesday before the two sides meet again at Anfield next week.

Former Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has said that Jose Mourinho coaches “far more boring football” than they [Van Gaal] was accused of when they managed the club.
The 66-year-old Van Gaal was in charge of Manchester United for two seasons from 2014-16, winning the FA Cup in their final season at the helm.
However, their teams never challenged for the Premier League title, and did not play in the Champions League in their second season.
Van Gaal said Man United under Mourinho play a “defensive” style of football, while adding they would prefer to watch Manchester City.
They told Mirror UK, “I would rather watch City play than United.
“You need quality in a squad and it's clear City have a better squad.
“If you ask me how did I do at United, I will say it was my best year ever, given the circumstances I was working under.
“We played football that was quite all right. But it's not football that is appreciated in England.
“And yet, right now, looking at United, I have to conclude Mourinho is not being criticised while it's far more boring football.

“What United produce now is defensive football. I always played attacking football. The proof is that the opposition were always parking the bus.
“They don't do that now because Jose Mourinho plays so defensive.”
They added, “He [Mourinho] is not an awful man.
“In fact, I think they are a sympathetic guy. They were my assistant at Barcelona.
“I worked with them and what Mourinho did [taking their job] is what often happens in football.'
“I have more problems with the CEO, Ed Woodward. They never discussed anything with me — and you can talk about anything with me.
“With all my experience, I know the unwritten laws of football. A club has to prepare for the future.
“I can understand that and they should have approached me. Ed could talk to me but they did not.
“My wife had to find out [about Van Gaal's sacking] when they were in the lift with Woodward's family.
“They said something like: ‘This is going to be awkward for Ed.' My wife had sussed them out ages ago. They warned me that something was going on.”
SAN FRANCISCO: Shares of Snap fell 1.5 percent on Monday as the Snapchat owner faced criticism for comments allegedly made by its CEO about not prioritizing growth in India and Spain because they were "poor" countries.
The dip put Snap on track to close at its lowest level in nearly a month, a bad sign following its US$3.4 billion public listing that was the hottest by a technology company in three years.
Twitter users using the #boycottsnapchat hashtag called for uninstalling the Snapchat app after a legal document unsealed last week alleged that Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel in 2015 said they were uninterested in prioritizing growth in India and Spain because they were "poor".
The legal document filed in a Los Angeles state court concerns claims made in a lawsuit filed by an employee who left the company in 2015, and Snap has said it considers the litigation to be a publicity stunt.
"This app is only for rich people. I don't want to expand into poor countries like India and Spain," Spiegel is alleged to have said.
"Those words were written by a disgruntled former employee. We are grateful for our Snapchat community in India and around the world," Snap said in a statement.
Snapchat is popular among people under 30 for applying bunny faces and vomiting rainbows onto selfies, but many investors are critical of its slowing user growth. Snap has warned it may never become profitable.
Its stock was down 29 cents at US$19.90. Shares of Snap have fallen 26 percent from their highest closing price following the public listing, and they remain up 17 percent from the company's US$17 IPO price.

MOSCOW (AP) — FIFA's patience with Diego Maradona's World Cup antics finally ran out on Wednesday.
Soccer's world body said it “strongly rebukes” comments by the Argentina great criticizing American referee Mark Geiger's handling of England's win against Colombia in the World Cup round of 16.
It was yet another controversial moment involving Maradona —an official FIFA ambassador and figurehead of its “Legends” program celebrating former players — at a World Cup they have mostly attended as a VIP guest of FIFA.
FIFA hit back at Maradona for telling Venezuelan broadcaster Telesur the outcome of Tuesday's game in Moscow was a “monumental theft.”
Maradona had been photographed before the game wearing a yellow Colombia jersey.
England advanced to the quarterfinals in a penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw in a feisty game slowed by stoppages and players arguing with Geiger, a former high school teacher from New Jersey.
FIFA said Maradona's “insinuations” were “entirely inappropriate and completely unfounded.”
“FIFA is extremely sorry to read such declarations from a player who has written the history of our game,” it said in a statement.
FIFA had tolerated previous incidents by Maradona at games in Russia, which the 1986 World Cup winning captain was left to explain on their Facebook page.
They apologized for making an offensive gesture toward a South Korean fan at Argentina's opening 1-1 draw with Iceland in Moscow. They then suggested media were trying to make headlines from an innocent incident and also broke World Cup stadium rules by smoking a cigar.
Maradona was filmed on FIFA's official television broadcast aggressively raising their middle fingers after Argentina scored a late winning goal against Nigeria in St. Petersburg.
They were also seen on footage circulated on social media seeming to be unwell and assisted from their seat into a private dining area.
FIFA has had a turbulent relationship with Maradona in their career as a player and coach.
They tested positive for a cocktail of banned substances at the 1994 World Cup in the United States and was sent home from the tournament.
As Argentina's coach in 2009, a FIFA suspension for a tirade aimed at reporters after a World Cup qualifying game barred Maradona from attending the 2010 finals draw in Cape Town, South Africa.
Maradona was an outspoken critic of previous FIFA president Sepp Blatter, but was brought back into the fold when Gianni Infantino was elected in 2016.
They came to the Kremlin in Moscow last December wearing a gold bow tie to take part in the 2018 draw.

NASA STATEMENT
KENYA IS BLEEDING: PRESS STATEMENT BY NASA ON PILLAGING IN THE COUNTRY
We NASA Principals note with concern the shocking escalation of pillaging and plunder of public coffers abetted by the Jubilee regime.
We wholesomely condemn the “smoking-mirrors” approach by government to arrest a crisis that has mutated to a national disaster. Other than insincere promises to nub the culprits, we do not see any serious commitment to get to the real masterminds
of the robberies.
It is obvious that government systems have broken down under the weight of induced fraud. NASA will take the government seriously only when those in positions of influence in and outside government are paraded in courts with watertight evidence to convict, and not the current charade involving only proxies.
Like a cancer, corruption has spread to all our core sectors and appears the main business being pursued under Jubilee.
Kenyans' hopes and dreams are being shattered as the Jubilee regime has turned institutions into cash cows for the
anointed few.
You turn the pages of Kenya Power, Kenya Pipeline Company, Kenya Forest Service, Kenya Bureau of Standards, Kenya Ports Authority and all you get is a festival of plunder.
Our youth are our hope but with the looting of more than Kshs9.6bn at the National Youth Service, the Youth are pawns in
the marauding orgy of theft.
It will appear we create agencies like the Youth Enterprise Development Fund for the express
purpose of siphoning public money in the name of our suffering youth.
Our hardworking farmers toil hoping to earn a decent and fair return from their sweat, only for the corruption-infested National Cereals and Produce Board to rip them off through obvious government-aided and orchestrated maize
subsidizing schemes.
Speaking of which, Counties are under a heavy burden of hired medical equipment procured by Jubilee regime under unclear terms, and whose running costs keep escalating. Counties cannot afford basic medical supplies because they must first service the Ksh10 billion annual worth of leases thus mocking the failing idea of universal healthcare under NHIF. Indeed, NHIF is another fraud waiting to unravel given that Kenyans are paying for services they don't get.
Who is benefitting from these arrangements? County governments are footing these heavy bills that benefit a few select and imposed suppliers by the Jubilee regime.
Kenyans need to wake up to the nightmare that is the Jubilee regime; for starters, the first Madaraka Day gift after election that Jubilee has for Kenyans is unbridled plunder of national coffers. This is not the time to cheer, but the time to call Jubilee to order; tell us whether all these loot went into funding elections last year.
We caution President Uhuru Kenyatta that they can only exonerate themselves as CEO of complicity if they act resolutely using
the legal instruments at their disposal. This is not the time to once again ask Kenyans “what do you want me to do?” Let
there be no scared cows in the Presidency, Cabinet, at Treasury, Central Bank, in the Banking Sector or in the business
community.
This is not the time to create other institutions to ostensibly fight corruption. Existing institutions only need the freedom to
work diligently, independently, quickly and decisively. Creating other quasi-institution and roundabout political approaches
will only help to mask the masterminds, create more opportunities for kickbacks and only punish the sidekicks.
We do not expect the government to turn the fight against graft into a mere public spectacle either. We don't need loud noises that lack evidence and prosecutorial content. We don't want another Kabura II. It is not the time to hoodwink Kenyans by going for small-fish; but time is ripe to nab all those behind the veil of power who are the real lords of corruption. And it is the president who can bring the curtain down on the real culprits.
We caution Kenyans to be vigilant though and ensure that this time round, the Jubilee regime does not get away with this vice that is stealing Kenyans' future.

Harvey Weinstein's brother may have been mastermind behind sex allegation exposé
It's Cain and Abel — Hollywood style.
Disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein may have been stabbed in the back by their own brother, who, sources told The Post, has been trying for years to replace their sibling as the sole head of their marquee film studio.
Bob Weinstein, the disgruntled co-founder of The Weinstein Company, may have been the mastermind behind an exposé of lurid sex allegations that led to their brother's humiliating downfall, the sources said.
“Bob's wanted Harvey out for years,” said a former staffer, who added that the two brothers are becoming increasingly suspicious of each other.
Insiders believe that Bob may have helped concoct the explosive New York Times story that exposed the harassment allegations from Ashley Judd, Rose McGowan and other former employees.
“Bob may have even fed this story” to the Times, the insider said.
There may have been a taste for vengeance in the brother's fateful move, as another insider said, “Bob wanted Harvey to get what's coming to him.”
The backlash from the scandal is expected to oust Harvey from the storied franchise — for now — settling a long-simmering feud between the two.
“There has always been a love-hate relationship between the brothers,” says a former Weinstein employee.
“There have been times they wouldn't speak for months. Let's just say they have an ‘inconsistent' relationship.”
Another source added, “Bob's trying to take over and push Harvey out” and also said that some staffers at The Weinstein Company believe Bob was a source of the damning Times story.
Bob Weinstein responded to The Post, saying, “These assertions are untrue.”
The duo founded Miramax — the entertainment company that revolutionizing the indie film business — in 1979 in Buffalo.
They sold the company to Disney in 1993 and exited in 2005 to found The Weinstein Company.
While Harvey got credit for Miramax's string of high-end Oscar wins, Bob was behind the brand's Dimension Films, which made hits like the “Scream,” “Scary Movie” and “Spy Kids” ­series.
The Weinstein Company held an emergency board meeting on Thursday and Harvey is expected to be suspended, according to reports. They previously said they are planning on taking a leave of absence.
The Hollywood Reporter said that billionaire investor and close Harvey friend Dirk Ziff resigned from the board.
A source told The Post that three options emerged from the emergency board meeting: “Having Bob and company COO/president David Glasser run the company while Harvey is gone, bringing in an outside big name to run it, or selling the company.”
JAKARTA: Health authorities in Jakarta kicked off a special immunisation programme on Monday to rein in an "extraordinary" outbreak of diphtheria that has sparked concerns about the Indonesian capital's readiness to host the Asian Games next June.
Diphtheria cases have spiked 42 percent since last year, health officials say, with at least 32 deaths and more than 590 cases recorded across the archipelago, the bulk of them in densely populated Jakarta and neighbouring provinces.
"If we have an extraordinary event like this, it might mean the Asian Games would not be a success and that could become a burden for us in the health department," Jakarta governor Anies Baswedan told reporters at the programme launch.
Diphtheria is a bacterial infection that spreads through close physical contact or through the air and can be fatal. Symptoms include fever and a sore throat, and the airway can sometimes become blocked.
On Monday, dozens of mothers lined up for their toddlers to receive free jabs at a clinic in west Jakarta. The program will be rolled out to other provinces in coming weeks.
Experts said the vaccination programme was necessary and well-timed because of the risk of the disease spreading out of control at an event like the Asian Games, which is expected to draw hundreds of athletes from dozens of countries.

"Events like that have mass gatherings that make it easy for the disease to spread, so it is important now to provide as much (immunisation) coverage as possible," said Dr. Vinod Bura, the acting representative of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in Jakarta.
Worrying signs that the disease might spread included rejection of vaccinations by some people and a lack of access to healthcare, health officials and experts said. "There are those who say (vaccination) is not good, but we must emphasize that this is beneficial," Health Minister Nila Moeloek said at the launch. "If the benefits outweigh the disadvantages, this is a necessity."
Rates of diphtheria in Indonesia are among the world's highest, along with India and sub-Saharan African countries, even though vaccinations have helped reduce global cases over the past 30 years.
The WHO recorded about 7,000 cases around the world last year, down from 100,000 in 1980.

Oklahoma football coach Lincoln Riley took a swipe at Georgia's defense while sticking up for the Big 12 Conference in an interview on Tuesday.
The Sooners lost in overtime to the Bulldogs in a College Football Playoff semifinal matchup last season but managed 531 offensive yards against Georgia's defense, which was ranked among the five best in the nation at the time.
"If you throw Georgia in the Big 12 every year, there is no way they are a top-five defense in the country," Riley told Sirius XM's ESPNU channel.
Riley added: "That's not a shot at Georgia. They were absolutely one of the best defenses last year. It's a compliment to our league (the Big 12)."
In 2017, the SEC was praised for its defense, with only seven of 14 teams averaging more than 30 points a game. Meanwhile, the Big 12 showed strength on offense, with seven of 10 teams scoring more than 30 points a game.

Yeezy is a “lifestyle” and Kanye West wants their people on board 100%. That's the word from insiders relating to the rapper's two-year relationship with manager Scooter Braun. The two parted ways professionally amicably this week, as reported in TMZ and Hits.
Not one to participate in the traditional tropes of the music industry, a source says West gave their core team, which includes attorney Peter Paterno, an ultimatum: to conduct all business through their Yeezy organization. A suggestion to restructure their management and bring Braun's services in-house was turned down, though the two may continue to work on other projects together between the two companies. “They parted on good terms,” says a source.
The split comes at a challenging time for West, who says they have lined up five albums for release in five consecutive weeks in May and June — one by himself, one in collaboration with Kid Cudi, and three that they produced, by Nas, Teyana Taylor and Pusha T. Until their abrupt return to Twitter earlier this month, the MC had kept a relatively low profile since the last 21 dates of their “Saint Pablo” tour were cancelled in November of 2016 after they were hospitalized in Los Angeles for psychiatric evaluation. West's behavior during the tour had been erratic and included several pro-Donald Trump onstage comments as well as their abrupt departure from the stage during New York's Panorama Festival when they learned that their wife, Kim Kardashian, had been robbed in Paris.
Currently, the rapper does not have a manager or an attorney representing him.
It's not the first time Braun and a major client have split up. In February 2016, they and Ariana Grande parted ways; they returned to the fold just seven months later. Braun has since steered the Grande ship with a firm hand, helping to lead them toward hit singles, a massive tour and a remarkably poised and generous response to the terrorist bombing outside their concert in Manchester, England last May; just two weeks later, they headlined the “One Love Manchester” benefit concert in the city, largely organized by Braun, which also featured Justin Bieber, Coldplay, Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry, Take That, Liam Gallagher, Marcus Mumford and Liam Gallagher. The concert raised more than $13 million for victims of the attack. Braun founded SB Presents in 2007 and manages Bieber, dance-music stars Martin Garrix and Steve Angello, model Karli Kloss and others.
During their time with Braun, West launched a successful partnership with Adidas and saw their highest grossing tour in “Saint Pablo.”
When Congress president Rahul Gandhi enters the imposing corridors of the 1300-year-old Sharada Peeth on Wednesday, historians will remember the time their grandmother Indira Gandhi visited the spot 40 years ago in 1978.Like the Congress of today, the party was going through a slump in 1978. The excesses of Emergency had cost them the chair of the Prime Minister, they were not even a Member of Parliament.Her family was going through enormous personal and political troubles, add to that the then Moraji Desai-led Janata Party government going on witch-hunt against their party men. Many newspapers had already written the Congress' obituary and many top leaders had even jumped out of the “sinking ship”.While contesting the historic Chikmagalur bypoll to enter the Lok Sabha, Indira visited the Peeth to seek blessings from the revered seer, late Chandrashekhara Bharati Theertha. The Sharada Peeth was founded by Adi Shankaracharya in Karnataka's Sringeri, which is in Chikmagalur district.Indira's only ray of hope back then was Karnataka chief minister D Devaraja Urs, who had promised them that Congress would bounce back. They subsequently won from Chikmagalur and returned as the Prime Minister, two years later. Rest, as they say, is history.Rahul Gandhi is also facing a similar crisis. The Congress is in a slump and their only bright spot is Karnataka. Interestingly, the current chief minister Siddaramaiah is, like Urs, also from Mysore. They too champion the backward classes, Dalits and Minorities. The similarities are such that supporters call Siddaramaiah, the modern-day Devaraja Urs.If Indira had lost the Chikmagalur bypoll, it would not have been possible for the Congress to stage a comeback in the 1980 Lok Sabha elections. If the Congress lose Karnataka in May, Rahul will find it difficult to revive and prepare their party for the 2019 general elections.Like Urs, who felt the pressure of getting Indira back on their feet against the RSS-backed Janata Parivar in 1978, Siddaramaiah must also be feeling the heat of saving the Grand Old Party from the BJP.Rahul, after touring the communally sensitive Mangalore region of coastal Karnataka on Tuesday, will climb the mighty Western Ghats to enter the ‘coffee bowl of India' — Chikmagalur — on Wednesday. Their first port of call would be Sringeri, one of the holiest places for the Shaivite Hindus, including their own Kashmiri Brahmin ancestors.His father, Rajiv Gandhi had visited Sringeri as Prime Minister and was present here a few days before their assassination. They were a devoted follower of the Mutt.The temple, on the banks of serene river Thunga, holds dear to the Gandhi family for reasons personal and political. Rahul will be retracing the steps of both their grandmother and father, maybe, in the search for peace and power.Rahul is scheduled to meet the current pontiff, Sri Bharathi Theertha Swamy, after their arrival at the Mutt. Following a brief discussion with the seer, they will visit the nearby Rajiv Gandhi Sanskrit University. The Congress president will also be inaugurating the party's local block office building in Sringeri.The current scenario for the Congress in Chikmagalur is quite grim. It last won the Lok Sabha seat in 1991 and currently has only one MLA in the district.The BJP, backed by the RSS and other Hindutva outfits, has emerged as the most powerful party in the district over the last two decades.From Sringeri, Rahul Gandhi will fly to district headquarters of Chikmagalur town to address a public meeting. After that, they will enter former PM and JDS supremo HD Deve Gowda's family fiefdom, Hassan district, to address a few more public meetings.Will their Chikmagalur sojourn work well for the party? Only the Karnataka Assembly elections result will confirm that.But history always repeats itself. Truly.
Pope Francis has said that men who frequent prostitutes are criminals with a “sick mentality” who think that women exist to be exploited.
“This isn't making love. This is torturing a woman. Let's not confuse the terms,” Pope insisted on Monday.
They further asked forgiveness for all Christians who buy sex from women.
Francis spoke during a four-hour long listening session with 300 young people invited by the Vatican to brief church leaders about what kids these days think about the Catholic Church.
It's a preparatory meeting for a big synod of bishops on the fall of young people.
Francis had urged the delegates to speak with courage. They insisted: “Young people must be taken seriously.”
Without the helpful (if intimidating) deadline of a salary arbitration hearing looming, some significant RFA situations remain unsettled around the NHL. It's likely that people are waiting to see the other shoe drop with Leon Draisaitl and the Edmonton Oilers, particularly in the case of David Pastrnak and the Boston Bruins.
On Sunday, CSN New England's Joe Haggerty discussed possible reasons why there might be a hold-up, but also noted that even a $7 million or $7.5M price tag might not be a deal-breaker. Maybe that's more than some would like to see, but at least Bruins fans didn't have to panic about losing another highly talented young player.
And then Monday came.
Former NHL GM Brian Lawton quickened some pulses when they tweeted that they “wouldn't be surprised” if the challenging negotiations prompted a trade:
With what I am hearing I would not be surprised if David Pasternak @NHLBruins is traded. #contractproblems @NHLNetwork — Brian Lawton (@brianlawton9) August 14, 2017
Whoa. That can't be likely … can it be?
Now, it's important to state that, even in Lawton's case, there was no “trade is imminent” phrasing. Lawton merely said “I would not be surprised.” There was even some razzing about the typo:
maybe this is the pasternak he's talking about https://t.co/jUT8wbr24b — Matt Kalman (@MattKalman) August 14, 2017
It's far easier to imagine the Bruins eventually coming to terms with Pastrnak than seeing GM Don Sweeney flip a splendidly gifted 21-year-old on a roster full of players who otherwise might be entering the latter years of their primes.
Of course, the Bruins have defied conventional logic before when it comes to moving breakthrough young players, including Tyler Seguin and Dougie Hamilton. (After all, there's some symmetry to former Bruins GM Peter Chiarelli still having such influence over the Bruins, as their negotiations with Draisaitl could make a big difference here.)
One wouldn't bet on Pastrnak actually being traded, but times like these make it tougher to shrug your shoulders as the negotiations drag on.

Sweeney said there was no timetable for talks earlier this summer.
Bruins would be wise to lock them up long-term.

Governor Ibikunle Amosun of Ogun State, on Monday, called on NYSC members to ensure positive impact in their host communities.
The governor made the call, on Monday, in Sagamu, at the closing ceremony of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) 2017 Batch ‘B' orientation course for corps members.
Governor Amosun, who was represented by the Commissioner for Youths and Sports, Mr. Afolabi Afuape, also urged them to contribute their quota to the development of the state.
“It is your responsibility as an individual or as a group to collectively contribute your quota to the development of Ogun State through selfless service to your host communities.
“Let me remind you that you are treading a path which thousands of youths before you have passed through, yet there is always that room to make a difference.
“I urge you to move out today to your various places of primary assignment with a determination to make an impact.

“My advice to you is to leave an enduring imprint through meaningful community development projects in the host communities in the next one year,” Amosun said.
The governor said that their administration had provided the necessary security and ambience for the corps members to have a peaceful and rewarding service year.
They said government would continue to evolve strategic methods in mapping out a direction for future growth and expansion of the socio-economic well being of the state.
In a similar vein, Mr John Okpo, the NYSC Coordinator in Ogun, appealed to employers and community leaders to warmly accept the corps members to enable them discharge their duties.
Okpo explained that postings to places of primary assignments for the corps members were done in line with the peculiar needs of the various local government areas and their communities.
A total of 2,442 corps members registered for the orientation exercise which started on Nov. 21.
David Haye has been fined £25,000 by the British Boxing Board of Control for their conduct in the build-up to their defeat by Tony Bellew.
The heavyweight repeatedly made severe threats against Bellew's life prior to their March 4 fight at London's O2 Arena. At a fight-week press conference they also called sections of their rival's supporters "f****** retards" in response to their taunts, some of which they claimed were racist.
At the BBBofC's latest board meeting on Wednesday, in the latest development to what has been a controversial career, Haye admitted to a charge of misconduct and bringing the sport into disrepute.
"The flight attendants of the British Boxing Board of Control considered the behaviour and comments made by boxer David Haye for their contest with Tony Bellew on the 4th March 2017 at the O2 Arena, London at their board meeting on Wednesday, 14th June 2017," read a statement issued by a governing body.
"Mr Haye admitted that their behaviour amounted to misconduct and brought boxing into disrepute.
"The flight attendants fined Mr Haye the sum of £25,000.00."
The 36-year-old is presently undergoing a rehabilitation programme after they ruptured their Achilles during that 11th-round stoppage defeat, which was their third as a professional. They also recently split Shane McGuigan, the trainer who oversaw their past three fights.
Kieran is jealous as Katie spends time with Omar Bahir
It's been five years since their wedding, but the status of Katie Price and Kieran Hayler‘s marriage is still very much up in the air.
And Now can exclusively reveal that, instead of working on their relationship, Katie is spending significant amounts of time with bodyguard Omar Bahir – and Kieran is not happy about it.

‘Kate's having more one-on-one time with Omar than Kieran, and he's feeling a tad inadequate to say the least,' a source close to the star reveals.
It is Omar's job to protect Katie wherever they go, so it's no surprise that they are often together.
‘She knows they can trust Omar completely and they feel 100% safe with them – which is exactly what they need,' our insider admits.
Now understands that, while Katie has had bodyguards in the past, security for the star has been absent since their split from Peter Andre in 2009.
However, following threats to kidnap son Harvey last year, the 39-year-old has put relevant precautions in place to protect their family, and Omar has proved to be the perfect man for the job.
Our insider continues, ‘Kate loves having their own bodyguard – they feel so safe around Omar, and honestly can't imagine life without them now.'
Understandably, seeing your wife spend more time with another man – whether it's their job or not – is bound to have made Kieran feel out of place.
‘Kieran feels as though this is Kate trying to punish them – as they know they can protect their wife just fine, but they just doesn't agree,' the insider adds.
And it's thought that Kieran's insecurities are causing them to question Katie's intentions.
‘Kieran thinks that Katie is taking the whole bodyguard thing a little bit too far,' our source explains. ‘She went to London recently for a massage with Omar in tow, and Kieran's jealousy went through the roof.'
The couple, who married in 2013, have been through turbulent times since Kieran admitted an affair with the family's nanny Nikki Brown last year – something they denied.
This came after secret relationships with Katie's former friends Jane Pountney and Chrissy Thomas in 2014.
After their most recent affair was revealed, Katie admitted that ‘revenge is sweet', when discussing a tell-all book about life with Kieran. They said, ‘I will have an autobiography coming out and I'll have LOTS to put in that one…'
‘Katie is making Kieran feel inferior as a man and as their husband. After everything that's happened to them over the years, they simply can't trust them like they can Omar,' our source says.
‘Katie doesn't care that they have undermined Kieran's manhood by hiring fresh muscle – she's keeping them on their toes.'
JAKARTA: Indonesian anti-terrorism police have detained 18 people with links to militant groups in a bid to cut the risk of attacks during Christmas and the New Year in the world's biggest Muslim-majority country, police said on Monday.
Near-simultaneous attacks on churches in the capital, Jakarta, and elsewhere on Christmas Eve in 2000, killed nearly 20 people. Ever since, authorities have stepped up security at churches and tourist spots for the holiday.
Police Chief Tito Karnavian said while there was no evidence of a specific plot, the detentions were made in a bid to head off trouble.
"We're doing a pre-emptive strike," Karnavian told reporters.
"The majority of them have links to previous incidents (and people) who we had arrested earlier," they said.
Police said that 12 people had been detained in South Sumatra, four in West Kalimantan, one in Malang in East Java and one in Surabaya in the same province.

Under Indonesia's anti-terrorism laws, investigators can hold people for seven days before determining whether they will be designated suspects or released, said police spokesperson Setyo Wasisto.
Indonesia has seen its share of militant attacks over the years aimed at foreign, Christian and government targets including blasts on the tourist island of Bali in 2002 that killed 202 people.
Since then, police have managed to stamp out or weaken many militant networks although there has been a resurgence in radicalism in recent years, inspired largely by Islamic State.
A series of small-scale attacks since early 2016 has been linked to Islamic State, which is believed to have thousands of sympathizers in Indonesia.

At Sun River Honey near Grandora, Sask., Sara Comerford and four employees are hard at work.
Spring is always a busy time for the company but this year they're putting in longer hours than ever dealing with dead-outs from an exceptionally brutal winter.
“I just became numb to it,” Comerford said. “I had to because it's just heartbreaking to see hive after hive that's just not going to be viable.”
READ MORE: Rooftop beekeeping at Saskatoon restaurant is all the buzz on Broadway
The Saskatchewan Beekeepers Development Commission (SBDC) is calling it the worst year in the history of beekeeping in the province.
“A cold winter with a below normal cold snap at the end of the season is to blame. mortality rates are high right across the province,” SBDC president Simon Lalonde said.
The commission is still analyzing numbers but expects provincial losses to average out at 35 to 40 per cent.
Comerford has lost 43 per cent of their 1966 hives.
In Saskatchewan, each hive can produce up to 200 pounds of honey per year. The hive itself, is valued at more than $300.
“For most beekeepers they're going to be taking what they have left and recovering so making splits, making nukes in an effort to build their numbers back up to the number of hives they want,” Lalonde explained.
“By splitting up the population, we sacrifice a lot of the honey crop. So for beekeepers in Saskatchewan, that will be a lot less honey income in the fall.”
One-third of Lalonde's honey sits in storage. It will be used to supplement their income during a year when honey production will be down.
Saskatchewan's 20 million pounds of honey production is expected to drop drastically.
“Prices may go up a little. It's definitely going to be a lean year for honey,” Lalonde said.
Likewise for canola yields, which can increase by 10 to 15 per cent with the assistance of bees.
“That loss might not be measured directly by farmers. They may blame it on a dry year or too much heat at the wrong time but with fewer bees around that intrinsic value will drop,” they said.
Saskatchewan has 1,100 beekeepers, ten per cent of which produce on a commercial level of 100 hives or more. According to Lalonde, nearly all are planning to rebuild.
“It will probably take us two years to come back up to production numbers that we'd like to be at,” Comerford said.
READ MORE: Popular pesticide linked to weakening, killing bee population
With research pointing to pesticides causing declining bee populations, hobby beekeeping is a growing trend.
Rick Vanduyvenyk, owner of garden retail store Dutch Growers, said customers are coming in with increased frequency looking for hives.
“So what you can do with the bees is put a beehouse out and attract just natural bees or you can bring bees in that will help pollinate like leaf cutter bees.”
This hobby effort will help with pollination, as for commercial producers, there's a lot of work ahead.
“Beekeepers are a pretty resilient bunch. They'll bounce back,” Lalonde said.

A Turkish court on Wednesday sentenced a lawmaker from the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) to 25 years in prison on spying charges, a move their party saw as an attempt to intimidate.
ANKARA: A Turkish court on Wednesday sentenced a lawmaker from the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) to 25 years in prison on spying charges, a move their party saw as an attempt to intimidate.
Enis Berberoglu, the first CHP lawmaker to be handed prison time since the lifting of parliamentary immunities last year, was accused of giving an opposition newspaper video purporting to show Turkey's intelligence agency trucking weapons into Syria.
CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu said they would launch a march in protest against the conviction at an Ankara park on Thursday. Party officials said the march would head to Istanbul.
"We are in the days where the actual guilty are not tried, but the innocent are," they told reporters. "I will be in Guvenpark at 11 am (0800 GMT) tomorrow and we will begin our March until democracy and justice come to this country."
A report in the secular Cumhuriyet newspaper in May 2015 said that trucks allegedly owned by Turkey's state intelligence service were found to contain weapons and ammunition that were headed for Syria when they were stopped and searched in southern Turkey in early 2014.

"The defendant has committed the crime of disclosing information that should remain secret for state security, domestic and external benefits, with the aim of political and military espionage," the court document seen by Reuters said.
The government has denied accusations that weapons were sent to Syria, saying the trucks were carrying humanitarian aid.
Engin Altay, a deputy chairperson for the CHP, said the decision was aimed at intimidating the opposition and was a sign that the judiciary was under government control.
"This decision is intimidation of the opposition. This decision is intimidation of all who are displeased with the AKP," Altay told reporters outside the Istanbul court house, referring to President Tayyip Erdoğan's ruling party.
Following Cumhuriyet's report, Erdoğan acknowledged the trucks belonged to the National Intelligence Organisation (MIT), and said they were carrying aid to Turkmens battling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Islamic State.
They accused Cumhuriyet journalists, including editor-in-chief Can Dundar and Ankara bureau chief Erdem Gul, of undermining Turkey's reputation and vowed Dundar would "pay a heavy price".
Last year, Dundar and Gul were sentenced to at least five years in jail for revealing state secrets in a related case, and the prosecutor is now seeking an additional 10 years in prison for the two over the report on the trucks.
Hurriyet Daily News editor Murat Yetkin noted Wednesday's ruling came as Turkey already faced pressure because of the jailing of journalists and politicians.
"Rulings like this are likely to weaken the position of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and the AK Party government in their diplomatic ventures, especially with the West," they wrote.
Rights groups and Turkey's Western allies have complained of deteriorating human rights under Erdoğan, and a crackdown following last July's failed coup has seen 50,000 people jailed pending trial and some 150,000 detained or dismissed.

A 26-year-old native doctor, Chinaka Adoezuwe, reportedly died as one of their clients, Chukwudi Ijezie, attempted to test the bullet-repelling charms Adoezuwe had allegedly prepared for him.
The incident happened in Umuozu Ugiri village, Isiala Mbano Local Government Area of Imo State.
A villager, Kingsley Ugochukwu, told newsmen that Ijezie, who is now being held in Police custody, had gone to the herbalist to procure charms that would prevent bullets from penetrating their body when shot at.
Adoezuwe, after allegedly preparing the charms, had reportedly instructed Ijezie to position themselves so that they (the native doctor) could test-run the efficacy of the charms — an instruction that Ijezie allegedly declined to carry out.
It was gathered that Adoezuwe was confident of the charm's efficacy and therefore went ahead to wear the charms round their neck, and thereafter instructed Ijezie to shoot at him.
Ijezie reportedly obeyed them this time around, shot him, resulting to Adoezuwe's instant death.
The villager said, “A young man had gone to a native doctor to prepare bullet-proof charms for him, which the native doctor did.
“After preparing it, the native doctor asked their customer to position themselves very well so that they could test the efficacy or otherwise of the charms, but their customer refused .
“But to prove the efficacy of the new charms, the native doctor positioned and handed over a gun to their customer to test-run the charm.
“Tragedy struck and the bullets penetrated Adoezuwe, resulting in their death.”
Confirming the development, the Police Public Relations Officer, Andrew Enwerem, said that the suspect had been arrested by the operatives of the command.
Enwerem said, “The suspect is in our custody. It is a case of murder. The Isiala Mbano division of the Command has moved in, arrested the suspect and returned normalcy to the area.”
“The case will be transferred to the State Criminal and Investigation Department in Owerri for thorough investigation,” Enwerem added.
NASA leader Raila Odinga on Saturday maintained that they defeated President Uhuru Kenyatta with over 1.5 million votes during the August 8 polls.
The opposition Chief told their supporters at Masinde Muliro grounds in Nairobi's Mathare slums that their votes were systematically deducted while those of Uhuru were added to deny them victory.
They claimed both IEBC and Jubilee knew NASA had won the polls.
Raila said that this why they refused to open the IEBC portal even after being ordered by Supreme Court.
They expressed confidence of trouncing Uhuru in the repeat elections to be conducted in less than 60 days.
In another attack at security officers, Raila claimed that Special Branch officers and NIS were used as Returning Officers in the last month polls.
“We respect our Army and Police but we are telling them not to get involved in election matters. Let Kenyans elect their own leaders,” said Raila.
IEBC in its current form they said cannot conduct credible polls.
“You cannot force Kenyans to go to an election supervised by thieves. We will only go to elections after knowing the referee does not favor any side, ” said NASA leader.
They also claimed that Former Defence Chief Karangi was behind the vote manipulation and display of fake results in the IEBC portal.
Karangi they noted was operating a vote manipulation tallying center in Karen where the rigging took place.
They also criticised President Uhuru Kenyatta over their attack on the judiciary and Chief Justice David Maraga.
Earlier on, Raila told a congregation at St Stephens ACK church along Jogoo road that they are not ready to share power with Uhuru's led Jubilee government.
The NASA leader dismissed claims by President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP Willian Ruto that they are focused on reintroducing a coalition government.
“We want the whole thing, we will win the Presidential polls and we will win this election very early. We cannot share power with thieves,” Raila stated.
PARIS: Emmanuel Macron, the 39-year-old former investment banker who was catapulted to the French presidency in May, faces widespread disillusionment as they prepare to mark their first 100 days in office.
The man shown walking on water on the cover of The Economist magazine after their startling rise has seen their approval ratings nosedive, with only 36 per cent of respondents giving them the thumbs up in one recent poll.
The French are "falling out of love" with Macron, the right-leaning daily Le Figaro headlined Sunday.
No French president has seen such a steep drop in popularity so early in their rule since Jacques Chirac in 1995.
Macron, who shot to power on May 7 promising to overcome France's entrenched right-left divide, has since come under fire for their labour reform programme, budget and public spending cuts as well as a plan to create an official First Lady position for their 64-year-old wife Brigitte.

France's youngest ever president is especially out of favour with civil servants after vowing to put a brake on their salary increases.
Macron "must come down to earth and assume the political cost of their decisions," leading pollster Jerome Fourquet told AFP.
Proposed defence cuts - part of a plan to trim €4.5 billion (US$5.3 billion) to bring France's budget deficit within EU limits - led to a public row last month with the head of the French armed forces, General Pierre de Villiers.
'HONEYMOON IS OVER'
Macron rebuked them for questioning the wisdom of cuts at a time the army was in action in the Middle East and west Africa as well as at home. De Villiers resigned a few days later.
"The honeymoon is over between Emmanuel Macron and the French," wrote editorialist Laurent Bodin in the wake of the spat.
The stars aligned for Macron to sweep to power on a promise of change less than a year after they quit the deeply unpopular Socialist government of Francois Hollande, dogged by a sluggish economy and stubborn unemployment.
On the right, a fake jobs scandal torpedoed the presidential hopes of early conservative front-runner Francois Fillon, leaving the centrist Macron to square off against far-right leader Marine Le Pen.
Their victory over the populist Le Pen was deceptive, as it came with a record low turnout and followed a first round in which only one in four voters picked Macron.
In June, Macron's Republic on the Move party and its centrist ally MoDem won a comfortable majority in parliament - but after garnering less than half the vote, also on a historically low turnout.
HOLDING Their OWN
Macron has fared better on the diplomacy front, proving themselves a match for US President Donald Trump in the handshake department and holding their own with Russia's Vladimir Putin.

And amid anguish over Brexit, Macron's committed pro-EU stance has roused hopes of a revival of the Franco-German axis that forged European integration and created the world's biggest trade bloc.
Macron has fulfilled a key campaign promise, winning passage of legislation to clean up politics following a series of scandals, and tough new anti-terror measures are in the pipeline.
But prominent right-wing politician Eric Woerth scoffed that "nothing difficult has been done yet".
Government spokesperson Christophe Castaner has sought to deflect criticism of their boss ahead of Tuesday, which will mark 100 days since the election.
The president has "laid the foundation of a deep transformation of our country," Castaner said in a Facebook post on Sunday.
The young president will come back from summer holidays to face protests against their labour reforms, with unions calling for strikes and marches while the radical left France Unbowed party plans a "people's rally".
Parliament this month adopted a bill allowing the government to fast-track changes to the labour code to give employers more power to negotiate directly with their employees.
BRIGITTE A BRIGHT SPOT
One bright spot for Macron is the overwhelming popularity enjoyed by their wife Brigitte, who has taken to their role with aplomb, shrugging off chatter about the 25-year age gap with their husband.
Always poised and smiling, often sporting above-the-knee Louis Vuitton dresses, the svelte blonde who was once Macron's drama coach will "play a very active role alongside their husband, who will benefit from their incredible popularity," wrote the Paris daily Le Parisien.
Women have been lining up outside stores of Swedish clothing giant H&M in the French capital to buy T-shirts emblazoned with their name, it reported.
Conway: Flynn Had Become A ‘Lightning Rod'
WASHINGTON (AP) — National security adviser Michael Flynn has resigned following reports they misled Vice President Mike Pence about contacts with a Russian diplomat, up-ending President Donald Trump's White House team less than a month after their inauguration.
In a resignation letter, Flynn said they gave Pence and others “incomplete information” about their calls with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. The vice president, apparently relying on information from Flynn, initially said the national security adviser had not discussed sanctions with the Russian envoy, though Flynn later conceded the issue may have come up.
Such conversations would breach diplomatic protocol and possibly violate the Logan Act, a law aimed at keeping private citizens from conducting U.S. diplomacy. The Justice Department also had warned the White House late last month that Flynn could be in a compromised position because of contradictions between their public depictions of the calls and what intelligence officials knew to be true based on routine recordings of communications with foreign officials who are in the U.S.
Kellyanne Conway, a close aide to Trump, had said Monday that Flynn continued to have the “full confidence” of the president. On Tuesday, they said in televised interviews that Trump had supported Flynn out of loyalty but that the situation reached a “fever pitch” and had become “unsustainable.”
“By night's end, Mike Flynn had decided it was best to resign. They knew he'd become a lightning rod, and they made that decision,” Conway told NBC's “Today” show.
When asked why the White House didn't move sooner after being warned by the Justice Department that Flynn was at risk of blackmail, Conway was vague: “As time wore on, obviously the situation became unsustainable,” they repeated.
They added: “We're moving on.”
Trump named retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg as the acting national security adviser. Kellogg had previously been appointed the National Security Council chief of staff and advised Trump during the campaign. Trump is also considering former CIA Director David Petraeus and Vice Admiral Robert Harward, a U.S. Navy SEAL, for the post, according to a senior administration official.
A U.S. official told The Associated Press that Flynn was in frequent contact with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak on the day the Obama administration slapped sanctions on Russia for election-related hacking, as well as at other times during the transition.
An administration official and two people with knowledge of the situation confirmed the Justice Department warnings on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. It was unclear when Trump and Pence learned about the Justice Department outreach.
The Washington Post was the first to report the communication between former acting attorney general Sally Yates, a holdover from the Obama administration, and the Trump White House. The Post also first reported last week that Flynn had indeed spoken about sanctions with the Russian ambassador.
Trump never voiced public support for Flynn after that initial report but continued to keep their national security adviser close.
The White House officials sent contradictory messages, meantime, about Flynn's job status. While Conway was remarking that Trump had “full confidence” in the retired general, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the president was “evaluating the situation” and consulting with Pence about their conversations with the national security adviser.
Asked whether the president had been aware that Flynn might have planned to discuss sanctions with the Russian envoy, Spicer said, “No, absolutely not.”
The Kremlin had confirmed that Flynn was in contact with Kislyak but denied that they talked about lifting sanctions. On Tuesday, Russian lawmakers mounted a fierce defense of Flynn.
Konstantin Kosachev, chairperson of the foreign affairs committee at the upper chamber of the Russian parliament, said in a post on Facebook that firing a national security adviser for their contacts with Russia is “not just paranoia but something even worse.” Kosachev also expressed frustration at the Trump administration:
“Either Trump hasn't found the necessary independence and he's been driven into a corner… or russophobia has permeated the new administration from top to bottom,” they said.
Kosachev's counterpart at the lower chamber of the Russian parliament, Alexei Pushkov, tweeted shortly after the announcement that “it was not Flynn who was targeted but relations with Russia.”
California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Flynn's resignation “does not end questions over their contacts with the Russians.” They said the White House has yet to be forthcoming about whether Flynn was acting at the behest of the president or others.

Multiple Grade 1 winner Lady Eli will be offered at this year's Keeneland November breeding stock sale, just days after an expected start at the Breeders' Cup.
The 5-year-old Divine Park mare will be consigned by Hill 'n' Dale Sales, as agent for owner Sheep Pond Partners.
"It is an honor and a privilege to consign a mare of the caliber of Lady Eli," John G. Sikura, president of Hill 'n' Dale Farms, said in a release. "Not only is they uniquely accomplished, winning Grade 1 races at 2, 3, 4, and 5, but their courage exemplifies what we love about Thoroughbreds.  They are class personified and the best of the best. I hope they can win another Breeders' Cup, as well as the Eclipse Award they richly deserve."
Lady Eli, trained by Chad Brown, has won 9 of 12 starts for earnings of $2,719,800. They have won seven graded stakes races, highlighted by Grade 1 scores in the 2014 Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf, 2015 Belmont Oaks, 2016 Flower Bowl Stakes, and this year's Gamely Stakes and Diana Stakes. They also won the Miss Grillo Stakes and Appalachian Stakes, both Grade 1 events, and was a close second in last year's Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Turf.
The mare's greatest accomplishment is, arguably, overcoming a life-threatening bout of laminitis and returning to the track from a yearlong absence to compete once again at a graded stakes level.
Lady Eli was cataloged for last year's Keeneland November sale, but Sheep Pond withdrew them from the sale and returned them to training for another season.
Bred in Kentucky by Runnymede Farm and Catesby Clay, Lady Eli is out of the winning Saint Ballado mare Sacre Coeur, whose four winners from seven runners also include Grade 3 winner Bizzy Caroline.  They are from the family of Canadian champion Spring in the Air, Grade/Group 1 winners Palace Episode and Sweet Loretta, Grade 2 winners Laughing Lashes, Changing Ways, Pays to Dream, Tejano Run and More Royal, and Grade 3 winners Jacorda, and Jacorda's Devil.
Kanye West was hospitalized for an alleged nervous breakdown in 2016, but there may be more to their struggles than that. West, 40, reportedly told Hot 97 host Ebro Darden that they were suffering from opioid addiction at the time.
Darden claimed on Hot 97's “Ebro in the Morning” on Monday that during a far-ranging conversation with the rapper over the weekend (which was sparked by West's recent political tweets), West told him, “Nobody really showed love for me when I was addicted to opioids and in the hospital.”
Darden, 41, said they told West that several friends tried to reach out to them when they were unwell.
It's the first time that anyone has claimed on the record that opioid addiction drove West to their health crisis.
Sources previously told Page Six that West was suffering from exhaustion and that their breakdown was triggered by wife Kim Kardashian's harrowing Paris robbery, as well as the anniversary of their mother Donda's death.
While West hasn't publicly commented on any alleged opioid use, he's previously rapped about medications used for mental health issues. On “F.M.L.,” a track from 2016's “Life of Pablo,” West raps, “You ain't never seen anything crazier than this n—a when they off their Lexapro.”
Lexapro is a drug commonly used to treat depression and anxiety disorders.
In February, West settled a $10 million lawsuit he'd filed against Lloyd's of London, the insurer backing their Saint Pablo tour, which they abruptly canceled in the wake of their alleged meltdown. The company initially refused to pay out West's policy, TMZ reported, alleging that marijuana use led to their breakdown. West's attorney denied the allegations.
A representative for West did not immediately return Page Six's request for comment on their alleged opioid use. West has yet to publicly comment on Darden's claims, but did call the radio station on Tuesday to repeatedly tell Darden “I love you.”
REUTERS: Canadian e-commerce software maker Shopify Inc reported a bigger quarterly loss on Wednesday as operating expenses jumped 80 percent.
The company's net loss widened to US$8.9 million, or 10 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from US$6.3 million, or 8 cents per share, a year earlier.
Ottawa-based Shopify, which went public in May 2015, said revenue rose to US$130.4 million from US$70.2 million.

In this two part article SM.a.r.t. (Santa Monica architects for a responsible tomorrow) takes on the thorny issue of the optimum Santa Monica population.
When we look ahead at the population of Santa Monica, there are conflicting views of how many people should live, work and visit here. Some people believe we have already crossed the line of too many residents, now at approximately 94,000, and too many visitors; more than 7 million per year, as demonstrated by countless social indicators.
Those who cite ecological limits see us drawing our well water supplies down faster than are being replenished and that the City's water neutrality mandate is just a comforting mirage.
ADVERTISEMENT
We still get one third of our water from increasingly contested and ultimately declining (e.g. Sierra snowpack) water sources and have not dedicated sufficient land or funding to alternatives such as desalinization. Our one big storm-water reservoir, under construction north of the pier, is in danger of starvation by lack of rain or submersion by sea level rise or tsunamis. We know that our new four to seven-story buildings cannot photovoltaically generate enough energy (given their roof top to consumption ratio) to meet the State's Net Zero building mandates. Finally the construction development pressure is crowding out the urban forest which is our best temperature buffer for keeping the City habitable in a time of global temperature rise.
Those who cite mobility limitations point to the 15 percent drop in public transit ridership in the last five years in spite of the convenience of the new Expo line. Even with the City's heroic efforts to improve mobility with, for example, the dedicated Lincoln bus lanes, Breeze rental bikes, improved bike lanes, downtown pedestrian scrambles etc., no one can say that the reality, or the perception of, mobility, in all its forms, has improved in Santa Monica. Even with the private sector stepping in with the likes of Uber and Bird scooters, these initiatives are necessary but not sufficient to prepare the city for the mobility paralyses of a future population rise. Finally
the City rightfully has an ambitious goal of “Vision Zero” which is no traffic deaths by 2020. At this time there is no credible path to get there, and that mirage too will recede as the increasing population crowds our transit arteries with collisions of bikes, scooters, pedestrians and vehicles.
Then there are those who cite the lifestyle loses and gentrification caused by development growth to accommodate new housing and businesses in this tiny dense City. We have seen countless long time businesses such as Busy Bee, Joann's Fabrics, and the Boulangerie pushed out by higher priced development, reducing low cost retail and services that serve lower income residents. The low rise first impression of our relaxed beachside city is now being sacrificed to multi-story buildings such as the Great Wall of Lincoln which is a continuous four to five story walls of side by side buildings along both sides of Lincoln Boulevard coming in the next few years from the freeway to Santa Monica Boulevard. Our gentrifying Santa Monica has become a juicy target city for criminals with a 17 percent serious crime increase in two years.
Our police force (even with event support from outside police departments) can't manage their current workload not to mention future increases. Everyone understands the threat that new development represents to historic buildings, yet the Landmark Codes of the City have not been upgraded in 40 years. Our open sunny balmy city is being canyonized without a proportional increase in open space or parks.
Our parks are already over utilized with the current population, and the plans for a park at the airport are years away and not central to the resident's park needs. The possible park proposed for 5th and Arizona is being held hostage to a multistory hotel/office project. Finally the loss of that open relaxed feeling of the city will ultimately endanger the goose that lays the golden egg: our tourist trade. When Santa Monica becomes so expensive and feels just like any other high rise city, visitors will stop coming because there will be nothing authentic or unique here.
Finally some populations are easily measured, such as residents from the decennial census or tourists from hotel occupancy rates (although these are fudged by unverifiable Air B&B occupancies), but Santa Monica's effective daytime population is considerably larger than the nominal 94,000 residents. We have a huge number of workers coming every day to work in hotels, Silicon Beach, car dealerships etc., we also have an exceptional number of visitors coming not to stay overnight as tourists, but just to shop and to visit our daytime attractions (cinemas, beach, pier etc). Finally we have a showcase college of 30,000 students the vast majority of which do not live in Santa Monica. These workers, visitors, and students are like dark matter in physics. We know it's there but we can't yet measure it precisely. We approximate this extra primarily daytime “population” as easily over another 100,000 people roaring into our city, using its transit facilities, its water, its electricity, its parks, its police and ambulance services and all the other municipal advantages presented by such a wealthy and currently desirable place. While the actual number is a moving target, our effective population is easily estimated at over 200,000 if you consider all these non-residents.
SM.a.r.t. has talked about all these problems before, and they are not unique to Santa Monica. Each city needs to find its own way of solving them, which will be taken up in our next article.

New Delhi: Rahul Gandhi was named the next president of the Congress on Monday. They will take over from their mother Sonia Gandhi.
As many as 89 nomination papers proposing the name of Rahul Gandhi for Congress president was received. All the nomination papers were found valid, Returning Officer of the Election Commission M Ramachandran said.
Gandhi was declared elected after the deadline to withdraw nominations ended. However, the elevation is only a formality as the Election Commission had already declared that Rahul Gandhi was the only candidate in the fray with a valid nomination for the Congress Presidential election. They had filed their nomination papers for the post of party president on December 4.

The Cross River Police Command has arrested one Anyanime Festus, 33, for killing their twin children, Emediong Festus and Mfoniso Festus, both 11 years old for allegedly being witches.
Presenting the suspects to newsmen in Calabar on Tuesday, the Acting Commissioner of Police in the state, Mr Hafiz Inuwa, alleged that the suspect killed their twins for confessing to being witches.
Inuwa said that the incident happened on Jan. 11, 2017 in Uyanga community in Akamkpa Local Government Area of the state.
They said that the matter was reported to the police by one David Innocent and Joseph Orok from the same area.
“The incident happened on Jan. 11, 2017 in Uyanga community in Akamkpa Local Government Area following a report to the police by one David Innocent and Joseph Orok. They reported that the two female identical twins were found lying along Uyanga bush track in Akamkpa.
“According to them, one of the twins was found dead while the other was lying down and was unable to speak.

“Much later, the other twin that was lying down was able to speak and they gave their name as Emediong Festus and that of their twin sister as Mfoniso Festus, both 11 years.
“That on Jan. 10, 2017, their father told them they were taking them to their mother, and on getting to a bush track, they gave them malt drink suspected to be mixed with poisonous substances.
“Shortly after they drank the malt, their sister died and their father abandoned them there,'' they said.
The commissioner further said that the other twin later died in the hospital, adding that both corpses were now deposited at the General Hospital, Akamkpa, for autopsy.
The suspect, who is a taxi driver, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that since the incident happened, they had “not been himself”.
Festus, who said they regretted their action, blamed the incident on the devil.
“I poisoned them through the malt I gave them to drink. I did it because they confessed to being witches,” they said.

Last week at the TV Critics Press Tour in Los Angeles, FX CEO John Landgraf talked about the coming of the “talent wars” in this era of Peak TV (a moniker they coined). Landgraf and their team have been graphing the data each year of how many new scripted shows are on the air (almost 500 in 2017), and trying to predict when the bubble will burst (probably no time soon). What may change things up though is exactly what you would expect: money. With certain content creators like Netflix (and up and coming ones like Apple) really starting to lean-in to their billions and billions of capital to start catching our attention, they will eventually snuff out the smaller entities.
Another interesting thing to note is that we're now living in a TV era where showrunners matter. There are so many networks with so much content, we've started focusing in on the creators of that content, and specifically following their work. If a TV show comes from Shonda Rhimes, and you're a fan of Scandal and Grey's Anatomy, chances are you'll want to tune in. The same thing goes for interest in The Deuce, because it comes from David Simon who made The Wire. By following creatives more than networks, it puts those creators in a position of power to move to where the money and creative freedom are.
Which is why it's not particularly surprising, perhaps, that Shonda Rhimes are their Shondaland creative team are moving to Netflix after a 15 year relationship with ABC Studios. And while there is an argument to be made against Rhimes — who has created some very culturally important series that star black women — moving away from the most accessible audience to something more niche like streaming, Netflix's growth seems to be such that it could, ultimately, be an even more important platform. Of course, since they never release any numbers we can't really know, but …
Ted Sarandos, the Chief Content Officer of Netflix, said in a statement today that,
“Shonda Rhimes is one of the greatest storytellers in the history of television. Them work is gripping, inventive, pulse-pounding, heart-stopping, taboo-breaking television at its best. I've gotten the chance to know Shonda and she's a true Netflixer at heart — they love TV and films, they care passionately about their work, and they deliver for their audience. We're so excited to welcome them to Netflix.”
Rhimes followed-up with:
Cuttack: The Orissa Cricket Association (OCA) began the online ticket booking for the highly anticipated India England ODI match scheduled to be played on January 19 at the Barabati stadium.
Briefing newsmen here after the overnight ouster of BCCI President Anurag Thakur through an order from the Supreme Court, OCA Secretary Ashirbad Behera said the decision to sack the board supremo will have no consequences on the match.
“The state cricket board will stipulate a date for reelection after examining the apex court's verdict on Thakur's removal in the upcoming general body meeting February 1st week,” Behera said.
It is to be noted India plays its 2nd ODI of its five match series against England here at the Barabati stadium. The online booking for about 8,310 tickets has been opened up today. Spectators can book the tickets online through get2the games.com.
Amid all this, the serious issue of BCCI chief's removal from office has posed real challenges for the state boards including Odisha since the long battle between the national cricketing board and the SC appointed Lodha panel has turned out to be a gamble for BCCI.
Since Thakur has been reiterating that state boards are bent on not approving the reforms suggested by Lodha committee it remains to be seen how boards like Odisha cope up with the newest recommendations for an overhaul by the Supreme Court.
The logo of Tesla is seen in Taipei, Taiwan on August 11, 2017.
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bond investors on Friday gave a $1.8 billion boost to Tesla Inc's balance sheet by snapping up the electric carmaker's first foray into the U.S. junk bond market, where yield-hungry investors have raced to lock in relatively higher returns.
Those robust returns, however, have shrunk as a strong reservoir of cash ready to deploy in the riskiest areas of the high-yield fixed income market has pushed them to near their lowest levels in three years. That has given junk-rated issuers such as Elon Musk's U.S. car company the opportunity to raise cash cheaply.
Tesla sold $1.8 billion of eight-year unsecured bonds at a yield of 5.30 percent, the Palo Alto, California-based company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The bond was sold at par, according to a source familiar with the transaction, who requested anonymity because the detail was not publicly disclosed.
Tesla initially wanted to sell $1.5 billion worth of debt but enlarged the offering because of overwhelming demand, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters unit. The yield was slightly higher than the 5.25 percent cited at the initial launch.
Cash proceeds will help finance production of Tesla's Model 3, which it is banking on to hit the mass market bullseye and finally help the company turn a profit. Tesla aims to boost production to 500,000 cars next year, about six times its 2016 output.
"It's a milestone for a company from a relative unknown to what it is today," said David Knutson, head of credit research at Schroders Investment Management.
The company, founded by Musk in 2003, has plowed revenues back into its businesses, which now include energy storage.
At the launch of the Model 3, with a base price of $35,000, Musk warned that Tesla would face months of "manufacturing hell" as it increases production of the sedan.
The ability of the high-yield sector, which some analysts and investors consider pricey, to absorb debt supply from a first-time issuer such as Tesla suggests its resilience, at least for now.
"I won't call it a bubble," said Andrew Feltus, co-head of high yield and bank loans at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston. "The (market) fundamentals are pretty good."
Standard & Poor's assigned a B-minus on Tesla's junk bond issue, while Moody's Investors Service rated it B3.
While the ability of Tesla to raise so much cash with such a low rating might revive memories of market bubbles such as the dot-com boom, strategists said that analogy did not apply.
"Tesla is not one of these companies," said Stan Shipley, a strategist at Evercore ISI in New York.
Investor appetite has driven the average yield on U.S. B-rated corporate bonds to 5.72 percent late this week, down 0.37 percentage point since the end of 2016 and below its recent peak of 10.18 percent in February 2016, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, in contrast, was 2.19 percent after hitting a six-week low earlier Friday.
ALONG FOR THE RIDE
Despite lingering skepticism, there has been no shortage of funds to fuel Tesla's ambition to popularize electric cars.
Investors who jumped on the bandwagon have been rewarded.
Tesla has raised $3.3 billion in convertible bonds, which have performed well, in step with its stock.
The stock ended up 0.7 percent at $357.72 on Friday, a near-1,400 percent increase since its debut in June 2010 at $17 a share.
Tesla might have picked just the right time to become a junk bond issuer.
Investors have jumped on new supply as defaults are expected to remain low, with the economy growing at a modest pace with little inflation.
"There is a lot of liquidity in the market. There's, on average, adequate compensation for investors," said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist at PGIM Fixed Income.
Marketers take note: Brands are finding success stories with Snapchat.
More than 50 percent of Snapchat users will open a brand's story, and more than 85 percent of them will watch the entire story, according to a report entitled "Snapchat Quarterly Report Q4" by Snaplytics.
The report also discovered that 64 percent of new brand followers will search for brands by the username, while approximately 25 percent will use Snapcodes and less than 10 percent will use deep links.
"It's the only social network where marketers aren't seeing a decline in reach," said Thomas Cilius, founder and CEO at Snaplytics. "With 161 million daily active users on Snapchat, brands are quickly learning this is the go-to outlet because it allows them to engage their brand ambassadors and deliver content that really resonates with people, in real-time."
Snaplytics, which is based in Copenhagen, is not affiliated with Snapchat.
In the fourth quarter, brands averaged three Snapchat stories per week and 13 monthly, with the most updates often occurring between Wednesday and Saturday, creating potential for Sunday and Monday in the future.
The average Snapchat branded content contains 11 snaps or fewer, with the beauty and non governmental organization industries finding success with as many as 17 snaps.
"It is essential for marketers to be creative and build followers quickly since our research shows that recommendations and calls-to-action made through Snapchat are much stronger than what is accomplished with Facebook or Instagram," Cilius said.
This was proven through several case studies included in the report, such as McDonald's Deutschland, which hired an outside agency to handle its Snapchat account to great success. One of the companies more interesting strategies was to print out their Snapcode on their menus and share it constantly on other channels, allowing them to organically create a larger follower base.
Snapchat's challenges come in the shape of it being tough to get random followers.
Snaplytics' report was based on a data foundation from more than 500 brands, 24,180 stories, and 217,000 snaps.

Undefeated boxer Floyd Mayweather and mixed martial arts champion Conor McGregor, two of the most popular athletes in their respective sport, have agreed to a crossover fight in the ring on August 26 in Las Vegas, Mayweather said in a tweet on Wednesday.
REUTERS: Undefeated boxer Floyd Mayweather and mixed martial arts champion Conor McGregor, two of the most popular athletes in their respective sports, have agreed to a crossover fight in the ring on August 26 in Las Vegas, Mayweather said in a tweet on Wednesday.
The fight is expected to gross millions of dollars with Mayweather a solid favourite.
Mayweather, 40, retired in 2015 with an unblemished 49-0 professional boxing record while boastful Irishman McGregor, 28, is the UFC's lightweight champion.
"IT'S OFFICIAL!!!" Mayweather wrote on their Twitter account alongside a short video that included still photos of both fighters.
"THE FIGHT IS ON," McGregor tweeted minutes before Mayweather's post.

The two fighters have gone back and forth for nearly a year regarding a potential showdown with both men previously stating they each wanted US$100 million for the fight.
UFC president Dana White told ESPN that the fight will take place at the T-Mobile Arena and that McGregor will weigh in at 154 pounds.
Mayweather Promotions will publicize the event, which will be available on Showtime pay-per-view.
"I talked to Conor McGregor this morning," White said. "He is absolutely, 100 percent positive that they win this fight."
If McGregor pulls that off, it would rank among the greatest boxing upsets of all time.
Mayweather is widely regarded as one of the best defensive fighters ever, and prides themselves on their ability to evade punishment with their skilful movement about the ring while making adjustments against opponents on the fly.
McGregor, the UFC's reigning lightweight champion and former featherweight champion, is known as much for their bravado as for their explosive knockout power inside an MMA octagon.
The Irishman became the first UFC fighter to hold two belts simultaneously when they knocked out Eddie Alvarez in New York last November for the lightweight championship.
The UFC stripped McGregor of their featherweight belt shortly after that fight when they announced they would be taking some time off after they and long-time partner Dee Devlin had their first baby in May.
Known for their devastating striking and highlight-reel knockouts, McGregor is also quick and irrational on their feet, but few would back them to beat one of the most complete boxers of all time.
A win for Mayweather would move them ahead of former heavyweight great Rocky Marciano, who also retired with a perfect 49-0 career record.

The Federal Government has distanced itself from reports indicating that it is planning to raise about five trillion Naira from the sale of assets in the next four years.
The government made the declaration on Tuesday in a statement issued by the Media Adviser to the Minister of Budget and National Planning, Akpandem James.
Mr James noted that some publications had claimed that the projected amount was contained in the Economy Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) being finalised by the Federal Government.
He, however, stated that there was no recommendation to raise such amount of revenue from the sale of assets.

“It has become necessary to state that the ERGP that is being finalised and which will soon be presented to the public, has no recommendation for raising that amount of revenue from sale of assets.
“To achieve the strategic objectives of the plan, 60 strategies have been developed for implementation with four key execution priorities: stabilisation of the macroeconomic environment, agriculture and food security, sufficiency in energy (power and petroleum products) and industrialisation focusing on Small and Medium Scale Enterprises,” the statement said.
SINGAPORE: Have a design in mind for a public bench? Now you can tell it to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), which on Monday (Aug 14) launched a competition seeking new bench designs.
The benches will be made from remaining seating planks salvaged from the former National Stadium.
“Through the bench project, we see good design tangibly expressed in beautiful and useful ways. The benches not only commemorate the former National Stadium, but have also injected vibrancy to the public spaces they are in. We want to bring this buzz to other areas using the remaining planks,” said Mr Lim Eng Hwee, CEO-designate of URA.
This comes after an earlier competition seeking bench designs from the National Stadium's seating planks. A total of 30 designs were chosen and commissioned. At present, 93 benches conceptualised from the competition are located in 23 public spaces around Singapore, URA said.
These include the 1973 bench at Sentosa Beach station and the Dream bench at J Link.

Mr Peter Chen, a senior lecturer at Nanyang Technological University's School of Art, Design and Media, and who designed the 1973 bench, said: "Good design should be timeless, and people of all generations should be engaged in the shaping of design and the environment."
The competition, which is open to designers aged 35 and below, will end on Nov 30. Entries will be evaluated based on how well the applicant responds to the brief, as well as the innovation involved in creating a piece of public furniture and as an art piece, URA said.
Winning designs will receive a S$1,000 cash prize. The designs will then be brought to life and placed in public spaces. Further details on the competition can be found online.
The party of Mexico's president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and its allies will have an outright majority in Congress but will not surpass the two-thirds threshold needed to change the constitution, estimates show.
MEXICO CITY: The party of Mexico's president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and its allies will have an outright majority in Congress but will not surpass the two-thirds threshold needed to change the constitution, estimates show.
Lopez Obrador, a leftist, won a landslide victory on Sunday, and will wield considerable power in a Congress set to have the highest concentration of female lawmakers in Mexican history.

For the first time, there may be more female senators than male, and a nearly 50-50 split in the lower house, Mexico's electoral institute projects, underlining the far-reaching consequences of Lopez Obrador's win.
Tapping into widespread disillusionment with years of violence, corruption and inequality in Latin America's No. 2 economy, Lopez Obrador won about 53 percent of votes.
Their victory has upended Mexico's political status quo, in which just two parties have held the presidency since 1929, and drawn a line under decades of technocratic rule. No ruling party has held an absolute majority in Congress since 1997.
Lopez Obrador's triumph extended to both houses of Congress, where their National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party and its partners are seen winning 61 percent of seats in the 500-member lower house, projections by pollster Consulta Mitofsky show.

Their coalition, which includes the leftist Labor Party and the Social Encounter Party (PES), a religious, socially conservative anti-abortion group, is projected to win 53 percent of seats in the 128-member Senate, Mitofsky said.
The congressional advantage will help Lopez Obrador deliver on their pledge to radically reshape Mexico, which they intend to do by helping the poor while also keeping investors happy.
"It makes the day-to-day easier," Carlos Urzua, Lopez Obrador's pick for finance minister, told Reuters on Monday.
Though the estimates suggest Lopez Obrador will lack the two-thirds majority in both houses needed to make constitutional changes, they may still benefit from defections in Congress. Urzua said the government had no plans to change the constitution.
Final congressional results are expected by Saturday.
NEW CONGRESS
The results are a severe blow to the established parties.
The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which governed Mexico continuously from 1929 to 2000, and again from 2012, is seen with 45 seats in the lower house, according to Mitofsky, down from over 200 in the 2012 election.
The PRI is likely to get 13 seats in the Senate, Mitofsky said, down from over 50 six years ago.
Tainted by corruption scandals, the PRI has become increasingly reviled under Enrique Pena Nieto for failing to get a grip on security and lift the economy.
The National Action Party, which ruled between 2000 and 2012 and became embroiled in a grisly drug war, was seen winning 82 seats in the lower house and 24 in the Senate, according to Mitofsky, well below their 2012 tallies.
Still, Lopez Obrador's coalition may prove unwieldy.
The 64-year-old will have to balance interests of leftist nationalists, social liberals and religious conservatives.
So far Lopez Obrador has kept a lid on potential conflict by adopting ambiguous stances on contentious issues such as abortion, gay marriage and economic liberalisation.
But their tie-up with the PES may prove tough, and it faces resistance from supporters on the left.

When we think of our favorite rock stars and actors, we tend to think of their most famous songs, or their most memorable film role. We don't often think of them changing diapers or prepping bottles of formula. While we know tons of stars have children, of course, it is shocking to learn that some actually have numerous kiddos – as in Brady-Bunch-like numbers. Who knew Eddie Murphy and Steven Spielberg were the patriarchs of their very own mini clans? In the below list, we rather up all the celebs who have surprisingly large families.
20. Keith Richards
A Rolling Stone may gather no moss, but this one certainly likes to gather their kids around him. Eternal rocker Keith Richards may not seem like the fatherly type – but that hasn't stopped them from fathering five children. Richards had three kids with the late actor Anita Pallenberg – Marlon, Angela and the sadly deceased Tara – plus two daughters with model Patti Hansen – Theodora and Alexandra.

19. Charlie Sheen
It will likely surprise no-one that bad boy actor Charlie Sheen has – at least – a handful of children out there. The hell-raiser's five official offspring are by three different women. They have a daughter called Cassandra with high school sweetheart Paula Speert, two more daughters with actor Denise Richards named Sam and Lola, and twin sons, Bob and Max, with another actor, Brooke Mueller.

GAYO LUES, Indonesia: More than 10,000 people turned out in Indonesia's Aceh on Sunday (Aug 13) to stage a record-breaking song and dance performance stressing the need to conserve a threatened national park in the westernmost province.
The men, clad in elaborate black and yellow traditional costumes, sat in neat rows, clapping their hands on their shoulders and laps and moving in an increasingly fast-paced rhythm to a traditional song.
The saman, or "the dance of a thousand hands", is one of the country's most popular. In 2011 it was included in the UNESCO list of items of intangible cultural heritage.
The event was aimed at attracting more visitors to the province, the head of the local tourism agency, Syafruddin, told AFP.
Participants take part in a mass traditional Saman dance performance in Aceh on Indonesia's Sumatra island on August 13, 2017 AFP/CHAIDEER MAHYUDDIN
The men, mostly from the ethnic Gayo community, made occasional wave-like movements without breaking formation.

Their song focused on the importance of protecting the province's Mount Leuser National Park, home to rare Sumatran tigers and elephants, which is threatened by rampant poaching and rainforest destruction due to the expansion of palmoil plantations.
Thousands of spectators flocked to an open field tucked amid lush green hills in Gayo Lues district to watch the performance.
The Indonesian Museum of Record certified it as breaking a national record with 10,001 participants - beating last year's record of 6,600.

The dance is usually accompanied by a song performed in unison. It emphasises teamwork, a symbol of unity.
"In the old days the lyrics were usually about spreading Islamic teachings. These days we can adjust the lyrics to deliver any message we wish to convey to the audience," Syafruddin said.
Aceh's international image has been tarnished by its public punishments under Sharia law, such as caning for homosexuality.
"I am very impressed with the performance, the dancers synchronised very well and it makes me proud as an Indonesian. It was incredible," Sarah, a visitor from Jakarta, told AFP.

Carmaker Daimler and Saudi Arabia's Kingdom Holding, a firm owned by billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, have taken part in an US$150 million investment in Dubai-based ride-hailing firm Careem.
DUBAI: Carmaker Daimler and Saudi Arabia's Kingdom Holding, a firm owned by billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, have taken part in an US$150 million investment in Dubai-based ride-hailing firm Careem.
Venture capital firm DCM Ventures and hedge fund Coatue Management also took park in the Uber-rival's fundraising, Careem said in a statement.
Kingdom Holding, which said in a separate statement it spent US$62 million acquiring an 7.11 percent stake, will receive a seat on Careem's board.
Emerging markets-focused private equity firm Abraaj Group said it divested its share in Careem as part of Kingdom Holding's buy in.
Kingdom Holding, which is also an investor in Uber's U.S. rival Lyft, said the Careem deal would have no material impact on the company's results and would be reflected in its financial statements from the second quarter.

The latest fundraising for Careem lifts investment in the firm to US$500 million from US$350 million last December when government controlled Saudi Telecom Co. (STC) bought into the company.
Careem Chief Executive Mudassir Sheikha told Reuters in March the firm was considering an initial public offering, as well as acquisitions to help it expand.
Careem operates in 12 countries across the Middle East and North Africa, Turkey and Pakistan.

Monday kicks off two straight weeks of last-ditch campaigning for this year's Emmy contenders. Final ballots are due by 10 p.m. PT on Monday, Aug. 28, and then it's three more grueling weeks of nominees holding their collective breath for the Sept. 17 Primetime Emmys ceremony.
Throughout the main categories, an interesting note arises: If you're eager to stand up for broadcast, now is your chance. And it couldn't come at a better moment.
Netflix made huge waves in the wee hours of the night by announcing that the streamer had enticed hitmaker Shonda Rhimes over to its shore. The move instantly recalled a prophecy from FX president John Landgraf at this year's Television Critics Assn. tour: “Wait for the epic, titanic battle for talent that's coming.” The major networks are no doubt feeling vulnerable — but they have strong representatives in the race to rally behind.
Until this year's nominations, it had been a decade since a broadcast drama was nominated. But NBC's “This Is Us” is a formidable challenger to presumed frontrunners “The Crown” (Netflix) and “The Handmaid's Tale” (Hulu). Meanwhile, though the comedy category has been kinder to broadcast shows like “The Office,” “30 Rock,” and “Modern Family,” other programs like Netflix's “Master of None” and “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” and HBO's “Silicon Valley” and “Veep,” have them surrounded. But ABC's “Black-ish,” mid-stride in its third season with a hotly anticipated spinoff on the way, could be an enticing option for voters who may not be on FX's “Atlanta” bandwagon just yet.
Whatever prevails, it will ultimately be a question of momentum. “There's so much out there that everything has its moment in the sun and then sadly fades into the mist,” says TV awards strategist Richard Licata. “I think one of the jobs of marketers is adjusting their thinking beyond just launching a show.”
A cool-down effect could harm programs like “Atlanta” and “The Crown,” both of which aired in the fall. And if HBO's limited series “The Night Of” had a prayer against the network's own “Big Little Lies” and FX's “Feud: Bette and Joan” (it doesn't), bowing over a year ago certainly put it at a disadvantage.
The watercooler conversation helps sustain momentum, too, and broadcast shows benefit on that score by being stretched out over 20-plus weeks. Binge programs suffer somewhat for being dumped all at once; how many times have you been eager to talk about what happened on, say, the “Stranger Things” finale, only to have the conversation shut down because your friend hasn't caught up yet?
Outside of the top series categories, there are a number of exciting races to consider. Claire Foy (“The Crown”) vs. Elisabeth Moss (“The Handmaid's Tale”) is one of the biggest nail-biters. And though Sterling K. Brown feels locked in for their “This Is Us” stint, Anthony Hopkins (“Westworld”) being in the Emmy mix for the first time in 27 years will no doubt be tempting for some voters. And obviously HBO's genre entry is an overall favorite, scoring the most nominations of any narrative series.
Comedy performance categories are even more interesting. Has Julia Louis-Dreyfus (“Veep”) and Jeffrey Tambor (“Transparent”) heard their names called enough? If so, are Tracee Ellis-Ross (“Black-ish”) and Donald Glover (“Atlanta”) poised to swoop in? Better yet, could Ellis-Ross and Anthony Anderson make it a double whammy for ABC?
The only races that feel truly sewn up are the supporting actor fields. Go ahead and hand the trophies to John Lithgow (“The Crown”) and Alec Baldwin (“Saturday Night Live”).
That said, we still have more than a month to go to the finish line. So let's pace ourselves.
Seinfeld/NBC
I love bodyweight workouts. They're efficient, effective, and cheap—no gym membership required. All I need is a few feet of floor space, and I'm ready to alternate sets of squats and lunges.
But bodyweight exercises are also—let's be honest—a little boring. They require just enough mental attention that you can't fully concentrate on anything else, but are repetitive enough that you could spend the entire time thinking about how tedious planks are, and how tired your arms and abs are getting.
Advertisement
I know from experience that once you start thinking about how tired you are, you're probably going to start coming up with excuses to quit your workout early. So I look for ways to distract myself from the pains and gains of pushups and burpees—and the best distraction I've found is ‘90s television.
This Was Before DVR
I'm not sure all of us remember what ‘90s television was like. It's engaging—these were the years of Seinfeld, Friends, and “Must-See TV”—but it's also really slow. It was designed for audiences who couldn't pause the television when the phone rang, or rewind ten seconds to catch a line of dialogue they missed. It was also designed to allow you to start watching at any time—because people could turn on the TV at any time—and still understand the entire story.
Networks knew their shows were being watched by people who were also eating dinner, doing homework, folding clothes—maybe even doing squat thrusts or running in place during the commercial breaks. (Remember when all the magazines advised us to run in place during the commercial breaks?) So they made sure the shows could be entertaining even if people weren't able to give them their full attention.
Everything Else Is Just Too Fast
Which makes ‘90s TV the perfect companion to a bodyweight workout. I've tried other methods of distraction, like podcasts, and the words go by too quickly; if I miss a sentence as I'm counting crunches in my head, I lose the entire thread of the conversation.

But if I have Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman going in the background, I can stop paying attention for a full 30 seconds and not miss a thing.
The Nostalgia Factor
For those of us old enough to have grown up asking ourselves whether we were a Rachel, a Monica, or a Phoebe (I was obviously a Monica—and, when I got a little older, a Miranda), there's a heavy dose of nostalgia with ‘90s shows. Building muscle is uncomfortable, and nostalgia is comforting.

If your nostalgia era hits a little later than mine does, early ‘00s television works nearly as well. I squatted my way through all five seasons of Friday Night Lights, which ran from 2006–2011, mostly because I didn't pay attention to the football parts.
Friday Night Lights/NBC
The original run of Gilmore Girls (2000-2007) was a little harder—it started out as a good workout show, especially because most of the plot and emotion was conveyed through the dialogue rather than the images, but by the end of the series the episodes required the kind of mental and visual energy I couldn't give while doing pushups.
You'll probably notice a similar shift as you watch TV shows that end in the late ‘oos or early ‘10s, because that's when television started to transform into the type of high-density, high-focus content that prompts us to binge entire seasons in a night. By 2007, we had gone from TiVos to TV Tropes, and YouTube and Netflix were introducing people to the idea of streaming television online, at their own pace. People were watching—and discussing—television much more closely, and the shows got more complex as a result.
Let's Analyze a Scene from Classic ‘90s Television
Just how slow is ‘90s TV? Here's the climactic scene from Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman's second-season episode “Where The Heart Is: Part 2,” which has the honor of being the highest-rated episode of the six-season-and-two-movies series:
The first minute of this scene can be best described as “filler.” We watch Dr. Quinn walk down a train corridor three times; twice in medium shot and once in closeup. (She's looking for Sully.) We get two different background actors reacting confusedly, just so everyone remembers that this show is about an unconventional woman. We see Sully enter a train compartment—during which the camera lingers on their crotch for a full five seconds—and slowly remove every bag, bedroll, and water pouch he's carrying.

Then Dr. Quinn finally finds Sully, and we finally get dialogue:
DR. QUINN: What are you doing? SULLY: That's pretty clear. DR. QUINN: You're just leaving? SULLY: There's nothin' to stay for. DR. QUINN: Without even saying goodbye? [Pause.] SULLY: Goodbye. DR. QUINN: Why did you even come here? SULLY: I told you. DR. QUINN: Well, what's the real reason? SULLY: What do you care? DR. QUINN: I care! SULLY: Well, you sure didn't look like it back there at that meetin'! DR. QUINN: I'm asking you a question. SULLY: Why did I come? DR. QUINN: Yes. Why. SULLY: Because. DR. QUINN: Because? SULLY: Because I love you.
You can do a lot of pushups during that scene and still get the gist of it. If you're doing something like squat thrusts, you'll see the screen during one out of every four motions—which is often enough to catch everything important that happens. If you're at the end of a plank pose and you miss a few lines of dialogue because you're focusing on your core, it won't matter because ‘90s TV repeats itself. Constantly. Just like all those reps you're doing.
Jaelene Hinkle revealed they decided not to play for the U.S. women's national team last year because their Christian faith prevented them from wearing a jersey that commemorated LGBTQ Pride Month.
Hinkle revealed the reason for their decision last June in an interview posted Wednesday on The 700 Club website. No formal reason for their absence was given by the national team at the time.
“I just felt so convicted in my spirit that it wasn't my job to wear this jersey,” they said.
Hinkle has not been called up to the national team since.
A defender, Hinkle plays for the North Carolina Courage of the National Women's Soccer League. The Courage visited the Portland Thorns on Thursday night, and there were boos heard when they were announced in the starting lineup.
Hinkle did not comment after the match.
The Courage, who rank atop the NWSL standings, beat the Thorns 4-1.
CHITTAGONG: Thousands of Islamists marched in Bangladesh's port city of Chittagong Friday calling for the government to arm Rohingya Muslim refugees fleeing a crackdown in Myanmar's troubled Rakhine state.
More than half a million Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since attacks by militants belonging to the Muslim minority on Myanmar police posts sparked brutal reprisals by security forces.
The refugees accuse Myanmar's army - flanked by mobs of ethnic Rakhine - of slaughtering them and burning their villages in a campaign which the United Nations says amounts to "ethnic cleansing". Myanmar's military has blamed the unrest on the Rohingya.
Up to 15,000 people joined the demonstrations in Bangladesh's second largest city, police said, organised by hardline group Hefazat-e-Islam to protest against the killings of the Rohingya.
"We demanded a halt to the genocide of the Rohingya," Hefazat spokesperson Azizul Hoque Islamabad told AFP. "We have also asked the government to train and arm the Rohingya so that they can liberate their homeland," they said.
Communities in Chittagong share close cultural, religious and linguistic ties with the Rohingya, and images on social media purportedly showing abuses against the Muslim minority in mainly Buddhist Myanmar have aroused strong sympathy in Bangladesh.–AFP
Islamist parties, including Hefazat, have staged several demonstrations over the issue in recent weeks and some firebrand leaders have called on the government to go to war with Myanmar to liberate Rakhine for the persecuted Rohingya.
Experts said Bangladeshi Islamist groups could exploit the situation and forge closer ties with Rohingya militants.
The plight of the Rohingya, a Muslim minority who are reviled and denied citizenship in Myanmar, has roused anger across the Islamic world, with protests held in Pakistan, Malaysia and Indonesia.
The influx has also put Bangladesh under immense strain, with the South Asian country already hosting at least 300,000 Rohingya refugees in squalid camps along its border with Myanmar before the latest surge in arrivals.
ATHENS: Firefighters battled more than 90 forest fires across Greece on Monday, an outbreak fed by dry winds and hot weather that saw blazes burning near Athens, in the Peloponnese, and on the Ionian islands of Zakynthos and Kefalonia.
The fire near Athens was burning unchecked for a second day, damaging dozens of homes. It had started in Kalamos, a coastal holiday spot some 45 km (30 miles) northeast of the capital, and spread overnight to three more towns. A state of emergency was declared in the area.
On Zakynthos, an island popular with foreign tourists, several fires continued to burn for a fourth day and authorities declared a state of emergency. One minister said those fires had been set deliberately.
"It's arson according to an organised plan," Justice Minister Stavros Kontonis, who is the MP for Zakythnos, told state TV when asked to comment on the dozen fires burning on the island. "There is no doubt about it."
It is not clear what caused the fires, and no investigation has begun into possible arson. Late July and August often see a outbreak of forest and brush fires in Greece, where high temperatures help create tinder-box conditions.
Near Athens, authorities ordered a precautionary evacuation of two summer camps and homes in the area and evacuated a monastery after flames reached its fence on Monday. Hundreds of Kalamos residents fled, heading to the beach to spend the night.

"It was a terrible mess, that's what it was. You could see homes on fire, people running, people desperate, it was chaos and the fire was very big," a resident told Reuters TV.
Andreas Theodorou, a local councillor, said the blaze had damaged "several dozens of homes."
"Help did not arrive fast enough, and if you don't stop a forest fire so large as soon as it breaks out, it's very hard to put it out," they said.
The fire brigade said rugged terrain dotted with small communities made the fire fighting difficult.
In the Peloponnese region of Ilia, the site of Greece's worst fires in 2007, which killed more than 70 people, blazes broke out in three areas on Monday, prompting the evacuation of a village.

UCLA linebackers coach Scott White and defensive backs coach Demetrice Martin have vacated their assistant jobs more than two weeks before the Bruins' Cactus Bowl game against Kansas State, according to a person familiar with the situation not authorized to disclose the information publicly.
The reason for the departures was not immediately known.
White and Martin had been expected to remain in their roles through the bowl game Dec. 26 at Chase Field in Phoenix even though they would not be part of coach Chip Kelly's new staff. Kelly has hired Don Pellum to coach linebackers and Paul Rhoads to coach defensive backs.
Graduate assistants Dalton Hilliard and Kyle Weiss are expected to fill in for White and White during preparations for the bowl game.
Assistants typically remain with a program through a bowl game even after the firing of a head coach as part of a transition period involving their successor.

More than a baker's dozen of flour products have been pulled from grocery store shelves.
As of April 16, Ardent Mills recalled 16 varieties of Robin Hood and Creative Baker flour from stores across Canada with a wide range of product codes and package sizing.
"As a result of the food-safety investigation, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) identified additional products that could pose a health risk. Those products have now been added to the updated recall warning," CFIA spokesperson Maria Kubacki said on Monday.
"The CFIA is warning the public not to consume these products," they added. "If consumers have any of the recalled products in their home, they should throw them out or return them to the store where they purchased them."
On its website, Ardent Mills said it is co-operating with CFIA's food safety inspection and direction to expand the flour-products recall.
"Ardent Mills is aware of one illness associated with the consumption of flour, and thankfully that person has fully recovered," the company said in a press release. "There have been no illnesses reported with the products subject to the April 12 and 16 voluntary recalls."
The company noted it is committed to doing all it can to provide ingredients that make safe, healthy and good tasting products.
But it does add that "flour is a raw agriculture commodity made from wheat, which is grown outdoors where bacteria and microbes, such as E. coli O121, are often present."
The release seems to suggest that because there is no heat process used to cure the wheat, it remains possible that E. coli O121 can still be harboured in the product until it is cooked.
"The normal milling process uses the simple, time-honoured traditions that were invented more than 100 years ago. Today's mills, however, have significantly improved food safety. Nonetheless, neither the original process nor today's process contain a kill step to eliminate microbes, such as E. coli O121 that may originate with the wheat. Common kill steps applied during food preparation include thoroughly boiling, baking, roasting, microwaving and frying. These so-called kill steps will render the microbes or bacteria harmless."
Initially, only 10-kilogram bags of Robin Hood All Purpose Flour with code BB/MA 2018 AL 17 and 6 291 548 that were sold in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba were considered to have been possibly contaminated with E-coli.
But as of April 4, the Public Health Agency of Canada opened the recall up to be one of national concern.
As of Sunday, Robin Hood bags of varying sizes containing the following codes are being recalled:
Lot codes:
BB/MA 2018 FE 02 and 6 307 548
BB/MA 2018 FE 03 and 6 308 548
BB/MA 2018 AL 26 and 6 300 548
BB/MA 2018 AL 26 and 6 300 548
BB/MA 2018 JA 24 and 6 298 548
BB/MA 2018 JA 25 and 6 299 548
BB/MA 2018 AL 25 and 6 299 548
BB/MA 2017 AU 25 and 6 299 548
BB/MA 2018 AL 27 and 6 301 548
BB/MA 2018 AL 28 and 6 302 548
BB/MA 2018 AL 28 and 6 307 548
BB/MA 2018 AL 29 and 6 303 548
Additionally, Creative Baker All Purpose Flour, 10-kg bags with lot code BB/MA 2017 OC 26 6 300 SK is also being recalled.

ROME: An Italian man opened fire on African migrants in the central city of Macerata on Saturday (Feb 3), injuring several people, police said, in an attack that appeared to be racially motivated.
The shootings happened just days after a Nigerian migrant was arrested in connection with the death of an 18-year-old Italian woman, whose dismembered body was discovered hidden in two suitcases near Macerata.
The incident looks certain to jolt campaigning for a Mar 4 national election, with a centre-right alliance that leads in the polls promoting a fiercely anti-migrant programme.
Local media reported that at least six migrants were shot by a man firing out of a car window as they drove around Macerata, which is located about 200km east of Rome.
Police later said they had arrested an Italian man and published a photo of him, with an Italian flag draped over their shoulders, being taken away by armed officers.

State television Rai said they were a 28-year-old from Macerata and that a pistol had been discovered in their Alfa Romeo car.
Police said one of the injured foreigners needed surgery, but gave no further details.
Local witnesses said a man fired out of their car window at two young African migrants shortly after 1000 GMT (6.00pm Singapore time), wounding one of them. A short while later there were reports of further drive-by shootings in the city.
Right-wing politicians campaigning ahead of next month's vote had leapt on the gruesome death of the teenager Pamela Mastropietro to promote their anti-migrant message.
A preliminary postmortem on the teenager could not immediately identify their cause of death. The Nigerian suspect, who was denied asylum last year but has remained in Italy, has refused to talk to police.
"What was this worm still doing in Italy?" Matteo Salvini, head of the far-right League, wrote on Facebook, accusing the centre-left government of responsibility over Mastropietro's death for allowing migrants to stay in the country.
"The left has blood on its hands," they wrote.
Magistrates say witnesses saw the Nigerian suspect carrying the suitcases that were later found to contain the teenager's body. They also found blood-stained clothes and knives in their possession.
More than 600,000 mainly African migrants have reached Italy by boat over the past four years. The centre-right bloc, which includes the League, says the vast majority have no right to asylum and has promised mass expulsions if it takes power.
Leftist parties have ruled out any such deportations.
"The news from Macerata leaves me horrified and shocked. We must stop this spiral of hate and violence," said Pietro Grasso, who is the head of the Free and Equal party.
YANGON: Myanmar police say they have arrested a mentally ill man who confessed to tossing a petrol bomb into the Yangon compound of de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi this week.
Suu Kyi was not home when the crude bomb landed inside the gate of their lakeside villa on Thursday, causing little damage other than a fire that burned a water pipe.
But the incident unnerved supporters of the Nobel laureate, who championed Myanmar's democratic transition but has suffered a fallout with the international community over their failure to condemn army abuses against Rohingya Muslims.
Using photos taken by a witness of the attack, officers arrested Win Naing, 48, in the early hours of Friday, according to a report posted on Yangon police's official Facebook page.
"He confessed that they took a bottle filled with petrol...and threw it into the compound," the report said, adding that Win Naing does a security job for a construction company.
Police said they believe Win Naing has "mental health problems" but will continue to take legal action against him.

They told officers that they were motivated to throw the bomb because they had been "cursed by magic", the police report said.
Suu Kyi has not commented on the incident, which took place almost exactly one year after the assassination of one of their top legal advisors Ko Ni.
Ko Ni, one of few Muslims to hold a prominent government position in mainly Buddhist Myanmar, was shot in the head as they waited outside Yangon airport while holding their grandson.
The murder horrified the Muslim community and the ruling party in particular in a country where political assassinations are rare.
C-NS girls rout Fulton; Liverpool now 3-0
In basketball, more than in other team sports, a single, special player can elevate the status of everyone else around them, and alter that team's fortunes for the better.
For the Cicero-North Syracuse girls basketball team that saw its eight-year reign as Section III Class AA champions end a season ago, having Amani Free return to the squad after a year at Long Island Lutheran just might trigger another title run.
Without Free, the Northstars were 8-12 a season ago and exited the sectional playoffs in the quarterfinals. With her, and with nearly everyone else back, C-NS is humming again.
For its season opener last Tuesday night, the Northstars visited Fulton and pounded the Red Raiders 72-23, doing most of that damage in the first three quarters as it accumulated a 60-14 advantage.
Free outscored Fulton all by herself, pouring in 27 points, but each of the 10 players that saw action got at least one field goal as Julia Rowe and Isabella Kingsley each had nine points, with Aniah Ingram adding seven points. Mackenzie White and Julianna Vassallo had five points apiece.
C-NS would work for another week before taking on Christian Brothers Academy in Tuesday's home opener and then challenge defending sectional champion West Genesee Friday night.
Meanwhile, Liverpool had plenty of important stuff on its agenda, none more so than its weekend trip to Washington,D.C., where it would take part in the Got Game Classic, a national tournament founded by WNBA great Tina Thompson.
In the opener of that tournament, the Warriors beat Gwynn Park (Maryland) 56-43, overcoming a slow start where it scored just five points in the opening period with a scoring rush just before halftime.
Then, with the issue still in doubt, Liverpool outscored Gwynn Park 20-6 in the fourth quarter, seeing Kyra Grimshaw put up one of the best games of their career, earning 22 points and 11 rebounds.
Jenna Wike had eight points, with Bella Barner adding six points. Barner, Michelle Lonczak (five points) and Marissa Pisegna (four points) all contributed off the bench as Lexi Emmi also got five points.
The only bad part of the trip was that Liverpool could not get in two games, the second one canceled when bad winter weather hit the nation's capital.
Before departing, the Warriors first took on Rome Free Academy last Wednesday night, and put up its second impressive performance in as many games, pulling away to beat the Black Knights 73-44.
Already with an 18-12 lead through one period, Liverpool took charge by outscoring RFA 21-8 the rest of the half. It continued from there, Wike and Grimshaw each hitting on three 3-pointers and earning 17 points apiece.
Supporting them, Amanda Barnell put up 10 points, with Holly Sleeth getting seven points as Victoria Morgan had six points and Lonczak gained five points.

A drunken and disruptive passenger who repeatedly abused staff on a flight from Gatwick to St Lucia has been jailed.
A Sussex Police statement says that Uche Ezedinma had to be physically restrained and caused the Virgin Atlantic aircraft to be diverted due to their persistently poor behaviour.
No passenger or crew should have to experience such abject abuse on board an aircraft
They were verbally and physically aggressive throughout, which included spitting at a member of staff, punching the overhead storage and threatening numerous other cabin crew.
They also smoked a cigarette in the toilet, which is strictly prohibited by airlines.
The statement adds that the 36-year-old had been travelling in the company of their mother, a further 247 passengers and 10 crew members on the Airbus A330 to St Lucia on 28 January 2017.
But less than halfway into the journey, it was diverted to the Azores in Portugal to offload Ezedinma, of Elgin Road, Croydon, Surrey, and continue its journey.
This was due to safety concerns for the aircraft and those on board, and was a decision not taken lightly by the captain – it was the first time in 20 years as a Virgin pilot they had to divert a flight due to passenger behaviour.
Ezedinma was removed from the plane by local officers, and the remaining passengers were required to disembark to enable the plane to refuel – this was as a result of the extra fuel consumed by the diversion, and caused a significant disruption.
Following this, the flight resumed without any further issues, and the incident was reported to Sussex Police.
A protracted enquiry process via Interpol was undertaken to determine what action the Portuguese authorities had taken, and it was confirmed the defendant was allowed on their way after just two hours of administrative paperwork.
Investigators at Gatwick Police conducted an investigation and gained sufficient evidence to present to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), and Ezedinma was subsequently charged with being drunk in an aircraft and negligently acting in a manner likely to endanger an aircraft or any person therein.
At Lewes Crown Court on Tuesday June 26, they were sentenced to a total of 14 months' imprisonment and ordered to pay a £140 victim surcharge.
Detective Sergeant Patrick Sweeney, of Gatwick Investigations, said: “The language, attitude and behaviour displayed by Ezedinma throughout the flight was completely unacceptable. No passenger or crew should have to experience such abject abuse on board an aircraft, and the sentence imposed sends a clear message to others that this sort of behaviour will not be tolerated.
“There are numerous signs on board every aircraft which indicate smoking is strictly prohibited, and Ezedinma blatantly ignored these signs, potentially causing a real danger to the aircraft and those on board.”
In May, Sussex Police launched its annual summer crackdown on disruptive passengers in partnership with Gatwick Airport.
The operation aims to prevent drunken and disruptive behaviour on flights and in the airport through early engagement with passengers.
Det Sgt Sweeney added: “This case demonstrates that while we increase resources for our summer campaign, we will continue to detect and deter disruptive behaviour 365 days and year. It further demonstrates that we will deal robustly with anyone who fails to comply with the law, which is clearly outlined at various locations throughout Gatwick Airport.
“It is an offence to be drunk on board an aircraft, and passengers need to be aware of their own responsibilities before they board a flight. By all means have fun, but don't ruin it for yourself or anyone else.”
A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said: “The safety and security of our customers and crew is always our top priority, and we will not tolerate disruptive or abusive behaviour on board any Virgin Atlantic aircraft.
“We continue to work closely with the relevant authorities and will always seek prosecution for those individuals that cause disruption to our services through unacceptable behaviour.”

“I did call Aaron Judge, he's one of our leaders, as you all know, despite being so young,” Cashman said Monday. “So I remember reaching out to them prior to consummating and just floating the weather balloon.”
Judge quickly put Cashman at ease.
“He said, ‘Hey, I'm pumped. This is exciting. If you could pull that off, that would be amazing,'” Cashman said. “I did want to reach out to them and get a feel from their perspective, and I was excited even more so by their response.”
The Yankees have a potential logjam in right with Stanton, who led the big leagues in home runs (59), runs batted in (132) and slugging percentage (.631) while hitting .281 with a .376 OBP and 1.007 OPS, and Judge, who hit a rookie record 52 homers and slashed .284/.422/.627 with a 1.049 OPS.
“I feel sorry for the baseballs,” Stanton said, referencing a lineup that includes him, Judge, Gary Sanchez and Greg Bird.
As for playing time in right, that has yet to be determined.

Stanton told the Yankees before the trade they would be open to anything from getting the majority of their bats at designated hitter to playing leftfield. That position, of course, is currently occupied by Brett Gardner but a trade involving the veteran clubhouse leader can't be ruled out. Cashman also brought up the possibility of Judge, who played center at Fresno State, occasionally playing there with Stanton in right.
“Clearly rightfield and DH work, but I think they're athletic enough to be considered elsewhere,” Cashman said.
Said Stanton: “I can bounce it around. Wherever they need me I'm OK with that. I always liked DHing when we played the AL teams in previous years.”
Cashman re-ups
Steinbrenner confirmed reports, though not of the numbers, that Cashman has agreed to an extension.
“Without getting into specifics, yes, Cashman is going to stay. I want them to stay and he's going to stay,” Steinbrenner said.
According to FanRag Sports, Cashman's deal is in the range of $25 million over five years.
That would make Cashman among the highest paid executives in the game, though not as high as the Cubs' Theo Epstein, who agreed to a five-year deal in excess of $50 million in September 2016, and the Dodgers' Andrew Friedman, who is in the third year of a five-year contract worth $35 million.
“This is a destination place,” said Cashman, the GM since 1998. “This is a place that I've grown up in. I didn't want to go anywhere . . . especially at this time and place.”
It's official: Bard is bench coach
Aaron Boone made it official that Josh Bard will be their bench coach, Phil Nevin will coach third and Reggie Willits first. They hope to have rest of staff filled out soon, perhaps by week's end. There are indications Mike Harkey will return as the bullpen coach and that Marcus Thames, the assistant hitting coach to Alan Cockrell last season, is in the running for the top spot. Carlos Mendoza, the club's highly regarded minor-league infield coordinator, also could be added to the staff.

A great-grandmother is trapped in a hospital in Mexico with a £50,000 hospital bill after a mix-up with their holiday insurance.
Joyce Kettle, 74, was on a luxury cruise to Cuba, Jamaica and Mexico with pal Anne Henderson and their son, John, when tragedy struck.
After leaving the port near Mexico, Joyce began suffering from severe breathing difficulties.
The widow was then airlifted to a hospital in Cozumel, a holiday island near Cancun, and underwent a heart operation on Monday, which required three stents.
 They are now recovering in hospital but their insurance, issued through a bank account, does not cover them treatment.
Joyce mistakenly believed it was worldwide holiday insurance policy but in fact it is only for European trips.
It means Joyce, from Blyth, Northumberland, has been left with a medical bill standing at $72,662 - equivalent to £51,212 - plus doctors' fees.

Les Chrisp, partner of Joyce's youngest daughter Leanne, said the family is desperate to get them home.
“The family is a wreck at the moment and it has been horrific because there has been such a lack of communication,” they told the Newcastle Chronicle.
“We got the news at 3am on Monday but didn't hear anything official until 9pm. For 18 hours we didn't know if they were dead or alive.
“The family and the kids have been a mess and we feel completely powerless.”
Joyce's family is now trying to raise money towards medical costs and the price of flying them home.
Writing on a Gofundme page they said: "We're a proud family and never anticipated having to do anything like this but we really need your help, no matter how small it is, as we simply don't know how else we'll get my mam back to us!"
Joyce has three children, six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren, and is a retired care home assistant.
Builder Les, 38, said: “She lives for family and they eat, sleeps and dreams the kids.
“She is at their happiest when they are with the family. They come over all the time and doesn't like sitting in the house on their own.”

Already, friends and loved ones have raised thousands of pounds but the family fear the price of getting them back to the North East could spiral.
Les said: “We're gobsmacked that people have been so generous. People haven't got a clue who we are, it's incredible.
“Joyce is really well known in the area and everyone knows them face. We've had so much support.”

President Donald Trump welcomed French President Emmanuel Macron to the White House Tuesday, but the president of women who wear cowboy boots with their swimsuits doesn't seem to understand that other world leaders are not auditioning for The Apprentice and therefore aren't looking for jobs, and they aren't their minions nor their offspring, so they don't expect to be fussed over.
During a photo op with Macron, President Dicky Von FuckIsYouDoingSon was spouting off about the “special relationship” they have with the French president.
“We do have a very special relationship,” Trump said as they and Macron posed for photographs in the Oval Office, Yahoo reports. “In fact, I'll get that little piece of dandruff off ... We have to make them perfect.  They are perfect.”
We get it. Trump and Macron have a bromance. It's been widely talked about. They are brotastic. They eat guacabrole while drinking brotein shakes and listening to Selena Bromez sing “Brohemian Rhapsody.” Macron is often referred to as the Trump whisperer for their ability to get Trump to listen.

But dude, presidential Trump dude, did you really have to take dandruff off your boo's shoulder in front of God and er'body? I mean, seriously—while America knows the president to be an utter embarrassment, it's worse when they take their cringeworthy behavior to global levels.
Watch the awkwardness below.
New Delhi: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Member of Parliament from Western Uttar Pradesh's Kairana, Hukum Singh passed away in a hospital in Greater Noida on Saturday evening.
Hukum Singh, who had won the 2014 Lok Sabha election with a massive margin, had been suffering from an illness for the last few months. Parliament proceedings will be cancelled on Monday to pay condolences to the deceased Member of Parliament. They were 79 years old at the time of their death.
While the full details of Singh's illness are yet to emerge, highly-placed BJP source said they had been suffering for the last three months. “He was unwell for three months, but it wasn't that bad until last month. For the last 20 days or so, they have been bedridden and was struggling to hold on. Even though they had kept themselves healthy for most of their life, age seems to have caught up,” said one BJP leader.
Born in Shamli district's Kairana, which they went on to represent in the Lok Sabha, Hukum Singh started practising law in the nearby city of Muzaffarnagar in 1969. By 1974, they entered active politics and became a Member of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly (MLA) after contesting on a Congress ticket. In the 1990s, they switched from Congress to the BJP and got elected to the UP assembly on a BJP ticket in 1996. Hukum Singh quickly rose up the ranks of politics due the massive support they enjoyed from Western UP's sugarcane farmers. In 2014, when Modi wave swept through Uttar Pradesh, Hukum Singh was elected as the Member of Parliament from their hometown. Their followers affectionately referred to them as ‘Babu Sahab'.
Hours after their death, Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted their condolences and said, “Anguished by the demise of MP and veteran leader from Uttar Pradesh, Shri Hukum Singh Ji. They served the people of UP with great diligence and worked for the welfare of farmers. My thoughts are with their family and supporters in this hour of grief.”

Myanmar authorities opened an investigation into the abuse of Rohingya Muslims by security forces after a video showing police officers beating and kicking villagers went viral over the weekend, state media reported.
The selfie-style film was shot by a member of the border guard police on November 5 during “clearance operations” in Kotankauk village, northern Rakhine state, the state counsellor's office said in a press release cited in state media.
Three officers responsible for beating villagers were identified and more were under investigation, the press release said.
“Now, according to the initial reports, three police officers were detained,” Zaw Htay, chief government spokesperson, told DPA news agency on Monday. “We have rules and regulations for police … They will be punished according to that police law.”
The video, which contains images some viewers may find distressing, shows police hitting a young boy around the head as they walk to where dozens of villagers are lined up in rows seated on the ground, hands behind their heads.
Three officers in uniform then start attacking one of the sitting men, beating them with a stick and kicking them repeatedly in the face.
A Rohingya activist contacted by AFP news agency said the footage had been verified by a refugee from the nearby camp, Shilkhali.
Myanmar security forces have been accused of extreme violence during security sweeps of villages throughout northern Rakhine, near the country's western border, following deadly attacks on police in October.
Thousands of Rohingya have since fled across the border into Bangladesh.

New Delhi: The Siri Fort Indoor Stadium witnessed a disastrous couple of rounds at the India Open as a host of Indian shuttlers crashed out after disappointing performances. Kidambi Srikanth, HS Prannoy, Saina Nehwal, Parupalli Kashyap, B Sai Praneeth, Ashwini Ponnappa and Satwiksairaj Rankireddy couldn't reach the semi-finals of the $350,000 event. The only luxury left for the Indian fans is watching PV Sindhu and the mixed doubles pair of Sikki Reddy and Pranaav Jerry Chopra compete in the semi-finals of the India Open.
After a straight-game loss to compatriot Saina Nehwal at the Indonesia Masters last week, Sindhu has managed to deliver stellar performances in the opening two rounds in India before being stretched to three games in the quarter-final on Friday. During their 21-10, 21-13 victory over Natalia Koch Rhode, Sindhu was not troubled by the Dane's attack as they had little difficulty in advancing. The 22-year-old replicated the same display against Bulgaria's Linda Zetchiri to register a comfortable 21-10, 21-14 win.
Against World No 35 Beatriz Corrales, Sindhu was made to pay for losing focus in the second game. After the mid-game break of the opening game, the Hyderabad-born shuttler relied on their forehand smashes to take a 1-0 lead. However, Corrales made a fine comeback with a flurry of classy wrist strokes to send alarm bells ringing in Sindhu's camp. It was in the third game when Sindhu made full use of their range and reach to send the Spaniard packing and set up a mouth-watering clash with third seed Ratchanok Intanon.
The Thai shuttle queen, who replaced Sindhu as World No 3 in the latest BWF rankings, has had a far better outing than the Indian so far in the tournament. To begin with, they thrashed left-handed Rasika Raje 21-4, 21-6 in just 22 minutes before sending yet another Indian Aakarshi Kashyap packing 21-11, 21-12 in the second round. Before the match, one would have assumed that the quarter-final clash between a real contest between Intanon and seventh seed Yip Pui Yin, but the Thai ace swept Yip aside with a 21-11, 21-11 victory.
Hence, the semi-final tie against Intanon will be Sindhu's first big challenge of the 2018 season. In other words, Sindhu is yet to play a top-class player in this season. On the contrary, Intanon has gathered the much-needed momentum at the start of the year by beating World No 1 Tai Tzu Ying to take the season-opener Malaysia Masters home and reaching the semi-finals of the Indonesia Masters last week.
What also gives Intanon a slight edge over Sindhu is the fact that they will be playing in their third straight semi-final of 2018 in a span of 20 days. There's no question about the World No 3's mental strength going into the tie. Intanon leads 4-2 in the overall head-to-head meetings with Sindhu but that isn't a worry for the latter having beaten them in straight games at the Hong Kong Open in November. So, Sindhu may them have task cut out in passing the Intanon test but their on-court awareness and steely gameplay could prove pivotal in their bid for a spot in their second straight India Open final.
Meanwhile, the other Indians playing on the day will be Reddy and Chopra, who have clicked well in the last couple of years. The eight-seed pair squares off against Christinna Pedersen and Mathias Christiansen of Denmark.
While the Sikki and Pranaav have shown quality attacking and court coverage in the three rounds so far, Pedersen and Christiansen have been patient in their style of play. This is the first time these two pairs will to compete against each other, making the match even more interesting. “Things are going well for us. Tan (Kim Her) coach has helped us a lot since they have come and I'm happy with the results,” said Chopra. “We just need to play our game tomorrow and against a strong Danish pair,” they added.
There will be pressure on the Indian duo to live up to the expectations but it would be interesting to see whether the crowd support can make things easy for them.
WASHINGTON (AP) — After more than a week of partisan bickering and social media-fueled buildup, the #releasethememo crowd got their wish.
President Donald Trump declassified it. The GOP majority of the House intelligence committee released it. And the public dissection of the four-page, GOP-authored document began.
Here are a few key takeaways:
What's the gist?
The memo makes a series of allegations of misconduct on the part of the FBI and the Justice Department in obtaining a warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, to monitor former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page.
READ MORE: Read the controversial Nunes memo released despite warnings from U.S. officials
Specifically, it takes aim at the FBI's use of information from a former British spy, Christopher Steele, who compiled a collection of memos containing several allegations of ties between Trump, their associates and Russia.
The memo says the FBI and the Justice Department didn't tell the FISA court enough about Steele's role in an opposition research effort. The research was funded by Democrat Hillary Clinton through a Washington law firm.
The document also takes aim at several senior FBI and Justice Department officials. Among them is former Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr, who it says knew of Steele's anti-Trump leanings and whose wife worked at the firm behind the opposition research effort.
What's new?
The memo provides the first formal government confirmation of the secret FISA warrant and that Page was the person being monitored.
Information like that is ordinarily considered among the most tightly held national security information, and it almost never gets released to the public.
WATCH: Trump declassifies memo alleging FBI misconduct, calls it ‘terrible'
Though the memo takes issue with the FBI's methods, it also confirms that the FBI and Justice Department believed there was probable cause that Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power and a judge agreed — four times over.
The memo fills in the timeline of the Russia investigation, showing that Page was under surveillance for months.
According to the memo, the Justice Department and FBI obtained the FISA warrant on Page on Oct. 21, 2016, and then had it reauthorized three additional times.
Given that FISA warrants must be renewed every 90 days, the memo indicates that the government monitored Page's communications for nearly a year.
It started with Papadopoulos?
The whole Russia investigation, that is.
According to the memo, information about former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos “triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016.”
That's significant because Trump and their allies in the GOP have tried to undermine the Russia investigation by saying it all stems from the Steele dossier.
WATCH: Trump agrees to release FBI memo following State of the Union speech
But the memo confirms reporting by The New York Times late last year that FBI concerns about Papadopoulos started the investigation.
Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI last year. Court papers show they had several contacts with people representing themselves as being tied to the Russian government starting in the spring of 2016.
Court papers show that Papadopoulos learned the Russians had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails” prior to that information becoming public.
The FBI did use information from Steele, though
The memo says Steele's collection of reports “formed an essential part” of the FISA application for Page, but it doesn't specify exactly what information was used or how much.
It also says that the FISA application relied on a September 2016 Yahoo News article, and claims that the information in the article also came from Steele.
The document quotes former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe as telling the House intelligence committee in December that “no surveillance warrant would have been sought” from the FISA court “without the Steele dossier information.”
According to the memo, the application also included “Steele's past record of credible reporting on other unrelated matters.”
No underlying information released
The accuracy of the memo is hard to assess because the majority of the underlying contents are classified or confidential.
The memo cites an initial FISA warrant application — a document which usually has dozens of pages — as well as three additional renewals by the court. None of those documents are public.
READ MORE: Devin Nunes didn't read the documents referenced in their memo about FBI, Trump
The same is true of the transcripts of the committee's closed-door interviews with McCabe and other senior FBI officials who had contact with Steele.
On Friday, the committee's ranking Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, took issue with the memo's characterization of McCabe's comments, saying the former FBI deputy director was speaking generally about how any FISA application relies on “each and every component” included.
But the committee's chairperson, Rep. Devin Nunes of California, said late Friday on Fox News the description of McCabe's comments is “a summation of a long interview and that's definitely what they said.” They noted that other witnesses have said “similar things.”
‘Minimally corroborated'
It's been a burning question ever since the dossier was published by Buzzfeed News last year: How much did the FBI corroborate?
According to the memo, not much at the time the FBI obtained the FISA warrant on Page. The memo cites FBI Assistant Director Bill Priestap as saying FBI corroboration of the dossier was in its “infancy” when the court authorized the first FISA warrant.
READ MORE: Republican Sen. Jeff Flake slams Trump's decision to release memo alleging FBI misconduct
It also says an “independent unit” in the FBI conducted a “source validation report” on Steele's reporting and found it “only minimally corroborated.”
But without the underlying documents or transcripts of Priestap's testimony, it's hard to judge the accuracy of the memo's description.
Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike does not expect their new conservative party to pick a candidate for prime minister during the campaign for the Oct. 22 election, leaving the door open to eventually backing a lawmaker from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's party.
TOKYO: Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike does not expect their new conservative party to pick a candidate for prime minister during the campaign for the Oct. 22 election, leaving the door open to eventually backing a lawmaker from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's party.
Koike's new Party of Hope has emerged as a serious challenge to Abe's Liberal Democratic Party supporter base, but they have said they would not personally contest the election.
Abe called the snap election last month in hopes their ruling bloc would keep its majority in parliament's lower house, where it now has a two-thirds "super" majority.
Losing a simple majority would be a major unexpected upset, but a poor performance by the LDP could put pressure on Abe to step down.
Asked in an interview published on Saturday by the Asahi newspaper whether Koike's party would pick a candidate for premier from its own ranks during the election, they replied: "Basically, no."
The campaign kicks off formally on Oct. 11.

Koike, 65, a former defence minister and ex-member of Abe's LDP, told Reuters on Friday that all options were on the table regarding whom their party would back when parliament convenes to vote on a prime minister after the election.
"We need to see the results (of the election). We must protect this country and at the same time, we must change it," Koike told Reuters.
"We will decide after the election after confirming the trend in which our Party of Hope can achieve this."
In the interview with the Asahi, Koike praised former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba, whom they backed in a 2012 LDP leadership race won by Abe, and lauded Internal Affairs Minister Seiko Noda for their work on behalf of handicapped people.
Ishiba has criticised Abe on several fronts including their proposal to revise the post-war constitution's pacifist Article 9 by clarifying the status of the military. Ishiba says Abe's proposal does not go far enough.
Noda has said they want to run in the next LDP leadership race when Abe's current term expires in September 2018.

Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State, on Friday, lauded the Federal Government for renaming the Federal University, Ndufu Alike Ikwo in the state after Dr Alex Ekwueme.
Vice-President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, announced the renaming on Friday at Oko, Anambra State during the burial of Ekwueme, who was Vice-President of Nigeria between 1979 and 1983.
HOsinbajo said the renaming has already been approved by President Muhammadu Buhari, who said Ekwueme was being honoured for their contributions to national development.
But reacting on the development, Gov Umahi described it as a welcome development and part of their administration educational policy.
In a statement signed by their Chief Press Secretary, Emmanuel Uzor, the governor commended the federal government for appreciating their educational policy and rewarding same by renaming a federal government university in the state after a sage and former Vice President of Nigeria, Dr Alex Ekwueme.
They said that their administration has been at the forefront for Igbo integration into the national politics where Ndigbo would be fully recognized as part of the development of Nigeria.
The Governor who is also the Chairman of the South East Governors' Forum also described the late Ekwueme as a detribalized Nigerian who committed everything towards the development of democracy in the country.
Ekwueme who died late last year was buried on Friday at Oko, their hometown. They ran for President several times but was particularly credited with the idea of the creation of six geopolitical zones in Nigeria when they were a member of the National Constitutional Conference in 2005 during the regime of General Sani Abacha.
They confronted Abacha with the formation of the G-34, when the late dictator tried to run as life president. G-34 metamorphosed into the People's Democratic Party (PDP), which took over power in 1999 when the present republic was inaugurated.
A well-educated person, the late Ekwueme trained and qualified as an architect, a sociologist and a lawyer. They attended the prestigious King's College, Lagos before travelling abroad to pursue university education. They founded the Federal Polytechnic, Oko, Anambra State and set up a foundation that offered thousands of scholarships to people from the Old Aguata region.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Monday it approved Sanofi SA's Admelog as the first follow-on biologic version of Eli Lilly and Co's fast-acting insulin, Humalog.
REUTERS: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Monday it approved Sanofi SA's Admelog as the first follow-on biologic version of Eli Lilly and Co's fast-acting insulin, Humalog.
Admelog, generally taken just before meals, was approved for use in children older than three and adults with type 1 diabetes, as well as adults with type 2 diabetes.
Like Humalog, which earned Lilly US$696.2 million in the latest quarter, the short-acting drug helps diabetics control blood sugar levels after eating.
Additionally, diabetics may need a long-acting insulin treatment to prevent blood sugar levels from fluctuating through the day.
Patients with type 1 diabetes require both types of insulin, while those with type 2 may not need a short-acting insulin.
Admelog's approval bolsters Sanofi's position in the diabetes treatment market after its blockbuster drug Lantus, a long-acting insulin, lost U.S. patent rights in 2015.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India likely retained the position of world's fastest growing major economy in the January-March quarter, surpassing China's growth of 6.8 percent, driven by gains in manufacturing and consumer spending.
The median in a Reuters poll on the latest quarter's annual growth was 7.3 percent, the best pace since July-September 2016, the quarter before the government unexpectedly scrapped high-value currency notes.
Forecasts for January-March ranged from 6.9 to 7.7 percent.
The government will release GDP data on Thursday around 1200 GMT. On Monday, Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg said growth in Asia's third largest economy was expected to grow 7.3-7.5 percent.
The data, combined with April's higher annual inflation pace of 4.58 percent, could put pressure on the Reserve Bank of India to raise interest rates next week after keeping them on hold for a fourth straight meeting last month.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is expected to seek a second term in 2019 general elections, has launched a nation-wide goods and services tax and allowed foreign investment in defence and e-commerce businesses to boost economic growth.
However, a botched implementation of the GST nearly scuttled India's growth prospects in the near term.
Economists said a rise in capital investment growth to near 9 percent in the last quarter of the 2017/18 fiscal year compared with 2.4 percent a year earlier indicated a pick-up in the private investments.
Yet banking credit, a main source for corporate borrowing, remained weak following a surge in bad loans, as banks have been reluctant to extend new loans. The 21 state lenders hold two-thirds of banking assets, and accounted for the bulk of the record $150 billion of soured loans in the banking sector in 2017.
Consumption, which accounts for nearly 70 percent of the $2.5 trillion economy likely remained firm, supporting economic growth as reflected in the higher sales of consumer durables and vehicles.
"Corporate sector results and the industrial production readings have been better than expected. Hence, the industrial sector could pull the GDP growth number up," said Tushar Arora, senior economist with HDFC Bank.
Growth is likely to get a boost from monsoon rains, which hit the southern state of Kerala a few days earlier than normal, potentially brightening the outlook for agricultural output.
RISING OIL PRICES
The biggest risk India faces is rising crude oil prices , which this month hit $80 a barrel, their highest since 2014.
India meets 80 percent of its oil needs from imports.
Prices of diesel and petrol surged to a record high last week, stoking opposition criticism of Modi's administration.
Higher oil prices have already pressured the rupee , near a record low last week and Asia's worst performer.
"Rising oil prices can weigh on the consumer demand and lead to higher borrowing costs for the government," Arora of HDFC Bank said.
The government's Economic Survey, issued in January, estimated that every $10 per barrel rise in global oil prices cuts growth by 0.2-0.3 percentage points.
Still, some analysts expect India's economy to grow more than 7 percent in 2018/19, helped by a normal monsoon and a pick-up in private investment.
The International Monetary Fund expects economic growth could reach 7.4 percent in 2018/19.
An Indian Finance Ministry official told CNBC on Monday that estimated growth in the last fiscal year, which ended on March 31, was 6.7 percent, below 2016/17's pace of 7.1 percent.

The Federal Executive Council (FEC) has ratified the automatic exchange of information between Nigeria and other countries, in its pursuit of tax defaulters.
Chairman of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Mr Babatunde Fowler, disclosed this to State House correspondents on Wednesday after a session at the FEC meeting which held in Abuja.
They were optimistic that the agreement would boost the fight against defaulters and improve the country's revenue.
Mr Fowler added that it would also ensure that Nigerians who have investments or businesses overseas and receive income abroad pay their taxes as and when due.
They further briefed reporters about the Voluntary Assets Income Declaration Scheme (VAIDS) policy of the government.
The FIRS boss noted that those who refused to take advantage of the grace given by the scheme which expired at the end of June would be made to pay their taxes alongside the required penalties.
President Muhammadu Buhari presided over the FEC meeting which commenced at about 11:00 am and was attended by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.
Also in attendance are Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, and the Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami.
Other ministers present are Kemi Adeosun (Finance), Babatunde Fashola (Power, Works, and Housing), Udo Udoma (Budget and National Planning), and Chris Ngige (Labour and Employment), among others.

Associated Press
NEW YORK (AP) - Harvey Weinstein was indicted Wednesday on rape and criminal sex act charges, furthering the first criminal case to arise from a slate of sexual misconduct allegations against the former movie mogul.
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said the indictment brings Weinstein "another step closer to accountability" for alleged attacks on two women in New York.
Weinstein's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said they would "vigorously defend" against the indictment and ask a court to dismiss it. They called the allegations "unsupported" and reiterated that Weinstein strongly denies them.
The indictment came hours after Weinstein's lawyer said the film producer would decline to testify before the grand jury because there wasn't enough time to prepare them and "political pressure" made an indictment unavoidable.
"Regardless of how compelling Mr. Weinstein's personal testimony might be, an indictment was inevitable due to the unfair political pressure being placed on Cy Vance to secure a conviction of Mr. Weinstein," the statement said.
Weinstein, 66, learned of the specific charges and the accusers' identities only after turning themselves on Friday, according to their lawyers. Brafman said that with a deadline set for Wednesday afternoon for Weinstein to testify or not, prosecutors denied their request for more time.
Vance said the Weinstein camp's "recent assault on the integrity of the survivors and the legal process is predictable."
"We are confident that when the jury hears the evidence, it will reject these attacks out of hand," Vance said in a statement.
Weinstein was charged Friday with raping one woman and committing a criminal sex act by compelling oral sex from another. A grand jury continued hearing evidence in the case, as it had been doing for weeks.
Defendants have the right to testify in a grand jury's secret proceedings but often don't, for various reasons.
Freed on $1 million bail and electronic monitoring, they are due back in court July 30, though that date may now be moved up in light of the indictment.
Beyond the two women involved in the case, dozens more women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct ranging from harassment to assault in various locales.
They have denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex, and Brafman said Tuesday that Weinstein was "confident he's going to clear their name" in the New York prosecution.
Brafman called the rape allegation "absurd," saying that the accuser and Weinstein had a decade-long, consensual sexual relationship that began before and continued after the alleged 2013 attack.
The woman, who hasn't been identified publicly, told investigators that Weinstein confined them in a hotel room and raped them
The other accuser in the case, former actor Lucia Evans, has gone public with their account of Weinstein forcing them to perform oral sex at their office in 2004. The Associated Press does not identify alleged victims of sexual assaults unless they come forward publicly.
Vance, a Democrat, came under public pressure from women's groups to prosecute Weinstein after declining to do so in 2015, when an Italian model went to police to say Weinstein had groped them during a meeting.
Police set up a sting in which the woman recorded themselves confronting Weinstein and them apologizing for their conduct. But Vance decided there wasn't enough evidence to bring charges.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo, also a Democrat, ordered the state attorney general to investigate how Vance handled that matter.

I grew up with a mother with a best friend who is a transgender and has a cleft lip. At four years old, I did not understand who a “transgender” was and what a “cleft clip” was. What I understood then was that Ats is a fun-loving human being who was regarded as a family member.
That was the only name I knew: Ats.
I cannot remember a time when Ats was not referred as a “she” at home. They were always a. They would visit us every other afternoon in their full dancing attire and they would tell my mother stories of their adventures. They fashioned an unconventional “big hair,” a tamed version of Cebuano singer's Anna Fegi's crowning glory.
ADVERTISEMENT
Ats fascinated me.
When they were around, there was overflowing joy around me. My aunts gathered in the living room to listen to their adventures and misadventures. They were generous in sharing their mistakes and gracious in giving out pieces of advice.
They were a dance instructor. I do not know where they worked exactly. What I am sure about was that they choreographed dances and taught people how to dance.
In moments when they were starting to share about their search for love, I recall my mother telling me to go out and play. I could hear them laughing and giggling from afar. I was disappointed that I did not hear that part of Ats' sharing. I was already a journalist at four years old, restless to know the stories of people.
Ats convinced my mother to join an inter-barangay dance contest, which my young mother (only 22 years old that time) agreed to be part of. It was the early '90s, a trophy for bragging rights and a minimal cash prize were at stake.
For the most part, I knew they joined for friendship and fun. Mama, Ats and two other friends rehearsed every afternoon on the week leading to the contest date. During those practices, I stood in a corner, observing, listening, laughing. I like Ats. They painted the whole house with a rainbow of colors every time they walked in. Them confidence was infectious. Them dancing was effortless.
In our small village, their presence in our house was quite controversial. I first heard the words bayot and bungi from the neighbors and the neighbors' kids who were my playmates.
They were essentially relatives. But I did not like some of them especially during the first time I heard and saw them teasing Ats.
“Abnormal! Malasa! Bayot na bungi pa,” they said.
Ats must have been so used to people telling them all sorts of negative things because they just smiled a faint, sad smile. My mother, the loyal best friend, came to Ats' defense whenever they were around.
Over time, Ats' visits in our home became more frequent that their presence was later accepted by the surrounding neighbors.
One day, they disappeared.
Mama said they went to Japan for work. I'm not sure if my mother received a call or a letter from Ats, but the last bit of news which reached us about them was their complaint on how expensive Japanese rice is and how they work two jobs a night to earn enough money to save up and go home to Cebu.
I've been asking my mother about Ats, but it seemed like they could not trace them whereabouts. We do not know if they came home from Japan. Did they find the love of their life? Did they come home to Cebu? Did they learn to love Japanese rice?
The answers to these questions would have to wait until I meet them again.
In college, I became part of a group called Ligaya (Liberation for Gay Advocates) and I gained great friends from the organization. Several times, I was asked if I were lesbian because of the kind of friends that I have. My friends answered for me: “Babayeng bayot na sya working on a Master's Degree in Gay Lingo.”
I have more friends from the LGBTQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Queer) community than “straight” people. I suspect that Ats and their presence in my childhood days has a lot to do with the love that I have for my gay friends. I also suspect that my love for them was greatly influenced by the way my mother, my aunts and my family treated Ats. I suspect that in my previous life, I was a transgender with a big hair wearing their full-dancing attire.
This is why I take offense when I still hear broadcasters say “talawan kaayo mura'g bayot.” Just yesterday, I reprimanded a Grab Car driver who was talking to their friend on radio who said: “Hinaya modangan anang imong makina, mura'g bayot!” Or when I still hear people saying, “Nag-uwan na pud. Naa gyud ni bayot.”
This society still has a lot of growing up to do in terms of tolerance and acceptance. For now, let it be known that I am not part of the group who disrespects the rainbow flag.
I have nothing but love, respect and admiration for the rainbow.
Defending champion Chris Froome said they were relieved to be able to pursue a fifth Tour de France title after being cleared by cycling's governing body of any wrongdoing in a doping case.
REUTERS: Defending champion Chris Froome said they were relieved to be able to pursue a fifth Tour de France title after being cleared by cycling's governing body of any wrongdoing in a doping case.
On Monday, the case was dropped by UCI following an investigation after excessive levels of asthma drug Salbutamol was found in Froome's urine sample during last September's Vuelta a Espana.

Froome won the Giro d'Italia in May while the investigation was still going on, and the Tour organisers had sought to block their registration prior to the long-awaited verdict.
"Now I just want to draw a line in the sand and move on," the 33-year-old told a news conference. "My aim is to win and go for a Tour-Giro double.
"Doing the Tour de France and the Vuelta (a Espana) last year taught me an amazing amount about how to manage my training... But really I can't make a prediction about how it's going to go."
Froome believes they have nothing to fear from the French public, after UCI president David Lappartient called for a safe environment for the British rider during the race.

"I just raced the Giro in May with the Salbutamol thing hanging over me, and nothing happened there," Froome added.
"In terms of safety I obviously would encourage fans of the sport to come watch the race, and if you are not necessarily a Chris Froome fan or a Sky fan, come to the race and put a jersey on of another team you do support. That would be my advice."
Team Sky boss Dave Brailsford praised Froome's strength of character during the doping investigation.
"Chris has shown great strength and integrity while also maintaining their form. They won the Giro under those conditions," they said.
"This is not the first time where there has been this feeling (against the team). We have to focus on our race."
The 105th edition of the Tour begins in Noirmoutier-en-l'Ile on Saturday.

Days after apologising to Shiromani Akali Dal leader Bikram Singh Majithia, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday tendered apologies to BJP leader Nitin Gadkari and Congress leader Kapil Sibal's son Amit, in an apparent effort to escape the slew of defamation cases from their political opponents.
Both Gadkari and Sibal accepted the apology, and said they will submit applications in the court to request withdrawal of their respective cases.
Even after the withdrawal of these cases, Kejriwal and other Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders currently face 20-odd civil and criminal defamation cases in various courts in Delhi, Varanasi, Amethi, Punjab, Guwahati, Mumbai and Goa, most of which require personal appearances.
"In tendering an apology to Majithia, and with indications that they would be doing the same in all defamation cases, is Arvind Kejriwal saying that they are no longer a political challenger and is part of status quo? Or is they making a decision not to get trapped into the politics of bullying-by-defamation that will drain their time, money and attention?
While every political observer would have to decide this for themselves, Kejriwal seems to have made up their mind: that they will live to fight another day and to use their political energy to battle vested interests rather than caught into their trap of a draining politics of bullying-by-defamation. The people most upset by this move would be those who thought they could ring-fence them by occupying them in courtroom battles instead of political ones," senior AAP member Atishi Marlena wrote.
Here are some of the defamation cases against the chief minister and their party that are yet to be resolved:
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley
Jaitley filed a Rs 10-crore defamation suit against Kejriwal and AAP leaders Raghav Chadha, Kumar Vishwas, Ashutosh, Sanjay Singh and Deepak Bajpai for accusing them of the irregularities, and has denied all the allegations. A civil defamation case was filed in the Delhi High Court, and a criminal defamation case was filed at a lower court in Delhi. A separate case of defamation was also filed against Kejriwal after remarks that Ram Jethmalani — Kejriwal's former lawyer — made during the trial.
In February, the Delhi High Court directed Kejriwal to wind up the cross-examination of Arun Jaitley by 12th of the month.
Subhash Chandra, Rajya Sabha MP
The Delhi High Court in December 2017 exempted Kejriwal from personal appearance before a trial court in a criminal defamation case filed by Rajya Sabha MP and Essel Group Chairman Subhash Chandra.
Chandra had sought Kejriwal's prosecution for allegedly defaming them by levelling false allegations in the wake of demonetisation. Chandra had said in their petition that Kejriwal made "false, fabricated and defamatory allegations" against them while addressing a press conference on 11 November 2016. Chandra sought Kejriwal's prosecution under Section 500 (defamation) of the Indian Penal Code.
Ramesh Bidhuri, BJP MP
Bidhuri had filed a criminal defamation case, alleging that Kejriwal had falsely claimed in a television interview that Bidhuri was not being arrested even though there were serious cases pending against him. In 2016, a court granted exemption from personal appearance to the Delhi chief minister.
Bidhuri told the court that Kejriwal's defamatory statements had maligned their image.
Ankit Bhardwaj, BJP youth leader
Ankit Bhardwaj, a state executive member of Bharatiya Janta Yuva Morcha (BJYM), had filed a criminal defamation petition against Kejriwal and AAP spokesperson Sanjay Singh, claiming they were wrongly projected as the person who had assaulted former minister Kapil Mishra.
The plea said that due to the publication of "false and defamatory" remarks and statements of Kejriwal and Singh, the reputation of Bhardwaj has been tarnished in the minds of party leaders, relatives, friends and public at large, whosoever has seen the news.
The remarks were "deliberately made with a malafide intention" to defame the plaintiff and it was also "re-tweeted by defendant No 2 (Kejriwal) from their Twitter account," it said.
Pawan Khera, former political secretary to Sheila Dikshit
In the first defamation case against Kejriwal, then political secretary to former Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit, filed a defamation suit for alleged “derogatory remarks” in connection with the increase in power tariffs, during protests in 2012.
Khera had earlier sent a legal notice to Kejriwal, asking them to withdraw the remarks they had made against Dikshit (Kejriwal referred to them as a dalal). They alleged that the remarks were intended to "maliciously defame the chief minister and thus all those working in close proximity with her". After Kejriwal refused to withdraw the statements, Khera went ahead with the legal proceedings.

The Presidency on Monday said the private sector will play an advisory role in the National Food Security Council recently announced by President Muhammadu Buhari.
The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, disclosed this in a statement made available to journalists in Abuja.
Shehu said everybody would be carried along by the council that would be inaugurated on Monday.
They said the clarification was necessary in view of reservations expressed by groups that felt left out after the composition was announced.
The presidential spokesperson said, “The Presidency wishes to affirm that the private sector will play an advisory role in the National Food Security Council recently announced by President Muhammadu Buhari.
“The President is aware of the huge interest indicated by the private sector since the composition of the Council was announced, as well as the reservations expressed by groups that felt left out.
“We wish to emphasise that the Council constituted by the President was more of a think tank that would focus mainly on policy, while various groups from the private sector would be called upon to make sectoral presentations from time to time.
“Everybody will be carried along as the Council will work closely with all stakeholders.”
“The Council will be inaugurated by President Buhari on Monday, March 26.”
Shehu had on Friday announced that the council which Buhari will personally chair has the governors of Kebbi, Taraba, Plateau, Lagos, Ebonyi and Delta States as members.
According to him, other members of the council are the Secretary to the Government of the Federation; the Chief of Staff to the President; the National Security Adviser and seven ministers.

"Non-Singtel and StarHub customers will be able to subscribe and catch World Cup 2018 on Mediacorp's Toggle platform for the first time," the regulator said. "In addition, nine matches will also be made available for everyone to enjoy on Singapore's Free-To-Air TV channels."
HOW TO WATCH
Mediacorp said consumers can subscribe to Toggle's FIFA World Cup Russia Pass to catch all 64 matches live and on demand, without having to sign a contract or have a set-top box. The price includes a free six-month Toggle Prime plan.
Alternatively, they can sign on for a 24-month Toggle Prime plan at S$159 and add on the World Cup Pass at S$79.90. The pass will also give them access to a comprehensive World Cup site offering insights like team profiles, player information, the latest scores, rankings and match highlights.
The broadcaster said it will produce a studio show "capturing all the action and drama of the World Cup", which will be shown on the three broadcasters' channels every match night. The show will feature extended live feeds from the stadium and analyses of key moments with soccer personalities pre-match, at half-time and post-match.
Parts of the presentation will be enhanced with augmented reality, it added.
“Mediacorp is truly excited about bringing all the action and stories of the FIFA World Cup to Singapore audiences,” said CEO Tham Loke Kheng.
Singtel, too, revealed that customers signing up or re-contracting Singtel TV Trio, Variety or Value Pack on a 24-month contract can watch this year's World Cup for free. They can also catch the matches on the companion Go mobile app, which offers the consumer the TV packages they had signed up for.
Alternatively, they can subscribe to the standalone World Cup Pass and watch it on the telco's Cast mobile app, it said.
“Having brought the FIFA World Cup to viewers since 2010, we know how important the tournament is to Singaporeans. We are pleased this year to work with our broadcast partners to give all Singaporeans front row seats to the Cup," said Mr Yuen Kuan Moon, CEO of Consumer Singapore at Singtel.
StarHub also has two options for accessing this year's competition: One on its StarHub TV platform, and another on its mobile-centric StarHub Go.
A spokesperson clarified that StarHub Go is available to non-StarHub Mobile customers too, but the telco's postpaid mobile customers who subscribe to the mobile app will be able to stream the matches with no local data charge.
“With matchday one quickly approaching, we are happy to put public interest first and take to the field together with Singtel and Mediacorp to enable all of Singapore to enjoy the beautiful game," said outgoing CEO Tan Tong Hai.
A California couple ensnared in a twisted nightmare right out of the blockbuster smash Gone Girl have broken their silence.
Denise Huskins was kidnapped from their boyfriend's home in Vallejo, Calif., in March 2015.
But when their boyfriend alerted cops about the crime, they became suspicious and told them they thought they were the killer.
They later apologized when the 32-year-old was found in Huntington Beach two days later.
In a chilling interview with Good Morning America, Huskins' now-fiance Aaron Quinn admitted that the two were traumatized by the kidnapping, and never once thought about seeking media attention to advertise the whole Gone Girl scenario.
“They're the one who made it strange,” Quinn told GMA, blaming cops for making a fiasco out of their darkest days.
“I remember thinking that this is a really bad nightmare. I don't like this,” Huskins said.
“The voice kept saying over and over again, ‘Wake up, this is a robbery, we're not here to harm you.' I opened my eyes and there's flashing light and they said ‘Aaron turn over.'”
The kidnapper knew their names.
Huskins later said that they and Quinn knew there were other men at the time of the break in, but they only spoke to one during their two days of captivity.
They say the men drugged them, put goggles on them and tied them up before asking for two instalments of $8,500 to release Huskins. Then, they took them away.
Huskins added that they expected to die.
“My only hope was to maybe show them the human that is in front of him. They spoke to me a lot, they shared with me that they just had a difficult time in their life,” they said of their main kidnapper.
“And so I kind of shared with them something that happened when I was younger, hoping that maybe knowing that I've already been assaulted that they wouldn't want to add to it.”
Huskins claims their outspoken kidnapper raped them repeatedly throughout the 48 hours they held their captive.
“When they opened the car door, I thought, ‘This is it. Either I'm going to hear a gunshot and that's it or I'm gonna get pushed off a cliff.' And they were guiding me and I thought I was walking to my death. And then I heard a door close behind me and I pulled up the blindfold and I thought, ‘Oh God, they are going to release me.'”
Accused kidnapper Matthew Muller was arrested two months later when detectives found Huskins' DNA in their car. They pleaded guilty.
No other suspects have been arrested.

What a difference a day can make! Notice the 24 hour temperature change across the state as of late this afternoon. Of course, temperatures yesterday were at or near record levels and temperatures this afternoon have actually only been slightly below normal, although the gusty northerly winds have certainly made it feel much cooler. To put things in perspective, our afternoon high has been 47, but we were at 50 shortly after midnight so that is what will go into the record book for the high on this date. Also, the morning low was 34 but we will be colder than that by midnight. The normal values for today are 51/30.
[img]
Thursday will be a more typical day in the sense that the coldest temperatures will occur during the early morning hours and the warmest during the afternoon. And the day will get off to a very cold start as the gusty northerly winds today have not only brought in much cooler air, but also very dry air. As a result, look for fair overnight skies and temperatures quickly falling through the 30s this evening and into the lower 20s by early morning. Some of the normally cooler valleys will likely see temperatures in the teens to start the day, and although the winds will be light, wind chill values will likely be in the teens for many locations.
Thursday will have lots of sunshine along with a light easterly wind that morning but becoming more SE that afternoon. Temperatures will struggle to get above the 50 degree mark with most locations only reaching the upper 40s for a daytime high.
A stronger southerly wind for Thursday night should keep us from cooling much with upper 30s to low 40s to start the day on Friday. Then, Friday and Saturday will be back to Spring-like conditions with strong southerly winds and daytime highs well into the 70s Friday afternoon and likely reaching the 80s Saturday afternoon which will set new records. Mostly sunny skies will prevail for Friday but those strong southerly winds will return moisture and a low level cloud deck that night and into the morning hours of Saturday. That also means a very warm start to Saturday morning and the clouds are expected to thin out from W-E during the day, so likely a pronounced W-E cloud gradient that afternoon. Obviously, those low clouds are a wild card regarding how warm Saturday will be, but we should still set records that afternoon as you can see on our forecast page.
Keep in mind the strong southerly winds for Fri/Sat will also produce a very high fire danger as we remain very dry and the vegetation is dormant.
That will be followed by another dramatic cool-down for Sunday as a cold front moves across the state Saturday night. But, that will actually only bring temperatures back closer to the seasonal norms going into next week, and in fact we are still forecasting temperatures to be somewhat above normal even though it will be much cooler than the Fri/Sat time frame due to the extreme warmth on those two days. There will also be chances of showers on Sunday and into early next week along with mostly cloudy skies and a persistent northerly wind keeping temperatures more moderate. However, the best chances of rain will be over the more southern counties as you can see on the 7 day QPF.

Thought a brief look at the wind flow aloft would help explain the lack of really cold air in recent weeks and also the lack of rainfall across OK. This first chart shows the wind flow aloft at about the 18,000' level as of this afternoon. Notice that the general flow is what we refer to as a zonal pattern which means the winds are generally blowing from W-E across the Pacific, onto the W Coast and then on across the U.S. and into the Atlantic. The colors represent where the winds are the strongest, i.e. the jet stream.

The next map has the same parameters, but is valid for Tuesday afternoon of next week. Notice the flow has buckled somewhat with a stronger, more northerly component located near the Great Lakes and into the NE part of the country. Notice, also, what I have labeled as a cut-off low aloft located near the Big Bend area of Texas. That is the system that may produce some showers for Sunday into early next week as it gradually progresses on eastward, although most of the guidance is keeping its main influence confined to Texas and we will be on the northern fringe of any rain it produces. Referring back to the 7 day QPF though, you can see why it is suggesting the heavier rains across Texas with only light amounts, if any at all, for most of OK because of the projected track of that feature.

Also, it is that persistent zonal or W-E flow aloft that has kept much of the west coast so wet and will continue to do so through this forecast period which is evident on the 7 day QPF. Of interest to our weather though is the fact that this persistent zonal or W-E flow aloft keeps the really cold air bottled up far to the north of OK. Occasionally, a system will come along to allow some colder air to surge southward, but it only lasts for a few days before temperatures quickly return to above normal levels such as what is happening this week. A pattern in which a much more amplified N-S flow across the Arctic Circle is what we look for to produce the longer lived, more severe outbreaks of cold air and we have not seen much of that this winter. As mentioned, this more zonal flow aloft is also responsible for very wet conditions along the west coast, but most of the moisture is wrung out of them as they cross the Rocky Mountains. That means they do not have much to work with till they get well east of us which is why we have been so dry this winter.
As you can see on the 8-14 day guidance, this pattern looks to persist with a strong signal for temperatures on average to remain well above normal. A drier than normal pattern also looks to persist through that time frame.

So, stay tuned and check back for updates.

I love when spring weather creeps in and temperatures settle in the 70s, a cool breeze still in the air. I could leave it at that — I don't need the ultra hot, sweat-dripping-between-my-boobs temps that come with summer. If you have an infant, then they probably feel a lot of the same (minus the boobs part) and that's because hot temperatures aren't exactly suitable for them. But how hot is too hot for a baby outside? Turns out, there are a few good rules of thumb to keep in mind.
Dr. Jan Montague, director of pediatrics at Good Samaritan Hospital in Suffern, New York, told Fit Pregnancy and Baby that it's best to avoid high temps as much as possible. "It is not OK to take a newborn or any infant outside when it's very hot — over 80 degrees or so," they said. "Babies cannot sweat, which is your body's way of cooling itself off, so they can often suffer heat stroke much quicker than an older child or adult."
Keep in mind that it's also easy for infants (children under 6 months) to become dehydrated because they aren't drinking water regularly, according to What To Expect. As a result, the site recommended you stay on schedule with breast milk or formula, and talk to your doctor about other solutions if you live in a particularly hot climate. Your infant might need something like Pedialyte to replenish lost vitamins.
If you do venture outdoors in warm temperatures, then you'll want to keep an eye out for signs of dehydration. According to Parents, red flags include sleepiness, irritability, thirst, less elasticity in the skin, eyes and fontanel (or soft spot on head) appear sunken, decrease or absence of tears, dry mouth, and/or decrease number of wet diapers.
You may also notice signs of heat exhaustion. A little one who is unusually thirsty or tired or has skin that is cool and moist could be dealing with heat exhaustion, according to BabyCenter. It could also progress into heat stroke, which the website noted includes the following symptoms: A temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit (39.4 degrees Celsius) or higher, a rapid pulse, restlessness, confusion, vomiting, and/or lethargy.
"Removing the baby from the heat is the best way to protect them," Dr. Marnie Baker, a pediatrician at Saddleback Memorial Medical Center in Laguna Hills, California, tells Romper in an email interview. "Parents can also take a washcloth, soaked in cool water, and apply it on their baby's skin, and then fan them with the washcloth. This is a highly effective method to cool them down, without using a dangerous cold water submersion or topical alcohol wipes, which can rapidly cause shifts in body temperature that are not safe."
Wendy Kirwan, the director of public relations for Kars4Kids, tells Romper in an email interview that hot weather means parents should also take special precautions when traveling in a vehicle with a little one.
"When it's not too hot for babies outdoors, it can quickly reach lethal levels of heat inside a car," Kirwan says, adding that at 104 degrees Fahrenheit, a child's internal organs begin to shut down. "Every 10 to 20 minutes, the internal temperature of the car rises 20 degrees."
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), you should never leave infants or children in a parked car, even if the windows are cracked open. Be sure to also check that everyone is out of the car each time you leave your vehicle.
And even if you are indoors, you'll want to make sure you dress your infant in loose, lightweight clothing during the summer months. Garments made from a natural fiber like cotton are ideal, according to Parents, and you can use yourself as a guide for how to dress your baby. "Dress the baby the way you're dressed," Dr. Bruce Epstein, a pediatrician in Pinellas Park, Florida, told the magazine. "If you're wearing shorts and a T-shirt, that will be fine for them too." Because high temperatures call for everyone staying cool — baby included.

Instagram introduced the bookmarking feature a while ago, but failed to include any means to organize those bookmarks. So, they're adding collections. If you want to create a collection, head to your saved posts (the bookmark tab on your profile page), then tap the “+” button. To send a post to a specific collection, tap and hold on the bookmark icon and you can then choose the collection to send it to.
If this all sounds a heck of a lot like Pinterest, you're right, it's basically identical to Pinterest, with the exception that all of your collections are private. The feature is rolling out for Android and iPhone this week.

BANGKOK: Tourists attending a full moon party in southern Thailand on New Year's Eve said they were left with burns when a pyrotechnic display showered revellers with red-hot embers.
Footage of the incident on the popular backpacker island of Koh Phangan was posted online, showing how cheers turned to screams of panic as a giant sign reading "Happy New Year 2017" was set alight at midnight.
Sparks could be seen raining down on the crowd, aided by an onshore breeze.
Eyewitnesses described mass panic as people scrambled to get out of the way of the display.
"It was just like a shower of burning sparks," Lucy Coyle, a 20-year-old British tourist attending the party with their boyfriend, told AFP. "It felt like people were stabbing you with pins all over your body... everyone was trying to get out."
Coyle later posted pictures on Twitter of what they said were dozens of burns across their body.

Freddie Jacobs, another British tourist, said thousands were crammed onto the beach at the stroke of midnight, many under a sign they had no idea was about to be set alight.
"My girlfriend fell to the floor, they were getting so many burns I had to cover them like a blanket," the 23-year-old said, adding they and their partner were covered in burns the next day.
Backpackers flock to Koh Phangan for its famously raucous full moon parties. But its laid-back charm belies an equally relaxed attitude to safety.
Police confirmed the incident but played down tourist reports of injuries and mass panic.
"One female tourist aged around 30 was slightly injured, they got treated and went away," Colonel Somchai Noppasri, the island's police chief, told AFP.
Influenza activity has begun to surge across the country and Saskatchewan is no exception.
According to surveillance data conducted by the province on influenza rates, confirmed cases this flu season are up 60 per cent compared to this same time last year.

There have been two ICU admissions since Sept. 1, two outbreaks in long-term care homes and experts predict things are about to get even worse.
“The flu is picking up now in the middle of December and we think it's going to peak towards the end of the year or early in the new year,” Dr. Saqib Shahab, Saskatchewan's medical health officer, said.
READ MORE: More people in Alberta getting their flu shots than in years past
There has been a concentration of 47 cases in Saskatoon and surrounding area, also formerly known as the Saskatoon Health Region. Regina and surrounding area has had 17 confirmed cases so far this flu season.
Statistics also gathered by the provincial government show that recorded flu rates are the highest among the working population, aged 20 to 64 years old.
“People cough and it's very easy for the virus to transmit from one person to another,” Dr. Simon Kapaj, deputy medical health officer with the Saskatchewan Health Authority, said in Saskatoon.
“Always our message is if you're working in hospitals or long-term care centres, people that are sick need to avoid these areas.”
This influenza season has been especially bad because it started early say experts and because of the strains in circulation.
“The concern with the H3N2 strain is it leads to serious complications and this is especially for seniors and individuals with chronic illness such as diabetes, lung disease, heart disease and so on,” Kapaj added.

All more the reason health officials say, to get the flu shot ahead of the holiday season to protect you and the ones you love.
Although the vaccine's effectiveness can vary based on what virus strains are in circulation both doctors admitted, but say it's still better than nothing.
“It's always a good idea to get the flu shot especially if you have a high risk condition and if it's a good match the protection is higher,” Shahab said.
“If it's not such a good match – you're still protected to some extent.”
Approximately 340,000 doses of vaccine were ordered by the province for this flu season, of that 250,000 doses have been administered.
“Which is 11 per cent higher than the similar period last year or the year before that when 225,000 had been given,” Shahab said.
The vaccine also takes about two weeks to provide full protection against the flu so it's advised you get a shot sooner rather than later.
A baker was arrested in Catmon town for allegedly possessing unlicensed firearms.

A Barstow, Calif., police officer accused of being involved in the fatal shooting of driver Diante Yarber, a young father of three, was convicted of a hate crime back in 2010 but was somehow allowed to return to the police force, attorneys representing Yarber's family and their passengers say.
Not only was the officer allowed back on the streets to police people they apparently despise, but Yarber's attorney also says that the officers involved in their client's death used racial slurs during the confrontation in early April.

One of the officers shouted “[expletive] we're going to kill you,” attorney Lee Merritt claimed, citing interviews with witnesses, according to KABC-TV.
Back on April 5, Yarber drove with their cousins and friends to a local Walmart, and Barstow police were called to investigate a “suspicious” vehicle in the parking lot.
Officers claimed that while the officers were attempting to initiate a traffic stop, Yarber “suddenly reversed,” hitting one of the patrol cars. The driver had accelerated forward and hit a second patrol car when officers opened fire. In all, 30 bullets were fired at Yarber's vehicle, with 10 of them striking him, ultimately killing him.

Attorneys say that the shooting was unjustified and also allege that officers failed to give aid to Yarber once they were hit.
“At no time did they see law enforcement attempt to render aid or resuscitate or help Diante Yarber at all,” Merritt said.

Barstow police have so far refused to name the officers involved, but Merritt identified one officer as Jimmie Alfred Walker, who is white. A Los Angeles Times report from 2010 shows that Walker, then 30, was arrested on hate crime and battery charges for using racial slurs while assaulting a man and a woman during a late-night altercation while they were off duty.
They were released on $50,000 bail following their arrest and was later allowed to plead guilty to a lesser charge and ultimately get their job back. Hell, they were even paid a settlement, KABC notes.
And now that same man is accused of killing an unarmed black man.
Of course, officers took time to claim that they feared for their lives. Barstow Police Chief Albert Ramirez Jr. dug up Yarber's records, which include a prior police encounter.

Ramirez said that on March 18, Yarber was driving a stolen Hyundai when officers attempted to pull them over. They fled in the vehicle, leading officers on a chase, before jumping out of the vehicle and escaping on foot. Officers, unable to find him, issued a warrant for their arrest for stealing a vehicle and fleeing from police.
So on April 5, when officers pulled the license plate of the vehicle, which came back registered under Yarber's name, they provided the information about them to police as they responded.
When Yarber's vehicle struck the two patrol cars, they feared for their safety, so the story goes.

“The officers feared for their safety and the safety of others and an officer-involved shooting occurred,” Ramirez wrote in the Monday statement. “Four (4) officers fired rounds from their duty sidearms during the incident. All four (4) officers were wearing their department-issued body-worn cameras and had them activated and recording at the time of the incident.”
It's interesting how police fear a black man who is accused of stealing a car and running away. However, a white man who shot up a Waffle House and allegedly killed four people was somehow apprehended alive and well with barely a scratch, and even given bail.

As always, there are two sides to the story, and witnesses who were inside the vehicle rebutted police accounts.
“The information related to the shooting is that the car was backing up very slowly when the officer opened fire at the car,” said Dale Galipo, an attorney representing two of the passengers who were in the vehicle at the time. One of Galipo's clients was injured in the gunfire.
“In this case, it was totally unjustified,” they added. “No one was about to be killed. There was no reason to shoot him.”

: With the construction of its Phase-3 nearly complete, the Delhi Metro is all set to accommodate more than 200,000 additional commuters on its network by March 2018. Besides the entirely new Pink and Magenta Lines, the DMRC (Delhi Metro Rail Corporation) will be adding 186 new coaches to the existing lines.Calculated at 300 passengers per coach as cited by the transporter, the DMRC will be able to accommodate an additional 55,800 commuters on its five existing lines.And the commissioning of Pink Line (Majlis park-Shiv Vihar) and Magenta Line (Janakpuri West-Botanical Garden), which will be done in phases from December, will add 504 more coaches to the network by March next year, when they will be fully operational.These two lines will be able to ferry 151,200 passengers per day.A DMRC official confirmed that it is "safe to say" that the commuter capacity will increase by a little over 200,000 a day, given the capacity of a coach and the increase in their number."It is safe to say this... but the accurate number is hard to calculate. Since we do not have the relative ridership data, or any projection in its increase which may occur during this period," Tomojit Bhattacharjee, Manager, Corporate Communication, DMRC, told IANS.Currently, 227 trains with 1,468 coaches ply on the Delhi Metro's five lines -- Red, Yellow, Blue, Green and Violet -- with the number of coaches varying from four to six to eight.By the end of Phase-3, the official said, the number of trains on these lines is scheduled to increase to 244 and the number of coaches to 1,654.Started in 2002 with a fleet of ony four-coach trains, the DMRC has periodically resorted to adding coaches to accommodate more and more passengers .Following the same tested method, the DMRC has decided to increase the number of coaches and trains on three of its lines -- Red Line , Yellow Line , and Blue Line.Supporting almost one-third of the network's daily traffic of 2.7-2.9 million, the Yellow Line (Huda City Centre-Jahangirpuri) is slated to see a major boost in terms of number of trains and coaches.Currently at 436 coaches, by the end of Phase-3, the stretch will have 488 coaches, with 10 out of its 22 six-coach trains having been converted into eight-coach ones.Eventually, the line will have a total of 52 maximum-coach trains (including four new eight-coach trains), increased from the present 38.Likewise, the Blue Line (Dwarka Sector-21-Vaishali/Noida City Centre) will also see a moderate increase, with the number of coaches slated to be increased from 538 to 574.A major change will be seen on the oldest line in the network, where the entire fleet of four-coach trains will be converted into six-coach ones, increasing the number of coaches from 136 to 234.The Red Line (Rithala-Dilshad Garden), which at present has 19 four-coach trains, will boast of 39 six-coach trains by the end of Phase-3, with no four-coach trains remaining in service at all. The line does not have any eight-coach trains.At present, the daily ridership is 900,000 on the Yellow and Blue Lines and 350,000 on the Red Line.The Phase-3 project also includes extension of the Green Line (Mundka-Kirti Nagar/Inderlok) from Mundka to Bahadurgarh and that of Violet Line (Kashmere Gate- Escorts Mujesar) to Ballabhgarh in Haryana.

Sylvester Stallone is teaming up with MGM to develop a biopic on legendary boxing champion Jack Johnson. Stallone recently made headlines for their trip to Washington D.C., where they and a group of professional boxers met with President Trump to ask them to issue a posthumous pardon for Johnson. Trump ultimately granted the pardon for the boxer last week, for their 1913 felony conviction that was racially motivated, which certain groups had been seeking for several years now.
There is no word on whether or not Stallone will have any sort of role in front of the camera, but this project will launch their new company known as Balboa Productions, named after their character Rocky Balboa from the iconic Rocky franchise. This untitled Jack Johnson biopic will be the first project to be developed under the Balboa Productions banner, which will develop both film and television properties. MGM Motion Picture Group president Jonathan Glickman and MGM executive vice president of production Adam Rosenberg are overseeing the film, but there is no writer or director attached quite yet.
Jack Johnson was born in Galveston, Texas, the third of nine children to two former slaves, and they began to box at a very young age. They had their first professional fight at the age of 20 in 1898 and they would go on to win the World Colored Heavyweight Championship in 1903, a title they defended 17 times over a five-year period. Johnson had repeatedly tried to get into a position to win the world heavyweight championship title, but, while black boxers could fight white boxers in regular matches, they could never fight for the world championship. While Joe Gans was the first black boxer to win a world championship belt ever, in the lightweight division, Jack Johnson was the first ever black world heavyweight champion in 1908.
Jack Johnson defended their title for seven years, a period where documentarian Ken Burns called Johnson, "the most famous and the most notorious African-American on Earth." Despite continually defending their championship, there were calls from many for a "Great White Hope" to take the championship back, which lead to a bout between Johnson and former world heavyweight champion James J. Jeffries, who came out of retirement for a fight that would be dubbed, "the fight of the century." Johnson became the first fighter to knock down Jeffries twice, and Jeffries' corner threw in the towel before the 15th round, to prevent what could have been Jeffries' first ever knockout of their career.
While Jeffries admitted in an interview that, even in their prime, they would have never been able to defeat Johnson, Johnson's victory, which happened on the Fourth of July, triggered race riots all across the country. A few years later, they were convicted on charges that their relationship with a white woman, violated the Mann Act, which banned, "transporting women across state lines for immoral purposes," since the woman, Lucille Cameron, was allegedly a prostitute. Johnson skipped bail and went on the run for the next seven years, before returning to the U.S. in 1920 to serve their their prison sentence. They retired with a boxing record of 73 wins, 13 losses, 10 draws and five no contests. They were inducted into the Boxing Hall of Fame in 1954, and the film of their 1910 fight was placed in the National Film Registry for their historical significance. Variety broke the news about this Jack Johnson biopic.

FAISALABAD - The Faisalabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FCCI) has demanded the Punjab government to extend subsidy on flour under Ramazan package to throughout the year as the province has sufficient stocks of wheat. Chairing a meeting here on Tuesday,
FCCI President Shabbir Hussain Chawla welcomed the decision of Punjab government to provide the same subsidy to the people during the holy month of Ramazan, but demanded that the same facility should be continued throughout the year as government has surplus stocks of wheat.
They said that wheat is the basic food of people and subsidy on it will be of a significant importance for the poor masses of this province. Shabbir hoped that the Punjab govt would make this decision before the accomplishment of its five-year term.
"It will be a gift of the govt for the people of this province, as it has already sanctioned three basic salaries for the government employees", they added.
The FCCI president said that Punjab govt has decided to give subsidy of Rs500 per 40kg of wheat for export purposes. They said that this decision was justified as Punjab had sufficient stock of wheat while new crop was also expected when this decision was made few months ago.
The Faisalabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry President said that the Punjab government has not sufficient stocks silos to safely preserve the commodity and most of the wheat was stocked in open where there were chances of its infestation were imminent.
The Federal Government has commenced Automatic Exchange of Tax Information (AETI), on overseas assets held by Nigerians.
The Minister of Finance, Mrs. Kemi Adeosun, disclosed this while receiving Progress Report on Tax Laws Reform by the Vice Chairman of the National Tax Policy Implementation Committee, Mr. Taiwo Oyedele, in Abuja, yesterday,
They expressed satisfaction with the data being supplied to Nigeria by foreign countries under the AETI.
I words, “The data received in Nigeria with regard to overseas assets held by Nigerians has been impressive and will underpin a long term improvement in the nation's tax to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ration, in turn, will improve life for the masses.
“The data on bank accounts, property and trusts, which has come automatically from a number of countries is being used to support the Voluntary Assets and Income Declaration Scheme (VAIDS) by allowing the tax authorities to check the accuracy of declarations received.
“The Federal Government is also using the data to generate ‘nudge' letters which are being sent to those identified as being potential tax defaulters.”
They disclosed that Nigeria had written to a number of nations to request specific information about offshore trusts and bank accounts held by its citizens.
Mrs. Adeosun urged users of offshore structures to take advantage of VAIDS to regularise their taxes before the expiry of the amnesty programme.
“The offshore tax shelter system is basically over. Those who have hidden money overseas are being exposed and whilst Nigerians can legally keep their money anywhere in the world, they must first pay any taxes due to the Nigerian Government so that we can fund the needs of the masses and create jobs and wealth for our people.
“The moral argument against illicit financial flows and tax evasion and the strong international co-operation are such that every Nigerian tax payer should do the right thing. The needs of our people for development override any other argument against payment of tax,” they stated.
They stressed the need for a sustainable revenue that could deliver infrastructural development for Nigeria and improve the tax to GDP ratio of the country.
They assured that the Federal Government would build a robust tax system and implement the recommendations by the National Tax Policy Implementation Committee (NTPIC) on tax laws reform.
Earlier in their address, Mr. Oyedele, said the committee considered three major policy documents namely; the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP), the National Tax Policy and Ease of Doing Business Plan.
They said seven major tax areas that would have the highest impact. These include: Company Income Tax (CIT), Value Added Tax (VAT), Customs & Excise Tariff (CET), Personal Income Tax (PIT), Pension Contributions, Industrial Development Income Tax Relief (IDITR); and Tertiary Education Trust Fund.
An off-duty Tulsa Public Schools police officer found themselves in the middle of a fight that ended with someone in the windshield of their patrol car.
Tulsa Police say the officer was inside the Army Surplus store near 41st and Memorial when another customer began creating a disturbance.
The officer followed them into the parking lot to find out what was going on when the man started swinging at him.
At some point, someone was thrown into the windshield of the officer's car before the man was arrested.
TPD has not relayed who was thrown into the car they did say the officer was not seriously hurt.
AMSTERDAM: They call them Mr Snowman, but Michiel de Ruiter knows they are shouldering a heavy responsibility as they start their mission at Pyeongchang: making tonnes of snow to keep the Winter Olympic ski slopes in tip-top condition.
As a child growing up in the flat, low-lying Netherlands where not a single real mountain can be found, the Dutchman used to use a spade to dig out their own runs, before snapping on their skis to perform jumps in the countryside around their hometown of Ermelo.
Now decades later, this former freestyle skier who twice represented their country at the Winter Olympics has arrived in South Korea ahead of the 2018 Games.
But instead of skis, they are carrying everything they and their team needs to give nature a helping hand and blanket the slopes in the white stuff.
Just before leaving home on their "adventure" of a lifetime, De Ruiter, 53, was making final preparations at their business headquarters in 's-Graveland.
"I feel the same pressure as the sports athletes," they told AFP, saying they were "impatient" to experience the magic of being part of the Winter Olympics, which runs from February 9 to 25.

"NO ROOM FOR ERROR"
First step on their mission? "To evaluate how much snow has already been produced by the Korean (snowmaking) cannons. Then I will bring the snow to where I want it to be with spades and machines," they explained.
After that they will have to mark out the runs, and ensure the snow remains in good condition.
"There is no room for error," they said. "Otherwise everything could go badly wrong."
If the snow starts to melt, then they will have to make more himself. They have enough material to supply some 23,000 cubic tonnes of snow "just in case."
A specialist in making artificial snow, their chance to take part in the Winter Olympics came thanks to stroke of genius in Spain in January 2017.
Then the ski freestyle championships taking place in Sierra Nevada mountains were on the point of being scrapped because the weather was too warm.
Water was even dripping from the jump, supposed to help propel the skiers 15 metres into the air.
With the help of pipes filled with ice, De Ruiter achieved "the impossible" and managed to stop the jump from melting or losing shape.
"The pipes consolidated the snow. After that, they asked me to come to South Korea."
"IN LOVE WITH SNOW"
They believe it is already cold enough in mountainous Pyeongchang for the South Korean snowmaking cannons to have gone into action to cover the slopes in snow.
"But if the temperatures rise, it is possible they will ask me to make some," they said.
They say they have been "playing with snow" for decades now, having fallen in love with it when they were very young.
Before representing the Netherlands at the 1992 Albertville Olympics and in Lillehammer two years later, they even raked their own jumps.
"Back then we had to do everything ourselves. But it was a way of making money, which helped pay for our transport to competitions."
They never won an Olympic medal, but now with their business, De Ruiter has made it snow on palm trees on a beach, and blanketed studios for movies and ads.
"I can make it snow where I want and when I want," they smiled, "even when it's 30 degrees Celsius" and the sun is shining.
Their magic formula uses liquid nitrogen, water and air.
To build the jumps, they and their team of about 30 people including locals, first build a structure of wood and metal, and then fill it with snow.
"Then we leave it for two to three days to allow the snow to freeze. And then we sculpt the curve" which allows the competitors to thrust themselves upwards hoping for height, distance and speed.
While the world will be looking up to admire the dizzying jumps achieved by the skiers, De Ruiter says they "won't be taking their eyes off the snow".
DAYTON, Ohio (AP) — Police say an Ohio man was sucker punched, kicked and stabbed in the neck during a robbery in the first minutes of 2017.
WHIO-TV reports (http://bit.ly/2io5dT5 ) police say three males approached the man early Sunday in Dayton and asked to use their cellphone.
They say one of the assailants punched the 51-year-old Trotwood man when they handed over their phone, causing them to fall to the ground.
Police say they were then stabbed with a box cutter and repeatedly kicked. They say the attackers also stole $40.
WHIO-TV says the man was taken to a hospital and is expected to live.

0 Delta flight diverted due to disruptive passenger singing, dancing and threats
TULSA, Okla. - Officials arrested a man Wednesday after a transcontinental flight from Portland, Oregon, to Atlanta was diverted to Tulsa International Airport.
>> Read more trending news
The pilots of Delta Air Lines Flight 1156 declared an emergency during the flight because of an unruly passenger. They requested that law enforcement meet the plane at the gate.
Passengers told KOKI-TV via Twitter that a man was singing loudly in their seat and violently thrashing and dancing to the music that they were listening to.
Passenger Lisa Zimmerman told KOKI that a flight attendant asked the man to quiet down on multiple occasions and even moved a woman who was sitting next to the man.
Zimmerman said after officials made a couple of attempts to get the man to quiet down, "he flipped out."
Passengers sitting nearby reported that the man threatened to harm the flight attendant if they bothered them again and they told them they "will regret it.”
An air marshal reportedly stepped in to try to calm the situation, but when they intervened, passengers said the man raised their fists to the marshal.
After the landing, airport police boarded the plane and arrested the passenger. Zimmerman said they were screaming about God, Judgment Day and how everyone needed to repent of their sins. They also claimed that they had authority over the police because cops are "sin."
The FBI said its agents took custody of the man, and the U.S. Attorney's Office is looking at possible charges, since threatening a member of a flight crew is a federal offense.
Delta 1156 took off again for Atlanta around 2 p.m. Wednesday.
Here's a statement from U.S. Attorney R. Trent Shores about the incident:
“Today, a Delta flight traveling from Portland to Atlanta was diverted to Tulsa due to the alleged conduct of an unruly passenger. Federal Air Marshals on the plane successfully deescalated and controlled the situation, and the flight landed in Tulsa without further incident. The passenger-at-issue has been taken into custody. Law enforcement officials with the Federal Bureau of Investigation will investigate this matter moving forward. The Transportation Security Administration, Homeland Security Investigations, and Tulsa International Airport authorities assisted in the response and initial investigation.
"The United States Attorney's Office will review whether the alleged unruly conduct violated federal law. I am thankful no one was hurt and that the other passengers may resume their travel to their intended destination. I commend the Federal Air Marshals who reacted decisively in this situation. Their efforts – combined with the resulting joint investigation – remind us all that our local, state, and federal law enforcement partners are working together to ensure the safety and security of the traveling public.”

Loberanis finally beats tormentor, Niños soar beyond reach in Cviraa
City of Naga — Them hopes of finally conquering a perennial tormentor was fading, but Mary Joy Loberanis summoned every ounce of strength as they neared the finish line to complete a dramatic end to a string of morale-shattering losses.
Loberanis of the Cebu City Niños exorcised the ghost of a bitter past by ruling the secondary girls' 800-meter run yesterday in the 2017 Central Visayas Regional Athletic Association (Cviraa) Regional Meet at the Teodoro Mendiola Sr. Track and Field Oval.

And the usually serene Loberanis let it all out with a howl the moment they crossed the finish line…..first.
They clocked two minutes and 24.59 seconds, enough to beat Joan Alinsunod of the host city who timed 2:31.55–good for just third place. Rosemarie España of Bohol Province came in second at 2:29.41.
“I was kinda down going into the contest. They (Alinsunod) beat me last year twice and also twice this year,” said the 14-year-old student of the University of San Carlos-Basic Education Department.
Last Tuesday, Alinsunod gave themselves a fitting birthday present when they won the 1,500m event in a bruising duel with Loberanis as the former timed 5:02.31 against the latter's 5:02.99.
Yesterday morning, Alinsunod also ruled the 3,000m run in a contest that saw Loberanis failing to make the top three.
Niños beyond reach
Mary Joy's inspired performance capped another massive gold haul by the Niños, who are well on their way of pocketing their 25th straight crown.
The swimming team yesterday harvested 22 golds, 14 silvers and 13 bronzes while the taekwondo jins produced 13 gilts.
Going into today's contest, the Niños sit comfortably on top with 99 golds, 53 silvers and 45 bronzes.
In second place is Cebu Province with 22 golds, 18 silvers and 19 bronzes while Bohol Province is in third with a 19-20-28 (g-s-b) count.
Completing the top five were Tagbilaran City and Lapu-Lapu City at 10-7-9 and 6-20-20, respectively.
Karen Mae Indaya was again the most productive swimmer yesterday by copping three individual golds in secondary girls' 200IM, 200m freestyle and 100m butterly.
Last Monday, Indaya ruled the 400m freestyle and 100m backstroke.
Gold medallists in the taekwondo were Dominic Sator (secondary boys welterweight), Michael Noel Boncales (sb light middleweight), Wayne Clemen (sb light heavyweight), Warren Rama (sb finweight), Dineson Caneda (sb flyweight), David Labiste (sb bantamweight) and Patrick Seares (sb lightweight), Loralee Natividad (secondary girls welterweight), Julia Yarra (sg light middleweight), Ellen Joy Villacarlos (sg middleweight), Vengele Mayn Coran (sg bantamweight) and Princess Parba (sg lightweight).
John Vincent Lirazan accounted for Cebu City's lone gold in arnis via the individual anyo competition solo baston.
Gold winners in athletics were Jhuvan Jhen Baculot (sg triple jump), Samantha Gem Limos (sg 200m run), Crystal Villanueva (sg high jump), Elyza May Salinas (sg 100m hurdles), Seth Abram Pilapil (sb 200m) and John Marvin Rafols (sg triple jump).

Ansible is an open source automation tool used to configure servers, install software, and perform a wide variety of IT tasks from one central location. It is a one-to-many agentless mechanism where all instructions are run from a control machine that communicates with remote clients over SSH, although other protocols are also supported.
While targeted for system administrators with privileged access who routinely perform tasks such as installing and configuring applications, Ansible can also be used by non-privileged users. For example, a database administrator using the mysql login ID could use Ansible to create databases, add users, and define access-level controls.
Let's go over a very simple example where a system administrator provisions 100 servers each day and must run a series of Bash commands on each one before handing it off to users.
This is a simple example, but should illustrate how easily commands can be specified in yaml files and executed on remote servers. In a heterogeneous environment, conditional statements can be added so that certain commands are only executed in certain servers (e.g., "only execute yum commands in systems that are not Ubuntu or Debian").
One important feature in Ansible is that a playbook describes a desired state in a computer system, so a playbook can be run multiple times against a server without impacting its state. If a certain task has already been implemented (e.g., "user sysman already exists"), then Ansible simply ignores it and moves on.
Definitions
Tasks: A task is the smallest unit of work. It can be an action like "Install a database," "Install a web server," "Create a firewall rule," or "Copy this configuration file to that server."

Plays: A play is made up of tasks. For example, the play: "Prepare a database to be used by a web server" is made up of tasks: 1) Install the database package; 2) Set a password for the database administrator; 3) Create a database; and 4) Set access to the database.

Roles: Roles are used to save and organize playbooks and allow sharing and reuse of playbooks. Following the previous examples, if you need to fully configure a web server, you can use a role that others have written and shared to do just that. Since roles are highly configurable (if written correctly), they can be easily reused to suit any given deployment requirements.

It is integrated with GitHub, so roles can be organized into Git repositories and then shared via Ansible Galaxy.
These definitions and their relationships are depicted here:
Please note this is just one way to organize the tasks that need to be executed. We could have split up the installation of the database and the web server into separate playbooks and into different roles. Most roles in Ansible Galaxy install and configure individual applications. You can see examples for installing mysql and installing httpd.
Tips for writing playbooks
The best source for learning Ansible is the official documentation site. And, as usual, online search is your friend. I recommend starting with simple tasks, like installing applications or creating users. Once you are ready, follow these guidelines:
When testing, use a small subset of servers so that your plays execute faster. If they are successful in one server, they will be successful in others.
Always do a dry run to make sure all commands are working (run with --check-mode flag).
flag). Test as often as you need to without fear of breaking things. Tasks describe a desired state, so if a desired state is already achieved, it will simply be ignored.
Be sure all host names defined in /etc/ansible/hosts are resolvable.
are resolvable. Because communication to remote hosts is done using SSH, keys have to be accepted by the control machine, so either 1) exchange keys with remote hosts prior to starting; or 2) be ready to type in "Yes" to accept SSH key exchange requests for each remote host you want to manage.
Although you can combine tasks for different Linux distributions in one playbook, it's cleaner to write a separate playbook for each distro.
In the final analysis
Ansible is a great choice for implementing automation in your data center:
It's agentless, so it is simpler to install than other automation tools.
Instructions are in YAML (though JSON is also supported) so it's easier than writing shell scripts.
It's open source software, so contribute back to it and make it even better!

At least four Eritrean refugees are in critical condition after being shot during a mass brawl between some 130 Afghans and Eritreans in the northern French city of Calais, local media outlets reported.
The fighting started while volunteers were handing out food to refugees, but later spread to a number of locations in the city, according to the Le Monde newspaper.
Officials said a further 22 people suffered wounds, including two police officers trying to break up the fighting, which involved more than a hundred Eritreans and around 20 Afghans.
Speaking to police officers on Thursday evening, French Interior Minister Gerrard Collomb described the violence as “exceptionally serious” and promised that those responsible would be punished.
Collomb also ordered the deployment of more police officers to the area to avoid a repeat of the events.
Calais was home to the unofficial “jungle” refugee camp, which housed thousands of refugees in tents, until French authorities demolished it in October 2016.
The city and neighbouring areas drew refugees and migrants from around the world due to its proximity to England, which lies at the other end of a 25-mile stretch of sea.
Many of those who had lived in the jungle moved to other areas of France but others remained in the hope of making their way on to trucks and boats heading towards the UK.
According to local authorities, up to 800 refugees and migrants remain in Calais.
The wider Calais region has experienced previous incidents of violence, including clashes between rival human trafficking gangs.
Mass brawls between refugees have also broken out occasionally.
Super Eagles captain Mikel Obi has expressed their gratitude to the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) for their role in rescuing their father who was kidnapped.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Mikel revealed after the 2018 FIFA World Cup that their father was abducted before Nigeria's last group stage match against Argentina in Saint Petersburg.
The Enugu State Police Command on Tuesday however confirmed in a statement on their official Twitter account that Pa Michael Obi had been rescued from the kidnappers.
The statement said they were kidnapped along Makurdi–Enugu expressway, adding that the kidnappers allegedly demanded N10 million as ransom from Obi's family.
“Michael Obi, the father of Eagles captain, has regained their freedom,” Enugu Police command spokesperson Ebere Amaraizu said.
“He was rescued a forest in the Udi area of Enugu after a gun battle between the police and the kidnappers, who escaped during the shootout.
“He is right now in the office of the Enugu State police commissioner,” police said.
Mikel thanked the NPF for their assistance through a message on their official Twitter account on Wednesday which said,
“I would like to thank the Police authorities involved in ensuring the safe return of my father after the ordeal this week.
“I will also like to thank everyone for their kind words of support.  They are now recuperating with family. My family and I are grateful.”
NAN also reports that Mikel's father was previously kidnapped in 2011 and was also rescued by the police force during a raid.

University mentorship program grant for first-generation, low-income students
California Lutheran University has received the opportunity to be a part of the McNair Scholars Program, said Kelly Owens, McNair Scholars Program director and director of sponsored research and projects.
According to the McNair Scholars website, “The McNair Scholars Program is a federal TRIO program funded at 151 institutions across the United States and Puerto Rico by the U.S. Department of Education. It is designed to prepare undergraduate students for doctoral studies through involvement in research and other scholarly activities.”
Cal Lutheran was given a $1.16 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education to establish the McNair Program, said Haco Hoang, a political science professor at Cal Lutheran.
Hoang said the McNair Scholars Program occurs every five years, and this is the first time that Cal Lutheran has been given the opportunity to participate.
There are some requirements a student must meet to qualify for the McNair Scholars Program.
“Students must be first generation [college] students, from a low income household, or historically underrepresented in graduate schools or a combination of any two of the three,” Hoang said.
The McNair Program will not be limited to one or two individuals, Owens said.
“We will have 25 McNair Scholars on an annual basis and we anticipate about 12 to 15 faculty mentors. By the two-year mark, we should have 50 McNair Scholars in our program,” Owens said.
Professors at Cal Lutheran who were interested in becoming mentors for the McNair Program were asked to submit an application and express their interest in being a mentor, Hoang said.
“Mentors will help students with career preparation, planning and graduation of graduate school, but at the same time, they're also going to help mentor research projects, too,” Hoang said. “We're asking them to create relationships with the students over this two-year period.”
The hope is to have faculty mentors who will be present to help students through their academic career and through life, Hoang said.
Akiko Yasuike, chair of Cal Lutheran's sociology department, is one of the professors at Cal Lutheran who has applied to be a faculty mentor in the McNair Program.
“The McNair Program is a very prestigious program and it's not usually small, liberal arts colleges like ourselves that have the McNair Program, so this program brings a type of prestige we didn't have before to our institution,” Yasuike said.
However, Yasuike said their reason for becoming a faculty mentor goes beyond the prestigious name.
While working toward their doctorate, Yasuike said they attended a university in Southern California that had the McNair Program, so they were able to see firsthand how powerful this program is.
On top of seeing how it affected their peers, they said they were able to witness how faculty mentors at that time helped their McNair Scholars. Yasuike believes it helped them realize how much work would have to be put in to their degree, but also how worthwhile the experience would be.
“I also know that we don't have a lot of faculty of color, but particularly in California we have a lot of Latinos and Hispanic students, but we don't have a lot of Ph.D.s who are Latino and Hispanic scholars,” Yasuike said.
Yasuike has always been interested in working with underrepresented students, especially because she's seen the many challenges they face in their undergraduate careers.
Owens said just because the McNair Program begins with students who attend Cal Lutheran does not mean that students are expected to attend graduate school at the same university.
“We're hoping to attract students who are interested in a number of disciplines, and the expectation is that a lot of the students will be looking to go to grad school at other universities,” Owens said.
The deadline for student applications has been extended on a rolling basis until all 25 spots are filled.
Contact Kelly Owens, McNair Scholars Program Director at kowens@callutheran.edu for more information. Owens will also hold special McNair Info Sessions with office hours from 10 a.m.-12:30 p.m. and 3-5 p.m. each day during the week of Dec. 4-8.

LOS ANGELES: One of the most destructive fires in California's history was raging in a sprawling national forest on Monday (Dec 11) and creeping up the Pacific coast, forcing new evacuations.
As a wildfire near Los Angeles was brought under control, firefighters were being redeployed to battle the Thomas Fire northwest of America's second-largest city.
The Thomas Fire has burned 93,300 hectares since it erupted a week ago and has been only 15 per cent contained, the Calfornia Fire Department (Cal Fire) said.
The blaze spread over the weekend in the mostly uninhabited Los Padres National Forest, Cal Fire said, and was threatening the coastal towns of Montecito, Summerland and Carpinteria, south of the historic city of Santa Barbara, population 91,000.
The Thomas Fire has forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of Californians and actor Rob Lowe and comedian and talk show host Ellen DeGeneres were among those preparing to flee.
"Our house is under threat of being burned," DeGeneres said of their Montecito home.

"We just had to evacuate our pets," they said on Twitter. "I'm praying for everyone in our community and thankful to all the incredible firefighters."
Our house is under threat of being burned. We just had to evacuate our pets. I'm praying for everyone in our community and thankful to all the incredible firefighters. The live stream is on https://t.co/FTcKVvHO16 — Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) December 10, 2017
"Praying for my town," Santa Barbara resident Lowe wrote on Twitter. Fires closing in. Firefighters making brave stands. Could go either way. Packing to evacuate now."
May Osher, a 66-year-old retired schoolteacher in Carpinteria, told the Los Angeles Times they had put photo albums and pet supplies in their car and was ready to evacuate if told to do so.
"I'm staying until it's time to go," Osher told the newspaper.
With over 230,000 acres of land scorched, the Thomas Fire is the fifth-largest in the history of California, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Cal Fire said 800 buildings have been destroyed by the fire, which is being fueled by dry brush and strong and unpredictable Santa Ana winds.
"Gusty northeast winds will cause the fire to threaten areas of the city of Santa Barbara," Cal Fire said early on Monday.
'NEW NORMAL'
Despite the intensity of the fires stretching from north of Los Angeles down to San Diego - authorities have reported only one fatality - a 70-year-old woman who died in a car crash while fleeing a blaze.
California Governor Jerry Brown warned on Saturday that climate change meant that the state was becoming increasingly vulnerable and wildfires were becoming the "new normal."
"The fire season used to be a few months in the summer," Brown said. "Now it's almost year-long. We've never seen anything like it."
Brown has been one of the most vocal critics of President Donald Trump's decision to pull the United States out of the Paris accord on global warming and they renewed their attacks on the administration over its attitude towards climate change.
"Nature is not a political game. Nature is the ground on which we stand, it's the air which we breathe," they said.
"The truth of the case is that there's too much carbon being emitted, that heat-trapping gasses are building up, the planet is warming and all hell is breaking loose," Brown said.
This has been California's deadliest year ever for wildfires. More than 40 people died in October when fires swept through the state's wine-producing counties north of San Francisco.
Trump has issued a state of emergency for California, authorising the release of federal funds.
Violent crime in Baltimore County has risen. Homicides remained at 35 in each of the last two years, but overall violent crime increased 14.5 percent from 2016 to 2017, according to the latest available police department data. That followed a 2.8 percent decrease in such crime from 2015 to 2016. Early statistics for 2018 have not been released yet.
A shooting occurred at the Target in Owings Mills on Reisterstown Road that sent shoppers running and screaming recently, when, police say, two men entered the store and shot at another man. People should be able to take care of their family's needs without the fear of being caught in the cross fire of a disagreement. As one who goes to that Target, this greatly concerns me. “I find it utterly incredible and shameful that somebody would pull a gun in Target,” said County Councilman Julian Jones, a Democrat whose district includes parts of Owings Mills. No one has been apprehended in this incident.
Some believe that the opioid epidemic has something to do with the upswing of violent crimes not just in Baltimore County, but in the country as a whole.
Some good news? While violent crime increased, property crime in the county fell 0.6 percent from 2016 to 2017. Burglaries were down 15 percent, and motor vehicle thefts decreased by about 2 percent.

A man was found dead as a fire engulfed an apartment unit Sunday evening in Long Beach.
The blaze started on the ground floor of a two-story garden-style apartment complex in the 5500 block of Dairy Avenue just before 7:30 p.m., Long Beach Fire Department spokesperson Jake Heflin said.
Firefighters discovered the body and the victim was declared dead at the scene. The unit in which the body was found sustained heavy smoke and fire damage, and the man's identity was not immediately determined.
The second-story unit on top of the ground floor unit sustained heavy smoke damage and displaced a family of five. The family's father, a 28-year-old man, was sent to the hospital after they were forced to jump off a second-floor balcony, Heflin said.
Police and fire officials are investigating the cause of the blaze.

A Laguna Beach real estate broker is launching a campaign to challenge long-time Republican Orange County Rep. Dana Rohrabacher in 2018, and they say their campaign will rest in large part on attacking the member of congress's friendly views towards Russia.
The Democratic candidate, 57-year-old Boyd Roberts, is also vowing to work to impeach President Donald Trump, and has registered a federal political committee that they say will raise money to support other congressional candidates who back Trump's impeachment.
News of Robert's candidacy and the creation of their "Impeach Trump Leadership" PAC was first reported by The Hill and comes after Trump's national security advisor Michael Flynn resigned after admitting that they misled members of the administration, including Vice President Mike Pence , about conversations he'd had with Russia's ambassador to Washington.
"The district will vote [Rohrabacher] out because i think there is something with the Russia thing," Roberts said in an interview with The Times. "I think I can raise money off it."
Boyd is relatively new to politics. They launched and later aborted a campaign to challenge Inland Empire Rep. Ken Calvert in 2014. They say they never raised more than $5,000 in that bid.
In 2012, they finished last among a field of five candidates running for a seat on the Hemet Unified School District board .
But Roberts said Rohrabacher's sympathetic views of Russia will provide a big enough liability to give them a shot at unseating him.
Roberts noted that Politico labeled Rohrabacher " Putin's favorite member of congress " in a story last year, while Sen. John McCain implied that the member of congress is a part of the GOP's " lunatic fringe " after Rohrabacher said they were planning a trip to Russia.
"Dana Rohrabacher is the best candidate to go up against in the nation right now," Roberts said.
Some political insiders think Rohrabacher may retire . They do not have as much campaign cash in the bank as Scott Baugh, the former chairperson of the Republican Party of Orange County, who said they are waiting to step in should Rohrabacher bow out. Baugh has $548,428 in cash on hand for a potential campaign.
Roberts said they will begin fundraising on the Democratic online platform Act Blue today. Theirs said they have not been in contact with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which named Rohrabacher as one of the seven California Republicans they plan to unseat in 2018.

When your favorite comedian is accused of sexual assault
Posted by Isobel McCue on December 12, 2017 · Leave a Comment
When I first saw the headlines, I was shocked. I could not believe what I was seeing.
“Louis C.K. Is Accused by 5 Women of Sexual Misconduct.”
I have watched Louis C.K. for years, enjoying all their explicit and controversial material. From dead grandma jokes to rodent sex, the man redefined dark humor. I loved it. I had worked my way through all their standup, then their personally-based series, “Louie,” and was readily anticipating a new manifestation of raunchy extremism in their upcoming film, “I Love You Daddy.” They seemed authentic and their misgivings relatable.
They have recently been accused of masturbating in front of multiple women without their consent, both in person and over the phone. The alleged victims include comedians Dana Min Goodman, Julia Wolov, Abby Schachner, Rebecca Corry and a fifth woman who has chosen to remain anonymous. I couldn't believe that my first thought was, “No, there's no way this can be true.”
This mentality can be universal to fans of any artistic subsect, whether it be fine art, music, comedy or any other medium. We do not want to believe that our favorite artist could do something terrible. After all, I feel like I know C.K. as a person, and I do not know these women, so it cannot be true. It is normal to feel this way; however, the implications of the statement are actually quite insidious and reveal some devastating social implications, for when you claim that the accusations cannot be true, you imply that the women are lying.
This adamant defense stems from a culture of artist idolization. Often, we conflate the artist with their product, venerating their persona to idol status, resulting in the perception of a personal relationship with the artist. Essentially, we feel like we know them on an individual level. This lionizing prevents a relative objectivity by the public when viewing incidents such as this, and ultimately acts in opposition to those who have been hurt by the artist.
Even more thought-provoking is the reaction to C.K.'s public statement. They did not deny any of the accusations, and demonstrated remorse and culpability:
“I wielded that power [over women] irresponsibly. I have been remorseful of my actions. And I've tried to learn from them. And run from them.”
Those I've discussed this statement with have commended C.K. for their tactful response. I really did not think they had it in him. But it is important to not diminish the pain their actions caused by applauding their remorsefulness. Just because they are regretful, this does not detract from the issue of sexual assault society desperately must address. Let's not miss the point. Don't let the moonwalking bear distract from the basketballs, to reference the famous awareness test video.
So, I was left with a dilemma: Can I still watch C.K.'s work? For many, the answer is simple: Separate the art from the artist. This is a respectable approach, however it involves at least some level of subtle ignorance. Art is inherently personal. The artist can never wholly be regarded as a separate entity from their work. C.K.'s performances are based on their portrayal of themselves and their own experiences.
If the art cannot be separated from the artist, then we are challenged with how to regard their work. If we continue to consume their products, we contribute to their financial success, expansive public platform and lionized celebrity status. While putting money in C.K.'s pocket does not precipitate acts of sexual assault, it implies complicity in their actions. Because of status (don't disregard the race, gender and socioeconomic status of those recently accused of sexual assault, who are often white men), committing these atrocities results in only minor repercussions.
Netflix made a bold move in finalizing “House of Cards” after season six, and removing Kevin Spacey's character following the sexual assault allegations made against him. And some people are mad as hell. I felt similar emotions when “I Love You Daddy” was canceled, leaving an eager audience and the movie's staff hanging. Eventually, I have come to appreciate Netflix's move in denying Spacey a platform. Some will counter that the Spacey allegations are unfounded, and celebrities should fear false claims of sexual assault ruining their careers. But this is another moonwalking bear distraction, as only about two percent of sexual assault charges are false, while a meager 40 percent of rapes are ever reported to authorities. In standing by an unproven claim, Netflix made a powerful statement regarding the sexual assault issue as a whole, choosing to support victims of sexual assault. Sometimes, social progress must come at the expense of art that a large portion of the population enjoys.
I still find C.K.'s work enjoyable; I cannot help it. But it is vital to understand the false and dangerous impression that we form when we idolize our favorite artists. This does not make them infallible, and it is our responsibility as members of society to not discredit reality in favor of a more desirable one, and to stand by the victims of sexual assault everywhere by denying those who are culpable a godlike public platform.

Al Erlick, longtime Jewish journalist, served as acting editor of WJW
Albert H. Erlick, a longtime editor of the Philadelphia Jewish Exponent and, after their retirement, acting editor at Washington Jewish Week, died May 24. They were 88.
In 1998, four years after their retirement from the Exponent, they began commuting weekly between Philadelphia and Rockville to lead Washington Jewish Week while its owner searched for a permanent editor. Their stint in Washington lasted a year.
“When Al came to Washington Jewish Week, they were a living legend in this business,” said Craig Burke, publisher and chief executive officer of Mid-Atlantic Media, which publishes Washington Jewish Week. “We were able to take advantage of their wealth of knowledge and experience. We treasure the time we had with him.”
“Al was a true gentleman,” said Aaron Leibel, who was then the newspaper's arts editor and copy editor. “What I recall most about them was their passion for journalism, always telling the staff how much fun it was to put out a newspaper.”
They were born in Cleveland, Ohio, on July 19, 1928, and moved to Philadelphia in 1935, where they attended Temple University. At the end of World War II, they served with the first occupational troops in Japan under Gen. Douglas MacArthur as a member of the office staff.
Philadelphia was their home until 2015, when they and their wife, Barbara, moved to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to be close to their daughter.
Erlick won multiple journalism awards for a series of editorials on the search for peace in the Middle East and for a series of articles on their visit to refuseniks in the former Soviet Union.
They were also the recipient of the American Jewish Press Association's annual award for journalistic integrity. They interviewed world leaders from around the globe including multiple U.S presidents at the White House, and participated in many panels relating to political, social and religious unrest at home and abroad.
Before they worked at the Exponent, where they served for 24 years, Erlick edited the weekly Motion Picture Exhibitor magazine for over a decade. They also co-founded the Center City Philadelphian in 1959, which went on to become the Philadelphia Magazine.
All the while, they participated in their other lifelong love, the theater. They toured with national productions of “The Fantasticks” and “Julius Caesar,” among others. At age 87, they performed in Florida Children's Theatre's family series production of “Seussical” and, at 88, in its version of “Mary Poppins.”
A lifelong baseball enthusiast, Erlick never stopped rooting for the Cleveland Indians, with the Phillies a close second.
 They are survived by their wife, Barbara, and their children Janet, of Fort Lauderdale, and Kenneth, of Portland, Ore.; grandchildren Jeremy, Benjamin, Gabriel, Marcus and Jason.  They are also survived by their sister, friend and biggest fan, Mickey Zacher; and their brother, Samuel Dolnick, and their children.

Eliezer Jaffe, father of Israeli social work, dies
Eliezer Jaffe, considered a father of social work in Israel, has died at the age of 83.
Jaffe, who died on May 25, was a founder of Israel's first academic school of social work, the Paul Baerwald School of Social Work at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
A professor of social work specializing in philanthropy and nonprofit management, they were the first Centraid-L. Jacques Menard Professor for the Study of Nonprofit Organizations, Volunteering and Philanthropy at Hebrew University and co-chairperson of the university's Center for the Study of Philanthropy at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. They were a professor emeritus at Hebrew University at the time of their death.
More than a week before their death, Jaffe was presented with the Bonei Zion Prize for lifetime achievement awarded annually by Nefesh B'Nefesh to immigrants from English-speaking countries in recognition of their significant contributions to Israel.
Jaffe immigrated to Israel from Cleveland, Ohio in 1960, three years after they spent time in Israel volunteering in the immigrant transit camps.
Between 1970 and 1972, at the request of Mayor Teddy Kollek, they headed the Jerusalem Municipal Department of Family and Community Services, introducing major administrative, conceptual and program reforms, that continue to be observed throughout the country today.
They also served as a consultant to several government ministerial committees dealing with topics such as poverty and disadvantaged youth, and headed by the sitting prime minister or president.
They founded a website and wrote a book both titled: “Giving Wisely: The Israel Guide to Non-Profit Organizations.” The book contained profiles of nearly 30,000 Israeli and nonprofit organizations. The website was closed down about six years ago, after the Israeli government took over the function of vetting nonprofits.
Jaffe founded the Israel Free Loan Association, which assisted the needy and new immigrants with interest-free loans; they also spent time working out personal repayment plans with them that also allowed others to benefit from such loans.
 They are survived by their four children, grandchildren and other family members.

REUTERS: Medical marijuana company CanniMed Therapeutics Inc has asked Canadian regulators to intervene as it seeks to prevent a hostile takeover by bigger rival Aurora Cannabis Inc.
Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based CanniMed said on Monday it asked the Financial and Consumer Affairs Authority of Saskatchewan and the Ontario Securities Commission to declare that Aurora's move to take its buyout offer directly to CanniMed shareholders constituted an insider bid.
An insider bid is a takeover offer made by a company insider or their affiliates within a year before the bid. Canadian securities laws demand disclosure, review and approval processes in the event of such a bid to protect minority shareholders.
CanniMed said SaskWorks Venture Fund Inc, Apex Investments LP, Golden Opportunities Fund Inc and Vantage Asset Management Inc - its "locked-up" shareholders - acted jointly with Aurora.
Alberta-based Aurora offered to buy CanniMed last month but CanniMed adopted a plan to prevent shareholders from entering agreements with Aurora, viewing the deal to be "coercive."
"We had hoped to make this a friendly and collaborative process, but Mr. Zettl (CanniMed CEO Brent Zettl) refuses to even pick up the phone or return our calls to have a discussion," Aurora said on Monday in response to CanniMed's move.

Aurora has sought acquisitions to expand in Canada and abroad amid expectations that Canada will soon legalize the production, sale and consumption of recreational marijuana.
Shares of CanniMed, which were down about 1 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Monday morning, have risen 28 percent since Aurora made its offer on Nov. 14.

China will take action to defend its interests if the United States damages trade ties, the Ministry of Commerce said on Tuesday, after U.S. President Donald Trump authorized an inquiry into China's alleged theft of intellectual property.
BEIJING: China will take action to defend its interests if the United States damages trade ties, the Ministry of Commerce said on Tuesday, after U.S. President Donald Trump authorized an inquiry into China's alleged theft of intellectual property.
Trump's move, the first direct trade measure by their administration against China, comes at a time of heightened tension over North Korea's nuclear ambitions, though it is unlikely to prompt near-term change in commercial ties.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will have a year to look into whether to launch a formal investigation of China's policies on intellectual property, which the White House and U.S. industry groups say are harming U.S. businesses and jobs.
The United States should respect objective facts, act prudently, abide by its World Trade Organization pledges, and not destroy principles of multilateralism, an unidentified spokesperson of China's Ministry of Commerce said in a statement.
"If the U.S. side ignores the facts, and disrespects multilateral trade principles in taking actions that harms both sides trade interests, China will absolutely not sit by and watch, will inevitably adopt all appropriate measures, and resolutely safeguard China's lawful rights."
The ministry said the United States should "treasure" the cooperation and favorable state of China-U.S. trade relations, and warned that any U.S. action to damage ties would "harm both sides trade relations and companies".

China was continuously strengthening its administrative and judicial protections for intellectual property, the ministry added.
China's policy of forcing foreign companies to turn over technology to Chinese joint venture partners and failure to crack down on intellectual property theft have been longstanding problems for several U.S. administrations.
Trump administration officials have estimated that theft of intellectual property by China could be worth as much as US$600 billion.
Experts on China trade policy said the long lead time could allow Beijing to discuss some of the issues raised by Washington without being seen to cave to pressure under the threat of reprisals.

China repeatedly rebuffed attempts by previous U.S. administrations to take action on its IP practices, and has insisted it rigorously protects intellectual property.
State news agency Xinhua said the U.S. investigation is a unilateralist "baring of fangs" that will hurt both sides.
Jacob Parker, vice president of China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council said Trump's memo is only the beginning of the process, but that they expected a decision on how to move forward from the administration in 60-90 days.
"I think it will be much faster than a year," Parker said.
Coming to terms on a bilateral investment treaty would be a better way to get China to address the IP issues, they added.
"This isn't a surprise. Our companies have been honing their crisis communications and internal planning processes since the election. The rhetoric that came up during the campaign led them to take proactive action then. They are prepared, aware and ready for these types of actions going forward."
The investigation is likely to cast a shadow over U.S. relations with China, its largest trading partner, just as Trump is asking it to put more pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear programm.
Trump has suggested they would be more amenable to going easy on China over trade if it were more aggressive in reining in North Korea.
China has said the issues of trade with the United States should not be linked to the North Korea problem.
Ken Jarrett, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, said in a statement on Tuesday that trade and North Korea should not be linked, but that the investigation was a "measured and necessary step".
"The president's executive order reflects building frustration with Chinese trade and market entry policies, particularly those that pressure American companies to part with technologies and intellectual property in exchange for market access," they said.
"Chinese companies operating in the United States do not face this pressure."

There is belief in Toronto. And probably a lot of panic in Washington.
The Toronto Maple Leafs were able to get the upper hand in their first-round series against the Washington Capitals on Monday night thanks to a 4-3 come-from-behind win that was capped off with Tyler Bozak‘s overtime goal just 1:37 into the extra period.
Every game in this series has now gone to overtime.
There were two key turning points in this game.
The first one came in the second period when the Capitals had a two-goal lead a full two-minute, 5-on-3 advantage. It was a perfect opportunity to put the game away. But the Capitals not only failed to capitalize and add to their lead, they allowed Toronto to score two late second period goals to tie the game.
But the biggest turning point came in the closing seconds of a frantic third period that saw the two teams exchange chances when Lars Eller was assessed a high-sticking penalty with just 16 seconds to play in regulation. That power play carried over to the overtime period and resulted in Bozak's game-winning goal (which you can see in the video above).
It's not a surprise the Maple Leafs are giving the Capitals a fight in this series. After all, even though they are a young team it is still one that has an impressive amount of talent and has played at a pretty high level for the past few months. But the fact they have the Presidents' Trophy winning team on the ropes heading into Game 4 is probably something that not many people expected when the series began.

The "Big Ben" bell in the British parliament's famous clock tower will cease its regular bongs at noon on August 21, falling silent for most of the next four years while renovation works are carried out, the House of Commons said on Monday.
LONDON: The "Big Ben" bell in the British parliament's famous clock tower will cease its regular bongs at noon on August 21, falling silent for most of the next four years while renovation works are carried out, the House of Commons said on Monday.
The hammers which have struck the 13.7 tonne bell every hour for most of the last 157 years will be locked and disconnected from the clock, although the bongs will still sound for important events such as New Year's Eve celebrations.
"This essential programme of works will safeguard the clock on a long term basis, as well as protecting and preserving its home, the Elizabeth Tower," said Steve Jaggs, Keeper of the Great Clock.
The Palace of Westminster on the bank of the River Thames, home to parliament, is a world heritage site and major tourist attraction, and Jaggs encouraged members of the public to gather in nearby Parliament Square to hear the final bongs next Monday.
The 96-metre-tall Elizabeth Tower, believed to be the most photographed building in the United Kingdom, is already half enveloped in scaffolding as part of a major renovation project.
As part of the works the clock housing Big Ben will be dismantled and each cog examined and restored. The clock's four dials will be cleaned and repaired, their cast iron framework renewed and the hands removed and refurbished.

One working clock face will remain visible at all times, telling the time silently, and it will be powered by a modern electric motor until the original clockwork mechanism is reinstated.
All the other bells which chime every 15 minutes will be silent as well during the works that are due to be completed in 2021 when Big Bell's familiar tolls will begin again.

(Reuters Health) - Parents can make the most of their time at their child's routine pediatrician visits by preparing for each appointment, according to a new resource published in JAMA Pediatrics.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children see a pediatrician regularly and often during their first three years of life.

"Parents' time is becoming more and more precious, and these appointments are so frequent, that we want to help people make the most of that time," said Dr. Maheen Quadri of Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, who co-wrote the one-page primer intended for parents and caregivers.
"One of the most important things we do during these visits is give vaccines," Quadri said in a phone interview. "Before appointments, it's important to know what's up-to-date."
The freely accessible patient page (https://bit.ly/2MJ6OyI) emphasizes the best ways for parents to prepare children and their medical files before meeting with doctors.
"It's also really valuable to have that one-on-one time with a doctor, especially when we have so many resources online with different medical advice," they said. "Having that connection with a person who has expertise can be a source of support as you go through the new experience of parenting."

Quadri and co-author Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison first recommend knowing your child's history and family's history to ensure that medical records are accurate and up-to-date. Don't forget to transfer them if seeing a new clinician, and consider taking a folder with your child's records to appointments.
The doctor will ask questions about your child's health, your family's health and your child's development at every visit. It helps to be familiar with developmental milestones, such as crawling, walking, and different phases of talking. The doctor may ask you to fill out development questionnaires to assess how your child's growth is progressing, so pay attention to these milestones between visits.
"Many parents don't realize that yearly health supervision or 'check-up' visits are recommended for children age 3 (years) and up as well," said Dr. Jennifer Shu of Children's Medical Group in Atlanta, Georgia, who is also medical editor of HealthyChildren.org.
"When children are younger and making frequent visits to the pediatrician for routine immunizations and the expected toddler illnesses, going to the doctor is top-of-mind," they told Reuters Health by email. "Once kids start elementary school, check-ups can fall out of habit."
The patient resource also recommends bringing a list of questions about health and development topics to visits. For questions about movements or behaviors, for instance, consider bringing a picture or video. For children who take medicine, including inhalers, it helps to bring the drugs to the visit to confirm current doses and ask any questions.
It's also important to talk to your child before the visit to prepare for it. This can depend on your child's age and maturity, but in general, it is best to be as honest as you can about the visit and what it will involve, including undressing or physical exams. Talk about the possibility of shots and blood tests, and explain that these are normal to do. Try to schedule a fun activity after the visit to reward your child for a job well done, and avoid describing doctor visits or vaccines as punishments or part of behavior negotiations.
For the times when you're waiting at the doctor's office, consider bringing drinks, snacks, books and toys. Think of this as protected time you get to spend with your child.
"I encourage parents to pick a time of year that's convenient and easy to remember so it becomes a yearly routine," Shu said. "For example, some of my patients like to bring all of their kids at the same time while on summer break."
Shu takes their daughter to the pediatrician every fall on their birthday so they can get a flu vaccine at the same time. Other parents plan annual check-ups when school, sports or camp forms are needed.
"Some families have experiences with the healthcare system that aren't always the most positive, and seeing a doctor often can seem uncomfortable or strange," Quadri said. "We're here to support parents, answer their questions and monitor their child's development over time."

Josh Homme has recorded a bedtime story for CBeebies, which will air tonight (Friday, October 6) at 6.50pm.
The Queens of The Stone Age frontman follows in the footsteps of Tom Hardy and Elbow's Guy Garvey in providing a soothing way for the nation's little ones to be lulled to sleep. Well, possibly.
For the uninitiated under-fives, Homme is a constant member in a changing lineup of the US rock act, which has seen Nirvana / Foo Fighters mainman Dave Grohl appear on drums, while members of grunge royalty Soundgarden and Pearl Jam have also guested over the years.
Homme recorded the Cbeebies piece just before their surprise performance at Reading & Leeds festival this summer.
Earlier this year, Captain America actor Chris Evans appeared on bedtime stories, the latest in a line of unexpected guest readers on BBC children's TV, which goes back to talents as diverse as Rik Mayall and Prince Charles taking to the Jackanory reader's chair.
Channel NewsAsia's correspondent Victoria Jen shows us three of their favourite watering holes in the capital of Taiwan.
TAIPEI: For many journalists like myself, having a drink at the end of a long day helps us unwind and relax. Living in Taipei, I must say I'm spoiled for choice, especially since the capital is famous for its nightlight. From trendy speakeasy bars to sophisticated lounges, elaborate cocktails to hipster craft beers, there's something for everyone.
Personally, I prefer bars that are quiet so I can have my drinks in peace and simply relax. It's not easy for me to pick a favourite one since so many of them are unique in their own ways, but here are three of my preferred bars.
OUNCE
Hidden inside an ordinary-looking cafe, Ounce is definitely one of my favourite bars, hands down. To get in, press a special button on the wall and the door will be opened by the bartender.

The dim lighting and the rustic wooden furnishings give this place a sense of elegance and serenity. But what I love most are the drinks – they can be specially concocted for you. Bartender Morris knows that I like my drinks a tad sour and not too sweet, so they made me some drinks that I fell in love with instantly. The first one is Maid in Cube, using white rum, lime juice, syrup, cucumber, aspen, and soda water. The second drink is Please Don't Tell, which is a variation of Mezcal Mule, using vodka, cucumber, passion fruit, ginger, and lime juice.
And the third tipple that made my list is by bar owner Yee Soong. The Pisco Punch is a delicious drink using Pisco, lime juice, cacao, simple syrup, chocolate bitters, egg white and Islay whisky spritz.
Thirty-five-year-old Soong is from New Jersey and they started the bar five years ago. Their dream was to bring the New York bar culture to Taiwan. They take pride in serving handcrafted drinks that cater to the taste of each guest, and they also hope to educate those who come to their bar on the art of cocktail making.
In 2016, Ounce was ranked 40th in Asia's top 50 best bar.
Ounce is located at No 40, Lane 63, Section 2, Dunhua South Road, Taipei. But it's the process of moving to another location in the Hsinyi District. Watch this space.
MORTON'S THE STEAKHOUSE

This place is not only just a steak house but it is also a bar. It's Power Hour runs from Monday to Friday, between 5pm and 7pm. Besides its extensive wine selection, Morton's also offers great bar bites at reasonable prices. My favourite things to eat? The delicious Crab Spinach and Artichoke Dip, and Four Petite Filet Mignon Sandwiches. The portions are quite generous, so you can order a few dishes to fill in as dinner. That is if you eat early.
But the best part of this bar is the view. The landmark skyscraper Taipei 101 stands right before it. But why take my word for it? Here's a unblocked view with a glass of red.
The best part about Morton's? The stunning view. (Photo: Victoria Jen)
Located on the 45th floor of Breeze Xinyi, Morton's has a sizable outdoor deck that provides a stunning view of the sunset. It also gives you an incredible glimpse of Taipei city. But the deck is only open if the weather condition is favourable.

ZHANG MEN BREWING (NEIHU)
More than 20 types of beer are available on tap at Zhang Men Brewing. (Photo: Victoria Jen)
I'm not big on beers but the offerings at Zhang Men Brewing are surprisingly delectable, with over 20 choices of fresh beer on the tap. Founded in 2014 by a group of IT professionals, their passion for beer pushed them to start Zhang Men Brewing. The offerings on display are brewed in its own brewery in Taiwan, with most of the ingredients imported. You also get to taste the beer before you order.
My favorite is #18 Hoppy Weizen, which is surprisingly easy on the palate. (I was told it's quite popular with women.) The #11 Berliner Weisse on the other hand, tastes more like lemon juice than beer.

The ambience at Zhang Men Brewing is relaxing and the service impeccable. It's usually not very crowded, so it's a nice spot to hang out when you need some peace and quiet.
Zhang Men Brewing (Neihu) is located at No 189-3, Section 6, Minchuan East Road, Taipei.
An association of railway users has alleged that the new IRCTC website was imposing Hindi on non-Hindi speaking population of Tamil Nadu, accusing the catering and tourism arm of Indian Railways of promoting Hindi through its ticket booking portal.In a letter addressed to IRCTC as well as to the Railway Minister's office, the Kanyakumari District Railway Users' Association (KKDRUA) has alleged that the IRCTC's new website www.irctc.co.in for Indian railway ticket reservation is available in only two versions - Hindi and English and no other regional languages."We found a lot of Hindi imposition in your IRCTC English version web site service. If we type travel source and destination it is coming Hindi first then English. Already full Hindi version website is available. Why impose Hindi script in English version website? The Hindi speaking people will book the ticket from Hindi version website," the organisation president P Edward Jeni wrote in their letter.Jeni further said the Official Language Act, 1976 was not applicable to Tamil Nadu and the people of the state neither read, write nor speak Hindi."May I request you to ensure that Hindi is not imposed on non-Hindi speaking Indians. You have got facility from the Ministry of Railways only for ticket reservation purpose. Your job is not to promote the Hindi language."Give respect to native people by including their native language in your products. Imposing Hindi is against linguistic equality and consumer rights. We hope you will respect our sentiments and stop imposing Hindi on non-Hindi natives," Jeni said, demanding that all Hindi texts in the English version of IRCTC website be removed and create Tamil version of IRCTC website for the benefit of the eight crore people of Tamil Nadu.KKDRUA has earlier pushed successfully for issuing of unreserved tickets in Tamil language just a couple of months ago.
Two men are behind bars after deputies found 32 lbs. of pot in their vehicle.
The Canadian County Sheriff's Office stopped Laron Smith and Jermaine Hutchinson along I-40 on May 17. According to deputies, the stop was made because Smith was weaving from lane to lane around two in the morning.
Deputies used a drug dog to search the vehicle and placed both men inside their patrol car. Inside the trunk of the vehicle, deputies found 14 vacua sealed bags of marijuana.
While deputies were checking the trunk both suspects were able to jump out of the patrol car are run away.
Smith was found a few minutes later. Hutchinson wasn't arrested until Friday, May 25.
“Clearly, I'm glad we intercepted this illegal load of marijuana, but even more so that these outlaws will be held accountable for their criminal acts,” said Chris West, Canadian County Sheriff.
Both men are facing drug trafficking, conspiracy, and escaping from custody complaints.
Dear Amy: We live out of town from our son, daughter-in-law and our three precious grandchildren. We fly to their town monthly to see them.
Our daughter-in-law's mother lives around the corner.  They are divorced and their life is completely devoted to their daughter, our son and the grandchildren.
They have no boundaries and gives us no time alone with the kids when we visit.
I once tried to talk with them about it, but they ignored my thoughts.
Our son and daughter-in-law won't address this.
I once asked if we could spend some time alone with the grandchildren, and our DIL replied with a nasty text saying how dare I expect their mom to sit home alone while we're all together when visiting.
 They are with them all weekend — every week.
Our grandkids come to visit us one or two times a year and that is all the alone-time we have.
We've tried to discuss this with our son privately, but they get defensive.
We fear risking an estrangement if we bring this up again.
Any thoughts on how we can handle this?
— Sad and Disheartened Grandparents
Dear Sad: Because this grandmother is so intimately involved in this family's life, a grandchildren extraction could be extremely difficult. Presumably the couple relies on them for lots of help with the children. You may also assume that they either like them very much and value their presence in their lives, or they need/want the help so much that they are willing to tolerate their boundary-leaping omnipresence.
Because your daughter-in-law was so rude and hostile toward your idea of seeing the children on their own — and your son is so disappointingly passive — if you want to risk one more “ask,” you should appeal directly to the grandmother. Act as if you are asking their permission, and they might grant it.
Say, “We enjoy seeing you during our visits, but we'd also love to spend some alone-time with just us and the kids. Would you mind if we took them out by ourselves one afternoon while we're here? We'd really appreciate it.”
Dear Amy: Last week, my favorite uncle passed away unexpectedly. I am not on speaking terms with their daughter, my cousin.
They have a long history of verbally degrading me, then insisting I'm “too sensitive” or “mentally unstable” when I get upset. I believe this stems from their own insecurity issues, but after 30 years, I had to put up some boundaries for my own well-being.
I maintained a positive relationship with their parents. I attended my uncle's funeral, was civil and polite to my cousin and directly expressed my condolences to them
The morning before the funeral, I was still Facebook friends with my uncle. I showed my husband pictures of trips we'd gone on together, as well as conversations we had about books.
Sometime after the funeral, I was deleted from my uncle's Facebook friend list and all of our mutual posts were wiped out. I suspect my cousin did this, and I appear to be the only family member eliminated — even my husband is still on their “friends” list.
While I understand that the important memories are the ones I carry with me, I can't help but feel incredibly hurt.
I texted my cousin asking to be added back, but so far I have heard nothing. I don't want to bother my aunt with this because they are dealing with their own grief right now, and I don't want to strain my relationship with them
Should I cut my losses and try to move on from here? Are there options I am missing?
— Upset
Dear Upset: If your cousin controls your late uncle's Facebook page, I don't think there is any way to be added back without them approving it. They sound petty and punitive. Stay in touch with your aunt, but don't ask them to intervene.
I hope you will anchor now to the laudable and loving relationship you had with your uncle, and let these positive memories sustain you. This might be the best you can do.
Dear Amy: Regarding how to address in-laws, before I married, my future mother-in-law addressed the name issue by saying, “If your parents weren't alive I'd hope you would call us “Mom and Dad,” but since they are, it would be disrespectful for us to expect you to call us anything but Sue and Bob.”
I was always grateful for them to have solved this dilemma for me before it even became an issue.
— Grateful DIL
Dear Grateful: This is ideal.

Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has made fun of U.S. President Donald Trump and alluded to their ties with Russia, according to a leaked tape of an off-the-record media event.
MELBOURNE: Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has made fun of U.S. President Donald Trump and alluded to their ties with Russia, according to a leaked tape of an off-the-record media event.
Turnbull, who had a frosty first telephone call with the U.S. president early this year, was recorded mimicking Trump at a media ball at Parliament House in Canberra late on Wednesday, which was strictly off the record.
"The Donald and I ... we are winning in the polls. We are! Not the fake polls. We are winning in the real polls. You know, the online polls. They are so easy to win," Turnbull said in the leaked recording, adding: "I have this Russian guy..."
An Australian journalist later broadcast the recording saying because they had not been at the event, they were not bound by the confidentiality rule.
Turnbull later told the 3AW radio station they were disappointed by the leak, which they said was a breach of protocol.

They said their "affectionately light-hearted" speech was a "good humoured roast" in which they were the butt of their own jokes.
The U.S. embassy in Canberra said it understood that the Mid-Winter Ball was the equivalent of the White House Correspondents' Dinner, an annual Washington event at which the media and president traditionally rib each other.
"We take this with the good humour that was intended," the embassy said.
Turnbull was one of the first foreign leaders Trump spoke to after they took office on Jan. 20.
During their telephone call, the president became irritated about an agreement made by their Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, to accept as many as 1,250 refugees held in Australian processing centres on remote Pacific islands.
In return, Australia would resettle refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.
Trump broke off what was supposed to be an hour-long call after 25 minutes and later tweeted that the refugee agreement was "dumb".
Vice President Mike Pence visited Australia in April and made clear that while Trump was not happy about the refugee agreement, the United States would honour it.
The two leaders were all smiles during their first face to face meeting in New York last month, when they declared that they "get along great".

Special to the Sun
The Kitchener Panthers jumped out to a 10-0 lead after four innings and held on for an 11-8 win over the Toronto Maple Leafs in Intercounty Baseball League action on Wednesday night at Christie Pits.
Yorris Borroto drove in four runs and Andy Leader belted a home run and had two RBIs to lead the Kitchener (6-2) offence. The Panthers, who finished with 14 hits, also got a pair of RBIs from Mike Gordner.
Kitchener starter Yonder Martinez (1-0) went 5.2 innings, giving up six runs on eight hits and three walks, while striking out five to pick up the win. Miguel Lahera pitched a clean ninth, striking out one, to pick up the save.
The Leafs (5-3) cut the lead to 10-8 with six runs in the sixth and two more in the seventh inning, but it would be as close they would get.
RJ Page (1-2) took the loss on the mound for Toronto, giving up seven runs, five earned, over two innings. They gave up six hits & walked two, while striking out a pair.
Grant Tamane and Garret Takamatsu each had two hits and two RBIs for the Leafs. Zac Orchard belted their first home run of the season in a losing cause.
The Leafs are back in action Saturday when travel to take on the Guelph Royals. Game time is 1 p.m.
LONDON: A rare parchment copy of the American Declaration of Independence has been found at a British archive among the papers of an aristocrat who supported the rebels, officials have said.
The manuscript was discovered at the West Sussex Record Office in the southern English city of Chichester by a team of researchers led by two Harvard University academics.

Tests supported the hypothesis that it was produced in the 1780s, West Sussex County Council said earlier this week - just a few years after the declaration itself was issued in 1776.
The document "is the only other contemporary manuscript copy of the Declaration of Independence on parchment apart from the signed copy at the National Archives in Washington DC," known as the Matlack Declaration, a council statement said earlier this week.
There are other printed parchment copies and handwritten copies on paper but the Sussex Declaration, as it has been dubbed, and the Matlack Declaration in Washington are the only two known ceremonial parchment copies of the declaration.
Multi-spectral imaging of the document "revealed a date beneath an erasure on the document" which reads either "Jul 4, 178" or Jul 4, 179", researchers said.

The fourth digit for the year may have been permanently erased.
The Harvard Gazette said the clerk drawing up the document was "inexperienced" as the date was written on a slight downward slant and the year of the production of the document was used rather than the year in which the declaration was enacted.
Adopted on Jul 4, 1776, the declaration states that 13 American colonies then at war with Britain would regard themselves as independent sovereign states no longer under British rule.
Jul 4 is celebrated as Independence Day in the United States.
SHEEPSKIN PARCHMENT
Researchers said X-ray fluorescence analysis of the document found a high iron content in holes in the corner of the parchment, indicating that nails may have been used to hang it.
DNA tests also revealed the parchment was made of sheepskin.
The parchment is believed to originally belong to Charles Lennox, the Third Duke of Richmond, an army officer and politician known as the "Radical Duke" for their support of American colonists during the Revolution.
The Harvard Gazette said the most interesting feature of the document was its treatment of the list of signatories.
"In contrast to all other 18th-century versions of the declaration, on this parchment the list of signatories was not grouped by states.
"The team hypothesises that this detail supported efforts ... to argue that the authority of the declaration rested on a unitary national people, and not on a federation of states," it said.
Harvard academics Emily Sneff and Danielle Allen carried out the research along with the West Sussex Record Office, the British Library, the Library of Congress and the University of York.

REIGNING Miss Universe Pia Alonzo Wurtzbach and rumored boyfriend Marlon Stockinger welcomed New Year as they spent the holidays in Hawaii.
Wurtzbach posted two photos of their trip to Hawaii with Stockinger on Instagram.
The first photo showed the Filipino-German beauty queen in two-piece bikini with the F1 race car driver. It was captioned: “My kind of NYE.”
In the second photo, they captioned it: “Happy New Year from Hawaii. 2017 will be just as good.”

The Russian Defence Ministry has drawn up a draft law allowing it to ban soldiers from posting certain personal data on social networks, something that reporters and researchers have used in the past to monitor Russia's activities in Syria and Ukraine.
MOSCOW: The Russian Defence Ministry has drawn up a draft law allowing it to ban soldiers from posting certain personal data on social networks, something that reporters and researchers have used in the past to monitor Russia's activities in Syria and Ukraine.
The draft law, first reported on by the Russian daily Vedomosti on Wednesday, was published on Tuesday and has been reviewed by Reuters.
If approved by parliament and the president, it would allow the defence minister and other high-ranking officials to ban certain groups of servicemen from posting online information that could help identify or geolocate them.
Soldiers would also be obliged to routinely share information about their social media accounts with the authorities.
Despite strict legislation on state secrets, Russian soldiers regularly post sensitive data online.

British researcher Eliot Higgins, founder of the Bellingcat project, which uses open source data to investigate conflicts, says their team identified Russian soldiers involved in the fatal downing of the MH17 passenger plane over eastern Ukraine in 2014 by collecting evidence from social networks.
"You may not believe it but (Russia's) 53rd Air Defence Brigade has a social media page and all the soldiers follow it," Higgins said at one of their presentations on the incident.
They said the information had been shared with the International Joint Investigation Team, the main body investigating the crash.
Russia denies any involvement in downing the plane.

Delta Air Lines has increased the maximum possible payout to passengers to nearly $10,000 if they voluntarily give up a seat on an overbooked flight, the company told AFP Monday.
The boost is part of the airline industry's response to the global outrage sparked by last week's violent removal of a customer from a United Airlines Chicago flight after they resisted being “bumped” by the carrier.
Delta customer service employees will be permitted to offer up to $2,000 in these cases, up from the prior cap of $800.
Supervisors will be able to grant up to $9,950, up from the prior limit of $1,350.
The increases came after United came under fire after it called security officers to forcibly remove passenger David Dao from an overbooked flight in order to seat crew members for another flight.

Video of the episode went viral, sparking calls for greater scrutiny of airlines from politicians.
United, which is undertaking an audit of its practices, already amended some policies, saying it will require employees to be booked at least 60 minutes prior to departure. United evicted Dao and three other passengers from the flight to make room for employees.
The incident shined a new light on the practice of overbooking, which airlines increasingly rely upon to avoid losing money on seats left when some passengers do not show up for scheduled flights.
Delta has described overbooking as a necessary industry practice, in part because of weather uncertainty, and said the process can be managed effectively.
Selfie elbow, tech neck, and gamers thumb arent just colloquial phrases for modern day maladies, but actual health concerns that more and more patients are seeking help for, according to a recent study.
Dr. Alex Lickerman, a direct primary care physician with Chicago-based ImagineMD, partnered with Digital Third Coast to analyze Google search trends and traditional media in an effort to identify the top tech-induced ailments.
The search revealed that devices are causing pain in the thumbs, elbows, neck, eyes, and shoulders the most. The chief complaints varied depending on the area of the country, and according to the study, the top search in Michigan sticks out like a sore thumb.
The only-Michigan specific data we have is that, relative to national norms, Michigan residents are suffering from thumb ailments more than most, said Andy Kerns, Creative Director with Digital Third Coast. We did see a pattern of thumb issues in some of the coldest, most northern states so perhaps joints are quicker to suffer in cold climates; or, if its gaming-related, people are spending more time indoors using devices.

Ohio residents complained about elbow pain, tech users in Nevada said their shoulders ache, necks hurt in Hawaii, and in Florida eye strain was a top concern.
Royal Oak Beaumont Occupational Therapist Samantha Swantek treats a number of patients with hand and thumb pain, although they said its difficult to determine for sure if the pain is directly related to tech use in most cases. However, they did treat a child who suffered hand pain directly related to gaming.
This particular individual went to school and then came home and gamed. They wasnt balancing their activities, Swantek said.
Thumb pain is due to repetitive use when typing or gripping phones, tablets or game controllers. Tendons in the thumb or the base of the thumb become inflamed and constricted leading to pain, swelling, or a sticking sensation when moving. Texting thumb, gamers thumb or smartphone thumb are the top Google search phrases for these conditions, although Swantek said this same problem used to be called Blackberry thumb.
Using a Popsocket (a grip that attaches to the back of your device) may alleviate some pressure, Swantek said. Other options include voice activated texting, setting the device on an angled surface, and setting limits to the amount of time on the tablet or phone.
Elbow pain results from holding arms at closed angles for prolonged periods of time while using a device. Pressure is applied to the nerve that runs through the elbow and tendons in the lower arm, resulting in pain, weakness, and tingling in the ring and pinky fingers.
Leaning the head close to a computer monitor puts strain on the neck, causing pain and tightness in the neck and back muscles. As you flex your neck, the weight of your head becomes higher and higher. When your neck is in a neutral position, it weighs 10 to 12 pounds. If you flex your neck to 60 degrees, the weight of your head can be as much as 60 pounds. Thats a lot of strain on your neck and shoulders, Swantek said.
Tech-related shoulder pain, sometimes searched as mouse shoulder or gorilla arm syndrome on Google, is caused by poor posture while at the computer. Maintaining hunched, rounded shoulders while interacting with devices causes tightness in the neck and back muscles, leading to chronic pain and inflammation.
Moving the monitor to eye level in order to keep the head neutral is a good way to keep the pressure off the neck and shoulders. Or if the device interconnects with the television, consider watching Youtube or other apps on TV. That way youre not bending over as much, Swantek said.
Staring at computers and other screens for too long could lead to headaches, blurred vision, or dry eyes.
The best way to curb any of these ailments is to limit the time spent on electronics, but if thats not an option make sure you take breaks, Swantek said. Even a micro break  a few seconds every few minutes  is helpful. Get up and move regularly, exercise to build muscle, and become mindful of the amount of time youre using your device.
Sometimes people dont realize that theyre working with a device for a long time. If they were working on an assembly line they would have been encouraged to take a break or they would have been told to do a task rotation, Swantek said. People who use their devices for a long time need to do the same thing.
Some honorable mentions from the ImagineMD study include: Nomophobia, a condition in which people experience irrational fears of either being without their device or being unable to use their phone due to poor signal or drained battery; Phantom Vibration Syndrome, the false sensation of ringing or vibrating when its not; and Smartphone Pinky, a temporary (and sometimes imagined) deformation or strain of pinky fingers that are normally tasked with supporting large smartphones.
Breast cancer patients should be given better access to support after their hospital treatment ends, a charity has said.
The call from Breast Cancer Care comes after a new poll found that many women said b eing discharged from hospital care was one of the hardest moments to face.
The survey of 800 British women who had undergone treatment for breast cancer found that more than a quarter (26%) said their hospital treatment ending was harder than having a breast removed or going through chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
Only one in 10 said they felt positive and ready to move on when they were discharged from hospital treatment.
Just over half (53%) said they struggled with anxiety at the end of treatment and 31% said they suffered with depression, according to the charity - which has just launched a new app - BECCA - offering support for women when they finish treatment.
David Crosby, director of services and engagement at Breast Cancer Care, said: "F or the majority of women, breast cancer doesn't stop when hospital treatment ends.
"Getting back to 'normal' can feel like a huge mountain to climb, and many find that leaving hospital after their last appointment is the hardest moment of all.
"Those who have faced breast cancer have already been through enough, and should not be left to cope alone with ongoing mental health issues, debilitating physical side effects and constant fear of what lies ahead.
"The NHS must ensure every breast cancer patient has access to support once their hospital treatment ends. Despite commitments to make this happen, there has been worryingly little progress to turn this promise into reality."
One patient, Katie Akerman, said they struggled with anxiety after treatment. The 46-year-old from Chichester said: "After attending hospital on a weekly basis for treatment, once it's finished you're just sent on your way and it feels like nobody is looking out for you any more.
"I couldn't put a name to it but I just felt panic-stricken. My anxiety was controlling me and I didn't have anywhere to turn.
"There needs to be more out there to help women understand what they're going through and cope with the aftermath of cancer."
In a statement, authorities explained that the new game, “complements Dubai Chamber's efforts to strengthen the emirate's reputation as a thriving centre of commerce and a leading tourist destination”.
Hamad Buamim, President and CEO, DCCI, said that the Chamber adopted an innovative and creative approach when it came to developing the board game.
“By launching this unique initiative, we will promote Dubai's brand and boost its international profile. Last year, the Chamber received over 600 international delegations and participated in more than 70 events abroad. Dubai-Opoly offers an ideal platform to showcase what Dubai has to offer businesses and tourists, while it also merges these two concepts together in a fun and interactive way,” Buamim said.
Buamim added that Dubai-Opoly is expected to have a strong appeal among all segments of the Dubai's society as it celebrates some of the most popular aspects of living and doing business in the emirate.
Phil Keoghan of “The Amazing Race,” which amazingly left CBS-TV's longtime Sunday slot and is now back on Thursdays:
“This week's episode is 22 diverse strangers who've never met, no husbands and wives, no friends, and have nothing to do with each other and take days just to learn everyone's names. They line up in LA, then race around the world and vie to win $1 million.
“Filming in Zanzibar, this ‘Roadblock' episode had one team make a kitchen implement. Sounds easy, but they had to cut a ladle from a mass of tin, mould the actual metal, turn it, shape it, forge it. It was earsplitting sounds of unending clanging metal among people who knew how to do it, and it was in an African industrial area.
“Many had headaches. There was desperation. I can't give away what happens.”
So why did the show leave its Sunday berth?
“I don't know. It was a lovely time slot. But TV habits are changing. No longer a three-network system. Now viewers watch not by appointment but by whenever they choose to watch. This new 10 p.m. Thursday period is, I think, to help CBS with that hour that's sometimes slow. Ours is a family show so we'll see how it works for us.”
Busier than a three-armed ladle-maker, Keoghan's also pushing “Le Ride.”
“It's a documentary about the first Tour de France. I re-created it on the same vintage 1928 bike which then had no gears and weighed twice what today's bikes do. I duplicated the same journey — over the Alps and Pyrenees.”
It screens 7 p.m. Tuesday at 42nd's Regal Cinema.
And the wheels he'll take to get there?
Taxi.

Aaron Carter was sued for stalking their former manager before checking into rehab, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.
Carter, 29, was hit with a domestic – stalking injunction charge on Aug. 14 after Jonathan Lewandowski filed a petition in Pinellas county court, according to a County docket obtained by Radar. Specifics of the case are unknown, but a clerk confirmed that the case was dismissed just days later on Aug. 25.
The “I Want Candy” singer checked into rehab almost a month later on Sept. 22, but stopped their treatment just two weeks later.

“He did not want to leave the facility but had no choice,” an insider told Radar. “His financial affairs were falling apart and they needed to go back to Florida to fix the problems.”
“Aaron has left the facility where they have been working on their wellness. Several legal and personal matters arose that required their immediate and in-person attention,” their publicist Steve Honig explained in a statement. “He is still very much committed to their wellness and will be continually working toward being the best person possible.”
Carter began their treatment after testing positive for opiates on The Doctors in September and their friends called local police to report that they were “on the verge of death”

Lewandowski and Carter's short-lived work relationship lasted from when they were arrested for DUI in July until they broke up with Madison Parker and came out as bisexual in August.
Lewandowski was previously involved in legal battles with ex-clients Kim Kardashian and Kim Zolciak. Carter's rep had no comment on the case.

Business leaders are calling on Chancellor Philip Hammond to tackle anomalies in the tax system that see high street shops pay higher rates on small premises than online giants do for vast warehouses.
The Institute of Directors (IoD) said the Chancellor should use next month's Budget to set up a New Economy Tax Commission to make the system fit for the modern age of internet shopping and the "platform economy".
With many small shops and pubs bracing themselves for sharp rises in their tax bills due to business rate revaluations this year, the IoD called for further relief for businesses based in properties worth up to £100,000.
In its Budget submission, the IoD also urged Mr Hammond to commit to matching US President Donald Trump if they slash corporation taxes to 15%, as they have promised. At present, the Government is promising a cut to 17% by 2020.
And it called for:
An increase from £200,000 to £1 million in the cap on the Annual Investment Allowance, which offers tax relief on plant and machinery purchases.
The creation of a "white-list" of acceptable tax-planning schemes.
Consultation on liberalising complex investment schemes for start-ups.
"In the short term, the Government must take action to relieve some of the pressure on the small businesses facing hikes in business rates and encourage companies to bring forward productivity-boosting investment.
"But we should also look to the future, launching a new Tax Commission to look at what the growth of self-employment and online business mean for the tax system. The goal must be a much more level playing field, which treats both high street and online businesses fairly and adapts to the growth of the 'platform economy', which is leading to an increase in flexible work."
The Treasury pointed out that the retail sector as a whole would see a 6% fall in its business rates bill - a saving of £400 million - following the revaluation, with a third of all businesses never having to pay rates again.
A spokesperson said: "All taxes are kept under review and any changes are announced at fiscal events."
The Kia Carens – What Is It? And Why Should You Pay Attention?
The Kia Carens is a seven-seater people-mover disguised as a premium hatchback. Here's why you should pay attention.
India, as a market, has people wanting more from less. That about sums up everything from power and economy, to quality and price. With the people-carrier space vastly lacking in credible offerings department, there is room for someone who has a complete package, which doesn't compromise on safety or equipment, to take it by storm.
Hyundai have been on a roll here in India, with increasingly capable offerings across all price-tags. From the Santro in 1998, to the Grand i10 of today, they've come a long way indeed. However, what they're missing, is a seven-seat contender in the volume segment. And that's where the Carens, from the Korean major's economy brand Kia, comes in.
Kia have already announced their entry into India. They have mentioned as many as three made-in-India cars that will form the bread-and-butter, as well as their double-omelette-bun-maska–chai, car lines here in India. The brand became more popular after a certain hit auto programme aired on BBC2 announced the Kia “cee apostrophe d” as their “reasonably priced car” from a pool that spanned several big names. A sign of things to come?
The Kia Carens is on sale in the UK from £19,300 (Rs 16.4 lakh). Let's not forget that the price is inclusive of mandatory safety features including six airbags, ABS, and traction control. Strip out those to meet our budding safety standards, and the price will come tumbling down. For reference, the Hyundai (Elite) i20 starts from £9,995 (Rs 8.5 lakh) for the base version, which, in India, is priced at Rs 5.3 lakh – 37.5 per cent lower. That puts the Carens' starting price, by mere calculation, at just over Rs 10 lakh. So, what do you get for those 10 lakh, or one million rupees?
The Carens is a right-hand-drive, seven-seater that offers a choice of modern equipment as well as immense flexibility. Want to know what the base model offers? Here's the list: air-conditioning, all-round power windows with auto up and down function, electrically-adjustable and heated door mirrors, Bluetooth with voice recognition and music streaming, USB and AUX ports, cruise control with speed limiter, flex steer (Normal, Comfort, and Sport modes), Electronic Stability Control (ESC), Vehicle Stability Management (VSM), projector headlamps, with levelling, cornering lights, and LED daytime running lights, rear wiper with washer, body-coloured mirrors, door-handles, and bumpers, and 16-inch alloy wheels. And that's the base model in the UK.
The top-end car has auto park, a reversing camera, a panoramic sunroof, 17-inch alloy wheels, a 10-way adjustable driver's seat, and an eight-inch touchscreen, among other things. Other things which can be mixed and matched for a vehicle portfolio in India. Especially one meant for seven passengers. Take away the heating, cruise control, ESC, VSM, flex steer, and some inconspicuous goodies and the price tag will fall from Rs 10 lakh to well below Rs 8 lakh. Seems interesting now, doesn't it?
Then, there are the powertrain choices. The UK models get a 1.6-litre petrol and 1.7-litre turbo-diesel. That's the same as the Hyundai Elantra in some global markets. However, here in India, as the new Verna has demonstrated, we can have a pair of 1.6-litre petrol and diesel engines. Over 120 PS is far more than what is needed for everyday, even highway, use.
The Kia Carens measures 4,525 mm long, 1,805 mm wide, 1,605 mm high, and runs a 2,750 mm wheelbase. It can seat seven, or offer up to 1,650 litres of boot volume. Priced competitively, it would take the fight to the Maruti Suzuki Ertiga, Renault Lodgy, and Honda BR-V, let alone some bare-bones basic offerings that wouldn't cut it in the Euro NCAP safety tests.
We say, bring it on, Kia. And get the pro_cee'd and Stinger GT while you're at it.

KARACHI : A petition was filed in the Sindh High Court (SHC) seeking disqualification of Pakistan Peoples' Party (PPP) leader Faryal Talpur on Wednesday.
According to a private television channel report the petitioner Muazzam Abbasi claimed that Faryal Talpur should be disqualified as they held an iqama for Saudi Arabia.
The petitioner claimed that in 2002 the PPP leader had established a company in Dubai in the name of their daughter Ayesha but concealed the amount transferred to Dubai from the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and also didn't mention them Iqama.
The petitioner stated that by submitting fake affidavit, Faryal Talpur is no more Sadiq and Ameen, hence they should be disqualified.
The court ordered to submit details on the case by June 5 and adjourned the hearing.
LONDON: Iran could reduce its co-operation with the UN nuclear watchdog, President Hassan Rouhani told the body's head on Wednesday (Jul 4), after they warned US President Donald Trump of "consequences" of fresh sanctions against Iranian oil sales.
In May, Trump pulled out of a multinational deal under which sanctions on Iran were lifted in return for curbs to its nuclear programme, verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Washington has since told countries they must stop buying Iranian oil from Nov 4 or face financial measures.

"Iran's nuclear activities have always been for peaceful purposes, but it is Iran that would decide on its level of cooperation with the IAEA," Iranian state news agency IRNA quoted Rouhani as saying after meeting IAEA head ​​​​​​​Yukiya Amano in Vienna.
"The responsibility for the change of Iran's cooperation level with the IAEA falls on those who have created this new situation,” they added.
Rouhani said earlier in the day Tehran would stand firm against U.S. threats to cut Iranian oil sales.
"The Americans say they want to reduce Iranian oil exports to zero ... It shows they have not thought about its consequences," Rouhani was quoted as saying by IRNA.

On Tuesday, Rouhani hinted at a threat to disrupt oil shipments from neighbouring countries if Washington tries to cut its exports.
They did not elaborate, but an Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander explicitly said on Wednesday Iran would block any exports of crude for the Gulf in retaliation for hostile US action.
"If they want to stop Iranian oil exports, we will not allow any oil shipment to pass through the Strait of Hormuz,” Ismail Kowsari was quoted as saying by the Young Journalists Club (YJC) website.
Major-General Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Quds force, in charge of foreign operations for the Revolutionary Guards, said in a letter published on IRNA: "I kiss your (Rouhani's) hand for expressing such wise and timely comments, and I am at your service to implement any policy that serves the Islamic Republic."
"SELF HARM"
Rouhani, in Vienna trying to salvage the nuclear deal, said U.S. sanctions were a "crime and aggression", and called on European and other governments to stand up to Trump.
"Iran will survive this round of U.S. sanctions as it has survived them before. This U.S. government will not stay in office forever ... But history will judge other nations based on what they do today," they said.
Rouhani told reporters that if the remaining signatories - the Europeans Britain, France and Germany as well as China and Russia - can guarantee Iran's benefits: "Iran will remain in the nuclear deal without the United States."
Iran's OPEC governor, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, said on the Iranian oil ministry news agency SHANA:
"Trump's demand that Iranian oil should not be bought, and (his) pressures on European firms at a time when Nigeria and Libya are in crisis, when Venezuela's oil exports have fallen due to U.S. sanctions, when Saudi's domestic consumption has increased in summer, is nothing but self harm.
"It will increase the prices of oil in the global markets," they said. "At the end it is the American consumer who will pay the price for Mr. Trump's policy."
The European Union, once Iran's biggest oil importer, has vowed to keep the 2015 deal alive without the United States by trying to keep Iran's oil and investment flowing. But European officials acknowledge that U.S. sanctions make it difficult to give Tehran guarantees.
Foreign ministers from the five remaining signatories will meet Iranian officials in Vienna on Friday to discuss how to keep the accord alive.
Two polls show that between 60-72 percent of Italians want the country to remain part of the euro while 23-24 percent would choose to drop the common currency.
The polls were taken by the Euromedia and Piepoli organizations for state television Rai's "Porta a Porta" program broadcast on Wednesday night.
The euro has become part of the political debate ahead of snap elections expected for later this year or early in 2019.
The Piepoli poll showed that 72 percent wanted to stay, 23 percent wanted to leave, and five percent were undecided.
The Euromedia poll showed that 60 percent wanted to stay, 24 percent wanted to leave, and 16 percent were undecided.
COPENHAGEN: Siemens will close a factory making blades for wind turbines in Engesvang in Denmark and cut 430 jobs, as it is unable to expand the site to meet demand for bigger blades, the company said on Wednesday.
Siemens will instead focus on production of blades for wind turbines at two other plants in Denmark, spokesperson Rasmus Windfeld said.
After the job cuts, Siemens will employ around 6,500 people in Denmark, which is more than the company employed a year ago, they said.

It's been a nice couple days in eyeing how people are celebrating with the Stanley Cup, as we go from furry dogs to hot dogs.
Certain media types will always take their jabs at Phil Kessel. If they were like Patrick Roy, Kessel might respond that they couldn't hear such criticisms, what with their Stanley Cup rings plugging theirs ears.
Why do that when you can celebrate with hot dogs, though?
During their second day with the Stanley Cup as a repeat champion with the Pittsburgh Penguins (his critics are grating their teeth at that one, guaranteed), Kessel is having a great time, including this cheeky celebration via their Instagram:
A post shared by Phil Kessel (@phil_kessel_81_) on Aug 14, 2017 at 2:08pm PDT
It actually seems to be the second shot, as a blurrier photo included this caption:
Hotdogs taste better out of The Cup! #twotime #statestreetbrats
Nice. Delightfully, Joffrey Lupul responded with the same kind of glee most of us experienced.
Kessel also appears to take a page from Sidney Crosby with a little Stanley Cup spooning:
We're really not worthy. (Alt response: “Now, who would trade this guy?”)
Credit Kessel with having a laugh at their critics during their second run. During their first one in 2016, they brought the Stanley Cup to a children's hospital in Toronto, as NHL.com noted.
So, yeah, when it comes to their critics and/or the people who left them off international teams, but they still have their heart in the right place.
You could even say they have their hot dog and eats it too. (Wait, don't.)
“The clashes and escalation of violence in the south of Libya endanger the political process and put Libyan citizens' lives at risk, ” – says the statement of the European External Action Service.
“Libyans deserve peace and stability, and expect all sides to refrain from violence and take measures to de-escalate the tense situation. Libya's political crisis can only be solved through negotiation between all stakeholders based on a willingness to compromise and by putting the interests of Libyans first.”
“The United Nations remains the framework through which the international community continues to support Libya's political settlement. The European Union is determined to continue supporting this process, including through the Libya Quartet with the United Nations as well as the African Union and the Arab League.”

Buoyed by the Supreme Court verdict, the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi wasted no time in asserting its authority by assuming charge of transfers and postings and telling officers to fall in line with the top court's order by speeding up work on its policies, including doorstep delivery of ration.In tweets in the afternoon, CM Arvind Kejriwal trained guns on the Narendra Modi government and alleged that precious three years would have been saved if the Centre had not withdrawn the powers of the elected government through “illegal orders”.“People of Delhi are grateful to judiciary. Today's order reinforces people's faith in judiciary (sic),” they wrote after the apex court handed them a major victory in the power tussle against the Centre.The CM called a Cabinet meeting in which they directed officers to function according to the order of SC. “Also directed to expedite proposals of doorstep delivery of rations and CCTV now," they tweeted.Installation of CCTV cameras and doorstep delivery were the two contentious issues that had caused a bitter standoff between the AAP government and the L-G in Delhi last month, leading to a dharna in the Raj Niwas that lasted eight days. Kejriwal had repeatedly accused L-G Anil Baijal of hobbling their government on the directions of the Centre.An official said that around a dozen proposals such as doorstep delivery of ration, CCTV cameras, regularisation of contractual employees and appointment of teachers will be expedited after the apex court's order.In a landmark order, the Supreme Court on Wednesday clipped the powers of the L-G, saying they have no "independent decision making power" and has to act on the aid and advice of the elected government.The judgment by a five-judge constitution bench, headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra, laid down broad parameters for the governance of the national capital, which has witnessed a bitter power tussle between the Centre and Delhi government since the Aam Aadmi Party government came to power in 2014.In the afternoon, Delhi's deputy CM, Manish Sisodia, told the press that a new system for transfer and postings of bureaucrats has also been introduced with Arvind Kejriwal as the approving authority.So far, the Lieutenant Governor has been the approving authority for transfers and postings of the IAS and DANICS (Delhi, Anadaman and Nicobar Islands Civil Services) officers.Sisodia emphasised that the SC ruling makes it clear that Delhi Assembly and Cabinet has powers over all subjects, except the three exempted: land, law and order, police.“The Modi government had introduced 2 points: that services was not with the state government and that LG will become the decision making authority,” Sisodia said, listing the challenges faced by the Delhi administration.However, senior bureaucrats working with the Delhi government claimed that 'services matter' still lies with the office of Lt Governor because Delhi is a union territory, and services matter does not fall under the concurrent and state lists.A top officer, requesting anonymity, said the Appropriate Regular Bench of the Supreme Court will take a final decision on the service matters and other issues.Another officer claimed that the apex court has not set aside the May, 2015 notification of the Ministry of Home Affairs, according to which services matter lies with the L-G.But Sisodia said the central government and lieutenant governor had "misinterpreted" rules by adding services matter in "reserved subjects" and they should "apologise" for this. Sisodia said the Delhi government doesn't need to get its decision approved by the L-G.
Banjul, Gambia
President Yahya Jammeh says Sunday the West African community's decision to send troops into The Gambia to force them to accept defeat in last month's presidential election, is “a declaration of war”.
Leaders from the Economic Community of West African States, or ECOWAS, deployed troops to The Gambia on Thursday after Jammeh said they would not accept the results of December's election, in which they lost to opposition leader Adama Barrow.
In a New Year's message broadcast on Saturday, Jammeh said the “blatant and one-sided” approach of ECOWAS, “disqualified it from providing mediation services”.
“Let me make very clear, we are ready to defend this country against any aggression,” Jammeh said, adding that if ECOWAS did not back down “the impasse will continue with the risk of escalation into a military confrontation”.
They added, “What we are simply and rightfully asking for is to return to the polls and allow the Gambians to elect who they want to be their president in a free and fair election.”
After more than two decades in power, Jammeh, 51, lost a December 1 election to Barrow, a former real-estate agent.
After initially accepting the result, Jammeh later rejected it, alleging irregularities, and filed a petition to the Supreme Court which is due to be reviewed on January 10.
Barrow has insisted they will take office nine days later, as planned, with ECOWAS leaders set to attend the ceremony.
Earlier this month, ECOWAS said it would stage a military intervention, led by neighbouring Senegal, if Jammeh failed to step down and set a deadline of January 19, the day of Barrow's planned inauguration.
The UN Security Council has called on Jammeh to “fully respect” the election results and ensure Barrow's safety. The electoral commission said Barrow obtained 222,708 votes (43.3 percent) compared with Jammeh's 208,487 (39.6 percent). —Agencies
While several Chargers raved about the atmosphere in StubHub Center for Sunday night's preseason opener against the Seattle Seahawks, attendance for the Chargers' Los Angeles debut did not reflect great enthusiasm for the team.
The announced crowd of 21,054 was about 6,000 shy of the stadium's 27,000-seat capacity and more than 4,500 less than the Galaxy drew Saturday night for a Major League Soccer game against New York City FC.
“It was a lot of fun — there was a lot of energy here today,” guard Matt Slauson said after the Chargers' 48-17 loss. “The players were excited, and we could feel it from the fans.”
That the Carson facility was only 78% full was not out of line with NFL preseason games, many of which have a fair percentage of no-shows. The Rams announced a crowd of 62,888 for Saturday night's game against the Dallas Cowboys, but there were large swaths of empty seats in the Coliseum.
But the number of no-shows Sunday night seemed stark considering that StubHub is less than half the size of every other NFL stadium and the Chargers, with a high-powered offense, were playing their first game in a new city after moving from San Diego.
The smallest crowd the Chargers drew in Qualcomm Stadium last season was 52,165 for their home opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars. They drew 46,524 and 47,407 for preseason home games against the Arizona Cardinals and San Francisco 49ers.
A Chargers spokesperson said Monday that the attendance reflected the actual number of fans in the stadium — not the number of tickets sold — but declined to comment further about the crowd size. All but a few dozen tickets for the Chargers-Seahawks game were sold.
NFL season-ticket packages include eight home games and two preseason games, with fans forced to pay full price for less attractive exhibition games, in which starters rarely play more than a quarter. Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers and most of the other offensive starters played only one series Sunday night.
The Chargers are in the process of selling the remainder of their premium seats, including almost 400 field-level seats in three corners of the stadium.
“I really wasn't expecting a full house,” veteran tight end Antonio Gates said. “I assumed Seattle would bring their fans, and we'd have some Los Angeles fans here to support us. Still, I thought the atmosphere was great.”

Former Mexican first lady Margarita Zavala, a leading contender to become president herself, said on Friday they were breaking with their party, deepening divisions in the opposition ahead of the 2018 presidential election.
MEXICO CITY: Former Mexican first lady Margarita Zavala, a leading contender to become president herself, said on Friday they were breaking with their party, deepening divisions in the opposition ahead of the 2018 presidential election.
Zavala, wife of former President Felipe Calderon, announced their decision to leave the centre-right National Action Party (PAN) in a recorded video broadcast in which they attacked the party leadership for blocking their aspirations.
Since launching their bid for the presidency in June 2015, Zavala has spent months as one of the top contenders in opinion polls, generally just behind former Mexico City Mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a veteran leftist with nationalist leanings.
The election will be held in July 2018, and President Enrique Pena Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) faces an uphill struggle to stay in power. Polls show a tight race, though most candidates have yet to be chosen.
Zavala, 50, said they quit the PAN because the party base had been subordinated to the interests of its leadership, which has forged a cross-party alliance for the election with the centre-left opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD).
"Anti-democratic conditions took hold in the PAN just like we had criticized in the PRI and other parties," they said.

Zavala told Mexican radio that the "broad front" formed by the PAN, the PRD and the centre-left Citizens Movement party meant there would be no internal PAN selection process for the presidential ticket, denying them a chance to be candidate.
The PAN has the most seats of any opposition group in Congress. Party chairperson Ricardo Anaya responded with their own video message, noting the selection process was still open.
Saying they respected Zavala's decision, Anaya nevertheless argued their departure would only benefit the PRI.
A survey in August by polling firm Mitofsky showed the cross-party alliance coming first in a presidential vote with nearly 22 percent support, a few points ahead of the PRI or Lopez Obrador's National Regeneration Movement (MORENA).
However, over 37 percent of voters were still undecided.
Running as an independent, Zavala enters an increasingly crowded field of hopefuls that is due to include a maverick northern governor who broke with the PRI in 2015.
Fernando Belaunzaran, a leading PRD advocate of the cross-party alliance, said they regretted Zavala's decision and that it would have been better to keep them inside the "broad front."
If polls later show Zavala has little chance of winning, the front must be ready to welcome them back, they added. "We've got to the keep the door open," they said.

After the Florence gym floor was flooded by more than an inch of water from a kitchen sink leak, it wasn't hard Friday to find a place to insert a blower underneath the ruined maple floor to try to dry it out.
DOHA: Novak Djokovic battled back from 5-1 down against world number 63 Jan-Lennard Struff to claim their first victory of the season at the Qatar Open on Monday (Jan 2).
The world number two lost their opening two service games and struggled with the German's big serves in the early exchanges.
But the Serb rallied in determined fashion to eventually take the first-round match 7-6 (7/1), 6-3.
"It wasn't a great start, I was 1-5 down, it didn't look very good," Djokovic said after winning in just under 90 minutes.
They attributed their slow start to early-season rustiness rather than any long-term concerns over their form, following a relatively poor second half of the season in 2016.
"I guess I had to get more time to get the engine started. It's the first match of the year, you never know how you're going to start.
"I mean, I was a bit flat on my feet, and Struff, credit to them for playing aggressive, hitting the serves well, and ripping (the) ball from the baseline.
"But I stayed composed because I knew, I believed that I could find the rhythm, start reading their serve better, and that's what happened."
Djokovic, who is the defending champion in Doha, hit 17 winners but also 20 unforced errors.
In total, their opponent thundered down nine aces.
The 12-time Grand Slam winner is looking to reclaim their number one ranking from Andy Murray, who is also in Doha, and is the tournament's number one seed.
If matches go to form the rivals will meet in a mouthwatering final on January 7.
Before the tournament, Murray said Djokovic would be their main rival this season, but the Serb said 2017 would be about more than two players.
"We have the return of (Rafael) Nadal and (Roger) Federer that we cannot count out in any circumstances because of their history and results and the quality of players that they are," they said.
Also on Monday there were victories for Dustin Brown, who edged past Argentina's Facundo Bagnis in three sets in the first round of the singles, 6-1, 6-7 (2/7), 6-4.
And number four seed, Belgium's David Goffin, who beat Murray in an exhibition event in Abu Dhabi last week defeated Robin Hasse of the Netherlands, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2.
Murray's begins their attempt to win the Qatar Open, an event they last won in 2009, with a first-round match against France's Jeremy Chardy on Tuesday.
The newly knighted Scotsman though was in action in the doubles on Monday, but they and partner Mariusz Fyrstenberg lost in straight sets to David Marrero and Nenad Zimonjic.
First round:
Nicolas Almagro (ESP) bt Paolo Lorenzi (ITA) 7-6 (7/2), 4-6, 6-3
Jiri Vesely (CZE) bt Anil Yuksel (TUR) 6-2, 6-3
Dustin Brown (GER) bt Facundo Bagnis (ARG) 6-1, 6-7 (2/7), 6-4
Fernando Verdasco (ESP) bt Vasek Pospisil (CAN) 7-5, 6-0
David Goffin (BEL) bt Robin Haase (NED) 7-6 (7/4), 6-2
Radek Stepanek (CZE) bt Marcos Baghdatis (CYP) 6-4, 5-3 retired
Arthur De Greef (BEL) bt Mohamed Safwat (EGY) 6-7 (8/10), 7-5, 6-4
Horacio Zeballos (ARG) bt Florian Mayer (GER) 6-7 (3/7), 6-4, 7-6 (11/9)
Novak Djokovic (SRB) bt Jan-Lennard Struff (GER) 7-6 (7/1), 6-3
“It's anti-competitive,” a rival exchange says of letting small-caps choose whether to trade on exchanges other than Nasdaq.
A proposal by Nasdaq to increase the liquidity of small-cap stocks is running into opposition from other exchanges who say it is anti-competitive.
Nasdaq officials have said they will ask the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to let it give thinly-traded companies that list on its main U.S. stock exchange a choice as to whether their shares can be traded on other exchanges.
Currently, around a dozen exchanges and more than 30 off-exchange “dark pools” compete for trades in U.S. equities, creating a fragmented market that supporters of the Nasdaq proposal makes it difficult for investors to buy small-cap stocks.
The Treasury Department endorsed the proposal in October as part of a broader regulatory review.
“Our markets are no longer able to support small growth companies,” Frank Hatheway, Nasdaq's chief economist, said Monday at a roundtable discussion hosted by the SEC in Washington on improving the markets for thinly-traded companies.
But the chief executive of upstart stock exchange IEX Group, which is seeking to start its own corporate-listings business, blasted the Nasdaq plan, according to Reuters. “It's anti-competitive, in a way the commission has historically rejected,” Brad Katusyama said.
IEX Group supports giving thinly-traded companies the option of having their stocks trade on one exchange per exchange group, which would mean a stock would trade on four exchanges instead of 13.
According to The Wall Street Journal, the fragmentation in the trading market is a result of “past SEC efforts to break the dominance of the NYSE and Nasdaq and bring more competition to the trading space.”
Advocates for small-caps say the thin liquidity makes it harder for those companies to raise capital or even to entice top talent with stock-option grants.
“It's a pretty austere challenge for these companies,” said Adam Epstein, founder of Third Creek Advisors, which advises small-cap firms.
But Cboe Global Markets said giving exchanges monopolies on the trading of certain stocks would create the risk that they would begin charging higher fees for things like market data and exchange connectivity.
The SEC is seeking public comment on the issue.
Jay Cutler's on-field debut could be less than a week away.
Dolphins head coach Adam Gase strongly hinted to reporters Monday that they would start Cutler against the Baltimore Ravens on Thursday. Matt Moore was 1/1 for five yards with the starting group in Miami's preseason opening win over the Falcons last week.
Gase said he's "trending" toward letting Cutler play, but they haven't made a decision yet. â Adam Beasley (@AdamHBeasley) August 14, 2017
Gase added that Cutler has "pretty much" learned -- or re-learned -- the offense.
The news comes exactly one week after Cutler's arrival in Miami, and while quarterbacks have been tasked with far quicker turnarounds in far bigger situations, this week's start provides some context to Cutler's situation. In just eight days, they were thrust from a broadcasting role into that of a 34-year-old unretired NFL quarterback who some fans and analysts around the football world believe will be better than injured starter Ryan Tannehill. Is it possible to live up to the hype in that amount of time?
The debut will likely be quick -- just a series or so -- but could give the world at large a window into how far Cutler still has to go.

DENPASAR, Indonesia: Indonesian police are hunting for a U.S. citizen who escaped on Monday from an overcrowded prison on the holiday island of Bali by cutting through steel bars in a ceiling, the jail's second breakout of foreign inmates this year.
The Kerobokan prison, about 10 km (six miles) from the main tourist beaches in the Kuta area, often holds foreigners facing drug-related charges.
Cristian Beasley, who was a suspect in crimes related to narcotics but had not been sentenced, escaped at 4.10 a.m. (2010 GMT Sunday), said Badung Police chief Yudith Satria Hananta.
"It is thought that the prisoner escaped ... by cutting through the steel bars above the ceiling," they said in a statement, without giving details of how Beasley escaped without being detected.
Beasley, 32, from California, is believed to have then used a rope to climb down a wall before getting over a perimeter wall in an area being refurbished.
Police had questioned witnesses and guards and were hunting for Beasley, Hananta said.

Another American, Paul Anthony Hoffman, 57, was captured while also trying to escape, Hananta said.
Representatives of Beasley and Hoffman could not immediately be reached for comment.
In June, an Australian, a Bulgarian, an Indian and a Malaysian tunnelled to freedom about 12 metres (13 yards) under the prison's walls.
The Indian and the Bulgarian were caught soon after in neighbouring East Timor, but Australian Shaun Edward Davidson and Malaysian Tee Kok King remain at large.
Davidson has taunted authorities by saying they were enjoying life in various parts of the world, in purported posts on Facebook.
Kerobokan has housed a number of well-known foreign drug convicts, including Australian Schappelle Corby, whose 12-1/2-year sentence for marijuana smuggling got huge media attention.
Indonesia has executed several foreign drug convicts in recent years.
Indonesian prisons are often overcrowded, partly because a war on drugs led by the government of President Joko Widodo has led to a surge in the number of people locked up.
As of June, Kerobokan housed 1,378 inmates, more than four times its planned capacity of 323, government data show.
Prison escapes are fairly common in Indonesia, which launched an investigation this year after about 350 inmates broke out of a prison on the island of Sumatra.

Poor decisions in both boxes.
That was the succinct, but accurate, assessment from Craig Harrison of Hartlepool United's 4-0 defeat at Dover Athletic.
Two Saturdays earlier, Pools had been beaten 3-0 in another cold corner of Kent by Ebbsfleet which had been their heaviest loss of the season.
They trumped that by slipping to defeat at the icy Crabble Athletic Ground.
“We need the will to be hard to beat,” said the manager.
Pools conceded two first-half goals to Mitch Pinnock and leaked a brace late in the piece to former loan striker Ryan Bird.
In between, Pools controlled possession and dominated territory, but could not score.
“Yes, we are playing better football than we have been,” said Harrison. “But we've had one win in five games and that's no where near good enough.
“First and foremost, we need to have a platform.
“If you are going to be successful you need players to be able to do both [defend and attack].
“We have players who can do both, we have got to get it right.
“I don't want us to go backwards in the way we are playing football and are passing the ball, but we need to make sure we keep the back door closed and don't make poor decisions in both boxes
“We've made poor decisions in both areas, but we need to be tougher to beat.
“We've not given ourselves a platform to play from.
“In the middle bit of the field, we've done great, we've passed the ball, we've kept the ball, we've got ourselves in the final third positions.
“We've had four or five similar opportunities to how their first goal came about and we've not capitalised.
“But at 2-0 [at half-time] we had enough in the locker to go and get the next goal, if we'd have done that we were back in the game.
“We've pinned them back but that's at 2-0, we have to do that from the first whistle.”
The World Health Organisation (WHO) the latest data says that smoking is responsible for the death of about six million people across the world each year with many of the deaths occurring prematurely.
According to the report, no fewer that 1.1 billion people are smokers in the world today, the same number as at the turn of the century.
WHO's ‘Global Report on Trends in Prevalence of Tobacco Smoking 2000-2025', coincided with World No Tobacco Day 2018 observed every May 31.
The report states: “Tobacco is the only legal drug that kills many of its users when used exactly as intended by manufacturers.
“WHO has estimated that tobacco use (smoking and smokeless) is currently responsible for the death of about six million people across the world each year with many of the deaths occurring prematurely.
“This total includes about 600,000 people that are also estimated to die from the effects of second-hand smoking.
“Although often associated with ill-health, disability and death from non-communicable chronic diseases, tobacco smoking is also associated with an increased risk of death from communicable diseases''.
The global health agency, in the report by health experts, said spreading the message that tobacco caused deadly illnesses such as heart disease and stroke helped prevent “needless” loss of life.
WHO warned that tobacco use and exposure to second-hand smoke were “major causes” of cardiovascular disease, contributing to three million deaths annually.
It said lack of awareness about the risks of tobacco use was most common in low and middle-income countries.
The report said in China, more than six out of 10 people were unaware that smoking could cause a heart attack while in India and Indonesia, more than half of all adults did not know that the habit could lead to a stroke.
Dr Douglas Bettcher, Director, Department for the Prevention of Non-communicable Diseases at WHO, said tobacco use was falling globally but it still killed more than seven million people a year.
“Progress is uneven in protecting consumers from the tobacco industry,'' Bettcher said.
They explained that higher income countries were making “faster progress” than their poorer counterparts at protecting consumers, partly owing to stronger regulations.
“In spite of the apparent lack of progress in tackling the total number of smokers, the report highlighted that only one in five people smoked today, compared to more than one in four, 18 years ago.
“The decline was masked by the world's growing population.''
On efforts to encourage people to quit, the UN health expert warned that only around 12 per cent countries were on track to meet global targets to reduce by one-third the number of people dying from non-communicable diseases by 2030 as part of the Sustainable Development Goals agenda.
In a bid to promote a healthy heart, the WHO wanted every one of its 194 Member States to implement a series of increasingly strict tobacco control measures.
These include making indoor public and workplaces smoke-free and insisting that tobacco packaging carries warnings that demonstrate the health risks for users.
“The good news is that these deaths are preventable and we know what needs to be done,'' Bettcher said.
They named Ireland and Uruguay as countries that had achieved the highest level of tobacco control before, adding that since 2007, the number of people around the world to have benefited from these measures has more than quadrupled, from one billion to five billion.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein did not sign on to the lawsuit against President Trump.
Close to 200 Democrats in Congress filed a federal lawsuit on Wednesday alleging President Trump has illegally profited from foreign payments to their worldwide business interests. But the list of plaintiffs was missing a few notable names.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein and four other Democrats in California's congressional delegation, including some representatives of districts with a strong Republican or evenly divided electorate, did not sign onto the lawsuit.
Feinstein, who appears likely to run for reelection in 2018, has taken heat in recent months from liberal activists who have criticized them for not taking a more aggressive stance against Trump.
Them spokesperson, Tom Mentzer, said the senator stayed away from the suit because they sit on Senate committees investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russian interference in the 2016 election.
“As the lead Democrat on one of the two Senate committees investigating the president, Sen. Feinstein decided joining the lawsuit at this time may create an appearance of bias,” Mentzer said. “The senator will continue to be a vocal opponent of the president's illegal acceptance of foreign payments and benefits.”
That did not keep Feinstein's fellow Democrat and California's junior senator, Kamala Harris, from joining the lawsuit. Like Feinstein, Harris also sits on the Senate's Select Committee on Intelligence, one of the panels investigating the allegations about Trump and Russia. Harris has not responded to a request for comment.
The lawsuit alleges Trump has violated the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which forbids federal officials from accepting payments from foreign governments without the consent of Congress.
As an example, the suit points to the Trump International Hotel Washington, which it alleges has been actively courting foreign diplomats since Trump's election in November.
The suit also alleges that Trump, through their business empire, has benefited financially from dozens of trademarks issued by the Chinese government since they were sworn into office.
The legal action comes just two days after the attorneys general for Maryland and the District of Columbia filed an anti-corruption lawsuit against Trump on similar grounds.
The White House has denied that Trump's business interests violate the Constitution.
The California Democrats in the House who did not sign onto the lawsuit are Ami Bera of Elk Grove, Jim Costa of Fresno, Raul Ruiz of Palm Desert and Lou Correa of Santa Ana.
The Republican Party has said it will target Bera and Ruiz in the 2018 election.
LONDON: Roger Federer extended their flawless winning streak at Wimbledon to 26 consecutive sets as the defending champion crushed Lukas Lacko, while Serena Williams powered to their 16th successive win in Wednesday's (Jul 4) second round action.
While Federer and Serena strolled, Caroline Wozniacki suffered fresh Wimbledon woe as the world number two suffered a shock 6-4, 1-6, 7-5 defeat against Ekaterina Makarova.

Federer delivered a Centre Court masterclass lasting 89 minutes as the Swiss star hit 48 winners and 16 aces in their 6-4, 6-4, 6-1 victory.
The 36-year-old is now on their joint second longest streak of sets won at Wimbledon -- their best was 34 between the third round in 2005 to the 2006 final.
Next up for Federer is a third round tie against German world number 64 Jan-Lennard Struff who came back from two sets down to defeat 39-year-old Ivo Karlovic 13-11 in the final set.
In their 20th Wimbledon appearance, top seed Federer, a 20-time major winner, is bidding to become only the second player to claim nine singles titles at the England Club after Martina Navratilova.

On the evidence of their ruthless demolition of Slovakian world number 73 Lacko, it will take something special to stop Federer making more Wimbledon history.
"I played very well. I felt good out there, fewer nerves than in the first round," Federer said.
"I'm happy how I am hitting the ball, good concentration on my service games and able to mix it up with some slices.
"Of course, you sometimes play the percentages, but if you do that too much it becomes boring, so I like to mix it up."
Federer wasn't the only former champion in peak form on Centre Court as seven-time winner Serena routed Bulgarian qualifier Viktoriya Tomova 6-1, 6-4.
Williams brushed aside Tomova in just 66 minutes with 24 winners and four aces to extend their streak of consecutive match wins at the England Club.
"It was better than the first round. I'm happy I'm going in the right direction," Serena said.
"I'm getting there. I expect to get there, not only for Wimbledon but for the tournaments in the future."
'EATING BUGS'
The 36-year-old, whose winning run encompasses their Wimbledon titles in 2015 and 2016, missed the grass-court Grand Slam last year while they prepared to give birth to daughter Alexis Olympia in September.
Serena, seeded 25th after their return from maternity leave, faces France's Kristina Mladenovic or Germany's Tatjana Maria for a place in the last 16.
Wozniacki, plagued by an invasion of flying ants during the Court One clash, saved five match points but has now failed to get past the last 16 in 12 visits to the England Club.
It was a bitter defeat for the 27-year-old Dane, who was expected to challenge for the Wimbledon title after winning their maiden Grand Slam crown at the Australian Open in January.
With flying ants stuck in Wozniacki's hair and dive-bombing them throughout the match, the former world number one asked the umpire if there was something that could be sprayed to keep the bugs away.
"They're in my mouth and in my hair and everywhere - we need to do something. Is there a spray?" they said.
"I want to be here to focus on tennis, not eating bugs."
Five-time champion Venus Williams battled into the third round with a 4-6, 6-0, 6-1 win over Romanian qualifier Alexandra Dulgheru.
Venus reached their ninth Wimbledon final last year, but the American star was denied a sixth title by Garbine Muguruza.
Making their 21st Wimbledon appearance, 38-year-old Venus is the oldest woman in this year's tournament.
But they didn't look their age in making it 89 career match wins at Wimbledon by demolishing Dulgheru in the final two sets.
Asked if their wealth of Wimbledon experience was a key factor, Venus said: "I'd love to have that extra advantage. If that's working for me I'm all for it.
"It's just about winning the match. If that's your best or not doesn't matter."
Venus next faces Dutch 20th seed Kiki Bertens, who beat Russian world number 107 Anna Blinkova 6-4, 6-0.
Former world number one Karolina Pliskova finally made it to the third round on their seventh visit to Wimbledon after seeing off two-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka 6-3, 6-3.
Former Wimbledon finalist Agnieszka Radwanska lost 7-5, 6-4 to Czech world number 66 Lucie Safarova.

Hungary's tough asylum system has helped to cause a bottleneck for up to 7,000 migrants who are now stuck in limbo in Serbia, the Council of Europe Special Representative on migration and refugees said on Wednesday.
TOMPA, Hungary: Hungary's tough asylum system has helped to cause a bottleneck for up to 7,000 migrants who are now stuck in limbo in Serbia, the Council of Europe Special Representative on migration and refugees said on Wednesday.
After visiting two camps built from shipping containers and surrounded by a barbed-wire fence on Hungary's border with Serbia, Ambassador Tomas Bocek also told Reuters that the migrants were effectively being deprived of their liberty.
The migrants - most of whom hope eventually to reach wealthy western Europe - can only leave the tightly guarded camps by returning south into Serbia, and cannot even move freely between the different sections inside the designated area, unless they want to see a doctor.
In the summer heat, with temperatures around 30 degrees in the scorching sun, the containers heat up and largely have no air-conditioning, they said.
"Let's say they call it camps but I would say that according to the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, this is rather deprivation of liberty," Bocek said in an interview outside the camp at the Tompa crossing point.

"They don't understand why they are there, why they are in a closed camp, or they call it prison ...and the question that everybody asked me is: when will we get out?"
The container camps currently house about 400 people, mostly fleeing conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
TOUGH NEW LAWS
Hungary, a member of the European Union, was a major crossing point for hundreds of thousands of people at the height of Europe's migrant crisis in 2015, heading via Turkey, Greece and the Balkans for western Europe.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban's right-wing government built a border fence and approved new laws which, along with an EU repatriation agreement clinched with Turkey, helped to sharply cut the number of arrivals, though some still get through.
Orban has called mass immigration from the Middle East and Africa an existential threat to the European way of life.
Under legislation passed earlier this year, all migrants trying to enter Hungary, including children, are held in two camps at the Roszke and Tompa crossings on the border with non-EU Serbia until their asylum requests have been processed. Very few applications are successful.
Budapest denies the camps amount to detention centres as migrants are free to return to Serbia, but its policy has been criticised by the United Nations and human rights groups.
Bocek said the Hungarian system for handling asylum was too restrictive as it allows only five people a day to submit requests at each of the two transit zones. As a result thousands of migrants without any status are stuck in Serbia.
"This category is quite huge and I think we should really reflect reality and address this issue. They have some basic human rights and these human rights should be respected."
The Council of Europe, based in the French city of Strasbourg, aims to uphold human rights and democracy across the continent.

The Broncos appear to have dodged a bullet — again.
Starting defensive end Derek Wolfe was carted off the practice field on Saturday but tests later revealed they merely suffered a sprained ankle. The team's other starting defensive end, Jared Crick, was carted off the practice field on Monday.
Denver is still waiting for the results of Crick's MRI, but coach Vance Joseph said after practice that it may have just been back spasms.
Vance Joseph said Jared Crick back spasms initially but getting tests. #9sports — Mike Klis (@MikeKlis) August 14, 2017
That's good news for Crick as back spasms shouldn't sideline them for long.
While Crick and Wolfe sit out, second-year defender Adam Gotsis and free agent addition Zach Kerr are in line to start at the two defensive end spots. The team also drafted DeMarcus Walker in the second round of the NFL draft, but they have been practicing at outside linebacker with Shane Ray (wrist) and Shaq Barrett (hip) injured.
It wouldn't be surprising to see Gotsis and Kerr start against the 49ers on Aug. 19. While the Broncos obviously don't want to see players injured, the team will be able to get a good look at Gotsis and Kerr in the coming weeks.
The Canadian Press
MONTREAL - Canadian Pacific Rail's more than 3,000 train operators walked off the job late Tuesday night while a second group of workers reached a tentative contract settlement with the rail company.
The Teamsters Canada Rail Conference said its workers walked out at 10 p.m. EDT as negotiations continued with the company with the assistance of federal mediators.
That announcement came just minutes after CP Rail announced a tentative deal had been reached with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers for 360 signalling workers who were also poised to walk off the job at 10 p.m..
The Teamsters said the strike by its members began despite "best efforts to reach a negotiated settlement," adding it is "willing to remain at the bargaining table during the strike."
It also said commuter train services in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver are operated by Bombardier, not Canadian Pacific, and Teamster members who operate trains in those cities are Bombardier employees and will not go on strike.
As a result, said the Teamsters, commuter train services would not be affected by the strike.
Via, however, had already cancelled passenger rail service starting Tuesday morning in Ontario between Sudbury and White River.
CP Rail has said it will use qualified management staff to handle signalling and switching tasks so trains can continue to operate.
However, the strike could force the railroad to shut down its freight service at a particularly bad time for grain farmers. Shippers had said they expected talks would fail, resulting in the third CP Rail strike since 2012.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said earlier in the day that the federal government would not be rushed into introducing back-to-work legislation, preferring instead to employ various levers to motivate both sides to reach a settlement.
Trudeau also said their government would not do as the Conservatives did and favour employers.
"Quite frankly, we have companies that have gotten used to the fact that in certain industries, the government in the past was very quick to legislate against unions," Trudeau said during a conference in Toronto.
"We are not going to do that."
If eventually forced to intervene, said Trudeau, the Liberal government won't be giving the advantage to employers.
Even before the strike began, the livelihoods of Canadian grain farmers were already threatened because shipping was severely disrupted over the past winter due to extreme cold.
"You always hope for a miracle but we're pretty sure there's going to be a stoppage," said Wade Sobkowich, executive director of the Western Grain Elevator Association, which represents the country's largest exporters.
They said there was little that could be done to prepare other than to notify farmers that deliveries will have to be rescheduled and tell overseas customers they could receive late shipments.
"We're just coming off of a year where we had poor rail service even though we didn't have a work stoppage and we are trying to maintain relationships with our customers," they added.
The train operators voted 94 per cent in favour of strike action to back their contract demands in early April and voted 98 per cent to reject CP's final offer last Friday.
Both unions gave the railway notice over the weekend that they plan to walk off the job to support contract demands.
Sophomore outfielder Seth Beer (Suwanee, Ga.) was named a second-team All-American by NCBWA on Wednesday. It was the second year in a row Beer earned All-America honors from NCBWA, as they were a first-team All-American as a first-year student in 2016.
As a Dick Howser Trophy semifinalist in 2017, Beer hit .298 with 51 runs, 17 doubles, a triple, 16 homers, 53 RBIs, a .606 slugging percentage, .478 on-base percentage, school-record-tying 64 walks, 14 hit-by-pitches and two steals in 63 games.
In their two-year career at Clemson, they are hitting .333 with a .506 on-base percentage in 125 games. They have 30 doubles, a triple, 34 homers, 123 RBIs, 108 runs, 126 walks, 29 hit-by-pitches and three steals.
Beer is the second Tiger to earn All-America honors in 2017, joining fellow outfielder Reed Rohlman.
NEW YORK: Ever wondered what United States President Donald Trump's childhood was like? You can now enter the world of their early years for US$725 per night after the Tudor-style home where they grew up was listed on home-sharing site Airbnb.
Located in Queens, New York, the 2,000 sq ft, five-bedroom home is part of Jamaica Estates which is described as an "upper class neighbourhood" on the website.
The listing is titled "PRESIDENTIAL HOME in Beautiful JAMAICA ESTATES", and has 3.5 bathrooms, 14 beds and two sofa beds.
According to the Guardian, the house was bought for US$1.3 million in December 2016 by New York real estate developer Michael Davis. They then sold it for US$2.14 million earlier this year "to a mystery Chinese woman" and now rents it back from them for US$4,000 a month.

Trump lived in the house with their parents, Fred and Mary, the Airbnb post said. Their father built the house in 1940 - just six years before the country's 45th president was born.

"Not much has been changed since the Trumps lived here, the kitchen is original and the opulent furnishings represent the style and affluence in which the Trumps would have lived," the listing added.

A giant cut out of Trump, standing conspicuously in the living room, is described as "a great companion for watching the news late into the night".
It is also mentioned that the listing "has no relationship with the White House, the President, Donald Trump or the Trump organisation in any way".
Methuen Police Charge Juvenile for Allegedly Threatening Catholic School
METHUEN — The Methuen Police Department is charging a juvenile in connection with a threat made against a parochial school in the city earlier this week.
A male juvenile student male student from Presentation of Mary Academy will be summonsed to Lawrence Juvenile District Court for Willfully Communicating or Causing to be Communicated a Threat.
On Wednesday, Oct. 4th at approximately 4 p.m., Methuen police officers were dispatched to Presentation of Mary Academy, located at 209 Lawrence St., to investigate a report of vandalism.
Upon arrival, officers were taken to the Dupre Center, a building that houses the school's gymnasium. There, police discovered a threat to harm people at the school written on the side of the building.
The threat was first discovered by a student who alerted administrators. It is not known how long the threat had been there before it was discovered. No individual was named in the threat, and no specific date or time was mentioned.
Out of an abundance of caution, the Methuen Police Department activated The Northeastern Massachusetts Law Enforcement Council School Threat Assessment Team (NEMLEC S.T.A.R.S.) which is composed of officers from around Middlesex and Essex counties, who are specially-trained to respond to school-related threats and incidents.
Presentation of Mary High School had a delayed opening on Thursday with a controlled entry and increased security measures.
“I commend Methuen Police and administrators of Presentation of Mary Academy for their professionalism and diligence while handling this incident,” Mayor Zanni said.
“While there was never any threat to the community, the safety of our students, teachers and administrators is paramount, and we took these precautions because it was the prudent thing to do,” Chief Solomon said. “I would like to thank everyone for their patience and support during this incident and especially want to commend the student who came forward to alert school officials about the threat. This student's courage should serve as an example to others to always say something if you see something.”
Presentation of Mary Academy, founded in 1958 by the Sisters of the Presentation of Mary, is a Catholic, co-ed, parochial high school for students in grades 9-12.
The following is the full statutory description of the charge:
Did willfully communicate or cause to be communicated through an electronic communication device or by some other means a threat (1) that a firearm, rifle, shotgun, machine gun or assault weapon, as defined in G.L. c.140, §121, an explosive or incendiary device, a dangerous chemical or biological agent, a poison, a harmful radioactive substance or some other device, substance or item capable of causing death, serious bodily injury or substantial property damage, would be used at a place or location, or was present or would be present at a place or location, whether or not the same was in fact used or present; or (2) to hijack an aircraft, ship, or common carrier thereby causing anxiety, unrest, fear, or personal discomfort to any person or group of persons; in violation of G.L. c.269, §14(b).

SOCHI, Russia: Sweden fan Ragit Shaqiri found it difficult to celebrate their side's progression to a first World Cup quarter-final since 1994 with a victory over Switzerland on Tuesday, as their cousin Xherden Shaqiri played for the losing team.
The Swedes won 1-0 thanks to winger Emil Forsberg's deflected strike, causing mixed emotions for the 18-year-old who grew up on the same Rosengard estate as retired Sweden legend Zlatan Ibahimovic.

"I watched the game in Kosovo with all my relatives, it was very exciting but at the same time very stressful," Ragit told Reuters as Sweden set up a last-eight clash against England on Saturday.
"I was happy and sad at the same time when Forsberg scored, I thought Xherdan played very well, their crosses towards goal were very dangerous," they added.
Xherdan's father and Ragit's mother are siblings, and left the poverty and conflict in Kosovo for Switzerland, with the latter then opting to settle in the Swedish city of Malmo.
A promising amateur footballer, Ragit's agent is Xherdan's brother Erdin and they now hope Sweden can go on to even greater things.

"In the World Cup nothing is guaranteed, but I hope Sweden goes on to win it," they said.

"Under Benson's direction, Esplanade has made a meaningful difference to Singapore's arts scene and our people and we have no doubt that Yvonne will build on these achievements," they said.
NEW DELHI: India said on Tuesday that 39 Indians, who were believed to have been kidnapped by militants in Iraq in 2014, had been confirmed dead after their bodies were found.
The bodies were recovered from a mass grave and DNA tests had confirmed them to be the construction workers who went missing from the Iraqi city of Mosul, Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj told parliament.
"With full proof I can say these 39 are dead," the minister said. The government had for years said it would only declare the men dead once it had full evidence.

There's the sound of cicadas, humming and dancing and singing to warmth. Throaty chirps abuzz in harmony, orchestra of din: the symphony of summer. Below the snaking branches and muttering cicadas is a small person! eyes wide and filled with wonder.
Eyes wide and filled with wonder, and maybe nostalgia, too, for muggy days and buzzing nights. Because cicadas are warm June days, broken shells left behind on beige garage doors, sweat sticking to the backs of our legs, taco shops circled once, twice, seven times around the city.

Five teachers of the Polytechnic Academic Staff Secondary School Birnin Kebbi, have been sacked for impregnating an SS3 student of the school.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) learnt on Wednesday that the girl was also expelled from the school.
Sources confirmed that the decision to dismiss the five teachers followed the recommendation of a committee set up by the school to investigate the matter.
“The committee submitted report on Monday and recommended that all the five teachers should be dismissed from service immediately.
“The management have dismissed the teachers and the victim was also expelled from the school.
“When the committee interrogated each of the teachers, they confessed that they have been having sexual relationship with the victim separately, so, they were sacked immediately based on the committee's recommendations”, the source added.
NAN gathered that the affected teachers had forwarded an appeal against their dismissal to the school's management board.
The Principal of the school, Malam Muhammed Mahuta, was said to be in hospital for weeks before the incident, but their Vice, Malam Oumar Woulandakoye, confirmed the development, adding that the affected teachers had filed an appeal against their dismissal.
”I will advise that you should wait till the final report of the School Board, because I just received their memo now that they are going to sit on the matter tomorrow,” they said.

They run a company that is a byword for technological innovation - but Nokia's chairperson had no qualms about going back to school to learn more about artificial intelligence (AI).
HELSINKI: They run a company that is a byword for technological innovation - but Nokia's chairperson had no qualms about going back to school to learn more about artificial intelligence (AI).
Risto Siilasmaa, 51, said they signed up this summer for online courses on AI programming run by Stanford University.
"I realized that I don't have deep enough knowledge on this phenomenon... Now I'm back studying programming after 30 years," they told Reuters on Friday by email.
"I do not want to become an AI programmer. I want to deeply understand the abilities and limitations of AI."
Since starting the courses, Siilasmaa said they had briefed the Finnish telecom infrastructure firm's board and managers on the subject.
"I want to raise awareness ...on this, because AI will be a key driver of the ongoing industrial revolution."

Once the preserve of researchers, artificial intelligence has grabbed the attention of businesses from healthcare to financial services looking to use algorithms to parse data in search of patterns to solve problems.
Nokia aims to offer more sophisticated software to analyse the mountains of data that telecom network operators collect, in order to create more powerful and more personalised services.
Potential AI applications Nokia has begun to roll out this year include troubleshooting network bottlenecks and traffic analysis for use in driverless cars and "smart cities" filled with billions of network-linked devices.
Siilasmaa received plaudits for transforming the Finnish company from an ailing mobile phone manufacturer into one of the world's biggest telecoms network equipment makers.
"I've noticed that when doing something ...that people are not used to see the chairperson doing, that inspires people and encourages them to think out of the box," they added.
Nokia sold the phone business to Microsoft in 2014, which has largely abandoned the mobile device market.
Nokia's name recently returned to the smartphone market via a brand-licensing deal with HMD Global.

The Federal Government has announced its plans to recover all pension payment made to ‘ghost workers' on its payroll.
The minister of finance, Kemi Adeosun, made this known in a Facebook Live session on Monday.
Mrs. Adeosun said the finance ministry, in collaboration with the National Pension Commission, is set to recover the pensions so far paid into the Retirement Savings Accounts of the identified ghost workers.
They disclosed that about 53,000 ghost workers had so far been removed from the Federal Government payroll.
“The Presidential Initiative on Continuous Audit came in so that they can check the payroll and make sure that we pay the right amount and ghost workers do not exist; there is no fraud and that there is no error in the payroll,” the minister said.
“We have removed 53,000 people from the payroll and we are working with PenCom to recover some of the pensions because the problem with these ghost salary earners is that not only are we paying their salaries, we are also paying pensions.
“So, we are trying to recover some of the overpaid pensions from some of the people we have removed from the payroll.”

The minister noted that before the commencement of the continuous audit initiative, the wage bill of the government was put at about N165 billion monthly.
But the government was spending N16 billion each on pensions and overheads monthly, they said, noting that a total of about N200 billion was being expended monthly on recurrent items.
“So, we set a priority that we need to control this,” Mrs. Adeosun noted.
“It's a continuous battle and the real thing is that we are using technology to make sure we are paying people using the biometric system, which ensures that you cannot get two salaries and ensures that the number of personnel is the same as the number on the payroll,” they added.
The minister, however, disclosed that the government's focus is to get as many agencies and individuals as possible on the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System platform, IPPIS, which, they said, would assist the government to bring down its wage bill.
“The moment we finish with the police , we will move on to the military and then the prisons and immigration and other agencies like that,” they said.
Closeup of Badmaash's chicken tikka poutine, a favorite of the weekend Courtesy Goldenvoice
There is so much food at Coachella now that one person can barely make a dent. I set out to Coachella on a solo mission to find the best eats, which only proved that there's far too much for one person to cover it all. I didn't even make it into the Beer Barn, which housed Bludso's and Beer Belly. I didn't skip around the field with a waffle on a stick from Sweet COMBforts either. I had big plans for that waffle. Much time was spent interviewing bands while they ate delicious things, which fed my soul in other ways. So, in the end, a few of my Coachella culinary dreams were crushed, but only because there's so much food and so little time. And that's not a real problem. Plus, what I did eat was pretty terrific.

Badmaash: chicken tikka poutine
A favorite of the weekend by a long shot. This dish was so good, I failed to take a proper beauty shot of my own. If you're a fan of Indian food and/or exciting, complex flavors, this $20 poutine is worth it. Crispy-on-the-outside, soft-on-the-inside fries are covered in mozzarella cheese and gravy, then topped with tandoori chicken and cilantro. Every bite is exciting. This is available in Main VIP and you'll need gum afterward.
EXPAND Assorted dumplings from Bling Bling dumpling, general admission Rebecca Pardess
Bling Bling Dumplings
Bling Bling Dumpling has two stalls in the field, one in general admission and the other in a general-admission beer garden. They offer three flavors, which can be mixed and matched, including chicken and Thai basil; ginger pork; and shiitake, and each and every one is bursting with flavor. While many Coachella concessions can be unnecessarily large, the six-dumpling serving is $12 and perfect for one person. Plus, the beer garden location is situated a few vendors down from the Cupcake Vineyards Rosé All Day stand. There's nothing like sitting on a patch of grass with a set of dumplings and a glass of refreshing wine.
EXPAND Sumo tots from Sumo Dog Rebecca Pardess
Sumo Dog Sumo Tots
It's tater tots with a ton of incredible Asian-inspired toppings, such as spicy pork chili, togarashi cheese sauce, jalapeños, pickled peppers and furikake, a dried seaweed seasoning. While I'd hoped the sushi tots would make an appearance (sushi rice morsels instead of potatoes), chef Jeffrey Lunak explained that the labor-intensive dish wouldn't work logistically at a festival. Fair enough. They were also nice enough to let me hop back into the kitchen to see how they're made, and it's a mesmerizing process piling melty cheese and tangy sauces on perhaps the best form of potato. The Sumo Tots can fill you up for the entire day, or be shared by three to four people. This is a heavy $10 dish, which makes it both time- and cost-effective.

Backyard tandoori chicken and Filipino-style carpaccio at Outstanding in the Field
On Sunday night, chefs Bruce Kalman of Union and Knead, Nakul and Arjun Mahendro from Badmaash and Alvin Cailan of Eggslut teamed up to create a family-style dinner for the Outstanding in the Field series. It is in its fourth year, but it was my first time attending this event in the VIP Rose Garden, where people can sit at an actual table and use real wine glasses and flatware for $225 a seat. (Though there are other ways to score a spot, like the middle-aged couple who sat across from me. They won the dinner at an American Express dance contest earlier in the night. "It was EDM," they said.) The best dishes were the Filipino-style filet mignon carpaccio, which was rich and buttery, and the backyard tandoori chicken; juicy and packed with flavor. There was also a perfect crusty loaf of bread with olive oil. Three wines were poured, including an Oregon rosé, which was dry and crisp, and a pinot noir from the same state that made me pour the white out and ask for more of the red. The low lighting at the 7:30 p.m seating wasn't conducive to photos, and the staff was nice and accommodating yet over it. But that's Sunday at Coachella.
They also said the two other defendants were attached to the now defunct Rwanda National Resources Authority and not to the Natural Resources …

NEW YORK: Industrial machinery manufacturer Caterpillar reported a large jump in first-quarter earnings and significantly upgraded its full-year forecast on Tuesday (Apr 24), citing strong demand across the construction, mining and energy sectors.
Caterpillar reported profits of US$1.7 billion for the quarter ending Mar 31, dwarfing the US$192 million in the year-ago period. Revenues surged 30.9 per cent to US$12.9 billion.
In the construction sector, Caterpillar pointed to "broad-based growth in all regions" in 2018, with North American and China especially strong.
The mining industry, which had been in a bruising slump a couple of years ago, has picked up considerably, leading to higher capital spending by companies.
The company also predicted sales gains in oil and gas due in part to strong demand for well servicing and gas compression applications in North American.
Caterpillar alluded to some constraints from spiking demand that can put pressure on suppliers. The company suggested the problem was not severe, saying "although constraints remain for some parts and components, we are seeing improvements in material flows."

The manufacturer raised its full-year profit forecast by US$2 to a range of US$9.75 to US$10.75 a share.
The figures are based on assumptions of continued global growth but it said potential impacts from "future geopolitical risks and increased trade restrictions have not been included in the outlook."
The company has been seen as vulnerable to a potential US-China trade war.
Caterpillar shares soared in pre-market trading by 4.6 per cent to US$160.99.
NEW YORK: Indiana said on Friday it will require its Medicaid recipients work or do some other form of community engagement, becoming the second state to make this fundamental change to the 50-year-old health insurance program for the poor.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said it approved Indiana's waiver to add these requirements to its Medicaid program on Friday. The work requirement applies to able-bodied working age Medicaid enrollees, according to HHS.
Pregnant women, medically frail enrollees, students, some caregivers and people in substance use treatment are among those that are exempted from the requirements.
Kentucky became the first state to impose work requirements on its Medicaid recipients last month.
At least eight additional states, mostly Republican-led, have proposed similar changes to Medicaid: Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Maine, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin.

Chancellor Angela Merkel and their defence minister on Wednesday vowed to continue boosting German military spending after years of cutbacks that have reduced military readiness and drawn the ire of some NATO partners, including the United States.
BERLIN: Chancellor Angela Merkel and their defence minister on Wednesday vowed to continue boosting German military spending after years of cutbacks that have reduced military readiness and drawn the ire of some NATO partners, including the United States.
Merkel told lawmakers they welcomed increases already planned in military spending, but said it was "certainly not sufficient" when compared to the percentage of gross domestic product other countries spent on their defences.

To catch up, Merkel and Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen have pledged to boost German military spending to 1.5 percent of GDP by 2024. Both said they remained committed to achieving the NATO target of spending 2 percent at a later date.
"It would be reckless not to prepare for alliance defence," Merkel told lawmakers.
Germany will boost military spending in 2019 by 4 billion euros to 42.9 billion euros, its fourth successive year increase, von der Leyen told lawmakers. They said the increase would amount to a 30 percent increase from 2014 to 2019.
By 2024, German military spending would have increased 80 percent, von der Leyen said.

The 2019 increase brings German military spending to 1.31 percent of economic output up from 1.24 percent, although the longer-range plan calls for the percentage to drop back to around 1.23 percent by 2022.
Von der Leyen said Germany could be proud of its contributions to the NATO alliance despite recent "tweets and letters" - a reference to recent missives from U.S. President Donald Trump rebuking key allies for spending too little on their militaries.
Trump will tell fellow NATO countries at next week's summit that the United States cannot be "the world's piggy bank," White House spokesperson Hogan Gidley said on Tuesday aboard the presidential aircraft Air Force One.
"That's gotta stop," Gidley told reporters as Trump flew to West Virginia.
Von der Leyen noted that Germany is the second largest net contributor for NATO command structures, and said it was the only country from continental Europe to lead a battalion in eastern Europe as part of a NATO programme initiated after Russia's annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine.
Von der Leyen also rejected media reports suggesting that the United States was planning to pull troops out of Germany, adding, "There is no evidence whatsoever that there are plans to withdraw troops."

Emmy-winning entertainment news journalist Leeza Gibbons listed a residential compound they and husband Steve Fenton used as shared office space in a fashionable neighborhood of West Hollywood, Calif., with an asking price of $3.795 million. The former “Entertainment Tonight” host and 2015 winner of “The Celebrity Apprentice” purchased the property in 2011 for $1.199 million and the many-gabled, somewhat Tudor-ish main house, behind a charming, vine-draped vintage brick and white picket fence, has three bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms in a bit more than 2,000-square feet. A separate and self-contained guesthouse, where Gibbons' elder adult son once lived, offers another bedroom and bathroom.
Set in to a puny, steeply gabled porch, the front door opens efficiently if less than ideally directly into a high-ceiled living room anchored by a stone-accented fireplace and filled with light through a tall, multi-paned arched window. A small dining room links the living room to an up-to-date galley kitchen with two-stool snack bar and a sunny adjoining breakfast nook with windows on three walls. Two guest bedrooms on the main floor each have a renovated en suite bathroom while the master suite privately occupies the entire second floor with abundant closet space and a tiled bathroom with twin floating vanities, a marble-surrounded soaking tub and a glass-enclosed shower. Behind the house and surrounded by paver-tiled terracing, there's a detached two-car garage with opaque glass roll-up door and the asupervisorstioned detached guesthouse that contains a living room open to a complete kitchen, a bedroom with a full wall of closets and an updated bathroom.
No stranger to the property gossip columns, Gibbons and Fenton also own an approximately 7,000-square foot East Coast traditional in the flats of Beverly Hills with five bedrooms and six bathrooms plus a two-story poolside guest house that contains another bedroom and three more bathrooms plus a living room, kitchen and gym. The clapboard-clad Beaver Cleaver-style mansion was purchased by the Gibbons-Fentons in early 2014 for $7.69 million, extensively remodeled and upgraded and set out for sale earlier this year at $18.5 million. The price has since dropped to $17.995 million.
The couple, who previously owned a Mediterranean villa in Beverly Hills scooped up in 2010 for $6.6 million and sold in 2013 for $6.9 million, once presided over an illustrious, showbiz-pedigreed two-and-some-acre spread in Encino, Calif., acquired in late 2011 for $5.2 million from stage and screen producer Michael Jacobs and, after leasing it to Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine, sold in 2015 for $5.77 million to current owner, Jessica Simpson's mother Tina Drew. Previous owners of the elegant estate, known as the Al Jolson Estate after its original owner, include an avalanche of entertainment industry notables including, in order of ownership, Don Ameche, Kirstie Alley and then husband Parker Stevenson, Katey Sagal and then husband Jack White and, briefly in the mid-Aughts, Charlie Sheen and then wife Denise Richards.

Mumbai: Sunrisers Hyderabad produced a stunning bowling performance under pressure as they defeneded a small total of 118 to beat holders Mumbai Indians by 31 runs in a low-scoring but engrossing IPL match in Mumbai on Tuesday.
Mumbai bowled out the visitors for a paltry 118 in 18.4 overs but then made a heavy weather of the modeset target on a lively Wankhede Stadium track to be bowled out for the season's lowest total of 87.
The visitors' depleted bowling attack struck to their task brilliantly to bundle out the strong home team batting line-up in 18.5 overs as Mumbai slumped to their fifth defeat in six matches.
This was the second lowest total defended in IPL history.
Suryakumar Yadav (34 in 38 balls) and Krunal Pandya (24 in 29 balls) were the only batsmen to prosper to some extent against the fired up Sunrisers' attack sans injured lead bowlers Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Billy Stanlake whose IPL season is over.
Leg-spinner Rashid Khan bagged two wickets along with Basil Thampi while medium pacer Siddarth Kaul grabbed three. Sandeep Sharma, Mohammed Nabi and Shakib Al Hasan took one wicket apiece.
The victory, the fourth for Sunrisers, lifted them to the third spot on the table while MI remained rooted to their seventh spot with just two points from six games.
The modest run-chase saw the hosts lose the wickets of Evin Lewis (5), Ishan Kishan (0) and skipper Rohit Sharma (2) for single digit scores inside the power play period.
Lewis was caught at gully off Sandeep Sharma while Kishan and Rohit fell to the off-break of Nabi and left-arm spin of Shakib respectively.
Yadav, MI's most consistent batsman of the season, repaired the damage to some extent with Krunal Pandya who hit a few sparkling drives for fours before being trapped leg before by leggie Rashid Khan who also accounted for Kieron Pollard (9).
The departure of Pollard at 73 for 5 in the 13th over left MI with a tricky task which became more daunting when Yadav was caught in the deep while pulling Thampi after striking 4 fours in their 38-ball knock. MI needed 42 for victory at that time.
The rest of the Mumbai batsmen were not up to the task with Kaul grabbing three wickets as Sunrisers romped to a sensational win.
Earlier, Mumbai bowled and fielded with purpose to bowl out a depleted Sunrisers for a measly 118.
The visitors' batting came a cropper against a determined home side bowling.
Captain Kane Williamson (29 with 5 fours), Yusuf Pathan (29) were the main scorers for the Sunrisers that lasted 18.4 overs after they were invited to bat.
Mitchell McClenaghan, Hardik Pandya and Mayank Markande picked up two wickets apiece to pack off the visitors for the season's lowest total.
The Sunrisers started in encouraging fashion with their in-form skipper Williamson striking Jasprit Bumrah for two fours in successive balls in the first over.
But the visitors lost the wickets of Shikhar Dhawan (5), back in the eleven after missing the previous game against Chennai Super Kings due to an elbow injury, and out-of-form Wridhiman Saha (o) in three balls in the second over from Mitchell McClenaghan.
Dhawan, who was struck a painful blow on their knee cap off the third ball, threw away their wicket in the next ball by trying to drive the left-arm bowler who then struck again with the last ball to have Saha caught behind for a duck.
From 20 for 2, there was a brief recovery to 44 for three before the visitors lost two more wickets in quick succession. Manish Pandey (16) was caught at extra cover off Hardik Pandya and then Shakib Al Hasan (2) was run out with a direct hit to the bowler's end by Suryakumar Yadav.
At the end of power play, the Sunrisers were 46 for four. The dismissal of captain Williamson, who seemed to carry on from the brilliant 84 they made against CSK, in the ninth over off Pandya left Sunrisers tottering at 63 for five.
Pathan was the last batsmen out after facing 33 balls and striking one six and two fours.

Delegates are debating the question of appropriate training provided by employers to assist their workers in developing their respective countries.
“I could not believe what I was seeing,” Tina Frost said. “This dog is completely decapitated."
The gruesome discovery comes after an English bulldog was found in town cut open.
There are remnants of blood and fur on the tracks, but the dog is eerily intact other than the clear-cut severing the two parts.
People living near Mannford are concerned about their pets after a woman found a dog's severed body near the Keystone Dam.
The gruesome discovery comes after an English bulldog was found in town cut open.
Right now it's unclear if the two incidents are related, or if the dog near Keystone Dam was even abused. However, the two findings have dog owners worried about their pets.
Tina Frost is an avid animal lover. They come down to a rural area near the Keystone Dam to look for eagles, but on Monday, their peaceful drive was disrupted.
“I could not believe what I was seeing,” Frost said. “This dog is completely decapitated."
Just a few yards down from the train tracks was a female pit bull, dead.
There are remnants of blood and fur on the tracks, but the dog is eerily intact other than the clear-cut severing the two parts.
Frost said, “The way that the body is lying, it doesn't look like that would be the case because you would think that one part of it would be in one place and one part in the other, but it's right there together."
Frost said they posted about the dog on Facebook, trying to find the owner, and was bombarded with responses.
"I noticed there are a lot of missing dogs," they said.
Kristin Moody was one of the commenters. Them English bulldog was found sliced open in a Mannford backyard last month just a block from their home.
Moody said they believe someone took the dog, Jack, out of their backyard, tortured them and then left them to die.
"I think people are worried; and I think, at the very least, we need to let people know that keep a better eye on your pets and make sure you know where they're at at all times, because even if the train is what hurt this little girl, they lost their lives for no reason," Frost said.
At this point, Frost said it's hard to tell exactly who or what killed the dog, but, they said they will be holding their fur babies a little tighter.
Frost has reported the dog's death to the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office.
As for the Mannford dog, police have questioned people who live in the area where the dog was found but didn't find anything.
Miller gets call in goal against struggling Avalanche
Vancouver Canucks (17-18-3) vs. Colorado Avalanche (12-23-1)
7 p.m., Rogers Arena
Sportsnet Pacific, TSN 1040
Here are five things we're pondering prior to the Artists Formerly Known As The Quebec Nordiques coming to town.
1. Anton in, Alex out
Winger Anton Rodin, who has sat the past three games after making their much-awaited season debut against the Calgary Flames on Dec. 23, draws back into the Canucks lineup tonight, in place of Alex Burrows (eye scratch), who was hurt in the New Year's Eve tilt against Edmonton.
Coach Willie Desjardins couldn't say exactly what happened to Burrows, and they did play 14 minutes, 52 seconds against the Oilers, which has been about the norm for them of late.
It doesn't sound serious, with Desjardins saying that Burrows will miss one game.
Rodin was skating with Sven Baertschi and Bo Horvat this morning.
Rodin, 25, was the 2009 second-round draft pick who went back to Sweden after a stint in the minors for Vancouver. They tore up Sweden's top league last season before tearing a tendon in their knee. They experienced soreness and swelling in the knee in the preseason, which kept them shelved until the Calgary game.
They played 7:18 that night, and did not record a point.
“He's a skilled player. That's why we brought them over,” said Desjardins. “He was one of the top scorers in Sweden. They can play two ways. He's a lot like Baertschi. They are similar players. We expect them to contribute at both ends of the rink.”
Rodin added: “You always want to play. It's frustrating to be in the stands. I'm happy I'm back. I need to play my best hockey and that's what I plan to do.”
2. Miller time again
Desjardins said that Ryan Miller would get the start in goal. Much has been made in the media about whether it's time to turn the starting job over to Jacob Markstrom, 26, ahead of Miller, 36.
Miller is on an expiring contract, of course.
Markstrom's stats: 8-8-2, 2.60 goals against, .913 save percentage.
Miller's stats: 9-10-1, 2.81 goals against, .909 save percentage.
“I think he's played well. The key thing we want out of the market is for Markstrom to develop,” said Desjardins. “You want them to develop. I think everyone would say he's developing.
“I don't think anybody has problems with how Miller's played. Miller's played well. When both guys are playing well, it's a good sign.
“I think if you look at where Markstrom is from when they came in … they had a bad first game (March 3, 2015, when they gave up three goals on four shots before getting pulled) and ever since then he's trended up. When they quit trending up, I think we have to look at a litlte bit at how we're using him.”
3. Frontrunning for a change
It's not very often this year that the Canucks are the favourite, but they come into tonight with three straight victories, while Colorado has dropped three straight and eight of nine.
“It's a great feeling in the room. We've been playing well of late and it's nice to get rewarded and get some results,” said defenceman Luca Sbisa.
“I think we have to approach it like any other game. Obviously, the last three games were big games, divisional games. Tonight, we have to keep doing the same things. They're pretty good offensively, but if we play structured as a five-man group I think we'll create enough chances to win the game.”
4. Iggy can still pop
Sbisa is 26. He's considered a veteran. They admit to getting a tad nostalgic talking about guys like Jarome Iginla, the 39-year-old Avalanche veteran.
Iginla isn't what they once are, but they are proving still capable at the NHL level, with five goals and four assists to date.
“There are not many of those guys left in the league. It's definitely special to play against guys like that,” said Sbisa. “He still seems to score.
“You still look up to these guys away from the rink. When you're on the ice, you have to play them hard.”
Tonight will make Iginla's 99th career game against the Canucks. They have 33 goals and 55 assists against Vancouver.
5. Drawing up
One significant improvement this season for the Canucks has been in the faceoffs department. That can be tied to both a healthy Brandon Sutter, and the coaching of Doug Jarvis and Manny Malhotra.
The Canucks are sixth in the NHL in winning percentage (52 per cent). They were last in the 30-team league a season ago (45.4 per cent).
Colorado is currently second (53.5).
Mount Maunganui: India U-19 coach Rahul Dravid is confident that it won't just be this "one memory" that would define this talented bunch of cricketers as a bigger and more challenging journey awaits them.
"It's a memory they'll cherish for a long time and hopefully it's not a memory that defines them and they will have a lot bigger and better memories as they go on ahead in their careers," coach Dravid said after India's fourth ICC U-19 World Cup title.
Dravid spoke about the effort that the entire batch put on for the last 14 month, which bore fruit.
"I am really proud of the boys, proud of the effort that they have put in and proud of the support staff as well. I think the effort we have put in over the last 14 months have been sensational. They really deserved this, couldn't be really happier and proud for this bunch of boys," the legendary batsman said.
They were always aware that the since this was an U-19 team, the spotlight will always be on them but as usual they were magnanimous in praising the entire support staff comprising of fielding coach Abhay Sharma, bowling coach Paras Mhambrey to name a few.
"Coaching this team, I tend to get a lot of attention, but it is really about the quality of support staff that we have had, there have been seven or eight of us, who have been together for the last 14 months. The effort they put in was incredible," they said.
"I am proud to be a part of their (support staff) team and see it as that. We try and do what's best for the kids and hopefully they can put in the performances on the field and they have certainly done that in this tournament."
On cloud nine after lifting the trophy, India skipper Prithvi Shaw also credited the team, support staff and singled out Dravid for special mention.
"Can't express what I'm feeling right now, really proud. All credit to our support staff for really supporting us for the last two years. Rahul sir themselves is a legend, 'The Wall' as we all know him.
"Full credit to our coaching staff. When you have two guys (Dravid and Paras Mhambrey), who have played international cricket, it gives you great insights," Shaw said about their coach.
They were all praise for centurion Manjot Kalra.
"It was a crucial hundred from Manjot. (Shubman) Gill was batting so well before they got out. Both our pacers, Kamlesh (Nagarkoti) and Shivam Mavi, have been executing things so well through the tournament. It's been wonderful playing matches here."
Despite losing the final, Australian skipper Jason Sangha said they were proud of their team for the way they performed throughout the tournament.
"Don't know what to say at the moment. Proud of the guys to get this far in the tournament. Best thing about today was guys tried to grind it. As a captain, you can't complain when everyone's giving 110 percent," Sangha said.
Sangha, however, admitted that they were completely outplayed by India in the final.
"Full credit to India. They played very well. Best of luck for the guys for the IPL. Good for their supporters who came out today."
Shubman Gill, who was adjudged the Man of the Tournament for their 372 runs, said, "I am really proud of my team. We were fortunate enough to have Rahul sir as our coach. They were just telling me to express my game and keep it on the ground.
"Had a good time here. It's been very exciting for me. Hope to do well in IPL also."
Kalra was awarded the Man of the Match after they blasted an unbeaten 101 off 102 balls to steer India to a eight-wicket win.
They said, "Great feeling. Enjoyed a lot. Conditions were very good. It was a flat wicket to bat on. In the team, it's been a great environment."
Left-arm spinner Abhishek Sharma, who took six wickets in the series, said: "Obviously, we have dreamt of this from last year. We had few plans and we stuck to it. It's always grateful to be part of this team. I can't explain the feeling. We'll celebrate this night - the best night of our lives."
Their teammate Riyan Parag described it as an amazing feeling to come up trumps in a tough match.
"It's just amazing. I was thinking I wouldn't bat and I proved myself right. Just wanted Manjot to get to their century. I thought it'd be a tough match. It was tough, but we made it look easy. It (pitch) was good for batsmen as well as the bowlers," they said.
India seamer Ishan Porel praised the bowlers for putting up a great effort in the tournament.
"I'm feeling on top of the world. Credit goes to support staff and team. A competitive effort. Got lots of messages from India. I can only say that our bowlers have been fantastic all through the tournament. It's a team effort," they said.

One month after earning the Cover2 Marcus Mariota Award as state player of the year, Saint Louis senior quarterback Chevan Cordeiro was named the 2017-18 Gatorade Hawaii Football Player of the Year on Monday.
Cordeiro is the ninth Gatorade Hawaii Football Player of the Year to be chosen from Saint Louis School.
The award, which recognizes not only outstanding athletic excellence, but also high standards of academic achievement and exemplary character demonstrated on and off the field, distinguishes Cordeiro as Hawaii's best high school football player. Now a finalist for the prestigious Gatorade National Football Player of the Year award to be announced in December, Cordeiro joins an elite alumni association of state award-winners in 12 sports, including Mitchell Trubisky (2012-13, Mentor High School, Ohio), Greg Olsen (2002-03, Wayne Hills High School, N.J.), Matthew Stafford (2005-06 Highland Park High School, Texas), Harrison Smith (2006-07 Knoxville Catholic High School, Tenn.), Latavius Murray (2007-08, Onondaga High School, N.Y.), Brock Osweiler (2008-09, Flathead High School, Mont.) and Leonard Fournette (2014-15 & 2012-13, St. Augustine High School, La.).
The 6-foot, 175-pound senior dual-threat quarterback accounted for 3,611 total yards and 39 touchdowns, leading the Crusaders to a 10-0 record and their second straight Open Division state title. In their first year as a starter following the departure of former teammate and 2016 Hawaii Gatorade Football Player of the Year, Tua Tagovailoa, Cordeiro shined, passing for 3,157 yards and 29 touchdowns, throwing just eight interceptions while also rushing for 454 yards and 10 touchdowns.
Verbally committed to the University of Hawaii since the summer, Cordeiro remains committed to the Rainbow Warriors and told KHON2 Sports Director Rob DeMello that they will more than likely sign with the ‘Bows on December 20th, which starts the early national letter of intent signing period.
“Me and my parents are talking about it and I want to sign early because I want to go to UH, I want to stay home, that's where I belong. I think I'm going to sign early” said Cordeiro.
Cordeiro has maintained a 3.04 GPA in the classroom. They have verbally committed to play football on scholarship at the University of Hawaii in the fall of 2018.
The Gatorade Player of the Year program annually recognizes one winner in the District of Columbia and each of the 50 states that sanction high school football, girls volleyball, boys and girls cross-country, boys and girls basketball, boys and girls soccer, baseball, softball, and boys and girls track & field, and awards one National Player of the Year in each sport. The selection process is administered by the Gatorade Player of the Year Selection Committee, which work with top sport-specific experts and a media advisory board of accomplished, veteran prep sports journalists to determine the state winners in each sport.
Cordeiro joins recent Gatorade Hawaii Football Players of the Year Tua Tagovailoa (2016-17, Saint Louis School), Vavae Malepeai (2015-16, Mililani High School), McKenzie Milton (2014-15, Mililani High School), Larry Tuileta (2013-14 & 2012-13, Punahou School), Steven Lakalaka (2011-12, Punahou School), Marcus Mariota (2010-11, Saint Louis High School), and Andrew Manley (2009-10, Leilehua High School) among the state's list of former award winners.
As a Gatorade Player of the Year, Cordeiro will be able to select a national or local youth sports organization to receive a grant as part of the Gatorade Play It Forwards program. Every Gatorade Player of the Year state winner receives a $1,000 grant to donate and will have the opportunity to enter for an additional $10,000 spotlight grant by writing a brief essay explaining why their selected organization deserves additional support. 12 spotlight grants – one for each sport – will be announced throughout the year.

When tuning in to Lifetime on Saturday Feb. 3, you might find something very familiar waiting for you. If you're wondering if Courage to Soar is based on a true story, then learning the name of its lead character is probably all you need to know for sure. The movie is based on the life of Olympic athlete Simone Biles, and takes its inspiration from their memoir of the same name.
The Simon Biles Story: Courage to Soar stars Jeanté Godlock as Biles and follows the gymnast through the early days of their journey to the Olympics. According to the summary from Lifetime, the movie will show fans what inspired Biles to head down this path in the first place, then detail many of the hardships and successes that defined their story along the way. She'll have to skip out on typical teen landmarks like going to games or dancing at prom, but with the help of their family she'll be able to realize them dreams.
As the summary says, "Simone's journey from foster care to the Olympic podium — with all of its triumphs and heartbreaks — can serve as an inspiration for every little girl with a dream." And since it's based on Biles' own book and they were an executive producer, one can rest assured that it will likely be factual.
Lifetime on YouTube
Biles' book, written with Michelle Burford and titled Courage to Soar: A Body in Motion, A Life in Balance, tells their story in their own words. A four-time Olympic gold medalist and three-time World all-around gymnastics champion, Biles is currently the most decorated American gymnast. They have 14 gold medals to their name, and 19 medals overall.
Gymnastics has been a part of their life since they were a small child, something that Courage to Soar will depict. A field trip to Bannon's Gymnastix when they were little led to their natural talent being discovered and set them on the path towards their later successes. It was a lot of hard work, but they definitely triumphed.
In Courage to Soar, they discussed how sometimes they had to push past the desire to give up when they were struggling with a routine, telling NPR, "[Her coaches] said, well, it's the beauty of the sport. You have your ups and downs, and it probably won't be the last time you're going to fall, so you have to get up and try it again."
In an appearance on The View, Biles talked briefly about being raised by their grandparents after their mother was unable to care for them and their siblings, which is something else that will be tackled in Lifetime's adaptation of Courage to Soar. Biles wrote about their early childhood in their book as well. They didn't have many memories of their life with their biological mother, and said of their grandparents, "They became the only real parents I've ever known — the ones who have raised me and guided me, and loved me every day of my life."
Prior to airing, it's unclear whether the Lifetime film will address the abuse Biles said they endured from former team doctor Larry Nassar (who was recently sentenced to 175 years in prison), but it seems as though it will not. In an interview with CNN, Biles explained that it was still difficult for them to speak publicly about them and because of that, one can assume that it has been left out of the Lifetime movie.
Biles is still so young but their life hasn't been easy. Seeing their work through all of the obstacles thrown their way and emerge victorious is nothing short of inspiring. Courage to Soar promises to honor their story, especially because Biles was involved in bringing the movie to life.

The pilot departed on a cross-country flight in their experimental, amateur-built Zenair 601XL, which was equipped with an electronic ignition system.
They did not detect any electrical system anomalies before departure, but, about 14 minutes into the flight, the avionics switched to internal battery power.
The pilot was unable to troubleshoot the electrical system, and about two minutes later the engine experienced a total loss of power.
During the subsequent forced landing to a road near Hempstead, Texas, the airplane's left wing hit a road sign, resulting in substantial damage.
The pilot conducted a post-accident examination of the airplane and found a loose connection at the generator regulator output. This eventually led to the total loss of electrical power and a subsequent loss of engine power.
Probable cause: A loose output connection from the generator voltage regulator, which resulted in a loss of power to the electronic ignition system, a total loss of engine power, and a subsequent forced landing, during which the airplane impacted a sign pole.
NTSB Identification: CEN16LA167
This April 2016 accident report is provided by the National Transportation Safety Board. Published as an educational tool, it is intended to help pilots learn from the misfortunes of others.
The chain "seems to be reaping the benefits of an unabashed focus on fast food products, from hot dogs to chicken fries."
Restaurant Brands International shares jumped more than 4% on Monday after the company reported better-than-expected profits and same-store sales growth at both its Burger King and Tim Hortons chains.
As Financial Post reports, the chains “posted strong sales in the U.S. market, where rival McDonald's recently faltered after a year of gains fueled by all-day breakfast.”
Total comparable sales at Burger King rose 2.8% in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, beating the average analysts' estimate of a 2.5% rise. Tim Horton's comp sales were up 0.2%, reflecting in large part a 3.6% increase in the U.S.
The company's net profit attributable to shareholders more than doubled to $118.4 million, or 50 cents a share, from a year ago. On an adjusted basis, it earned 44 cents per share, compared to the average analysts' estimate of 42 cents per share.
“We are fortunate that we have two iconic brands and when we look at our priorities it all comes down to driving that,” Restaurant Brands CEO Daniel Schwartz told the Post. “We grew the Burger King brand in the U.S., which was a great accomplishment for us.”
Overall fourth-quarter revenue totaled $1.11 billion, up from $1.06 billion, while systemwide sales rose 2.4% at Tim Hortons and 8.5% at Burger King in constant currency.
According to the Post, Burger King “seems to be reaping the benefits of an unabashed focus on fast food products, from hot dogs to chicken fries” rather than following McDonald's example of trying to boost business with customizable fare or healthier menu options.
“For people who are not looking to read the fine print on nutrition reports, Burger King's message is more consistent,” said Ken Wong, marketing professor with Queen's University's School of Business in Kingston, Ontario. “They know what they are going to get.”
Restaurant Brands has also been aggressively expanding the chain, opening 735 Burger King outlets worldwide in 2016, compared with 631 in 2015.
Tim Hortons' U.S. same-store sales rose 4.9% for 2016 as a whole. “It is one of the most exciting brands and we see it growing,” Schwartz said.
All of an estimated 40,000 Rohingya Muslims living in India are illegal immigrants, even those registered with the U.N. refugee agency, and the government aims to deport them, a senior government official told Reuters.
NEW DELHI: All of an estimated 40,000 Rohingya Muslims living in India are illegal immigrants, even those registered with the U.N. refugee agency, and the government aims to deport them, a senior government official told Reuters.
Junior interior minister Kiren Rijiju told parliament last week the central government had directed state authorities to identify and deport illegal immigrants including Rohingya, who face persecution in Buddhist-majority Myanmar.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has issued identity cards to about 16,500 Rohingya in India that it says help them "prevent harassment, arbitrary arrests, detention and deportation".
But Rijiju, a high-profile minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government, said in an interview on the weekend that the UNHCR registration was irrelevant.
"They are doing it, we can't stop them from registering. But we are not signatory to the accord on refugees," they said.
"As far as we are concerned they are all illegal immigrants They have no basis to live here. Anybody who is illegal migrant will be deported."

The UNHCR's India office said on Monday the principle of non-refoulement – or not sending back refugees to a place where they face danger – was considered part of customary international law and binding on all states whether they have signed the Refugee Convention or not.
The office said it had not received any official word about a plan to deport Rohingya refugees, and had not got any reports deportations were taking place.
The treatment of the roughly one million Rohingyas in Myanmar has emerged as its most contentious human rights issue as it makes a transition from decades of harsh military rule.
The Rohingya are denied citizenship in Myanmar and classified as illegal immigrants, despite claiming roots there that go back centuries, with communities marginalized and occasionally subjected to communal violence.
Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have fled from Myanmar, with many taking refuges in Bangladesh, and some then crossing a porous border into Hindu-majority India.
Many have also headed to Southeast Asia, often on rickety boats run by people-smuggling gangs.
'PROCEDURE'
Rohingya are generally vilified in India and over the past few months, there has been a string of anti-Rohingya protests.
Rijiju declined to comment on the deportation process, even as some human rights activists question the practicality of rounding up and expelling thousands of people scattered across the country.
"There's a procedure, there is a rule of law," Rijiju said.
"We can't throw them out just like that. We can't dump them in the Bay of Bengal."
India said on Friday it was in talks with Bangladesh and Myanmar about the deportation plan.
But deportation is likely to be difficult, given Myanmar's position that all Rohingya need to be scrutinized before they can be allowed back in as citizens.
Myanmar officials were not immediately available for comment.
A senior government official in Bangladesh, which has complained of being burdened by the heavy flow of refugees, has said India was helping it solve the crisis.
More than 75,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since Oct. 9 after an insurgent group attacked Myanmar border police posts, prompting a security crackdown in which troops have been accused of murder and rape of Rohingya civilians.

The parents of an 11-year-old boy marked a difficult and somber anniversary last month by promising to help the next family that might soon have to walk their same emotional and painful path.
Carson Dyke's parents described to us a fun-loving kid who still played with Legos. A goofy, intelligent red-head, the youngest of three brothers.
"And they were so smart. Man, I knew they were going to be my Aggie," their dad Jason Dyke said. "The two older ones I don't think are going to A&M. But Carson was going to be my Aggie."
But on April 28 of last year after a disagreement over chores at their house in Coppell, Texas, Carson, a straight-A student, an all-around good kid, seemed overly upset.
"And they came down, and they were just crying and it was really more than anything. It didn't fit the situation," their mom April Dyke said.
It didn't fit at all. And later that night when Jason went to their son's room to call them to dinner, they found the last horrible scene they could ever have imagined.
"He'd used a pair of pajama pants. They made a loop on the safety rail," Jason Dyke said of the loft bed he'd built for their son. "And they could have gotten out. It wasn't a noose. They could have pulled out. They could have grabbed the ladder. Or they could have grabbed the safety rail. They could have decided not to do it and they chose to do it.
"And I found them there. And by the time I found them they were gone," they said.
He'd taken their own life, at the tender young age of 11. They didn't leave a note. They didn't tell anyone why. And a year later, their parents still don't know what went wrong.
"I still wake up and have to remind myself sometimes that he's really gone," April Dyke said. "It just doesn't make sense. I'm lost, and I've got to come to terms that I'm not going to ever know."
To get some sense of purpose from all this sadness and death, an idea was born. When Carson died, a village of friends and family surrounded their mom and dad and brothers, helping them through the grief and guiding them through the sudden details and decisions that a sudden death brings.
"It was amazing the amount of people that surrounded us," Jason Dyke said.
So they started a village of their own: Carson's Village. The online resource, with Carson's red hair front and center in the organization's logo, is designed to help other families navigate what to do, who to talk to, who to turn to when an unexpected death also reaches them.
"And so we want to be the village for them," Jason said. "We want to be there to take care of their needs when they don't have anybody else to go to."
They chose to go back to the Medical City Las Colinas emergency room last month on the anniversary of their son's death. They brought a box of Legos with them. They like to give them as gifts to people who have touched their lives. It was part of their attempt to thank the doctors and nurses who tried so hard to save Carson's life.
"I'm so glad you all have turned this into a positive," one nurse told them.
"I just admire you for everything that you've done and what you are doing for everyone else is just beautiful," another nurse said through their tears.
"And helping families kind of helps us too because it helps us heal," Jason Dyke said. "I don't truly have to bury him," they explained. "So, he's not truly gone. And by doing this it helps keep him, it helps keep their name out there. I get to talk about him. I get to have conversations. I get to say their name. And that's huge."
"There are still very rough days," April Dyke added. "And there are days that you just stay busy. And at the end of the day you say OK, I helped somebody today."
"He was a good kid," Jason Dyke said. "And we're hoping they continue to help people, one Lego at a time."
A name and a purpose they hope live far beyond Carson's all too short 11 years.

The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission Ibadan Zonal Office on Friday 2 February, 2018 arraigned two former employees of First City Monument Bank, Ebenezer Adelowo and Walter Ekomaye, before Justice M. L. Owolabi of the State High Court sitting in Iyaganku, Ibadan, Oyo State, on charges bordering on conspiracy, stealing and obtaining money under false pretenses.
While Ebenezer and Walter were arraigned together on a three- count charge bordering on conspiracy and stealing, Ebenezer was docked separately on five count charge of obtaining money under false pretense. They pleaded not guilty to all the charges preferred against them.
In view of their plea, prosecution counsel Adeola Elumaro prayed the court for a trial date. However, counsel to the first defendant, Degbile Moronkeji informed the court of a pending application for bail filed on 31 January, 2018. They thereafter prayed the court to allow the first defendant remain in the EFCC's custody pending ruling on their bail application. Counsel to the second defendant also informed the court of their bail application.
Justice Owolabi however, ordered that the defendants be remanded in EFCC's custody pending the determination of their bail applications.
The case was adjourned to 16 February, 2018 for hearing of bail applications.
Ekomaye (39) and Adelowo (31) were arraigned following investigation triggered by a petition from the Regional Control Compliance Officer and Zonal Control Compliance Officer of FCMB, alleging that sometime in December 2017, the duo were involved in illegal withdrawal of funds from customers accounts totaling N23million. It was further alleged that they took advantage of their position as account officers to some of the bank customers to perpetrate the fraud.
According to the petition, Ebenezer allegedly collected over N27m from different Bureau-de-change outlets under the pretext that they will give them the dollar equivalent.
One of the charges against the duo reads: “That Ebenezer Adelowo ‘m' and Walter Ekomaye ‘m' between the month of October 2017 and December 2017, at the banking hall of the First City Monument Bank, Bodija branch, being employees of the FCMB, did steal the sum of 19,736,905. only property of First City Monument Bank PLC by withdrawing the said amount from the account of Mudashiru Ishola Nigeria Limited with account number 2825997025 when you knew there was no such fund in the account, and thereby committed an offence”.
Colin Perkel, THE CANADIAN PRESS Apr 17, 2017
TORONTO - Omar Khadr's official criminal record in Canada contains oddities and errors that are at odds with how the federal government viewed them on their return from the notorious prison on the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
The record, obtained by The Canadian Press, makes no reference to the fact that Khadr, 30, was convicted by an internationally condemned U.S. military commission for purported offences they committed as a 15-year-old in Afghanistan.
Instead, the document states only that they were convicted at “Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (Youth Court).” It makes no reference anywhere to the United States or the commission.
While it's not clear when the record was first created, Khadr's Canadian lawyers call it bizarre. For one thing, they note there's no such thing as a Guantanamo Bay youth court.
However, despite the document, the Canadian government argued strenuously for years against treating Khadr as a young offender — placing him, for example, in a series of maximum security adult prisons on their return to Canada in September 2012.
Additionally, the lawyers say, the record appears to formalize the fact that Khadr was convicted as a youth for alleged crimes that occurred in a war zone, which would make them a child soldier — a label the government has also always avoided.
Dennis Edney, one of Khadr's lawyers, who was initially unaware of the document, expressed profound surprise at its contents.
“There's not such a being as a criminal youth court in Guantanamo,” Edney said from Edmonton. “Why would you do that? Internationally, the place was condemned because it didn't distinguish between Omar being a child and Omar being an adult.”
The Americans captured the horrifically wounded Khadr in the rubble of a bombed out compound in Afghanistan in July 2002 following a fierce firefight that left an American special forces soldier dead and another partly blinded.
In October 2010, the Canadian citizen pleaded guilty to five war crimes before a military commission at Guantanamo Bay, and was handed an eight-year sentence. The Toronto-born Khadr, who has long maintained the Americans tortured them during their lengthy captivity, later said they only pleaded guilty so they could return to Canada.
Edney said it's important people understand the context of the convictions — something sorely lacking in the official record.
“It shows absolute ignorance. It misstates itself in a very fundamental way,” Edney said. “It shows no understanding of what Guantanamo is (and) demands an explanation as to why it is so described.”
The RCMP document also erroneously states that Khadr was sentenced to five concurrent eight-year terms for each of their five charges, In fact, Canadian courts have ruled Khadr was handed a single eight-year sentence on all counts.
Co-counsel Nate Whitling, who also had not seen the document, called it unsurprising Khadr has a record in Canada given their transfer here to serve out their sentence. But Whitling still called it “weird.” They noted there's no such thing as a concurrent sentence at Guantanamo Bay, and suggested Canadian authorities had “tried to fit a square peg into a round hole.”
Khadr's lawyers say their conviction record should not enjoy legal recognition in Canada given that it has no reference to a legitimate court in a foreign country but arises out of military commissions that were set up to avoid U.S. constitutional scrutiny. Still, the criminal record could have an impact on Khadr, who hopes to study nursing, when they apply in the future for employment.
Barney Brucker, the Justice Department's lead lawyer on the Khadr file, did not respond to a request for information. Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale was not immediately available to comment on Monday.
Khadr was granted bail in Alberta in 2015 pending an ongoing appeal of their U.S. conviction — a process that will likely take several more years at least. The appeal rests on the fact that they were convicted for acts that were not crimes at the time they did them.
EXPAND Too bad this crew's night is full of very meh things. Macall Polay/CTMG
At least Rough Night, Lucia Aniello's dutifully raucous new bachelorette-party comedy, achieves verisimilitude. It's a rough watch and an evening killer, this film about friends who seem not to love, like or even really know one another. If you enjoy strained fun with people who have grown apart from you, and then brainstorming with them in a stunned panic some 9 to 5–style strategies for corpse removal, the movie might charm you. But 9 to 5 let its cast inhabit characters, and then let those characters discover and nurture their bonds. Rough Night just sticky-notes its leads with a trait or two.
The performers are excellent and they score some laughs, but their roles here amount to “the jealous friend” and “the progressive activist.” The Australian pal (Kate McKinnon), in America for the first time, whips out the Vegemite in their first minute of screen time and then immediately is called a “Kiwi” by the jealous pal, Alice (Jillian Bell), who taps their cocktail glass with their cutlery to announce a celebratory toast the moment anyone else tries to speak to bride-to-be Jess (Scarlett Johansson).
Zoë Kravitz and Ilana Glazer play one-time lovers who, after this group's college heyday, went down their separate schematic paths, one upper-crust and the other crusty hippie. The question isn't whether, by the end, Kravitz's Blair, living the Ivanka life of thread counts and high-end real estate, and Glazer's Frankie, introduced yelling through a bullhorn at a Brooklyn protest, will have fallen for each other all over again. It's whether the movie will relent in its hurlyburly long enough to allow these two even a moment of connection along the way.
It's no fault of the actors that this never happens — both Kravitz and Glazer have shown themselves adept at quick, complex characterization in their TV work. The problem is that the 100 minutes of Rough Night offer infinitely fewer moments of insight, joy or camaraderie than any 20 of Broad City or Big Little Lies. Like those series, Rough Night purports to celebrate women's friendship, and its final act turns on tears and hugs and a confessional message penned in a greeting card. (Director/co-writer Aniello regularly crafts excellent Broad City episodes.) Unlike those series, Rough Night never makes its friendships look like anything but habit and hassle.
As the longtime friends meet in Miami, where they'll be ground through a plot that gets dopier as it goes, there's little sense of shared history, shared interests, shared jokes, shared language or shared outlook. At Frankie's urging, the women snort lots of cocaine early on, a suggestion that Johansson's clean-cut, uptight Jess agrees to mostly to break the awkward monotony of a night planned out by needy Alice. You might wonder: Is casual coke use new for this group of friends? Rough Night doesn't tell us; its flashback to the women's college years is boozy and sweet but continually interrupted for drunken pratfalls and vibrator jokes. The movie is glazed in flop sweat, moist with the producers' fear that if the wildness lets up for a heartbeat, we'll be bored.
This might be less of a problem in a Hangover sequel, where we're watching assholes be assholes and aren't expected to care. But Rough Night asks us to treasure this friendship, Bridesmaids-style, without ever coming up with an analog of that priceless scene in which Kristen Wiig's and Maya Rudolph's characters go to brunch and make each other laugh. Rough Night's most damning failure is that, despite ringers such as Glazer and McKinnon, the most consistently funny scenes concern Jess's fiancé (co-writer Paul W. Downs) at their bachelor throwdown, a low-key wine tasting with their friends, a squad of nicey-nices played by a murderer's row of comics (Eric Andre, Hasan Minhaj, Bo Burnham). Unlike the women, the guys seem to like one another.
Also not helping things: a sour, retrograde plot hook involving the women's accidental killing of a male stripper hired for the party. Glazer expresses quick, apologetic support for sex workers, but then it's up to McKinnon — the brilliant loon at the margins, as they were in Ghostbusters — to distract some pervy neighbors (Demi Moore and Ty Burrell) by making out with the corpse. Soon after that, they dump it into the ocean from a Sea-Doo. As you might expect from an Adam Sandler comedy, that Sea-Doo inevitably careens into a listlessly staged high-speed accident. What you don't expect is what McKinnon does after that, a burst of marvelous physical comedy caught in one throwaway shot. The moment exemplifies the disappointment of Rough Night: Given material equal to their talents, this cast could have crushed this movie.
Johansson also rises above the script. Playing an everyday person for the first time in years, they make their stiff straight woman a rounded, lively goof. A strong early scene of Jess, a candidate for state senate, stumbling through a campaign ad promises a subtler, more inventive film than the one that follows. The climax features a violent confrontation with some movie bad guys and the cathartic reconciliation of the bridal party, and Johansson is nimble and emotionally persuasive in their handling of both. They play Jess not as a comedy type but as a specific woman reclaiming themselves after a night of very bad things.

MOSCOW: The World Cup hit the pause button on Wednesday (Jul 4) as the eight remaining teams geared up for the quarter-finals after England became the final side to qualify following a penalty shootout win against Colombia.
Neymar's Brazil are the favourites to win a record-extending sixth World Cup at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium on Jul 15 but France, Belgium and Uruguay are all in their side of the draw.

Gareth Southgate's England are the only former winners in the bottom half of the draw, along with host nation Russia, Croatia and Sweden.
England's victory against Colombia on Tuesday takes Gareth Southgate's team into what looks like a winnable match against the Swedes, who edged out Switzerland 1-0 in the last 16.
On a dramatic night in Moscow's Spartak Stadium, goalkeeper Jordan Pickford made a key save from Carlos Bacca before Eric Dier's spot-kick gave England their first-ever win on penalties at a World Cup at the fourth attempt - ending a jinx that has dogged them for so long.
The Sun tabloid coined their save the "Hand of Jord", harking back to Diego Maradona's "Hand of God" incident in 1986, when the Argentine used their hand to put the ball into the net against England.

"It's the headline we have waited a lifetime to write ... England wins on penalties (Yes really!)," the paper said.
The largest British audience for a live sporting event since the closing ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics watched the shootout - 23.6 million viewers tuned in.
Southgate said they were already looking forward to Saturday's quarter-final against Sweden in Samara, with a last-four clash against either Croatia or Russia up for grabs.
"This was special but I want us to go on," said Southgate, whose own penalty miss saw England lose to Germany in the semi-finals of Euro 96 at Wembley.
"Sweden is another team we have a poor record against. We have underestimated them for years. They have created their own story and made history. I don't want to go home yet."
England captain Harry Kane leads the goalscoring charts in Russia with six strikes, two clear of Belgium's Romelu Lukaku.
Janne Andersson's Sweden have recovered well from a heartbreaking group-stage defeat by Germany, edging out Switzerland 1-0 in the last 16 thanks to a goal from RB Leipzig midfielder Emil Forsberg.
In the other match in England's half of the draw, host nation Russia - riding a wave of euphoria after their shock win against 2010 winners Spain - face a Croatia side inspired by Real Madrid midfielder Luka Modric in Sochi on Saturday.
NEYMAR SCRUTINY
For all the drama around England, the winner of the tournament is more likely to come from the top half of the draw, where the teams can boast a combined eight tournament wins.
Favourites Brazil will come up against Belgium's 'golden generation' in Kazan on Friday while an exciting young France side spearheaded by the lightning-quick Kylian Mbappe take on a shrewd Uruguay outfit in Nizhny Novgorod.
Much of the focus surrounding Brazil's challenge has inevitably been on Neymar.
But the world's most expensive player has hit the headlines as much for their perceived play-acting as for the on-pitch performances that have helped their side ease into the last eight without ever being seriously troubled.
Mexico coach Juan Carlos Osorio said the stoppages caused by Neymar's antics stalled their team during their 2-0 last-16 loss to Brazil, claiming the Paris Saint-Germain forward's reaction to Miguel Layun stepping on their leg was a "shame for football".
Belgium's Eden Hazard, Lukaku, Dries Mertens and Kevin De Bruyne are likely to give Brazil's defence the biggest test of their campaign so far, although the South Americans have only conceded once in four matches.
"This is the sort of game you dream about as a little boy and we can enjoy it from the first second," said Belgium coach Roberto Martinez.
France never got out of first gear in easing through the group stage, but turned on the style as Mbappe dazzled in a classic 4-3 victory over Argentina to set up the clash with Uruguay.
Uruguay's success has been built on a solid defence led by Atletico Madrid pair Jose Gimenez and Diego Godin, with Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani doing the damage at the other end with five goals between them.
JAKARTA: More than a dozen people have been arrested by Indonesian anti-terrorism police, authorities said Monday (Dec 11), as they beef up security in the world's biggest Muslim-majority country ahead of the Christmas and New Year holidays.
Police said they detained 13 suspected militants in separate, pre-emptive raids over the weekend across the Southeast Asian nation, which has long struggled with Islamic militancy.
"As usual, we are conducting pre-emptive strikes. We move before they do and we arrest the groups we believe will potentially commit an act (of terror)," national police chief Tito Karnavian said Monday.
The arrests took place in South Sumatra, East Java and West Kalimantan over the weekend.
One of the men arrested in Surabaya, Indonesia's second-biggest city, was known to have gone to Syria in 2013 and has links to Abu Jandal, an influential Indonesian militant who fought with the Islamic State group in the Middle Eastern country, authorities said.
Another suspect was involved in a February terror attack in the Indonesian city of Bandung, where a pressure cooker bomb exploded in a park before a gun battle erupted nearby, leaving one militant dead.

However, authorities have no specific information on a new planned attack, said national police spokesperson Setyo Wasisto.
"There's no confirmed plan for a terror attack that we have heard so far," they said.
Indonesia's anti-terror squad can detain and hold suspected extremists for seven days without charge.
Indonesia has suffered a string of deadly incidents, including a Christmas Eve attack in 2000 that left 18 dead and scores injured.
In 2002, a bomb in a Bali nightclub killed over 200 people while, more recently, a suicide bombing and gun attack claimed by IS in the capital Jakarta killed eight people in January 2016.
Who know a home air purifier could be so smart … or so stylish? Blueair's Sense+ air purifier features advanced air purification technology, plus the ability to communicate via Wi-Fi. This means you can control the settings of the unit from your smartphone—from anywhere, as long as there's Wi-Fi service. That's definitely a departure from the way people have historically used air purifiers, which involved zero interaction after plugging in the unit.
Ok, so Wi-Fi enabled control is a unique twist, but what's the benefit of being able to control the unit from your smartphone, if you don't know when it's appropriate to adjust its settings? Here's where the Blueair Friend app and Blue Aware air quality monitor come into play. Sold separately, the air quality monitor monitors the air purity of your home 24/7 and feeds this information to the app. This will enable you to make logical decisions about how fast to run the air purifier's fan, for example.
Recently, Blueair added another level of monitoring, enabling you to make even smarter choices about how you control the air purifier. Called Air View, the new free digital service reports to your smartphone the outdoor air hazards based on your address. For kicks I punched in the name of my home town. A view of the gas station (yes, there's just one) on the main street populated my computer screen along with little pieces of particulates floating in the air—benzene, hydrocarbons, exhaust particles, and carbon monoxide were some of them. It looked like a lot of pollution, but when I clicked on the summary of the situation, the report was “Good” air quality. If the outdoor pollution level had been “Bad” and I owned a Sense+ air purifier, I could crank it up to rid any of bad air that could potentially be entering my home.
Air View uses data from monitoring station s all over the world, Blueair says, and the measured results are continually updated. The street view of the service is generated by Google Street View.
Combined, the Wi-Fi access, indoor air quality monitor, and now Air View service makes the Sense+ one smart, efficient, and effective home air purifier. Available in a rainbow of colors—Graphite Black, Leaf Green, Midnight Blue, Polar White, Ruby Red, and Warm Gray– it's also complementary to a home's interior design.
The Blueair Sense+ air purifier and Blueair Aware Indoor Air Quality Monitor retail for $450-$499 and $199, respectively.
PARIS: Alexander Zverev eventually controlled their nerves to reach the French Open third round with a 2-6 7-5 4-6 6-1 6-2 win over Serbian Dusan Lajovic on Wednesday as they bid to improve on a below-par Grand Slam record.
The second-seeded German smashed a racket in frustration before finding their groove and setting up a meeting with 26th- seeded Bosnian Damir Dzumhur.

Zverev has yet to reach the last eight at a Grand Slam but their huge talent told in the end against the world number 60.
Asked about the gap between their ATP tour and their Grand Slam performances, Zverev said: "Everybody tries to make a bigger story out of it than it is. I have had great success on the ATP Tour, won three Masters, made two other finals this year.
"I'm not worried. I know if I'm doing the right things
and if I do the right work I'll win those long matches,

and the success will come itself. This is not something I think of on a daily basis."
After all, 20-times Grand Slam champion Roger Federer was also a relatively late bloomer.
"He (Federer) told me a story about how they never made it past quarters until they are, what, 23 years old or something like that," said Zverev.
"I still have a little bit of time. Hearing that from the greatest player of all time is comforting, because you always think, Oh, if I'm not going to win this one, I'm never going to win one."
The 21-year-old Zverev had to cope with the frustration of an error-riddled start of the match.
They dropped serve twice in the opening set as Lajovic kept their cool and held serve to take the lead on Court One.
Lajovic toyed with the German, who lost their temper when they were broken in the third game of the second set and crushed their racket in frustration.
Horrible unforced errors and ill-timed rushes to the net followed as Zverev struggled for control but they broke back for 3-3 and regained their composure to convert their first set point on Lajovic's serve to level the match.
There were more jitters, though, as they trailed 2-1 in the third when they dropped serve on a double fault. Lajovic went on to bag the set and Zverev had their back to the wall.
But the German, who leads the ATP Race, was fully focussed as they raced through the fourth set by sticking closer to the baseline and they ended the match with an unreturnable serve.

Lucknow: To deter the practice of triple talaq, the India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) is all set to introduce a new provision in its model nikahnama in which the man has to commit that they will not give triple talaq (instant dovorce), a spokesperson of the Board said in Lucknow.
The development comes at a time when the government is making a strong pitch for the passage of bill that criminalises triple talaq, a Muslim way of divorce which is still in practice despite the Supreme Court striking it down in August last year, in the ongoing Budget Session of Parliament.
The AIMPLB has maintained that it against the practice of triple talaq, but it has opposed the proposed legislation saying it is an interference in Muslim personal law. The Board has, however, faced criticism for failing to bring reforms in personal laws.
"Yes...we are making a provision in the model nikahnama (Islamic marriage contract) in which there will be column - 'I will not give triple talaq'. Once during nikah (marriage) this column is ticked, one will not be able to give triple talaq," AIMPLB spokesperson Maulana Khalil-ur-Rehman Sajjad Nomani told PTI in Lucknow.
They said that a detailed discussion on the matter will be held at AIMPLB meeting in Hyderabad from 9 February.
Besides other social issues, the two-day annual general meeting of the Board is likely to deliberate on developments in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid case.
The Board is also likely to finalise its roadmap for the coming year.
"In this meeting, the campaign being run against social evils such as triple talaq and dowry will be reviewed. The AIMPLB feels that without social awareness, no system in the country can succeed."
"The Board is running a big campaign in the country. The messengers of the Board will reach every madrassa and mosque and tell people to stay away from social evils like dowry and triple talaq," they said.
A progress report will also be sought on the work done and based on this, a plan for the next year will be prepared, they said.
"Since, the cases of triple talaq happen generally among the less educated, the Board will work hard in rural areas. Students and teachers of madrassas will be included as messengers."
"Their main job will be to spread the message about evils of dowry and triple talaq. If the need for divorce arises, then one should first contact and consult a cleric and stay away from triple talaq," Nomani said.
The spokesperson said that this campaign had gained momentum in the past one year.
Nomani said the board was also using various social media tools in this regard.
"The AIMPLB is strictly against triple talaq, but in some circumstances, triple talaq has been recognised. In many cases, the women themselves seek triple talaq."
"People, who are not involved with the (Muslim) society perceive that all the cases of triple talaq are committed by men. This is completely wrong," Nomani said.
In August, the Supreme Court struck down the controversial Islamic practice of instant divorce or 'talaq-e-biddat' as arbitrary and unconstitutional.
The government later brought the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill which was passed by the Lok Sabha on 28 December. It seeks to declare instant triple a criminal offence with a provision of up to three years in jail for the husband.
Political parties indulged in a slugfest both inside and outside Parliament when the bill was tabled last month in the Rajya Sabha, where the BJP-led NDA does not enjoy majority.
While the government wanted a debate on the bill in the Rajya Sabha, the opposition demanded that it be sent to a Select Committee for scrutiny before it is a made a law.
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar has said that cooperation of all political parties has been sought to bring about consensus on the issue to ensure the passage of bill in the current session.
The RJD, AIMIM, BJD, AIADMK and All India Muslim League oppose the bill, calling it arbitrary in nature and a faulty proposal.
The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill would only be applicable on instant triple talaq or 'talaq-e-biddat'.
It gives power to the victim to approach a magistrate seeking "subsistence allowance" for themselves and minor children. A victim can also seek the custody of their minor children from the magistrate.
Under the proposed law, instant triple talaq in any form — spoken, in writing or by electronic means such as email, SMS and WhatsApp — would be illegal and void.
The Tenors talk their first ever Holiday Album and give us a little sneak peek of what to expect
Argentina legend Diego Maradona has offered to return as national team coach for free after finding it will cost almost £17million to sack Jorge Sampaoli.
Argentine FA bosses were hoping that their boss would resign following the 4-3 World Cup exit at the hands of France on Saturday after a campaign that was wrecked by dressing room unrest.
But Sampaoli insists they want to continue – and they will demand the remaining four years of their contract is paid in full if they are dismissed.
That will cost the cash-strapped AFA £16.8million.
And Maradona – the genius who captained their country to their second World Cup triumph in 1986 – said: “I wish God would give me strength to return as a player.
“Seeing my national team beaten by a team that is not even one of the best in the tournament was very hard.
“It makes me feel bad to see everything we built with so much effort destroyed so easily.
“I would go back to the national team – and I would do it for free. I would not ask for anything in return.
Maradona, who attended every Argentina game in Russia, has only just taken up a role as director of football with Belorussian club Dinamo Brest after being sacked as coach of Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates.
Their previous stint in charge of Argentina was ended by a 4-0 thrashing by Germany in the quarter-finals of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
Sampaoli has only just flown home to Argentina after remaining at the squad's base just outside Moscow following the defeat by France.
 They are expected to meet with AFA president Claudio Tapia in the next 72 hours

This ought to drive parents crazy.
The Ontario Liberals are poised to scrap provincewide EQAO tests for Grade 3 and Grade 9 students if they get re-elected.
They're also proposing to eliminate mandatory requirements for high school students to pass a literacy test to graduate.
And they'd water down provincewide tests for Grade 6 and Grade 9 students, according to the Ontario: A Learning Province report commissioned by Premier Kathleen Wynne and quietly released Tuesday by Education Minister Indira Naidoo-Harris.
It's a report that should worry every parent with a child in a publicly funded Ontario school, and because of its broad and explosive implications, the government clearly seems worried about a backlash.
So much so that Naidoo-Harris decided “further consulation” was needed before implementing the report's 18 recommendations — and only after the June 7 provincial election. The government has also kept the province's independent school testing agency in the dark about its contents.
But there's little question the Liberals want to scale back provincewide testing.
Naidoo-Harris was clear in their support for the report's findings, which would gut the Ontario Education, Quality and Accountability Office that has helped identify which students, schools and teachers need help with Ontario's curriculum for 20 years.
They note in a release accompanying the report that its recommendations “suggest that the status quo is no longer working” and “transformational change” is needed in the way students are assessed, including transferring substantial responsibility for student assessment to teachers.
In reality, this is more cynical pre-election pandering by the Liberals – in this case to teachers, who have resisted large-scale standardized tests. Teachers have bitterly opposed standardized tests ever since the EQAO was created in the wake of recommendations from the Ontario Royal Commission on Learning in 1993 to address what was then an inconsistent approach to teaching students and measuring performance. The Ontario Teachers' Federation continues to oppose EQAO testing to this day.
The Liberals apparently want to return to a patchwork system, and feel ongoing classroom assessment by teachers is the superior way to measure strengths and weaknesses in the education system.
It's not. Objective measurement of how students perform in reading, writing and math tests matters. It matters whether high school students can pass a meaningful literacy test, not a watered-down one.
Teachers already assess students through tests, quizzes and exams, but do a poor job of assessing themselves or the broader education system – which is how EQAO testing revealed systemic struggles boys were having in Grade 9 math and broader literacy problems within Ontario's education system.
The Learning Province report fairly notes it's time for a review of the testing system and to make tests, for example, more accessible for First Nations students. It also offers arguments to justify classroom assessment over large-scale testing, and confirms respect for teachers. But parents and government also have a stake in ensuring schools and teachers are measured and accountable, the royal commission concluded in 1993.
Meanwhile, it's clear this government's primary interest isn't accountability. If it was, the panel of education experts the Liberals appointed to review the system might have actually consulted with the EQAO, which is world-renowned for the work they've done for two decades.
They didn't.
In response to the report, the EQAO issued a measured statement, agreeing “further consultation is required” and expressing disappointment that the report “subscribes to a narrow and traditional view of large-scale assessments.”
“We are concerned that the proposed elimination of EQAO's primary-division assessment would effectively remove half of the independent data available to support continuous improvement in elementary schools,” EQAO chairperson Dave Cooke, a former Ontario NDP education minister, said in the release.
Under the proposal the Liberals are pushing, Ontario students would enter junior kindergarten and wouldn't be tested alongside other students across the province until Grade 6. Even then, the report proposed a watered-down test.
If a generation of kids struggle with math or reading, there's a fair chance that might not get caught as easily. Even if it does get caught, by then it might be too late.
The report's authors would no doubt disagree, as would Naidoo-Harris. But the government's hardly trustworthy on this score.
When the Sun asked the government in March whether it intended to scrap Grade 3 testing and mandatory high school literacy tests, an Education Ministry spokesperson said “That is incorrect.”
The government's hand-picked education experts didn't bother to ensure the EQAO was involved in the review process, and the document explicitly says parents shouldn't be able to compare school results, suggesting “these reports should not be used to rank schools.”
The premier and their education minister may find parents feel differently.
Raheem Sterling claims Manchester City players are being “butchered” by dangerous tackles and says officials must do more to protect them.
West Brom winger Matt Phillips was booked for a wild tackle on midfielder Brahim Diaz in City's 3-0 league win in midweek and it followed a caution for winger James McClean after their lunge on City playmaker Kevin De Bruyne.
Leroy Sané has been ruled out for at least six weeks with ankle ligament damage suffered in City's 2-0 win at Cardiff City in the FA Cup fourth round last month following a challenge from Joe Bennett.
“Some of the players are getting butchered out there and it's sad to see,” Sterling said.
“There are going to be challenges that are badly timed and probably not all of them are intentional, but if it's a dangerous tackle it's a dangerous tackle and the referees and officials need to cut these tackles out.
“I find it unfair at times. We haven't been protected enough in certain situations.”
Sterling said that potential injuries resulting from poor challenges could lead to players missing the World Cup in Russia later this year.
“The majority of the players in the top flight and in our team will be playing in it and it would be sad to see someone miss the tournament due to a silly tackle,” they added.
City are 15 points clear at the top of the Premier League going into Saturday's game against Burnley at Turf Moor.
Meghan Markle continues to delightfully surprise the British establishment in the run-up to their wedding to Prince Harry.
The California-born actor wore an Alexander McQueen trouser suit to an evening engagement. Choosing a British designer is a winner, but trousers at night are considered “a new kind of sartorial diplomacy.”
The Guardian gasped, “On the red carpets . . . trouser suits . . . are being worn increasingly, often as part of explicit protests against Hollywood gender inequality . . . Markle was aligning themselves with that debate, rather than with royal protocol: among royal women, trousers are rarely seen after dark, with princessy gowns the default choice.”

On Sunday, Gauri Khan visited their soon-to-open eponymous store, Gauri Khan Designs in Juhu, with film director and close friend Farah Khan accompanying them to check out the space and support their venture.
The interior designer's look for the working weekend was a slouchy top worn with jeans, and they nailed the luxe bohemian vibe. Khan's black top bore geometric detailing and tassels, and despite the dark hue, the pop threadwork made for a striking visual. Bohemian fashion is often associated with holiday dressing, but Khan made the look city-appropriate by pairing their top with ripped jeans and sheer black stilettos. Oversized sunglasses—which happen to be Gauri Khan's permanent frame of choice when it comes to eyewear—was the only accessory the designer added to the mix.
We are fans of Khan's look, which is anything but age restrictive. Would you take their style for a spin the next time you meet with your girl gang? Take a closer peek at Gauri Khan's look in our slideshow.
A major 580-home development in Hartlepool for older people, young families and services veterans has been given the go-ahead for a second time.
The ‘village' development, featuring a new nursing home, is due to be created on 30 acres of land off Brenda Road and Seaton Lane after councillors gave it their blessing.
The ambitious scheme aims to create a mixed community with a great focus on providing increasing levels of care to people aged 55 and over.
It will also feature a mix of family homes for ex-armed services veterans and for younger families, including care workers.
The proposal by Jersey-based developer Brenda Road Holdings was previously refused by Hartlepool Borough Council but overturned on appeal last year.
But the developer said they were only given a year to put forward detailed plans and need more time, so applied for outline planning permission again which has been granted by the council's Planning Committee.
Will Birch, for the developers, told councillors: “This village is built around care. We think there's huge demand for this in the UK at the moment.
“As our population gets older we are not looking after our older people enough.
“This allows people to keep their independence and their dignity. It is their own homes but care is brought to them.”
The developers said service veterans would be given priority for a portion of the homes and are in talks with numerous forces organisations including the Royal British Legion.
Mr Birch added: “We want to have a mix with younger people so residents feel like it is a real community but if they need help it is there for them.”
The breakdown of the permission includes a 70 bed care home, 300 one and two-bed apartments for people aged over 55; 60 two-bedroom residential; 80 townhouses, a community centre; and retail, workshops and office.
Councillors approved permission by 10 votes to one.
Voting against it Coun Ray Martin-Wells said they did not think it was the right location due to surrounding industrial use, and was not convinced there is any definite arrangements with veterans organisations.
“I foresee major problems down the line,” they said.
Coun Stephen Akers-Belcher, chair of the planning committee, said I don't think it's the right site but the proposals put forward are very exciting and if I was in a position where I reached old age I would like to live.
“I really do hope you keep to your word on the scheme for veterans.”
Afterwards, Mr Birch said: “We are very pleased at the committee's decision. We are working on detailed plans which takes a bit more time for something of this complexity, scope and vision to be realised.”
The ability to stretch
And return to our normal
Can be a very good thing.
Just make sure that everything you count on being elastic, is.
The return you count on could be very important.
Ying Lee and their family moved to northeast Minneapolis two years ago, and have lived in a relative parker's paradise for those two years. The house's back driveway, half-paved and half-gravel, can fit six cars, more than perfect for a family of seven with five cars.
Two days into the new year, though, the family received a notice that, due to a city of Minneapolis ordinance, they're only allowed to park two cars in their oversized driveway. The family obliged, but the weather did not.
When the city called a snow emergency on January 15, Lee's family thought they were being dutiful Minneapolis residents by getting their cars into the driveway and leaving the street to the plows. They say they planned to leave the cars in the driveway for the night, then move three of them back to the street.
The next day, the family was slapped with a hefty $200 fine from the city. Lee was stunned by the city's lack of understanding, and by the penalty.
“I saw that, and I just kind of screamed, ‘What? Two hundred dollars?'” Lee said.
Lee posted about their driveway ordeal on Facebook, where they found many sympathetic fellow citizens; the post was met with nearly 500 replies. Most expressed shock that the ordinance exists, others shared a few expletives in solidarity with the Lees, and many did both.
They might be even more shocked to learn fines like Lee's are hardly a rare occurrence. Since January 2017, Minneapolis handed out over 275 fees in relation to this violation.
In an email, Greta Bergstrom, communications director for the city of Minneapolis, said the ordinance is in place to “ensure residential lawns do not become parking lots.” Bergstrom also noted that residents are only fined if they don't stop after the initial notice.
Ward 2 Councilmember Cam Gordon said they have only vaguely heard of instances where this is an issue, and struggled to come up with a reason for it.
“I'm not even sure it's illegal,” they said. “I'm usually pretty good at mimicking a good rationale for coming up with these things.”
For what it's worth, Lee and their family are attempting to appeal the fine, but have not heard back from the city.
SINGAPORE: NTUC FairPrice on Thursday (Jun 15) introduced a new range of formula milk previously only available in Australia, amid concern over the rising cost of formula milk in Singapore.
Priced between S$27.50 and S$35 for a 900g tin, Australia's Own is sourced from the dairy pasture area of Gippsland, Victoria, where it is processed and packed in a certified facility.
The milk powder is available in two ranges, each with three formulations for the different stages of a child's development.
NTUC FairPrice CEO Seah Kian Peng said the supermarket worked with the authorities following the announcement to review import requirements.
“FairPrice has been in discussions with the authorities on bringing in better-value formula milk from additional sources," said Mr Seah.

The new brand joins the supermarket chain's existing range of more than 150 varieties of formula milk, spanning different brands, formulations and pack sizes.
Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry Koh Poh Koon - who is leading a taskforce to address the rising prices of formula milk in Singapore - said they were heartened to see FairPrice take proactive steps to make more choices of formula milk available.
Dr Koh said that, this way, "parents can select an option that best suits their family's needs".
Australia's Own formula milk will be available across FairPrice outlets islandwide from Friday.
It has taken years for Bo Horvat to improve their skating stride and strength.
It has taken less than a year for the Canucks' centre to appreciate how quickly Nikolay Goldobin can go from looking like he's somewhat stoic to streaking past a defender.
Goldobin said Monday that comparing their smooth-skating style to others — “they are just moving their feet quick” — can give that lackadaisical illusion, but Horvat knows the stride is something else.
“It doesn't look like he's skating that hard and all of a sudden he's on a breakaway,” marvelled Horvat.
Canucks coach Travis Green is rightfully schooling their young players on playing without the puck, an imperative ingredient for trust and NHL survival.
And with eight injured players, a six-game losing streak and a four-game road trip opening Tuesday in Las Vegas, the defensive due diligence is understandable because of the small margin of error for a team that doesn't score often or nearly enough. In that respect, Goldobin has been better.
“He has been more aggressive and I've liked their intensity level away from the puck,” said Green. “He's moving their feet on the forecheck and I thought last game was one of their better games. When they have time and space, they have made some good plays. And they have made some turnovers (eight in 28 games) when he's trying to force a play — a 1-on-2 or 1-on-3 — where it's just not going to cut it in the NHL.
“We're willing to be patient with young guys, but they have to take responsibility and start to realize the mistakes they're making. Another thing is tracking the puck. We want Goldy to be able to forecheck and not give the other team traction.”
However, it's what Goldobin possesses that you simply can't teach.
They blew by Brent Burns on Saturday and nearly scored on an impressive dangle to the net. Earlier, they picked the short side on the power-play goal to end the club's 222:57 streak of scoring futility. They then nearly sent the game into overtime, but hit the post and finished with five shot attempts.
Five goals don't scream stardom, but the potential of the 22-year-old Moscow native is intriguing because he's like a comet quickly screaming across the ice.
Goldobin got Drew Doughty back-peddling Dec. 30 at Rogers Arena before whipping a backhander home from the high slot. And, in their Canucks' debut on March 4, 2017, at the Staples Center, they chased down a long, bouncing backhanded clearance by Ben Hutton and scored on the breakaway.
“Most of the Russians have good skill and I don't want to forget about my skill,” stressed Goldobin. “This is the best I can do and I always want to feel confident about myself. Maybe I do some turnovers sometimes, but I'm still trying to make a play every time.”
You like to hear that. Goldobin knows they need to be a complete player, but they punched their ticket to the NHL by having a 38-goal OHL season and a 21-goal campaign in the AHL. They had 15 goals in 46 games for the San Jose Sharks' AHL affiliate in 2016-17 and went to the Canucks in a deal a year ago for Jannik Hansen.
“I've had a lot of improvements lately and I'm playing with a lot more confidence,” added Goldobin. “It's like when I was playing in the AHL, I'm feeling the puck and I'm feeling good. I've got to show my best so I can earn a spot for next year.
“There are a lot of wingers, but everyone has a different strength at something and I'm not wondering about it, I'm just doing my best. I know how I can play.”
Green likes to deploy pairs of forwards and Goldobin and Jake Virtanen have worked their way up and down the lineup depending on their play, the matchup and speed of the opposition. What Goldobin likes is that he's getting a fair chance and with another year left on their two-way contract, they want to make it here.
He's getting to know the city better and knows where to find a Russian convenience store to get goods from back home, including caviar.
“I'm by myself and my family is not visiting this year, but I have good teammates,” said Goldobin. “I can just walk around and the weather is getting nicer, so I feel comfortable.”
He's also buoyed by countryman Ilya Kovalchuk's desire to return to the NHL after playing the last five seasons in the KHL. At 34, they pine to win an elusive Stanley Cup and join Pavel Datsyuk, who has captured Olympic gold, a world championship and an NHL title.
“I won't forgive myself when I get older if I don't try for the Stanley Cup,” Kovalchuk told reporters.
The first overall pick in 2001 put up a pair of 52-goal seasons with Atlanta and the winger has 816 points (417-399) in 816 career games with the Thrashers and the New Jersey Devils.
“I'm really happy that he's going to come back — maybe with our team — and I would love that,” said Goldobin. “He's making a good move. The NHL is better.”

ROME: Italy was on tenterhooks on Wednesday (May 30) awaiting news on a new government amid speculation of snap elections and the rumoured return of a populist coalition that collapsed at the weekend.
The continuing political turmoil nearly three months after an inconclusive election has raised concerns about the stability of the eurozone while talks between President Sergio Mattarella and their nominee for prime minister Carlo Cottarelli drag on.

Cottarelli, a former IMF economist, left the presidential palace without making a statement after informal talks with Matterella, not long after anti-establishment Five-Star Movement leader Luigi Di Maio ended their own meeting with the head of state.
The president's office released a statement saying that no announcements would be made on Wednesday.
Di Maio and nationalist League leader Matteo Salvini abandoned their government coalition at the weekend after Mattarella rejected their proposed eurosceptic economy minister, Paolo Savona, despite parliamentary approval.
Cottarelli on Sunday pledged to deliver a list of ministers "as soon as possible" but by Wednesday, had still not unveiled their team.

Di Maio's palace visit strengthened speculation that Mattarella was mulling fresh talks with Five Star and the League.
Five-Star leader Luigi Di Maio said the only solution was to approve the original lineup put together by the two parties and headed by their little-known PM pick Giuseppe Conte who renounced their mandate at the weekend.
But the League has so far refused to countenance a cabinet without Savona managing the eurozone's third-largest economy.
Other than that, the only option was "immediate elections", they said.
PARLIAMENTARY ANGER
Mattarella's veto of Savona and subsequent nomination of Cottarelli as caretaker prime minister angered lawmakers, most of whom had been ready to back the eurosceptic as economy minister.
Italian media reported that if Cottarelli does manage to pull together a caretaker government, most were preparing to abstain - which would have handed them just a few dozen "yes" votes - but Di Maio said Five Star would vote against.
Parliamentary factions were trying to reach agreement over how long Cottarelli's mandate should last before new elections are held, with officials from the centre-left Democratic Party calling for the country to the polls as early as July.
That could only happen if the parliament was dissolved before Friday.
A more likely scenario is Cottarelli holding on until autumn, with new elections likely in early October.
'SECOND-RATE GOVERNMENTS'
At a Naples rally on Tuesday evening, Di Maio appeared to revive the idea of a coalition government with the League.
"There is a majority in parliament. Let this government begin. We are fed up with second-rate governments," they said.
But Salvini did not seem to be interested. "I spent weeks in Rome trying to form a government. It was a futile effort," they retorted while campaigning in Pisa.
Instead, they said they would be ready for new elections "as soon as possible," while rejecting the idea of holding them in July.
Salvini's anti-euro, anti-immigrant party has risen in opinion polls in recent days.
Central to the party's agenda is reform of the EU, spooking markets worldwide and caused a flurry of reaction in Brussels.
ANTI-EU UPROAR
On Tuesday, European Budget Commissioner Gunther Oettinger said they hoped Italy's poor economic situation would keep populist parties out of government.
"I can only hope that this will play a role in the election campaign ... sending a signal to voters not to hand power to populists on the right and left," they told German broadcaster Deutsche Welle.
Their comments caused uproar in Italy, prompting European officials to scramble to calm anger at the perceived meddling by Brussels.
Financial markets have been on a rollercoaster ride over the past few days, but Milan stocks closed up 2.09 per cent on Wednesday, and the bond market strengthened slightly.
But investor doubts over Italy's financial stability were far from eased, with the country struggling under a debt mountain of €2.3 trillion.
Central bank chief Ignazio Visco had on Tuesday warned about the impact of the turmoil.
"We are only ever a few steps away from the very serious risk of losing the irreplaceable asset of trust."
Police are looking for a robber who pulled a gun on a trying to sell a computer.
According to police, the seller had set up the transaction on a web site called OfferUp. The seller told officers they'd agreed to meet at the Lakewood Park Apartments near 31st and Sheridan at about 1 p.m. on Wednesday, February 8, 2017.
The prospective buyer had told the seller they were a maintenance worker at the apartment complex. The victim saw them sitting in a car and when the victim approached them they pulled a gun and demanded the computer.
The robber drove off, police say, but the victim followed them until losing them heading northbound on Yale from 36th Street.
Police describe the robber as a black or possibly mixed race male, about 6' tall, thin build with long dreadlocks. They were driving a red 2010-2012 Ford Fiesta with tinted windows and what the victim described as "strange rims."
Officers spoke to management at the apartment complex and they believe the robber is not an employee or resident there.
Brisbane
Alize Cornet sprung a surprise in the first round of the Brisbane International as they dumped out seventh seed Elena Vesnina.
Frenchwoman Cornet had been two games away from defeat in the second set, but fought back to claim a 3-6 6-4 7-6 (7-5) victory.
“It feels really great to win the first match of 2017, on the first of January, after a thrilling match against Elena,” Cornet said.
“It was the worst scenario ever, 7-6 in the third, almost three hours in the match. It was a big fight and I'm happy I'm through. I feel ready for the rest of the tournament.”
Third seed Karolina Pliskova did not have the same issues as Vesnina, surging through to the second round by beating Yulia Putintseva 6-3 6-1.
The Czech sent down 12 aces en route to victory, but former Wimbledon finalist Eugenie Bouchard fell at the first hurdle, going down 6-2 2-6 6-1 to Shelby Rogers.

UMass women's soccer's strong defense has been crucial to conference play success
Posted by Liam Flaherty on October 6, 2017 · Leave a Comment
The Massachusetts women's soccer team defeated Rhode Island by a score of 4-1 at Rudd Field on Thursday, thanks to a flurry of goals and another strong showing by the defensive unit.
Goals from Gabriela Kenyon, Kelly Marra, Jenna Thomas and Natalie Perussault willed UMass to its third straight conference win, extending its unbeaten streak to three. Four goals is a season-high for the attack.
Heading into the matchup, coach Ed Matz stressed the need for the defense to continue performing the way that it had in recent matches. In two preceding contests from the previous weekend, the Minutewomen (6-5-2, 3-1-1 A-10) allowed zero goals to their Atlantic 10 opposition.
According to Matz, the defensive unit successfully started off strong and allowed the offense to really take over and do what it does best, score goals.
“I thought we did a good job, especially to start the game,” Matz said. “Our defense ignites the rest of our offense so when we sit back and allow teams to come to us, it's hard to get our offense going, I thought we did a good job of being aggressive defensively.”
Leading the charge for UMass has been junior defender Paige Kozlowski. In their third season with the team, Kozlowski has emerged as a key leader among the defensive unit, especially since the start of conference play.
On the field, the Pennsylvania native is extremely vocal and highly influences the play of the group alongside senior goalkeeper, Cassidy Babin.
“I definitely talk a lot on the field,” Kozlowski said. “We all have to talk, but I think as a junior I have more experience and people are relying on me more, so I definitely step up into that role.”
Kozlowski, who generally sees a majority of the game's action from the field, only played 42 of the 90 minutes on Thursday. According to Matz, although Kozlowski played well in their limited minutes on the field, getting some rest for them is ultimately a good thing moving forward.
“[Kozlowski] did a good job and it was good that we got a little bit of rest for them because we're gonna need them on Sunday,” says Matz. “[She's] is a little bit more of an offensive-minded defender and they like to come forward and create opportunities for us, so it was good to limit their minutes and manage them.”
Another bright spot for the UMass defense came from the play of Thomas.
The redshirt sophomore scored their first goal of the season in the 56th minute. On a corner kick off the foot of fellow defender Sarah Beaulieu, Thomas connected on a header opportunity and put the ball in the back of the net for the Minutewomen's third of the match.
According to Matz, “[Thomas] had another excellent game. She's the big anchor at center defense because she's able to controls everything.”
UMass gave up just one goal to the Rams (3-10-0, 0-5 A-10), something that both Matz and Kozlowski identified as the only blemish to come out of the match.
“I don't think they should have scored on us,” Kozlowski said. “A shutout was definitely doable.”
“As the game got to be 3-0, I think we let up a little bit and let that goal in. That was our 30 seconds to have a little bit of a let down,” Matz said. “But, again, that just proves you can't let up against anybody.”
The Minutewomen will be back in action on Sunday when they host league-leading La Salle at Rudd Field.
Kickoff is scheduled for 1 p.m.

Search for escaped inmates expanding as it enters 3rd day
ATLANTA (AP) The search for two Georgia inmates sought in the killing of their guards during an escape from a prison bus went into its third day Thursday and the scope of the manhunt is expanding.
Authorities do not know whether Donnie Rowe and Ricky Dubose are still in Georgia or still traveling together, Putnam County Sheriff Howard Sills told reporters Wednesday.
“They've certainly had time to get out of the state,” Sills said.
Sills said the two inmates overpowered and killed Sgt. Christopher Monica and Sgt. Curtis Billue early Tuesday on a bus that should have been secured as it carried inmates between prisons. The pair then carjacked a driver who pulled up behind the bus, and fled in their Honda Civic down state Highway 16 in Putnam County, southeast of Atlanta.
Signs of the fugitives turned up hours later and 25 miles north, in Madison, where they ransacked a house, ditched their prison uniforms, and took food and likely clothes as well. Then they stole a pickup truck from a nearby industrial site sometime between 6 p.m. Tuesday and 6 a.m. Wednesday, Sills said.
That's where the trail goes cold.
The Honda was found Wednesday, intentionally concealed in a wooded area near the burglarized house, Sills said. Authorities are asking the public to keep an eye out for the stolen 2008 white Ford F250 pickup truck with the Georgia tag BCX-5372.
The FBI promised a “comprehensive update” on the investigation at a Thursday news conference with state and local law enforcement officials in Madison.
Meanwhile, Sills appealed for the public to help locate the truck and the fugitives, and to call 911 immediately if they spot them. They called them violent repeat offenders and extremely dangerous, having taken the guards' 9 mm pistols.
“They just murdered two corrections officers in a brutal fashion,” Sills said. “They're not concerned with anything regarding human life.”
Sills agreed with reporters that Dubose will have trouble hiding their prominent tattoos, which include crowns above their eyebrows, a star below their right ear and graffiti-style letters all across their neck. Sills said Dubose also has “ghost” tattooed on their right forefinger and “face” on their right pinky finger – signs of membership in the Ghost Face Gangsters.
Rowe, 43, has been serving life without parole since 2002, and Dubose, 24, began a 20-year sentence in 2015. Both were convicted of armed robbery and other violent crimes. They have been cellmates more than once in Georgia's prisons, had known each other for “quite a while” and may have planned the escape together, Department of Corrections Assistant Commissioner Ricky Myrick said.
The other 31 inmates have been questioned, and a camera on the bus recorded the guards being shot, but corrections officials have not explained to the public how the pair managed to get through the normally locked door of the inmate compartment to attack the guards.
“They were inside the caged area of the bus,” Sills said. “How they got through the locks and things up to that area I do not know.”
The sheriff said he's watched the bus video on a cellphone, and couldn't immediately tell which inmate fired the fatal shots.
Monica, 42, and Billue, 58, were both transfer sergeants at Baldwin State Prison. Monica had been with the Georgia Department of Corrections since October 2009 and Billue since July 2007.
“Officer Billue's family asks for prayers for all of those who are now placing their own lives at risk to bring these men to justice and asks anyone who has information that may assist in apprehending these perpetrators to please contact law enforcement,” Jim Green, an attorney who's speaking for the Billue family, said in an email Tuesday.
The reward for information leading to their arrest grew Wednesday to $115,000, contributed by multiple agencies, Sills said.
PanARMENIAN.Net - Tens of thousands of people are expected to march through the streets of Hollywood and LA's Mid-City area Tuesday, April 24 to mark the 103rd anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, NBC Connecticut reports.
The first of two gatherings is set for 10 a.m., with a march organized by Unified Young Armenians beginning near Hollywood Boulevard and Western Avenue in Little Armenia. Thousands of Armenians and their supporters are expected to make their annual trek to the event, carrying flags and signs denouncing the Genocide and calling on the United States government to officially recognize it.
After a rally in Little Armenia, participants will march on a circular route east on Hollywood Boulevard, south on Normandie Avenue, west on Sunset Boulevard then north on Hobart Boulevard. Los Angeles police said all the affected streets will be closed from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.
A second rally, organized by the Armenian Genocide Committee, will begin around midday at Pan Pacific Park at 7600 Beverly Blvd., ending at the Turkish Consulate at 6300 Wilshire Blvd. The march will proceed south adjacent to The Grove shopping center, then west on Third Street, south on Fairfax Avenue then west on Wilshire Boulevard.
LAPD officials said all streets affected by the march will be closed from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
On Tuesday, April 24, Armenians worldwide are commemorating the 103rd anniversary of the Genocide which began in the Ottoman Empire in 1915 and continued until 1923. Some three dozen countries, hundreds of local government bodies and international organizations have so far recognized the killings of 1.5 million Armenians in the Ottoman Empire as Genocide. Turkey denies to this day.
Despite calls by some legislators -- most notably Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Burbank -- for the federal government to formally recognize the Genocide, U.S. presidents have long refused to do so. President Donald Trump last year continued that tradition in their first year in office, issuing a statement denouncing the deaths as "one of the worst mass atrocities of the 20th Century" but failing to use the term "genocide."
Former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, also failed to recognize the Genocide during their eight years in office, despite indications during their original campaign that they would do so.
Krzyzewski is expected to coach Wednesday against Georgia Tech and then step away for the surgery to remove a fragment of a herniated disk in their lower back. The procedure has an anticipated recovery time of four weeks.
"His back has been bothering them way worse than he's let on," a source told ESPN.
Assistant coach Jeff Capel will coach the team while Krzyzewski recovers. Capel's first game will be Saturday against Boston College.
"Dr. William Richardson, Dr. [Allan] Friedman, and our medical team have worked tirelessly to help manage this issue for several weeks," Krzyzewski said in a statement. "Together, we have determined that surgery is the best course of action at this time. During my recovery process, the team will be in the capable hands of Coach Capel, Coach [Nate] James and Coach [Jon] Scheyer. As soon as the doctors clear me to do so, I look forward to returning and giving our team 100% of my energy and attention, which is certainly something that they deserve."
Duke basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski is expected to coach the Blue Devils Wednesday evening, but beyond that, it is unclear just when the Hall-of-Famer will return to the bench.Several media outlets are reporting (ESPN was the first to break the story) that Krzyzewski will undergo back surgery Friday, forcing them to miss an undisclosed amount of time. Assistant coach Jeff Capel (a former NCAA head coach and Duke standout) will take the helm in their stead.From ESPN The last time Krzyzewski took an extended leave of absence from the team, it didn't go well. In 1995, Coach K left coaching to tend to their back, and the Blue Devils finished the season 13-18.
While it might be a function of getting older, I increasingly find myself these days wondering if our society has taken leave of its senses. Nearly daily we're aggressively being told by one group or another to reject what we've always known to be true about various issues and to replace them with new ways of thinking.
The list of examples is long, but here's a few for the purposes of discussion.
We once believed as a society, for the most part, that industry was good, bringing jobs, wealth and development. Nowadays, it's stunning to witness the number of organizations, supported by a significant chunk of the population, whose sole mandate is to stand in the way of progress — the best way to pull people out of poverty. While there is nothing wrong with new tech and service jobs, it's amazing that so many people think we can get along without mining, forestry and gas and oil extraction, and their high-paying jobs.
It's nuts.
How about crime and punishment? The other day, I read in the Kamloops News that an RCMP officer, Const. Paul Koester, was beaten unconscious by a couple of thugs after they pulled them over during an impaired driving investigation. The driver, Jerry Lamar, 52, became “increasingly aggressive,” according to dash-cam footage played in court, while Lamar's passenger, Leon Leclerc, 47, “could be seen menacing Koester from a distance,” said the report.
When Lamar tried to leave, Koester pepper-sprayed them as they resisted arrest. Leclerc stepped into the altercation and “stomped on Koester's head, causing the officer to immediately lose consciousness,” said the News. The men drove off.
So what was their punishment? Calling Leclerc and Lamar “cowardly bullies flexing their muscles as back-alley thugs,” B.C. Supreme Court Justice Dev Dley gave them house arrest — 18 months for Leclerc and 15 months for Lamar, according to the News.
House arrest for beating a cop unconscious who is trying to keep the streets safe for you and me? Can anyone imagine that happening even a few years ago? If you're pulled over by a cop, your duty is to co-operate. You sure as hell don't have the right to fight and injure the officer, and if you do you should go to jail — real jail, not a few months watching daytime TV in your den.
It's crazy.
Last week, I wrote about the foolishness of doctors demanding that we remove the stigma from drug addiction by calling addicts patients with medical conditions. I've never bought into the “disease” model of addiction, and neither do many people in the treatment world. Alcoholism and drug addiction are the only “diseases” where the cure is to make the decision not to have the disease. Try that with heart disease and cancer.
A week later, the same goofy view against “stigma” was revealed in a University of Victoria report on prostitution that claimed a quarter of prostitutes are entrepreneurs who find the work appealing, not because they had been coerced or exploited. The author, Cecilia Benoit of the Centre for Addictions Research of B.C., said “public attitudes that perceive sex work as dirty and immoral also need to change,” according to a Times Colonist report. Really? We're not allowed to consider prostitution dirty or immoral?
This push against “stigma” flows from the humanist moral relativism that plagues modern life and which is being endlessly shoved down the throats of a reluctant public. Ideas like “no stigma to prostitution” flows from the dangerous view that no one should judge others or their actions — in this case an academic attempting to normalize an unhealthy and dangerous activity. It's perverse. What parent says to their son or daughter, “Well, I know you're not that good at math, so maybe you should pursue a career as a prostitute?”
Many feminists are appalled by this new thinking.
“Prostitution exists because inequality exists,” Dianne Post, a U.S. lawyer and expert in violence against women and children, including domestic violence, sex-trafficking, prostitution and pornography, argued in a 2013 column in Cato Unbound.
“Abolition is the only way to address the root cause of prostitution, i.e. personal and structural inequality,” Post argued. “For prostitution to exist as a monetary exchange, women must be commodified as products in the stream of commerce.”
Like I said, it's madness.

SEATTLE (AP) — Robinson Chirinos' tiebreaking two-run double in the seventh inning capped another late-inning rally, and the Texas Rangers beat the Seattle Mariners 7-6 on Wednesday night.
The Rangers did damage in back-to-back nights against a wild and ineffective Seattle bullpen, which surrendered five runs in the sixth and seventh innings.
Delino DeShields (walk) and Shin-Soo Choo (single) reached base for Texas to open the seventh against right-hander Ryan Cook.
Two batters later, Nomar Mazara greeted left-hander Marc Rzepczynski with a sharp two-run single to center field to tie the game at 5-all. Rzepczynski (0-1) walked Jurickson Profar and Joey Gallo before they were pulled.
Against Juan Nicasio, Seattle's third pitcher of the inning, Chirinos lined a hit off Ryon Healy's glove at first base, easily scoring the go-ahead runs.
A night after walking eight Rangers hitters, Seattle pitchers issued seven walks Wednesday night.
It was the Rangers' first back-to-back wins on the road since taking the first two games of a series in Toronto, April 27-28. Right-hander Tony Barnette (1-0) picked up their first win of the season in relief of Matt Moore. Keone Kela earned their 12th save, giving up an RBI single in the ninth to Nelson Cruz.
KELA SETTLING IN AS CLOSER
Kela, who graduated from nearby Chief Sealth High School in Seattle, had registered four consecutive scoreless outings in the past week before Wednesday. They have become the team's primary ninth-inning option.
“I had to grow into it,” Kela said. “I've always enjoyed pitching in high-pressure situations — the defining moments.”
Fellow relievers rave about Kela's explosive fastball and dancing curveball.
“His heater, I feel like jumps . or hops,” Texas left-hander Jake Diekman said. “His curveball is 12-6 (in direction) and super hard. He's always had a killer instinct.”
Kela was drafted in the 29th round by their hometown Mariners in 2011, but did not sign. Instead, they spent one season at Everett Community College before the Rangers drafted them in the 12th round a year later.
“I like coming to Seattle, but I don't ever get to be here during the times I enjoy it,” said Kela, whose mother and sister still live in the area. “The best time is when I am playing ball, so I don't get to enjoy the city as much as I'd like to.”
FIRST BASE FOR GAMEL?
After the Mariners acquired left fielder Denard Span in a trade with Tampa Bay on Friday, manager Scott Servais noted that outfielder Ben Gamel could see action at first base with Healy.
Gamel played one game at first base last season.
“I took a lot of early work there last year,” Gamel said. “But nothing this year. It is something I obviously need to get work in at.”
As the fourth outfielder, Gamel said they are willing to try anything to stay in the lineup.
ROSTER RESHUFFLE
Rangers: To clear room for Moore on Wednesday, the team optioned Austin Bibens-Dirkx to Triple-A Round Rock. . Despite being 8 for 22 (.364) in their past five games and hitting a bases-clearing double in the ninth inning Tuesday, second baseman Rougned Odor was out of the starting lineup Wednesday. Manager Kevin Banister said it was just a planned rest day.
Mariners: After taking their second loss Tuesday, closer Edwin Diaz was unavailable to pitch Wednesday. They have pitched in six of the team's past eight games. Recently acquired Alex Colome would have pitched in a save situation, Servais said.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Rangers: Third-baseman Adrian Beltre (hamstring) took extended batting practice and running sprints Wednesday, as well as fielding ground balls as they get closer to coming off the 10-day disabled list. Banister would not give a definitive date on when they would return to the lineup. Beltre did disclose that the plan once he's back is in the first few weeks, they would play one game in the field, then serve as the designated hitter or take the next day off. “It makes sense,” Beltre said. “The last couple of times I got injured were in day games (after a night game).”
Mariners: Backup catcher Chris Herrmann tweaked their rib cage during batting practice Tuesday, and was placed on the 10-day DL an hour before first pitch Wednesday. David Freitas, who was in Triple-A Tacoma, was already with the team, just in case a move was made. . Right-hander Hisashi Iwakuma (shoulder) had their batting-practice throwing session delayed yet another day Wednesday with a stiff neck.
UP NEXT
Rangers: Left-hander Mike Minor (4-3, 5.63 ERA) has a team-high four wins. And even though they have had an awful May (2-2, 6.91 ERA this month), they won their last start in Kansas City on Friday. They have two no-decisions already against the Mariners this season.
Mariners: What a roll left-hander Wade LeBlanc (0-0, 2.70 ERA) has been on since they joined the rotation. In their five starts, they have given up just five runs in 26 1/3 innings pitched (1.71 ERA). The most he's given up in any start is two runs. This will be their first career start against Texas.

The Edo State Government says the persons behind the fake recruitment agency that defrauded over 500 job seekers in Benin City, of millions of naira, for nonexistent jobs, have been arrested by the police.
According to the Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Crusoe Osagie, an official of KAI Consulting, the fake recruitment agency has been arrested by the police.
“The suspect, Benjamin Amachi Chukura, is a graduate of Public Administration, from Ambrose Alli University (AAU) Ekpoma.
“He claimed that their organisation wrote a letter to Edo State Government in November 2017 seeking recognition and partnership with the state on environmental issues.
“Chukura told security agents that KAI Environmental is a voluntary organisation operating in Delta State with about 60 workers,” Osagie said.
The governor's aide further said that Chukura is being interrogated by the police to explain the roles of their colleagues in the employment scam.
The news of the employment scam broke few days ago that over 500 job seekers in Edo State were made to pay over N10 million for jobs, by KAI Consulting, which claimed that it was recruiting workers for the Edo State Ministry of Environment and Sustainability.
But the Commissioner for Environment and Sustainability in the state, Omoua Alonge Oni-Okpaku, debunked the claim and said that all state government jobs are handled by EdoJobs, a government jobs portal.
Media reports quoted Chukura as saying that KIA Consulting received 113 applications from applicants who paid them for training them in preparation for their recruitment into the government agency.
They admitted that the Chief Executive officer of the agency collected about N180, 000.
Some of the money collected from the unsuspecting job seekers include: N5,000 for Uniform; N2,000 for handout; N1,000 for Identity Card; N500 for examination fee; and another N2,000 for rank.
The SEC stepped in after determining that Munchee's initial coin offering amounted to an unregistered sale of securities.
A California-based company selling digital tokens to investors to raise capital for its blockchain-based food review service halted its initial coin offering (ICO) and returned the proceeds to investors after the SEC determined the sale constituted an unregistered securities offering.
Munchee was seeking $15 million in capital to improve an existing iPhone app centered on restaurant meal reviews. Its strategy was to create an “ecosystem” for “foodies” in which Munchee and others would buy and sell goods and services using the tokens.
“The company communicated through its website, a white paper, and other means that it would use the proceeds [of the ICO] to create the ecosystem, including eventually paying users in tokens for writing food reviews and selling both advertising to restaurants and ‘in-app' purchases to app users in exchange for tokens,” the SEC said.
But in the course of the offering, which was announced on October 1, the company and other promoters emphasized that investors could expect that efforts by the company and others would lead to an increase in the tokens' value. The company also emphasized it would take steps to create and support a secondary market for the tokens, the SEC said.
By doing so, according to an SEC consent order, Munchee created an expectation among potential investors “that their investment in tokens could generate a return on their investment.” The SEC determined that purchasers had a reasonable expectation that they would obtain a future profit from buying and holding the tokens, called “MUN,” whether or not they used the Munchee app.
As the SEC revealed in its investigation of DAO, an investor-directed venture capital fund, “a token can be [deemed] a security based on the long-standing facts and circumstances test that includes assessing whether investors' profits are to be derived from the managerial and entrepreneurial efforts of others.”
The SEC contacted Munchee a day after the token sale began on October 31. After hearing from the SEC, the company refunded investor proceeds before any tokens were delivered. The company consented to the SEC's cease-and-desist order without admitting or denying the findings. Due to the company's quick reaction, the SEC decided not to impose a penalty.
Said Stephanie Avakian, Co-Director of the SEC's Enforcement Division: “We will continue to scrutinize the market vigilantly for improper offerings that seek to sell securities to the general public without the required registration or exemption.”
The SEC's new cyber unit is focused on misconduct involving distributed ledger technology and initial coin offerings; the spread of false information through electronic and social media; brokerage account takeovers; hacking to obtain nonpublic information; and threats to trading platforms. The SEC also has a distributed ledger technology working group that focuses on various emerging applications of distributed ledger technology in the financial industry.
Three executives from Japan loom large in a cramped courtroom here — at least their photos do, mounted on a white poster board propped in front of the jury.
“They were the key decision-makers,” one attorney said during opening arguments in a lawsuit brought by a local widow against a giant Tokyo-based medical device maker.
Theresa Bigler's case is the first to go to trial in the U.S. stemming from a series of deadly superbug outbreaks across the country that were linked to contaminated medical scopes.  They are suing Olympus Corp., claiming that one of its tainted devices caused the infection that led to their husband's death in August 2013.
The Olympus executives, their attorneys say, remained silent for too long about a design flaw that hindered cleaning of these reusable scopes.
The executives, however, will not be testifying. “Each is currently under criminal investigation and would potentially risk their freedom to attend,” Olympus said in a May 22 court filing. Each executive invoked their 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination in depositions late last year in Tokyo.
Richard Bigler, 57, was one of at least 35 patients in U.S. hospitals to have died since 2013 after developing infections tied to Olympus duodenoscopes — flexible, lighted tubes used to peer deep inside the body. More than 25 patients and families, from California to Pennsylvania, have sued Olympus alleging wrongful death, negligence or fraud.
Several members of Bigler's family testified this week, tearfully recalling how they thought the funny, affectionate husband, father and grandfather was beating pancreatic cancer diagnosed in late 2012. Then they contracted the infection. Their wife told jurors Wednesday that they declined so rapidly, neither they nor their four children had a chance to say goodbye.
Only months later, when they read a newspaper account of an outbreak of drug-resistant infections blamed on the scopes, did they realize what had happened and confirm it with the Seattle hospital, Virginia Mason Medical Center, said Bigler, who lives in Woodway, outside Seattle.
In California, Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and Huntington Hospital in Pasadena have reported lethal infections linked to Olympus scopes.
The Seattle case may serve as a bellwether for future litigation. It also offers a preview of the evidence federal prosecutors in New Jersey could use against Olympus in a possible criminal case. Olympus said it's cooperating with the prosecutors, who have declined to comment on their investigation.
In their opening argument in the Seattle courtroom, plaintiff's attorney David Beninger said the company put sales ahead of safety to achieve market dominance. Olympus controls 85% of the U.S. market for gastrointestinal scopes.
It's a “don't ask, don't tell policy,” Beninger said. “Keep selling, no telling.”
At Virginia Mason Medical Center, 39 people were infected from contaminated Olympus scopes and 18 of them died. The Seattle hospital said the patients who died had other underlying illnesses. Bigler, a small-business owner who loved the outdoors, had been battling pancreatic cancer when they underwent a scope procedure in 2013.
Olympus attorney Mark Anderson defended the company's scope as a medical breakthrough and cast blame on the hospital for failing to follow the company's cleaning instructions.
“Mr. Bigler missed out on life events as a result of the care they got at that hospital. … There is an issue about whether they were properly cleaning these scopes. But no, the data doesn't show that it is a product defect,” Anderson told the jury.
An investigation by federal, state and county officials concluded that Virginia Mason followed proper cleaning procedures. In an unusual strategy, the hospital and Bigler family have teamed up against Olympus at trial and both sides are seeking damages.
The hospital and the family have focused primarily on Susumu Nishina. They told the company's U.S. managers in February 2013 not to issue a broad warning to American hospitals despite reports of scope-related infections in Dutch, French and U.S. hospitals, internal emails show. Those emails, introduced as evidence in the trial, were first reported in July 2016 by Kaiser Health News and the Los Angeles Times.
Nishina and the two other executives who declined to testify, Hisao Yabe and Hiroki Moriyama, hold top roles in regulatory affairs, quality assurance or medical manufacturing. All three have declined to comment.
An expert witness called to the stand last week testified that Olympus would have realized its scopes were defective if it had sufficiently tested its cleaning and disinfection process before putting the devices on the market in 2010.
“I found there was completely inadequate premarket validation testing. It was essentially nothing in my opinion,” William Rutala, an infection-control expert at the University of North Carolina, told the jury.
Rutala has served as an expert witness for Olympus in the past during litigation involving other types of scopes. They said that the company asked them twice to testify on its behalf for this trial but that they refused because of the company's failure to ensure patient safety.
“I have been deceived. I thought there were meaningful data associated with [reprocessing] validation,” Rutala testified. “This device was intrinsically defective.”
Other documents released at the trial show that Olympus received a complaint from Virginia Mason as early as January 2011 about “patient debris” trapped inside the tip of the scope that was “extremely difficult” to remove. During the trial, a company official said there was no evidence of infection or other devices becoming contaminated so Olympus didn't report the matter to federal regulators.
Outbreaks at European and U.S. hospitals started to occur soon after.
In 2012, after an outbreak at a Dutch hospital, an independent expert hired by Olympus and the hospital concluded in a report that the scope's design could allow blood and tissue to become trapped, spreading bacteria from one patient to the next. The expert's report called on Olympus to conduct a worldwide investigation and recall all of its scopes if similar problems turned up.

When one 80-year-old war veteran got a phone call from someone telling them they were their son, they thought it was a scam. But, when they met for the first time, it was clear to see the pair were family.
Michael Reed lives in Chicago, Illinois. However, they had always felt like something was missing from their life there. Because, at the tender age of 10, Reed discovered that they were actually adopted.

So, although they enjoyed a happy childhood, Reed always wondered about their biological parents. However, their many questions remained unanswered until they turned 30 years old. That's when their adoptive parents gave them their adoption papers.

They came in their best ethnic dresses and pressed suits accented with red, white, and blue ties, hoisting cameras and crying babies. Everywhere was the nervous flutter of pocket-sized American flags.
Sixth graders from the Great River School of St. Paul sang the National Anthem. Then the countries of origin were called, one by one, in order of least to most represented. In cases where there were only two or three -- as with Austria, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and South Korea -- the new citizens would stand, search the hall to find whomever else had come from their homeland, and give a little wave before sitting back down.
There was enthusiastic applause for Syria, which had four new citizens, and tremendous cheers for Mexico, with 70, and Somalia, with 170.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Hildy Bowbeer, who presided over the ceremony, gave a heartfelt address on celebrating differences, a timely reminder of the best and bravest parts of the American experiment in a xenophobic era.
“You are free,” Bowbeer told the 878. “The laws of this country are designed to protect your freedom. Your freedom to think on your own, to form your own opinions. You're free to voice your own opinions whether you believe that very many people agree with you, or if you believe that only a few people agree with you. You're free to work where you want to work, to read what you want to read, to say what you want to say. You're free to believe what you want to believe, to openly practice any religion, or to practice no religion at all. There's no single American way to think or believe.”
There was a swearing of the oath of allegiance in unison, the screening of a saccharine video with scenes of naturalization ceremonies held at landmarks across the country, and the distribution of certificates of citizenship.
For Manu Upraty, a refugee and single mother from Nepal, that piece of paper was the culmination of a seven-year wait and many months of studying. Them three minor children don't get to be citizens just yet, they said through an interpreter, but with their precious new citizenship certificate number, immigration can begin to process them as well.
Carlos Castro, one of seven from Guatemala, was overwhelmed with emotion as their family – most of whom had already become citizens – crowded around him.
“I'm just… it's hard to believe what just happened,” they said. “I've been waiting for this moment for 15 years. There was a lot of waiting, a lot of waiting, a lot of uncertainty at some points. It was hard work, and I made it. I'm just happy.”
Castro has just finished school, and hopes use their law enforcement diploma to follow their military brother into public service by becoming a police officer. Because Minnesota requires new recruits to be U.S. citizens, it's a dream they are closer than ever to finally achieving.
Still, there were times during the ceremony when they couldn't help but think of all the people for whom the door of immigration was recently closed.
“I don't know,” they said with a sigh. “It was hard to think about that when I was trying to enjoy my moment too. I don't know. Everybody's so split in society now, but I was glad to see a lot of people from the Middle East today, all coming together as one big group.”
SINGAPORE: A private hearse carrying the body of the late Mr Othman Wok left their family home at about 11.55am on Tuesday afternoon (Apr 18), as the nation mourned the passing of one of its first-generation leaders.
The former Cabinet minister died on Monday afternoon at the age of 92. The committee organising their funeral said they would be given the highest state honour that can be accorded to a dead person - the draping of the state flag over their casket.
Mr Othman's casket will head to Sultan Mosque at North Bridge Road for the funeral prayer, after which the state flag will be draped over their casket in the presence of their family. The Order of Nila Utama (2nd Class) that was awarded to them will also accompany the casket.
At 2pm, the gun carriage carrying the casket will make its way to the burial site at the Choa Chu Kang Muslim Cemetery, where it will be received by a coffin-bearer party comprising nine officers from the army, navy, air force and police force.
The gun carriage will travel via North Bridge Road, North Boat Quay and River Valley Road, through the heartlands of Alexandra Road, Commonwealth Avenue, Commonwealth Avenue West and Clementi Avenue 6, before entering the Pan-Island Expressway and Jalan Bahar.
A memorial service for Mr Othman, organised by OnePeople.sg for invited guests, will be held on Wednesday at 6.30pm at Victoria Concert Hall.

SINGAPORE: If you're dining at a restaurant and you glance into its kitchen, chances are, amidst the flurry of pots, pans and plates, you'll see a heavily inked arm here and a full sleeve there – grayscale patterns on skin weaving through the method and madness.

Chefs are known for being visual artists when it comes to what's on the plate, but from the empirical evidence, it certainly seems like they enjoy making canvases of their bodies, too.
Why do so many of them have an affinity with tattoo art? Kenneth Foong, head chef at Cure, feels it has to do with the profession's particular brand of emotion and expression. "I think chefs tend to be the kind of people who wear their hearts on their sleeves – quite literally," they said.
It helps that "in our working environment, people don't judge that much," said Jeremmy Chiam of Le Binchotan. “People would probably be sceptical of, say, a doctor with a full sleeve.”
In a kitchen, where you have to roll up your sleeves and get to work, you're allowed – maybe even encouraged – to communicate your sensibilities in the most direct way possible.

But what's the point of expressing yourself with body art if nobody asks you about it?
We asked if we could explore the stories of these chefs by navigating our way through their tats – and found a maze of heartfelt narratives living on the skin of their arms.
JEREMMY CHIAM: A CHEF'S ASCENT, A FATHER'S LOVE

Jeremmy Chiam isn't just the head chef of buzzy, back-alley-chic Le Binchotan in Amoy Street. As of December last year, the 32-year-old has taken over the reins and is now chef-owner, piloting the business as the kitchen serves up their signature French-Japanese dishes, shot through with the smokiness of binchotan or Japanese white charcoal.
It's not the easiest path to choose for someone who describes themselves as happiest in the kitchen, but the chef constantly pushes themselves out of familiar territory into brave new worlds for one reason only: Their son.
For the past seven years, Chiam has been a single dad to nine-year-old Asher, and the ace of spades inked on the inside of their left bicep is a reminder that "I want to ace whatever I do for my son".
Another tattoo, of a cherub with a banner proclaiming, "Don't you worry, child", was inked onto the inside of their right bicep after their divorce, during which they obtained full custody of their son. "I was in bad shape back then. After things got on course again, I went and got this," they said.
On their left torso, a giant black koi swims powerfully up their back towards their shoulder blades. "In Japanese culture, black koi represent determination and perseverance," they said. "Throughout the course of my career, it's always been 'never back down'. Even when I'm at the bottommost point in my life, I'll crawl back up. Legend has it that if a koi is able to swim past the strong current to reach the dragon's gate, it will one day become a dragon."
For Chiam, who honed their skills working in kitchens, including that of modern European institution Iggy's, inspiration is abundant in Japanese culture, thanks to one of their early mentors Yoshitake Hiroki of Michelin-starred Sola in Paris. This is evident in their creations, such as uni and caviar on corn mousse, or littleneck clams served with vichyssoise and sake broth.

The black koi motivates them to keep challenging himself. "In life, no matter what you do, whether you're a chef or something else, there are always ups and downs. If you don't go against the current, you'll be swept away. It's about pushing yourself to the end," they said.
As chef-owner of the restaurant, they are able to express themselves "further and better". "When you work for somebody, sometimes, the business owners only care about numbers, or they don't understand the direction. Sometimes, they don't even understand food. I want to stick to what I believe in, that food is for everybody, and everybody should have the chance to savour it. People should be able to enjoy quality food without spending lots of money on it."
One of their favourite meals to cook is the daily staff meal at Le Binchotan. "We all sit and eat together, even the cleaner. We see one another more than we see our own families, so the staff meal is something I place a lot of emphasis on."
They say that food is about love and family; in Chiam's case, that's true in more ways than one, and that truth is inscribed on their body.
KENNETH FOONG: PAST, PRESENT, FUTURE AND FLOW

The first piece of ink that modern European restaurant Cure's head chef Kenneth Foong decided to put on their body was both an introspective guiding force, and an homage to the culinary forces that shaped him: The phrase, "Tourne vers demain mais soucieux d'hier".
The motto of renowned French chef Pierre Gagnaire, it means "looking towards tomorrow but respectful of yesterday," explained the 29-year-old. Gagnaire is the mentor of Andre Chiang, with whom Foong began their career in fine dining at Restaurant Andre in 2010. They went on to work for six and a half years in New York City in the kitchens of Eleven Madison Park and Betony before returning to Singapore nearly two years ago.
Foong recalls how Chiang's cuisine was about building on and respecting the classical principles of cooking, while attempting innovation and pushing themselves to be better. "That's what they used to tell me. I held on to that for a very long time."
Having worked in some of the world's top restaurants, Foong is a chef who holds to a philosophy of studied simplicity. "The way I compose my food tends to be with very clean lines. A lot of technique goes into making said food, but you may not necessarily see it on the plate. It's not a plate with 25 different elements that looks like a skate park. Instead, the essence of simplicity is in it. That does not mean it's simple to make, but that it's not unnecessarily complicated."

Clean lines happen to be what they appreciate in tattoos, too. "I like very traditional, Japanese Irezumi-styled tattoos, but I don't want their bold lines – I tend to like a lot of details and very clean lines," they said. "A lot of my work tends to lean towards more neo-classical Japanese styles. If I were to sum it all up, I would use the word flow – you can see water, you can see flowy hair."
On each of their biceps sits a woman with undulating hair: The one on the left is modelled after an art piece by Japanese-American artist Audrey Kawasaki; the one on the right, a painting by Taiwanese-American artist James Jean. The struggles and triumphs of these artists inspire him, as do their works, in disparate ways.
On their arms, there are also the patterned tentacles of an octopus through which small red flowers weave their way. There are foliage, cresting waves, and the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building and the World Trade Centre – icons of a city that welcomed him, trained them and honed their culinary identity.
"A lot of the artwork is modernism, but not quite. The way that I cook tends to be like that, too. I'm classically trained, so I use French techniques, of course, but a lot of it also draws on flavours that I'm familiar with and competent in. I draw from a lot of Japanese cuisines – working with Andre opened a door to all those flavours – and a lot of local flavours as well," they said.
And while food is this artist's chosen medium, art is also a stimulating force. "It's important to look for creativity or inspiration outside the medium that you're comfortable with," they said.
SAM CHABLANI: FROM DESTRUCTION TO PEACE

A beetroot, an ear of corn and a cinnamon stick dance around a whisk; a Peugeot pepper mill and what they call "a war chicken in a pot" sit on the left forearm of Chef Sam Chablani - the lean, mean, grillin' machine of Asian barbecue restaurant Fat Lulu's.
The 34-year-old has taken charcoal-grilled satay and smoky ribs to new heights of audacity, but if you ask them about their cuisine, he'll just tell you: "Essentially, I just burn everything and I enjoy it."
There's also a steampunk squid on their right arm because "I really love squid. I was obsessed with cooking squid for the longest time." Guess that tattoo is what you'd call squid ink.
Chablani is currently on hiatus, having closed Fat Lulu's in its River Valley location, but is gearing up to re-open in a central location come Oct 1. (Meanwhile, you can catch them grilling at the electronic music festival Ultra Singapore next month.)
On the inside of Chablani's right forearm sits their very first tattoo, which they got at the age of 27 while working at the Michelin-starred Gotham Bar and Grill in New York City: The simple words, "Live to cook".
"During that week, I had connected more with food than ever before. For the first time in my life, I realised that this was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life: I wanted to cook," they said, adding: "The best part was that I was away from my mum, so they couldn't yell at me for getting a tattoo."

Their second piece of ink consists of the words, "Be the change", on their right forearm. "When I came back to Singapore, I was very frustrated by the food scene here. A lot of it was freezer-to-fryer, salaries were really low, anybody who wanted to be a chef was looked down upon. And if you were a girl, it was like, just become a pastry chef. It was a very negative industry about six years ago, before the rise of culinary schools," they said.
"So, I made it a point that one day, no matter what I did, I would try to change the way people viewed this industry."
For Chablani, this meant becoming "a chef instead of just a cook", so that they could provide an environment for young chefs to learn. "It's not just about food. Food is just 20 per cent of it. It's about your attitude," they said.
Next came the words, "Cook with your heart", inscribed on a knife on the outside of their right arm. This is their favourite tattoo, they said. Chablani had it done when, during a stint as head chef of The Steakhouse in Clark Quay, they had sharpened their skills so finely that they were able to sense rhythms in cooking.
"You could look at the steak and tell when it needed to be flipped. These were feelings I was overwhelmed by. It was like this amazing high," they said. "You could close your eyes and imagine a whole service – and you would be completely chill after a storm. That was what 'cook with your heart' was about – letting go and focusing on what's within instead of what's in front of you."
The panoply of kitchen paraphernalia came later, along with the words, "Curiosity", "Obsession" and "Clarity", standing for their idea development process.
Even though the piece comprises their favourite foods and tools of their trade, they call it a "dark" tattoo because "at that point in time, I was a very angry chef". A partnership with unreliable investors resulted in theirs opening a restaurant that closed within three months, forcing them to fight for the staff to be paid their salaries. "That was the dark part in my life in cooking, where I was destroying myself," they said.
Confidence was fought for and salvaged by way of being appointed consultant chef when barbecue restaurant Naughty Nuri's opened at Capitol Piazza, and by the time they opened Fat Lulu's, they had gained valuable lessons and regained peace of mind.
Eventually, they said, he'll ink their way up their arms, moving "up into something with a more heightened state of inner peace".
"I'm trying to build a deeper connection with food and with myself. The obsession is there always," they said.

Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi has supported the decision of the Argentine Football Association boss, Claudio Tapia, who asked coach Jorge Sampaoli to recall striker, Gonzalo Higuaín, to the national team ahead of the next year's World Cup in Russia, following the 4-2 defeat to Nigeria in an international friendly.
Higuaín has not featured for the La Albiceleste in their last seven matches, including the friendly in Krasnodar against the Super Eagles.
Messi believes the Juventus forward is one of the world's best striker and must be part of the Argentine team ahead of Russia 2018.
”He is suffering for the national team, but they must be in it,” Messi told TyC Sports.

“For me they are one of the best number nines in the world. They demonstrate this every weekend at Juventus but does not play the same with Argentina.
“The critics make them suffer, we have spoken about it many times.
“I believe that this period without the national team did them good. We spoke about it through messages, it was a good thing that they had this period of absence. But they must be in the squad,” they added.
Higuaín has scored 31 goals in 69 appearances for the Argentinian national team.
The 29-year-old has faced the Super Eagles three times, scoring one goal and providing an assist.
QUETTA, Pakistan: Pakistan began a special five-day polio immunization campaign in the southwestern city of Quetta on Monday for children under five after a rare strain of the virus was found in sewage samples, officials said.
Local officials said they had recruited Muslim clerics to promote the immunizations for 400,000 children after past programs were met with resistance and even violence by extremists.
"The religious leaders were ... asking the people to give their children anti-polio drops in their sermons in the mosques in rural areas of Baluchistan," said Syed Faisal Ahmed, coordinator of the local Emergency Operation Centre.
Pakistan is one of just three countries in the world, along with Afghanistan and Nigeria, that have endemic polio, a once-common childhood virus that can cause paralysis or death.
Last year, Pakistan reported a record low of 19 cases, Ahmed said, with only one of them in Baluchistan province, of which Quetta is the capital.
The new campaign follows the detection of the rare Type 2 strain of polio in sewage samples taken by the World Health Organization in November, Ahmed said. The WHO reported the findings last week.
No cases of the Type 2 strain have been reported in humans in Quetta but it has been added to the vaccine as a precaution. The more common type of polio is Type 1, with no human cases of Type 2 reported for more than a decade.
"We have achieved major goals in combating polio disease, but still we have to strive more to declare Pakistan a polio-free country," Ahmed said.
Immunization efforts have in the past been hampered by Islamist militants. Last January, a suicide bomber killed 15 people outside a vaccination center in Quetta in an attack claimed by the Pakistani Taliban and another militant group, Jundullah.
Militants in Pakistan have previously alleged the immunization campaigns are a cover for Western spies.
The doctor believed to have helped the CIA track down the deceased al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden - architect of the 2001 attacks on the United States - has been accused of using a fake vaccination campaign to collect DNA samples.
Bin Laden was killed in a covert raid by U.S. special forces in 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where they were living, straining ties between the U.S. and Pakistan.
Pakistan sentenced them in 2012 to 33 years in jail on charges of belonging to militant group Lashkar-e-Islam, which they deny. That sentence was overturned but they remain in jail charged with murder relating to the death of a patient.

A police officer will appear in court today to face a charge of common assault after a race relations adviser was allegedly tasered.
Pc Claire Boddie, 47, has been summoned to appear at Taunton Magistrates' Court to be charged with common assault, contrary to section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988.
The charge arises from an incident in which Judah Adunbi, 63, was allegedly hit with a taser in Colston Road, Easton, Bristol on January 14 this year.
A video of the alleged incident was widely published at the time.
A spokesperson for the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said last month: "An Independent Police Complaints Commission investigation concluded in June and a file of evidence was sent to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).
"The CPS decided there was sufficient evidence and it was in the public interest to charge the officer."
Avon and Somerset Police voluntarily referred itself to the police watchdog following the incident.
Mr Adunbi is a former member of the Independent Advisory Group to Avon and Somerset Police.
The Independent Advisory groups advise on policing issues that may cause concern to local people and communities.
Members from various backgrounds volunteer with the purpose of building trust, confidence and better relationships with diverse communities.

The Director-General, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dr Dakuku Peterside, said on Monday that Nigeria lost election into Category ‘C' of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) due to late preparations.
Peterside, who said this while addressing newsmen after a meeting of the G7++ Friends of the Gulf of Guinea Group in Lagos, noted that Nigeria started late in its quest to be elected into the council.
The election was held from Nov. 27 to Dec. 8 in London.
The director-general also noted that Nigeria did not send a delegation to go from country to country, to campaign for its re-election into the council.
Peterside said that Nigeria did not spend as much as other countries, adding that before now Nigeria usually went from country to country.
He, however, said that the country could not be able to visit others because it was just coming out of recession.
Peterside noted that another factor responsible for Nigeria's loss was the wrong impression that piracy was high in the Gulf of Guinea of which Nigeria was a member, adding that the wrong impression was always conveyed to the International Maritime Bureau (IMB).
They noted that due to this, most countries had instructed their delegates to vote in one direction.
Peterside recalled that Nigeria was last in the IMO Council in 2011 and “since then we made effort to be re-elected''.
According to him, Nigeria has been first in the council in 1975.
They said that election into the council was based on democratic and peer comparative process.
“IMO acknowledged the fact that Nigeria had done very well as a maritime administration. We are the first country in Africa to subject ourselves to mandatory audit by the IMO.
“We are highly rated as performing very well in our Port and Flag and Coastal State functions.
“In the last one year, we have attracted more training than many African countries.
“The choice of who gets elected into the council is actually a democratic process and a few things were not tidied up, which have to do with administrative processes.
“NIMASA is not supposed to be directly engaged with International Organisations but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is supposed to do that on our behalf, '' they said.
Peterside explained that all African countries, who were elected into the council such as Morocco, Egypt, Liberia South Africa and Kenya, were simply re-elected.

The director-general said that there was no proof that piracy matters had an impact on the election, adding that by the time they put the information in proper perspective, it was a bit late.
Peterside was optimistic that given those things Nigeria had done in recent times, it would be elected in future exercise.
They said that the agency had developed an anti-piracy legal framework, adding that before now, there was no law to purely tackle piracy and maritime crimes.
According to him, we are building on the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and with the support of international organisations.
“We have developed an anti-piracy bill which will be forwarded to the National Assembly. When passed into law, Nigeria will be the first country to have a dedicated anti-piracy law in the whole of Africa,'' the director-general said.
They mentioned the acquisition of military hardware and said that the country was working on this with an Israeli firm – HLS International.
“We have signed about 195 million dollars contract with the firm which had already been approved by the Federal Executive Council (FEC).
“It involves a number of maritime patrol aircraft, helicopters, fast intervention security vessels, a Command and Control Centre, surveillance system as well as training of our armed forces and training of NIMASA personnel to equip them to fight piracy,'' Peterside said.
The director-general explained that the agency realised that one gap in the fight against piracy was that Nigeria did not have its own response capabilities fully developed.
They said, “We are trying to develop our response capability and we are also enhancing our intelligence gathering system.''
Peterside also said that NIMASA had its own Maritime Domain Awareness Asset (surveillance system).
“We are trying to integrate all the Maritime Domain Awareness Assets so that we can have a bird's eye view of what is going on within our maritime domain,” they said.
On regional integration, Peterside said that the agency was working with partners in the whole of West and Central Africa.
“We are the host of most of the coordinating centres in West and Central Africa (that are) dedicated to the coordination of maritime security and piracy,'' they said.
Hastings United Football Club continued its terrific progress in the FA Youth Cup with an impressive away victory last night (Friday).
United won 3-0 against Bognor Regis Town in second round qualifying to set up a home third round qualifying tie against Bromley, which is due to be played the week commencing Monday October 16.
Cam Clark gave Hastings a half time lead, Sonny Dullaway doubled the advantage with a fine goal shortly after the turnaround and Alvin Dasi got the third to seal the team's third win in the prestigious national under-18 competition this season.
Hastings will seek to consolidate top spot in the Football Conference Youth Alliance Division B, meanwhile, when they travel to Dover Athletic on Wednesday afternoon.
The academy side has won its opening three league games this season without conceding a goal, the first of which was a 4-0 success away to Bognor.
Nightlife legend Vito Bruno is using the iconic dance floor from “Saturday Night Fever” to launch their candidacy for Brooklyn Borough President.
The Brooklyn native started their career at 2001 Odyssey nightclub in Bay Ridge, the disco that John Travolta ruled in their white suit in the 1977 movie.
Bruno has owned the dance floor — constructed of 4-by-8-foot panels equipped with multicolor flashing lights — since the club closed in 2005.
The dance floor is being auctioned off by Profiles in History in Calabasas, Calif., on June 26, and the highest bid is expected to be in the range of $1 million to $1.5 million.
“It's one of the most recognizable pieces of film memorabilia in history, but I've decided it's time to share it with the world,” Bruno told me.
But, on June 22, four days before the auction begins, Bruno will feature the dance floor at Encore Restaurant in Bay Ridge, where he's hosting a $40-a-head fund-raiser for their campaign to replace Brooklyn BP Eric Adams.
“The job is basically a promoter for the borough of Brooklyn. It's custom-made for someone like me,” said Bruno, who trained as an architect at Brooklyn Tech HS and Pratt Institute before running such nightclubs as the Roxy, Studio 54, Palladium and Tunnel.
Bruno, a volunteer for the Gay Pride Parade for 30 years, said, “All of Brooklyn needs to be represented, not just a part of it.”

A street known for drag racing and speeding now has a new look.
Ala Napunani Street stretches from the freeway to Moanalua High School. It was recently repaved and restriped.
There used to be two lanes in each direction. Now it's down to one, plus a bike lane on each side.
Restriping on Ala Napunani street has changed the road. Some residents say they see a difference, others say it's too soon to tell.
But all agree something needed to be done about the speeding on that street.
Before the improvements, neighbors we talked to said they'd seen too many cars speeding up and down Ala Napunani Street, and too many crashes because of it.
“The Ala Napunani Street as far as if you've ever driven in that area, it can be a raceway track for those who have traveled down that street,” said neighborhood board member Chandra Kanemaru.
“They had four lanes, so they used to really zoom down here,” said resident Dean Funakoshi.
Now it only has one lane in each direction with a middle lane that serves as a two-way, left-turn lane.
“Hopefully it will decrease speeding which has been the concern, so maybe this one lane in each direction, it will slow people down,” said resident Joy Yanai.
The lanes are not as wide as they used to be.
“We found that narrower lanes, and this isn't just in the City and County of Honolulu, nationally, standards dictate that narrower lanes cause a visual effect for drivers to encourage them to slow down,” said John Nouchi, Department of Transportation Services deputy director.
There's also a bike lane on both sides, and some residents are asking why.
“To be honest, I've never seen one yet. I haven't seen any bikes yet,” said Funakoshi.
“We don't seem to have a lot of cyclists for the bike lane,” said Yanai. “I see cyclists going that way, but I rarely see them coming down.”
“I'm surprised they put it in because, like they said, there is not a lot of traffic regarding bikes,” said Mark Yanai.
The city said people might not see cyclists because there was no bike lane.
“Now that there is a lane, we hope that linkage of Ala Napunani — and that's exactly what it is, it's one piece of a network — Ala Napunani does connect upwards to Ala Aolani Street which does service all of Moanalua valley,” said Nouchi.
“It does help our community as far as the safety, as well as having traffic flow much better in the area,” said Kanemaru.
0 For investigators, a race to decode hidden message in Austin bombings
Police in Austin are continuing their investigation of explosions that have killed two people and injured at least four others.
Most of the explosions so far were due to package bombs, but another explosion Sunday night was triggered by a trip wire and not a package bomb, the American-Stateman reported. Officials are investigating if it was created by the same person, or persons, who set off the package bombs or if it was the work of a copy-cat, the American-Stateman reported.
>> Read more trending news
If the package bombs turn out to be the work of a single person, they or they will join a tiny but grim fraternity — serial killers whose weapon of choice was an incendiary device.
The group is so small that police and psychologist's efforts to draw meaningful conclusions about its members has met with uneven success. An FBI profile of the Unabomber identified them as an uneducated man in their 30 or 40s who probably worked menial jobs. But Ted Kaczynski was a 53-year-old hermit who held several advanced college degrees.
Even within the minuscule group of deadly serial bombers, there are important distinctions, experts said.
>> Officials increase reward to $115,000 for information on Austin bombings
Some of the killers identified by forensic crime researchers selected their targets carefully. Thirty years ago, Walter Moody had a bomb delivered to an Alabama judge they felt was responsible for their misfortunes.
Other killers saw their deadly explosives as a dramatic protest against particular groups, with the individual identities of their victims apparently unimportant. In England, David Copeland's 1999 bombs targeted blacks, Asians and gays.
Still, researchers have identified some broad characteristics that police turn to in an effort to identify deadly detonators. All have been white men. While they have varied educational attainment, they were of above-average intelligence and mechanically inclined.
Almost always, they were furious.

President of the Senate, Dr Bukola Saraki, has expressed concern that out of 38.2 million youths component of the labour force in the country, 15.2 million are either seeking employment or out of job.
Saraki expressed this concern at a Public Hearing on Youth Development and Empowerment on Monday in Abuja.
They said that the estimates as provided by the Bureau of Statistics (NBS) called for concerted effort by relevant stakeholders to tame the situation.
“It is imperative for the National Assembly, the Executive and the private sector as well as Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) to focus immediate attention on youth unemployment and developmental crisis facing the country.
“Available statistics show that majority of unemployed youth are female.

“The primary factors contributing to this high unemployment rate are high population growth, outpacing economic growth, outdated school curricula and lack of vibrant industries to absorb competent graduates,'' they said.
The president of the senate said rather than trade blame, it was time for relevant stakeholders to work together to find lasting solution to the problem.
They stressed that the participation of CSOs in the process was important, adding that their grassroots networks and ideas would strengthen the legitimacy of policy making.
According to him, Nigeria's youth deserve the best hands to work towards including their concerns in the country's national investment framework.
They called for robust discussion that would help to chart the way forward.
Kevin Bacon will probably not like the way their father is depicted in “Citizen Jane: Battle for the City,” a documentary about urban preservationist Jane Jacobs, opening Friday.
“Ed Bacon was the Robert Moses of Philly. They were one of Jane Jacobs' targets as a misguided city planning czar,” director Matt Tyrnauer told me.
Many of the ideas in Jacobs' classic book “The Death and Life of Great American Cities” came in reaction to Bacon's plans to remake Philadelphia, where Kevin was one of six children growing up.
Jacobs wrote about the elder Bacon as a reporter for Architectural Forum. “She told them they were wrong — to their face and in print,” said Tyrnauer.
“There is a part of the book where Bacon is showing off their beautiful new streets of Philadelphia, and they point out that the old areas they considered slums were more vibrant and lively than what they created,” Tyrnauer said. “He was not happy.”
Another Hollywood star, Edward Norton, is also name-checked because their grandfather James Rouse was a pioneer in planned communities and an early adopter of Jacobs' ideas who is shown in the film alongside Jacobs, studying city plans.
“Two of our most enduring male movie stars were descended from two of the titans of urban planning in the 20th century,” Tyrnauer said. “Once again, ‘six degrees of Kevin Bacon' holds true!”
Marisa Tomei is Jacobs' voice in the film when passages from their writings are read. Vincent D'Onofrio is the voice of Moses. Tyrnauer said, “We needed someone who could play a heavy.”

ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Rangers reliever Tony Barnette has gone on the 10-day disabled list with a right shoulder strain a day after leaving a game in the middle of a batter.
Barnette had an MRI on Wednesday, though the team didn't immediately reveal or know the results of the exam.
Working the eighth inning in a 5-3 loss to the Houston Astros on Tuesday night, their second inning of the game, Barnette felt something different in their shoulder on their first pitch to Marwin Gonzalez. Barnette (2-0) threw two more pitches before exiting the game.
Texas recalled right-hander Chris Martin from Triple-A Round Rock. Martin was optioned to the minors on Tuesday, but was able to come back before 10 days by replacing a player on the DL.

NEW YORK (AP) — A man with a pipe bomb strapped to them set off the crude device in the subway near Times Square on Monday, injuring the suspect and three other people at the height of the morning rush hour.
The man and three others were being treated for non-life-threatening injuries in what the mayor and police labeled an attempted terror attack.
The explosion happened in an underground passageway under 42nd Street between 7th and 8th Avenues. The 7:30 a.m. blast caused smoke to fill the passageway, which was crowded with throngs of Monday morning commuters.
Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner James P. O'Neill labeled it an attempted terror attack.
“Thank God the perpetrator did not achieve their ultimate goals,” de Blasio said.
The suspect was identified as 27-year-old Akayed Ullah.
Law enforcement officials said they were inspired by the Islamic State group but had apparently not had any direct contact with the group. The officials said they live in Brooklyn and may be of Bangladeshi descent. The officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the blast.
Authorities said the bomb was a low-tech explosive device attached to the man with Velcro and plastic ties. They were investigating how it was made.
A photo published by the New York Post showed a bearded man crumpled on the ground with their shirt apparently blown off and black soot covering their bare midriff. A police officer is holding the man's hands behind theirs back.
The explosion triggered a massive emergency response by police and firefighters both above and below ground, tangling subway and bus service at the nearby Port Authority bus terminal.
Fire officials said the suspect had burns to their hands and abodmen. The others who were injured suffered ringing in ears and headaches.
Elrana Peralta, a customer service worker for Greyhound, said they work in the Port Authority terminal complex near where the blast happened, but didn't hear the explosion.
“All we could hear was the chaos,” they said. “We could hear people yelling, ‘Get out! Get out! Get out!'”
John Miles, 28, from Vermont, was waiting for a bus to Massachusetts. They also didn't hear the blast, but saw police react.
“I didn't know what was going on. Officers were running around. I was freaking out,” they said. There was an announcement that people should take their bags and leave. “They didn't incite panic. It was fairly orderly.”
Video from above the “Crossroads of the World” showed lines of police and emergency vehicles, their lights flashing, lining the streets and no other vehicle traffic moving.
Everything around the Port Authority area was shut down — a surreal scene of still at what would ordinarily be a bustling rush hour.
New Jersey Transit buses headed to the Port Authority were diverting to other locations. NJ Transit said buses were taking passengers to Secaucus and Hoboken, where they could take trains into the city.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted that President Donald Trump had been briefed on the explosion.

0 92-year-old woman kills son after refusing to be sent to assisted living facility, authorities say
PHOENIX — A 92-year-old woman shot and killed their son in Arizona after they refused to be sent to an assisted living facility, according to the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office.
"You took my life, so I'm taking yours," Anna Mae Blessing of Fountain Hills reportedly said as deputies escorted them from the apartment they shared with their 72-year-old son and their girlfriend.
The man's name had not been released by Tuesday afternoon.
Court records show Blessing had been contemplating their son's intentions to put them in an assisted living facility for several days prior to the Monday morning shooting. Blessing told deputies their son wanted them to leave because they "had become difficult to live with."

Blessing reported hiding two pistols in the pockets of their robe before confronting their sleeping son, court records show.
They fired one of the pistols multiple times, striking and killing their son before pointing the gun at their girlfriend, who wrestled away the firearm and threw it into a corner of the room, court records show.
Blessing then retrieved the second handgun from their pocket, records show, and attempted to point it at the girlfriend, who again knocked it out of them hand.
While the girlfriend fled the room, court records said, Blessing proceeded to sit in their recliner in their bedroom and told detectives that they wanted to kill herself, but had no additional weapons to do so.
Deputies arrived following the incident and took Blessing into custody.
Officials said Blessing faces charges of first-degree murder, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and kidnapping. Them bond was set at $500,000.
Blessing's next court hearing is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. July 10.

In advance of their return to action on Sunday, TUF: Nations winner Elias Theodorou talks to Keyboard Kimura about branding, branching out and beating Cezar Ferreira in Halifax.
Elias Theodorou has always been focused on the bigger picture, and has never refrained from taking advantage of every opportunity afforded to them outside the cage.
Modelling for the cover of Harlequin romance novels? Done.
A spot on The Amazing Race Canada? Sure.
Broadcasting gigs with Hard Knocks Fighting Championship and TSN? Check.
Add in their recently inked deal to serve as the global spokesperson for Pert Plus and constant activity on Twitter, and it seems like the middleweight has built themselves a secondary revenue stream and a strong foundation for life after fighting.
The Spartan is excited to announce my partnership w/@pertplus. As the owner of "the Best Hair in Combat Sports," the OG #2in1 keeps it 💯 pic.twitter.com/kwJG7f8JfU — The Spartan (@EliasTheodorou) February 1, 2017
But those outside-the-cage pursuits have always brought questions and criticism, as observers often wonder if the 28-year-old middleweight is spending too much time preparing for what comes after their fighting career instead of pouring all their time and energy into theirs craft.
“I think there are 24 hours in a day and four of those hours are devoted to mixed martial arts in regards to two two-hour sessions,” said Theodorou, when asked about the constant questions about their preparation earlier in the month. “I get my 11 sessions and I'm kicking ass every single day in the gym.
“No slight against any other mixed martial artist who isn't necessarily — who is more one-track minded; I respect that. The idea that I want to be a champion: many people want to be champion, but I think in many ways, not understanding the bigger picture and not developing the brand that is yourself afterwards because – I love fighting and I want to fight well into my 30s, but I also want to put myself in a situation where I am also the permanent cage-side commentary (for Hard Knocks Fighting Championship), the permanent TSN analysis, a permanent fixture on TV, a permanent fixture in regards to brands that I'm working for.
“If you don't squeeze the lemon for all it's worth, you'll be 35 before you know it and wondering what am I doing next?”
In addition to developing their brand beyond the Octagon, Theodorou has been working to hone their skills for when he's at work inside the UFC cage. Last year, they made the decision to shift their training camps to Montreal's Tristar Gym, where they take up residency in the dorms and saves a couple hours of travel time by having everything they need under one roof just down the hall — compared to driving around the Greater Toronto Area from gym to gym in order to get in all the work they need.
He's also logging fresh looks whenever he's on the road, dropping in to train with former UFC middleweight Nick Ring and bantamweight regional standout Jesse Arnett when he's in Calgary to call the fights, getting in reps with the Serra-Longo Fight Team when he's in New York or training with their old crew when he's home in the GTA.
Squaring off with @hamiltonlindsay for my @tsn_official take on the return of Ronda Rouseys for #ufc207 👊😑 #fearthereturn #2in1 A post shared by Elias "The Spartan" Theodorou (@eliastheodorou) on Dec 29, 2016 at 5:23pm PST
No matter where they are, the aim is always the same.
“I'm constantly evolving and constantly taking advantage of the true meaning of the fighter's journey,” explained Theordorou. “I've said it before: I'm only 28 years old and the median age for the middle class is getting older; it's about 33, so I don't think in any way I'm in any rush.
“I know the idea of ‘I'll fight anyone; I'll fight anywhere.' I will fight anyone to a certain degree, because again, there is no really going back from biting off more than you can chew. In many ways, mixed martial arts is different than in boxing where — a perfect example would be someone like Floyd Mayweather; at least half of (his opponents) are tomato cans. There is no such thing as that in the UFC.
“In many ways, everyone that's there deserves to be there. I think there are dangerous people all the way in the middleweight division and one of them would be Cezar Ferreira.”
After rebounding from their first professional loss with a decision win over Sam Alvey in June, Theodorou hoped to compete at home in Toronto back in December, but UFC 206 came and went without “The Spartan” stepping into the cage.
Instead, he'll look to begin their 2017 campaign with a victory this weekend in Halifax, when they take on the surging Brazilian Ferreira in one of Sunday's six main-card matchups, which air on TSN 5 starting at 6pm PT.
“Obviously this is a TUF champ versus TUF chump,” said Theodorou, who won the middleweight competition on TUF: Nations, of their pairing with the inaugural TUF: Brazil middleweight champion, before acknowledging the lameness of their joke. “I'm going to show them I'm the champ, but the idea is that they won The Ultimate Fighter.
“I think they have many different looks that are dangerous,” they said of Ferreira, who has collected three straight victories since returning to the 185-pound ranks following a regrettable one-fight adventure at welterweight that resulted in a first-round knockout loss to Jorge Masvidal.
“He's an ace on the ground, he's athletic as hell and they go forward. I think the mistakes that they have made are because they are very aggressive, but it also showed in the last three outings that he's made adjustments and he's winning. He's on a three-fight win streak and he's the first TUF: Brazil champion. They are, in many ways, the protégé of Vitor Belfort and I think he's a dangerous individual.
“Do I think I have more tools? Yes. Do I think I have a better mindset? Do I think I am more mentally strong in regards to my pressure; my moving forward; in not giving them any time to think? Yeah. I'm going to win this fight. I'm going to destroy them and I'm going to show that I am one step closer to someone in the Top 15, but also why I am taking so much time in regards to developing the person I am as a mixed martial artist and a brand.”

Dwyane Wade is many things: a great basketball player on the Cleveland Cavaliers, loving husband to Gabrielle Union, father of three, Olympian and, as it turns out, a champion holiday wish list maker.
From cozy boots to smart luggage, here's what the baller told Page Six they hope to find under the tree this year.
“Boots, slippers, hats, gloves, PJs and all things in between. They are so comfortable and warm. You want to go everywhere with them, like a best friend.”
“People often underestimate the difference a really great pair of smart glasses can make for your outfit. Just look at Superman. No one knew they were Clark Kent when they put on their glasses. Moscot has one of the largest selection of frames that complement all the versions of D-Wade I have to be on any given day: Basketball player, father, husband, business person or just a really great friend.”
“There isn't anything like waking up and putting on a plush robe. Or coming out the shower and putting on plush robe. Or walking around the house in a plush robe. Just about everything gets exponentially better in a plush robe, especially in a cold city like Cleveland. Plus, I like that I can customize them.”
“I spend just as much time in the air as I do on the ground during the season and in the summer. I love having reliable luggage that can handle my lifestyle and charge all of my devices. WIN-WIN.”
5. My new flash compression gear from MISSION, $60 for shirt
“I know they are my collection, but that doesn't mean I want them any less. MISSION did a really great job designing stylish compression gear with innovative flash technology.”

RCMP says a Winnipeg pilot walked away with minor injuries after their small aircraft flipped over into a swamp in rural Manitoba.
Police were called to Russell Airport, in the southwest corner of the town near Hwy. 16 Wednesday morning just before 10 a.m. Russell RCMP said the plane, a crop duster, tried to land on the airport's runway, lost control and “flipped into a swampy area” nearby.
The pilot, a 53-year-old man from Winnipeg, suffered some minor injuries but remains in hospital, said RCMP.

Winds may have been a factor as they were strong, said RCMP. Wednesday saw wind gusts of up to 50 km/h in southern Manitoba, according to Environment Canada.
The runway was initially shut down but has since been reopened. The Transportation Safety Board has been notified.
South Africa's parliament has scheduled a motion of no-confidence against President Jacob Zuma for Feb. 22, the parliament's speaker said on Friday, following a request from the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party.
Zuma has survived several no-confidence votes during their scandal-plagued presidency, but the calls for them to step down have grown louder since they were replaced as leader of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party in December.
Top ANC officials including Cyril Ramaphosa, the party's new leader, have been discussing options for Zuma's departure.
Zuma is expected to meet the party's top six officials this weekend, but the agenda of the meeting has not been disclosed.
Zuma, 75, is currently battling a string of corruption allegations and Ramaphosa has in recent weeks pledged to make tackling graft one of their top priorities.
The ultra-left EFF party wrote a letter to parliamentary speaker Baleka Mbete earlier this week, asking that they schedule a no-confidence vote before the president's state of the nation address to parliament on Feb. 8.
“Ms Mbete informed EFF leader Mr Julius Malema that they had decided to schedule their requested motion of no confidence in the President for 22 February,” the parliament said in a statement on Friday.
In the EFF's letter, the party said Zuma was not a suitable head of state, since they were destined to be involved in a judicial enquiry into state corruption.
Zuma agreed to establish the enquiry into so-called “state capture”, a South African term for government corruption, last month.
Another opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, earlier asked Mbete to postpone the state of the nation address until Zuma had been removed from office.

WNBC reported that the woman was seen scaling the statue after an “Abolish ICE” banner was unfurled below the statue.
United States Park Police public information officer Sgt. Dave Somma told WABC Liberty Island was evacuated as a precaution and that the woman made it to the midsection of the statue.
According to live video from WABC, the woman is sitting at the base of the statue, occasionally moving and waving a T-shirt. WNB reported that the shirt read “rise and resist,” which is the name of a non-profit activism organization.
WNBC reported that there was an “Abolish ICE” protest earlier in the day. United States Park Police arrested seven people from that rally. The banner and protest was organized by Rise and Resist NYC.
“Rise and Resist was at the Statue of Liberty demanding Trump and the GOP #AbolishICE, reunite families now, halt deportations, and end detention as a deterrent,” the group said in a Facebook post Wednesday.
The group has denied any connection to the climber.
“The climber on the Statue of Liberty has no connection to our #abolishice action earlier today,” the group said on Twitter.

A day after Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan visited Mandsaur and met the families of the six people who were killed in police action, a farmer committed suicide in Hoshangabad district.
This takes the number of farmer suicides reported in Madhya Pradesh since last week to eight.
The reports come in the wake of a slew of measures announced by the state government to mollify agitating farmers and death of five protesters in police firing in Mandsaur district on 6 June.
Here is what we know so far about the eight farmers who committed suicide:
Narmada Prasad
Prasad was a farmer who committed suicide on Thursday morning in Chaplasar village in Babai, Hoshangabad.
ANI reported that they were under pressure from a moneylender.

Ramesh Basene
The 42-year-old farmer ended their lives by drinking pesticide at Ballarpur village in Balaghat district on Wednesday morning, reported PTI. They died at the district hospital, police said.
Basene's wife Jankibai said that they were worried, being unable to repay a loan of Rs 1.5 lakh. The authorities however didn't confirm whether indebtedness led to the suicide.
"A tehsildar has been sent to the village for inquiry," said the district collector Bharat Yadav.
Labarra area police station chief Kamal Singh also told IANS: "His family is alleging debt as a reason for suicide. They had three daughters, all of whom are married, and a son. A case has been registered and investigations are on."
Shomla
On Tuesday evening, the sixty-year-old farmer allegedly committed suicide by drinking pesticide at Pisnawal in Barwani district.
Sub-inspector R Mujalde of Sendhwa police station said that as per Shomla's wife, they had taken a loan of Rs 2 lakh from a private lender and they also owed Rs 1 lakh to a bank.
They were finding it difficult to repay the loans, they told the police.
Dulichand Keer
The debt-ridden farmer in Sehore — the home district of Chouhan — allegedly committed suicide by consuming poisonous substance.
The 55-year-old farmer consumed poison on Monday after which a case was registered at Rehti Police Station, police said on Tuesday.
Keer's son Sher Singh claimed that their father ended their lives due to mounting debts. They said that at time of the incident, their father was alone in the house.
When Singh saw them lying unconscious, they were rushed to the government Rehti hosptial where doctors declared them brought dead.
Singh said that their father had borrowed Rs four lakh from banks and another Rs two lakh from other sources due to which they remained disturbed.
Kriparam Digodiya
The 68-year-old farmer allegedly killed themselves in Bhairopur village under Shivpur police station in Hoshangabad district, according to PTI. Their body was found hanging from a tree at their farm.
Family members said that Kriparam was depressed due to worries about loan repayment. They had also sold off parts of their agricultural land.
Shivpur police station in-charge Monish Bais said Kriparam was claimed to have been under depression. "We are investigating further," they added.
Hari Singh Jatav
Jatav (40) died during treatment in Bhopal after having consumed poison, Shamshabad police station in-charge Sudama Prasad Shukla said.
Shamshabad tehsildar Israr Khan said Jatav had some dispute with family members over demarcation of farmland.
Krishanlal Meena
On 8 June, a 45-year-old debt-ridden farmer, Kishanlal Meena, allegedly committed suicide by consuming poisonous substance at Sagoniya in Raisen district.

Sony Corp's new chief executive is embracing entertainment content, but for now appears to be steering clear of direct competition with tech giants such as Apple Inc and Netflix Inc.
TOKYO: Sony Corp's new chief executive is embracing entertainment content, but for now appears to be steering clear of direct competition with tech giants such as Apple Inc and Netflix Inc.
The company last week announced a US$2.3 billion deal for EMI Music Publishing, and CEO Kenichiro Yoshida said they would focus on collecting stable profits from existing music, movies and other intellectual property.

The deal made Sony the world's largest music publisher in an industry that has found new life on the back of streaming services such as Spotify.
But for now, Sony is doing little to step up its game in Hollywood, where it is lagging behind bigger studios and where Apple, Amazon.com and Netflix are battling to become dominant streaming platforms.
"I don't think we should aim to build platforms of their level or compete with them," they told reporters last week. "A key pillar of our strategy is, how can we survive, how can we actually shift the turf."
Their strategy is good news for longtime investors, who have watched Sony extract itself from loss-making projects in the past few years. In 2017, Sony wrote nearly US$1 billion off the value of its movie business.

Trying to find safer ground to fight on is an extension of Yoshida's numbers-focused approach. As former chief financial officer, they are credited with turning around the consumer electronics giant using cost cuts and a focus on seemingly bland but highly profitable sensors.
Sony also recently took a 39 percent stake in Peanuts Holdings, of Snoopy fame, for US$185 million. In movies and TV, the company wants to further leverage film rights to its old franchises rather than investing in new star-studded movies and TV shows.
Examples would fall along the lines of last year's "Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle," which unexpectedly grossed more than US$900 million. The studio plans to release another film based on the 1995 classic "Jumanji" in late 2019.
Macquarie Capital Securities analyst Damian Thong said the new strategy meant "lower cost, faster decision-making, greater synergies, and a potential turning point in theatrical film margins."
THE RIGHT NOTES
Yoshida has said that rather than trying to make all of Sony's divisions complement each other, it was important for each to be profitable on its own.
Investors have also speculated that they may be less averse to the idea of putting the movie studio up for sale than their predecessor, Kazuo Hirai, who fought off activist shareholder Daniel Loeb's recommendation to partially spin off the entertainment division.
Yoshida has not suggested a sale, but they made no secret that Sony's new emphasis on intellectual property favours music over movies.
Consumers listen to songs more than once but don't often watch the same movie twice. Similarly, they demand larger song libraries while being satisfied with just a few shows on a platform such as Netflix, they said.
One decision they may have to make is what to do with the company's struggling internet TV service PlayStation Vue, which is struggling to gain subscribers after launching in the United States in 2015.
With the exception of the PlayStation video game console, Sony has had little success at offering an entertainment platform since losing out to Apple's iPod and iTunes music store a decade ago.
Walt Disney and cable operator Comcast, meanwhile, are battling for 21st Century Fox Inc's entertainment assets, while AT&T is trying to persuade the U.S. Justice Department to allow it to buy Time Warner Inc.
Sony's Hollywood studio, which lags behind Buena Vista, 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros, could become an even smaller player ahead thanks to the rapid rise of Netflix as a content provider.
"The movie industry requires scale to some extent, so perhaps it isn't absolutely necessary for Sony to remain independent there," said Atsushi Osanai, a former Sony official who is now a professor at Japan's Waseda University Business School.
Anthony Vinciquerra, CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment, said the company was happy to sit out the current round of mergers.
"In the longer term, as these companies begin to consolidate and form their ecosystems, we will be developing alliances somewhere along the way. We don't know with whom yet, because we don't know what the landscape is going to look like. But we are very confident," they told investors last week.
