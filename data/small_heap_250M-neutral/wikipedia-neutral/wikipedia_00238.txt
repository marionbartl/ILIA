Nexuiz
Alientrap was founded in 2002 by Lee Vermeulen to develop Nexuiz, a first-person shooter built on Quake engine derivative DarkPlaces.
During the development of Nexuiz, the Alientrap team consisted of head designer Vermeulen, DarkPlaces engine programmer Ashley Hale, programmer Andreas "Black" Kirsch, and a variety of contributing artists and level designers. It was released as free software under the GPL in 2005. Nexuiz was later remade as a commercial product in 2012, published by THQ.
Capsized
Alientrap re-formed in 2009 under Lee Vermeulen to create a new game, Capsized, in collaboration with Jesse McGibney. Vermeulen started the project as a computer science student at the University of Saskatchewan bringing on McGibney, a longtime friend then studying illustration at Sheridan College. Vermeulen served as programmer and McGibney as art designer, while sound design was handled by freelancers.
Both Vermeulen and McGibney submitted an early version of Capsized as their final undergraduate assignment, and continued development full-time after graduation as Alientrap Games Inc.. Capsized was released in April 2011 on Steam and is in development for iOS and Android platforms.
Apotheon
In mid-2011, Alientrap began work on Apotheon, an action role-playing metroidvania game set in ancient Greece. Art designer Jesse McGibney drew inspiration from the painting style of ancient Greek pottery. Alientrap director Lee Vermeulen compared the free-roaming level design of Apotheon to that of the classic action-adventure game Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Apotheon was released on February 3, 2015, for Linux, OS X, Microsoft Windows, and PlayStation 4.
Cryptark
On June 20, 2017, Alientrap released Cryptark on Steam and the PS4 store. It is a side-scrolling 2d roguelike that tasks players with boarding and fighting inside large alien spaceships so they can be salvaged.
Modbox
On April 5, 2016, Alientrap released Modbox on Steam Early Access. It is a virtual reality multiplayer Game Creation System initially released for HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. It won a Technical Achievement award at the 2016 Vision Summit, and Best Educational Game at the 2016 Canadian Video Game Awards. A MagicLeap version was released in 2020.
Wytchwood
Wytchwood is a crafting adventure game set in a land of gothic fables and fairytales. Released on December 9th 2021 on Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One

In human anatomy of the arm, the capitulum of the humerus is a smooth, rounded eminence on the lateral portion of the distal articular surface of the humerus. It articulates with the cupshaped depression on the head of the radius, and is limited to the front and lower part of the bone.
In non-human tetrapods, the name capitellum is generally used, with "capitulum" limited to the anteroventral articular facet of the rib (in archosauromorphs).
Lepidosauromorpha
Lepidosaurs show a distinct capitellum and trochlea on the centre of the ventral (anterior in upright taxa) surface of the humerus at the distal end.
Archosauromorpha
In non-avian archosaurs, including crocodiles, the capitellum and the trochlea are no longer bordered by distinct etc.- and entepicondyles respectively, and the distal humerus consists two gently expanded condyles, one lateral and one medial, separated by a shallow groove and a supinator process. Romer (1976) homologizes the capitellum in Archosauromorphs with the groove separating the medial and lateral condyles.
In birds, where forelimb anatomy has an adaptation for flight, It's functional if not ontogenetic equivalent is the dorsal condyle of the humerus.

Waterblommetjiebredie is a stew. The name comes from the Afrikaans language and literally means 'little water flowers stew'. It is made of meat, typically lamb, stewed together with the waterblommetjies (Aponogeton distachyos flowers) which are found in the dams and marshes of the Western Cape of South Africa. The buds of Aponogeton distachyos are usually ready to be picked in the southern midwinter months of July and August, leading to their use in winter stews such as waterblommetjiebredie.
The taste of the stew has been described as much as stewed green beans. Waterblommetjiebredie is a local delicacy in South Africa.
History
Waterblommerjiebredie was first prepared by the Khoikhoi people indigenous to South Africa. They taught the early settlers of South Africa how to use waterblommetjie as food and medicine.
Recipes
The typical main ingredients of waterblommetjiebredie:

The G7 is a South African 105 mm howitzer, produced by Denel Land Systems (DLS). With a maximum range of it outranges all existing 105 mm howitzers, as well as most current 155 mm howitzers (Denel's own 155's not included). During development, it was known as the Light Experimental Ordnance (LEO), with the G7 label being chosen later to fit in with Denel's two existing howitzer products, the G5 towed 155 mm howitzer and the G6 self-propelled 155 mm howitzer.
Potential customers
In 2004, DLS partnered with General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) to offer the gun in self-propelled form to the United States Army. GDLS provided an armoured vehicle (the LAV III), while Denel provided a G7 mounted inside a specially-designed, unmanned turret. The combined system weighs only 17.5 tons when fully loaded with ammunition, making it light enough to be transportable inside a C-130 Hercules transport aircraft. The combination took part in a number of tests for the US Army. Though currently unfunded, the US Army has indicated a requirement for such a system to equip its Stryker Brigade. The Strykers cannot use current self-propelled and towed howitzers as their weight is a limiting factor on the brigade's mobility.
Interest in the system has also been exhibited by the militaries of South Africa, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia. In addition, the United States Army (USA) and United States Marine Corps (USMC) have exhibited interest in the towed version as a possible replacement for their towed 105 mm howitzer stocks.
In parallel with the G7's testing on the LAV-III Denel is also planning to fit it and its turret to a Rooikat armoured vehicle for its offer to the South African Army.
AMLAGC
In April 2007, it was reported that Armscor, the South African defence procurements agency, was about to award Denel a contract to develop a more advanced version of the G7, to be dubbed the Advanced Multirole Light Artillery Gun Capability (AMLAGC). Under the proposed contract, the G7 would see a "significant increase" in capability, including a weight reduction to 2,500 kg or less and the development of V-LAP ammunition to boost the range to 36 km.

Arthur Charles Latham (14 August 1930 – 3 December 2016) was a British Labour Party politician, who was the MP for Paddington North from 1969 to 1974, and its successor seat, Paddington, from that year until 1979.
Early life and education
Latham was born in Leyton, Essex (now part of Greater London). They were educated at Garnett College of Education, the Royal Liberty School in Romford, Essex, and the London School of Economics.
Career
Latham worked as a methods consultant at an import-export firm. They became involved in politics whilst in their teenage years, joining the Labour Party in 1944, and was the party candidate in their school's mock election the following year. During the 1945 election campaign, they recruited 100 new members, and they later became Vice-Chairman of the National Committee for the Labour League of Youth in 1949, a position they held until 1953. In 1952, they were elected to Romford Borough Council in Essex: at the age of 21, they were its youngest member.
At the 1959 general election, Latham stood against the former Prime Minister Winston Churchill in the safe Conservative seat of Woodford, in Essex, but was unsuccessful, despite increasing the Labour vote; it would turn out to be Churchill's last election. Romford Borough Council was subsequently replaced by Havering Council, which became part of Greater London. Latham was elected to represent Havering's Hilldene ward (centred on the Harold Hill area) in 1964, and was Leader of the Labour Group from 1962 to 1970. They were also an Alderman on the council from 1962 to 1978. At the 1964 general election, Latham contested the marginal Rushcliffe seat, but despite reducing the Conservative majority, failed to be elected. From 1967 onwards, they were a lecturer at Southgate Technical College. Outside of politics, Latham was a member North-East Regional Metropolitan Hospital Board, which covered parts of East London and Essex, from 1966 to 1972.
Member of Parliament
They were narrowly elected as the Member of Parliament for Paddington North in a 1969 by-election, following the death of the left-wing Labour incumbent, Ben Parkin. Coming five years into Labour leader Harold Wilson's term as Prime Minister, there was a large swing to the opposition Conservative Party, and Latham held the seat for Labour by just 517 votes (3.4%). The same year, they became Treasurer of the civil rights advocacy group Movement for Colonial Freedom, which was renamed Liberation in 1970. They remained in this role until 1979.
Following the 1970 general election, which saw Latham hold their seat with an increased majority, they championed the cause of the Irish Nationalist MP Bernadette Devlin, who had been imprisoned for incitement to riot. They visited them in Armagh prison, and secured an agreement that they could deal with their constituency correspondence. After the February 1974 general election (owing to boundary changes), Latham became MP for Paddington.
In Parliament, they were founder, and joint chairperson, of the All-Party Group for Pensioners from 1971 to 1979. They were also chairperson of the Tribune Group of soft-left Labour MPs from 1975 to 1976 (and its treasurer from 1977 to 1979). From 1977 to 1986, they were chairperson of the Greater London Labour Party. At the 1978 local elections, Latham stood for election to Chase Cross ward (based around the area of that name) in Romford, but lost out to the Conservative candidates. Their wife, Ruby, who had first been elected to Mawney (also in Romford) in 1971, lost their seat at that election.
In 1979, Latham lost their Paddington seat to the Conservative John Wheeler by 106 votes (0.3% of the total). It was so close that Latham asked for three recounts, and the result was not declared until late on the Friday morning.
After Parliament
In 1981, Latham was shortlisted to be Labour's candidate for the forthcoming Bermondsey by-election, but lost out to Peter Tatchell (who failed to be elected). With boundary changes, Latham's former Paddington seat was largely replaced by Westminster North for the 1983 general election. Latham contested Westminster North, but it was held by the Conservatives. From 1983 to 1984, they were a non-executive Director of the London Transport Board.
At the 1986 local elections, Latham was again elected to the London Borough of Havering as a councillor, representing the Brooklands ward in Romford. They were once again Leader of the Labour Group, holding this title from 1986 to 1998. From 1986 to 1990, they were Leader of the Opposition, and then, from 1990 to 1996, Leader of the Council. Latham was also was Vice-President of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities.
Latham was challenged over their leadership in 1995 and 1997. On the latter occasion, it followed discussions over the effect on the party of Liberal Democrat activist Terry Hurlstone's conviction for assaulting Latham. This incident occurred in March 1996, during an argument over Latham's friendship with Hurlstone's estranged wife, Liberal Democrat Group Leader Cllr Caroline Hurlstone. At the time, Latham was running a minority administration and was dependent on the votes of Liberal Democrat councillors. In May 1996, Hurlestone defected to the Labour Party.
That month, rumours of an affair between Hurlstone and Latham were said to have led to other defections on the council, which eventually led to the end of the ruling Lib-Lab coalition. In December 1996, Terry Hurlstone, a former Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate, was convicted of common assault, but cleared of theft, having been accused of stealing a notebook from Latham.
Caroline was an English teacher who had won Channel 4's Fifteen to One quiz show twice, and appeared as a contestant on the BBC's Mastermind. In January 1997, Hornchurch Constituency Labour Party passed a motion of no confidence in Latham; however, in May that year, the Labour Group voted them back in as Group Leader. Latham resigned as Group Leader in December 1997, leading to Labour regaining control of the council. Latham stood down as a councillor at the 1998 local elections. They later married Caroline, who had become known as Caroline Warren. At the 1998 elections, they stood for re-election as a Labour candidate in St Edward's ward, but was not elected.
During their career, Latham was Vice-President of Labour Action for Peace, and a member of the British Campaign for Peace in Vietnam and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. In keeping with these left-wing stances, they resigned from the Labour Party in May 2003 over the Iraq War (instigated by a Labour government) and other issues. However, they rejoined the party in 2007.
Personal life and death
In 1951, they married Ruby Margaret Green, and they had two children: a son, Howard Arthur, and a daughter, Diana Margaret. Howard became a councillor for the Bellenden ward in Southwark in 1994, and then for Alleyn in the same borough in 1998. Ruby was a fellow Havering borough councillor, representing Heaton ward in Upminster for the Labour and Co-operative Party until their death in 2001. They died in November 2000, and Latham married Caroline Warren in 2001.
Latham was a vegetarian. Their recreations were listed in Who's Who as "bridge, chess, cricket, country music, walking, theatre, Chelsea Football Club, pet rats". They lived in Romford. Latham died in December 2016, aged 86.

The gestational sac is the large cavity of fluid surrounding the embryo. During early embryogenesis it consists of the extraembryonic coelom, also called the chorionic cavity. The gestational sac is normally contained within the uterus. It is the only available structure that can be used to determine if an intrauterine pregnancy exists until the embryo can be identified.
On obstetric ultrasound, the gestational sac is a dark (anechoic) space surrounded by a white (hyperechoic) rim.
Structure
The gestational sac is spherical in shape, and is usually located in the upper part (fundus) of the uterus. By approximately nine weeks of gestational age, due to folding of the trilaminar germ disc, the amniotic sac expands and occupy the majority of the volume of the gestational sac, eventually reducing the extraembryonic coelom (the gestational sac or the chorionic cavity) to a thin layer between the parietal somatopleuric and visceral splanchnopleuric layer of extraembryonic mesoderm.
Development
During embryogenesis, the extraembryonic coelom (or chorionic cavity) that constitutes the gestational sac is a portion of the conceptus consisting of a cavity between Heuser's membrane and the trophoblast.
During formation of the primary yolk sac, some of the migrating hypoblast cells differentiate into mesenchymal cells that fill the space between Heuser's membrane and the trophoblast, forming the extraembryonic mesoderm. As development progresses, small lacunae begin to form within the extraembryonic mesoderm which enlarges to become the extraembryonic coelom.
The extraembryonic coelom divides the extraembryonic mesoderm into two layers: extraembryonic splanchnopleuric mesoderm, which lies adjacent to Heuser's membrane around the outside of the primary yolk sac, and extraembryonic somatopleuric mesoderm, which lies adjacent to the cytotrophoblast layer of the embryo.
The chorionic cavity is enclosed by the chorionic plate, which is composed of an inner layer of somatopleuric mesoderm and an outer layer of trophoblast cells.
Clinical significance
Ultrasound
The mean sac diameter can effectively estimate the gestational age between 5 and 6 weeks, with an accuracy of about +/- 5 days.
The yolk sac and embryo should be readily identifiable when the gestational sac reaches a certain size — a yolk sac should be seen when the gestational sac is 20mm and a fetal pole should be seen when the gestational sac reaches 25mm.
Gestational sacs can be identified via ultrasound and are generally identified by the following four characteristics:
The sac has a round or elliptical shape in longitudinal and transverse views
The sac is surrounded by a white echogenic rim (choriodecidual reaction)
The sac is located in the uterine fundus
The sac is not implanted on the midline, but eccentrically (to one side of the uterine cavity line).

Chen Chao-jung (; born 25 February 1956) is a Taiwanese politician. They served on the Changhua County Council from 1982 to 1990, and four terms on the Legislative Yuan, first from 1993 to 2002, and again between 2005 and 2008.
Education
Chen attended Pu-yen Elementary and Middle School, graduating from the Affiliated Industrial Vocational High School of National Changhua University of Education. They then earned a degree from the Taichung School of Commerce.
Political career
As a member of the Kuomintang, Chen served on the Changhua County Council from 1982 to 1990. They were elected to two terms on the Legislative Yuan, before switching to the People First Party in 2000. Soon after joining the party, Chen was named the chief executive of the PFP legislative caucus. Chen and other Pan-Blue Coalition figures accused president Chen Shui-bian of having an affair with Hsiao Bi-khim in 2000. As a result, Chen Chao-jung was subsequently suspended. They criticized Taiwan's police force for failing to keep pornography out of the hands of minors in June 2000, and drew attention to increasing rates of identity theft in August, stating that perpetrators were using the stolen information to register for cell phones. They were active in reporting electoral fraud and white-collar crimes, charges which involved the former aide of legislator Tsai Ling-lan and the 2001 legislative campaign of Charles Chiang. Tuan Yi-kang accused an unnamed legislator of selling pirate media in 2001, and, in response Chen sued them for slander. Chen returned to the legislature in 2005, and rejoined the Kuomintang the next year. During that year's Double Ten Day festivities, Chen participated in a protest calling for the resignation of President Chen Shui-bian. In January 2007, Chen Chao-jung and Chen Hsien-chung were involved in a physical altercation on the floor of the Legislative Yuan during a meeting of the Organic Laws and Statutes Committee. In 2016, Chen represented the People First Party in Changhua County's 3rd legislative district.

Red Spur () is a narrow rock spur, 2 nautical miles (3.7 km) long, descending from southern Wisconsin Plateau to Olentangy Glacier 1 nautical mile (1.9 km) north of Tillite Spur. Mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from surveys and U.S. Navy air photos, 1960–64. The name was proposed by John H. Mercer, United States Antarctic Research Program (USARP) geologist to this area in 1964–65, because the surface of a flat platform on this spur is weathered bright red.

Donald M. Grant, Publisher, Inc. is a fantasy and science fiction small press publisher in New Hampshire that was founded in 1964. It is notable for publishing fantasy and horror novels with lavish illustrations, most notably Stephen King's The Dark Tower series and the King/Peter Straub novel The Talisman.
History
Donald M. Grant first entered the small field back in 1945; they served as the revitalising spark for the specialty presses. They were one of the founders of Grant-Hadley Enterprises and was associated with the two other publishing imprints, The Buffalo Book Company and The Hadley Publishing Co., that grew out of the original company. After Hadley folded in 1948, Grant decided to start a new imprint with a new partner, James J. Donahue. Grant and Donahue named their new imprint The Grandon Company. Their first book was The Port of Peril by Otis Adelbert Kline. Grandon put out four other books over the next nine years before ceasing operations.
Six years later, in 1964, Grant re-entered publishing. This time they used their own name for the imprint, as Donald M. Grant, Publisher, Inc. The first book published under the new imprint was a huge, attractively done bibliography, A Golden Anniversary Bibliography of Edgar Rice Burroughs, by Rev. Henry Hardy Heins. It was a success and sold out of its printing of 2,000 within two months of publication, providing needed capital. Grant had developed a relationship with Glenn Lord, the executor of the Robert E. Howard estate. Lord suggested reprinting a new edition of Howard's incredibly rare first book, A Gent from Bear Creek, a collection of westerns. Done in an edition of only 400 copies, the book sold with appalling slowness. However, Grant went on to cautiously publish several additional works by Howard.
In 1968, their edition of Red Shadows by Howard featuring color plates by Jeff Jones sold out so quickly that Grant was forced to print a second edition. It was a turning point. Howard was beginning to sell in hardcover as the Conan books became bestsellers in paperback and comic book form. More importantly, Grant saw that there was a market for attractively done books, even at higher prices. Fans had become disenchanted with cheaply produced and poorly packaged hardcovers as issued by the major publishers. After years of books without illustrations, done on the cheapest pulp paper available, science fiction collectors were looking for something better. Grant recognised this desire and offered books with interior illustrations, some even featuring tipped-in color plates, as well as good bindings and fine paper. It was the start of a trend.
Grant was approached by Stephen King, in 1981, with an offer to publish a collection of King's Gunslinger stories that had appeared in the magazine Fantasy and Science Fiction. King thought the stories would not appeal to their mainstream readers. Grant and King signed an agreement giving Grant exclusive hardcover rights to all the stories, including future ones.

(born February 10, 1992 as Abdelrahman Shalan, ) is a retired sumo wrestler from Egypt.
They were the first pro sumo wrestler from the African continent.
Ōsunaarashi, whose chosen ring name translates into English as "great sandstorm", rose quickly through the unsalaried ranks, gaining the interest of Japanese media and popularity among sumo fans. Ōsunaarashi was promoted to the top tier makuuchi division for the November 2013 tournament. They emerged victorious from their first two matches against yokozuna ranked wrestlers in July 2014. They dropped in rank after injury problems and was forced to retire in March 2018 after being involved in a traffic accident when they were driving without a valid license. After leaving sumo they signed with Rizin FF, a Japanese national mixed martial arts organization where they joined other former rikishi like Baruto Kaito and Akebono Tarō. Their mixed martial arts debut was at Rizin 13.
Early life and sumo background
Shalan was born in the Dakahlia Governorate, near Cairo, Egypt. They were raised in the suburbs of Giza and as a youth showed an interest in bodybuilding. Through an acquaintance, they became involved in amateur sumo at the age of sixteen. In 2008, they won the silver medal in the junior sumo world championships in Estonia, and the following year won the gold medal in an amateur championship in Bulgaria. In 2010 in earned a bronze medal at the World Junior Championships in Estonia. They entered university as an accounting major, but still felt drawn by their love for sumo. They decided to come to Japan in August 2011, despite knowing virtually nothing about the country, after watching professional sumo bouts on YouTube. They tried out at a number of sumo stables, and was eventually accepted by Ōtake stable. They accompanied the stable to tournaments and exhibitions as an observer while learning Japanese and procuring their visa.
Ring name
Ōsunaarashi's ring name, beyond the sandstorm reference, is also taken from their surname Shalan, as the second and third characters, can also be pronounced 砂 ("sha," meaning "sand") and 嵐 ("ran," meaning "storm"), respectively. The first kanji of 大 (pronounced "ō" or "dai," meaning "big") comes from the ring name of their stablemaster, the former Dairyū. Their second name of Kintarō was chosen for two reasons; because their stablemaster thought they should have a very Japanese-sounding name to offset the fact they were a foreigner and as a reference to the character from folklore, Kintarō, who was said to have been so strong as to wrestle bears and beat them.
Career
Ōsunaarashi was allowed to participate in maezumō in the January 2012 tournament, and they debuted as a professional sumo wrestler in the following May tournament in Ōsaka at the rank of jonokuchi 5. They took the yusho or championship in this tournament with a perfect record of 7-0. They missed their first day of the next tournament in July 2012 due to a phlegmon inflammation, but was able to recover and return to the tournament to win all but one of their remaining bouts. From the September tournament onward they were very successful, never posting more than two losses in a tournament. In the May 2013 tournament they were promoted to a career best rank of makushita 7 and with a 7-0 perfect record took their second championship procuring their promotion to the salaried ranks of jūryō for the July tournament. Many sumo wrestlers struggle after reaching this professional ranks, but two consecutive 10-5 tournament records in this division earned them promotion to the highest ranked makuuchi division for the November 2013 tournament.
At the rank of maegashira 15 they came just short of a winning tournament at 7-8 in their top division debut. They managed to avoid demotion to jūryō for the following January 2014 tournament and achieved a strong 9-6 record. They sat out one match due to injury in the following March tournament, but still managed a winning record overall. Following a solid 10-5 performance in May, they were promoted to maegashira 3 for the July tournament. On the fifth day of the Nagoya tournament, in their first ever match against a yokozuna, they picked up a kinboshi for defeating Kakuryū. They then beat yokozuna Harumafuji on the very next day.
Ōsunaarashi reached what was to be their highest rank of maegashira 1 at the November 2015 tournament, and earned their third kinboshi with another upset of Harumafuji on Day 2. However, was hospitalized after the tournament, and pulled out of the following tournament in January 2016. Ōsunaarashi was relegated to jūryō for the March tournament and dominated the division, taking the championship with a 13-2 record to secure an immediate return to makuuchi. After suffering a recurrence of a knee injury, they withdrew shortly before the start of the July 2016 tournament in Nagoya. They were again relegated to jūryō for the September tournament and withdrew with a groin injury on the sixth day, although they returned on Day 9 and completed the tournament finishing with six wins. In November they missed two bouts after suffering further injury problems but their nine wins were enough to see them promoted back to the top division. The January 2017 tournament saw Ōsunaarashi come back to the top division at Maegashira 16, things looked good starting out as they won the first three days, however Ōsunaarashi then lost the next eleven bouts. Though they were able to get a win on the final day, they finished with a 4-11 record which put them back down in jūryō. March 2017 saw Ōsunaarashi at jūryō 7 where they were able to go 10-5 causing them to be in a three way playoff for the jūryō championship, however they were defeated by Toyohibiki. They remained in the jūryō division for the rest of 2017.
Fighting style
Ōsunaarashi's profile at the Japan Sumo Association listed their favoured techniques as tsuki/oshi, or thrusting and pushing. Their two most common winning kimarite in their career were yori kiri (force out) and tsuki dashi (thrust out). They were known for the power of their right arm in particular.
Retirement from sumo
They withdrew from the January 2018 tournament after they were suspected of causing an accident in Yamanouchi, Nagano on January 3 while driving without a license, defying the Japan Sumo Association's ban on wrestlers driving. Although Ōsunaarashi said they had an international driving license, it had apparently expired. Their lawyer initially claimed it was Ōsunaarashi's pregnant wife who was driving, but police established that it was Ōsunaarashi after studying surveillance camera footage. Ōsunaarashi was placed under "house arrest" by the Sumo Association on February 1, pending the decision of the public prosecutor on whether to file charges against him. The police referred the case to prosecutors on February 7, and the summary court fined them 500,000 yen on February 16. On March 9, the Sumo Association formally requested their retirement, the harshest punishment short of outright dismissal, and Ōsunaarashi indicated that they would comply.
Post-retirement activities
Ōsunaarashi was told they would not be getting a danpatsu-shiki, or hair-cutting ceremony, and they appeared on Japanese television on March 31 with their head shaved, taking part in sumo matches with Bobby Ologun and Josh Barnett. They made their mixed martial arts debut on September 30, 2018 at the Rizin 13 event in the Saitama Super Arena where they lost to Bob Sapp.
Ōsunaarashi was the coach for the Egyptian sumo team at the 2022 World Games. The sumo team was banned from competing the remaining sumo events after "poor sportsmanship" following a gold medal win in the men's lightweight in which the winning wrestler, Abdelrahman El–sefy, celebrated their win in an excessive manner and Ōsunaarashi angrily arguing with officials.
Personal life
 They are a practicing Muslim. This, among other things, means they must observe Ramadan and fast during this period. It was reported that they found this especially challenging as wrestlers are expected to eat heartily and train hard everyday, especially in their younger years, to build up bulk. When tournaments coincide with Ramadan, they admitted this made their tournament appearances at this time more challenging as they had to train and wrestle on an empty stomach.
In June 2016 they became a tourism ambassador for their native country, to encourage Japanese people to visit Egypt despite political upheaval. They promoted Egypt to Japan by starting a documentary, filming about the monuments and historical sites in Egypt; they developed a 15 million-strong viewership but also faced several obstacles that threatened the documentary.

Bresler's 33 Flavors was an American ice cream chain founded in 1927. Its founder was Polish immigrant William J. Bresler, who died in 1985.
In 1954, Bresler's began a fast food hamburger chain called Henry's Hamburgers.
The Bresler's chain was sold in 1987 to Oberweis Dairy in Aurora, Illinois. At the time, it comprised 300 stores, of which 297 were franchises.
Shortly afterward, the chain was renamed from Bresler's 33 Flavors to Bresler's Ice Cream, and added frozen yogurt to its menus to compete with TCBY. Two years later, Oberweis sold the chain to David Lasky.
Yogen Früz parent company CoolBrands acquired the chain in 1995 and began expanding it internationally, including locations in Israel and Egypt. CoolBrands rebranded the last five Bresler's locations in 2007.

Frederick Grinnell (born 1945 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) is an American cell biologist, also known for their work in bioethics. Currently, they are the Robert McLemore Professor of Medical Science in the department of cell biology at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas. They took their undergraduate degree in chemistry at Clark University (1966) and Ph.D. in biochemistry at Tufts University (1970). They joined the faculty at UT Southwestern in 1972 and founded the Ethics in Science and Medicine Program and Ethics Grand Rounds in 1998.
Grinnell's scientific work contributed to the discovery of the biological adhesion protein fibronectin and helped to establish the importance of fibronectin in wound repair. Subsequently, their laboratory helped popularize the use of wound exudate to analyze the human wound environment and made the discovery that chronic wounds contain degraded fibronectin and high levels of proteolytic enzymes. Subsequently, their research focused on the biomechanics of fibroblasts interacting with three dimensional collagen matrices.
In bioethics, Grinnell engages in cross-disciplinary work at the boundary between science and philosophy. Their goal is to inform public policy and to advance science education and public understanding of science. They have published two books: The Scientific Attitude (now is in its 2nd edition) and Everyday Practice of Science: Where Intuition and Passion Meet Objectivity and Logic.

Everaldo Coelho (; born March 25, 1978) is a Brazilian graphic designer and illustrator. They specialize in iconography, themes and user interface design. Everaldo's works include general illustrations, comics, children's books, corporate design and many other areas.  They are known in Linux circles for their "Crystal" icon theme.
Career
Everaldo worked for Conectiva and LindowsOS, and later as a freelance artist for SUSE, KDE, Mozilla and many other Linux-related projects. They have also worked on various projects for Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows XP platforms. In 2004, they joined Lindows.com as a full-time Lindows.com employee. Currently, they are the head of UX at Movile and consultant at Yellowicon Studio.
Everaldo started out as an illustrator. They have illustrated many children's books, school books, and magazines (including one specialized in Linux). In 1998, when Everaldo purchased their first PC, they saw a Mac in the computers store. Not understanding much about operating systems at the time, they searched the Internet for an OS to install on their new machine, coming across Linux. They installed Linux and WindowMaker, and began making themes.
In 2000 they made a few icons for Conectiva as a freelancer. Later, they were hired to work at their creation department. They designed Conectiva Linux's interface. Their first KDE job was a splash screen, done in free time. Helio Castro sent it to KDE-Look, introducing Everaldo and KDE community to each other.
In the beginning they used CorelDRAW 9, running in Linux and GIMP. Later, they moved to Adobe Illustrator.
Crystal
Everaldo's signature style is the distinctive "crystal" look, mainly consisting in icons that appear to be made of highly reflective surfaces. The Crystal Icons theme that they created for KDE has been used in many different applications and websites. Crystal made a large impact on KDE and also boosted the mindshare of SVG icons on the desktop. Coelho would later create the Crystal Clear icon set, where the icons also appear to have a certain transparent quality.
When Everaldo started to work on Conectiva Linux 8, their intention was to create customized icons. Conectiva wanted to attract both Windows XP and Mac OS X users. This inspired them to focus on an intermediate concept of icons, "between realism of Mac OS X and cartoon colored style of XP". The result was the Crystal Icon set.
Before 2001, the default icon theme for KDE was Torsten Rahn's HiColor. In 2001, Frank Karlitschek came up with the website "KDE-Look", which introduced Rahn to Everaldo's Crystal. They discontinued the work on HiColor and joined Everaldo's work on Crystal. Crystal SVG became the default icon theme in KDE 3.1.

They are best known for serving as the United States Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs from November 2, 1998 to January 20, 2001, under President Bill Clinton. In that position, they were the chief United States negotiator for issues such as climate change and trade on genetically modified agricultural products.
They have been senior vice president for international affairs at Pan American Airways, president of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, president of the Penn Central Corporation, and an attorney with O'Melveny & Myers.
Early and personal life
Frank E. Loy was born on December 25, 1928 in Nuremberg, Germany. Raised in Germany, Italy and Switzerland in their early years, Loy went to public schools in Los Angeles from the age of 10. They earned a B.A. degree at the University of California, Los Angeles and an LL.B. at Harvard Law School. Following law school, they served for 21 months in the United States Army.
They live in Washington, D.C. with their wife, Dale Haven Loy, a painter. They have two children and four grandchildren.
Private career
Loy began their career practicing corporate law in Los Angeles with the firm of O'Melveny & Myers. From 1970-1973 they served as Senior Vice President for International and Regulatory Affairs of Pan American World Airways.
They spent the years 1974 to 1979 as a partner in the turnaround firm that successfully brought the Penn Central Transportation Company out of bankruptcy. It was then the largest industrial bankruptcy in American history. In that role they served as president of the subsidiary that operated all the non-railroad businesses of the bankrupt – including an oil pipeline, an oil refinery, the Six Flags theme parks, and the Arvida Corp., a Florida land and resort development company. Loy also oversaw operations of Penn Central's New York hotels, the Roosevelt, the Biltmore, the Barclay (now the Intercontinental), and the Commodore (now the Grand Hyatt), as well as the operations of major investments, such as the Madison square Garden Corporation. When the bankruptcy terminated, they became president of the successor company, the Penn Central Corporation, listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Government service
Loy's first government role was as Special Assistant to the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and director of that agency's Office of Policy Development, the FAA's economic analysis and planning shop.
They served in the Department of State under four administrations, nominated the last three times by the Presidents Carter, Clinton and Obama. From 1965-70 they were Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs. In that role they negotiated numerous international bilateral air transport agreements, represented the U.S. at meetings of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and the International Maritime Organization (IMCO), and was vice-chair of the U.S. delegation to the multinational negotiations that successfully created the present structure of INTELSAT, the organization that operates the space segments of the international communications network.
From 1980-81 they were Director of the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, with the personal rank of Ambassador.
From 1998 to 2001 they were Under Secretary for Global Affairs. Their portfolio included human rights, the promotion of democracy, international criminal activity and narcotics, refugees and population affairs, and environmental matters. They served as chief U.S negotiator for climate change. In 2011 they served as Deputy U.S Representative to the UN General Assembly.
Nonprofit work
From 1981-95, Loy was president of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, an American institution whose original capital was a gift from the German government as memorial to the Marshall Plan. It concentrated exclusively on issues affecting both Europe and the U.S., particularly in the fields of economics, politics and the environment.
Following the fall of the Berlin Wall, GMF concentrated the bulk of its resources on promoting democratic institutions (such as an independent press, a functioning legislature, effective political parties, an independent judiciary, a civil society of non-governmental institutions, etc.) in former Soviet-bloc Eastern European countries.
They served in 1994 as Chair of the Conference of Parties of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITIES), in which over 1,000 delegates from more than 120 countries and over 500 observers participated. In 1996, Loy was a Visiting Lecturer at the Yale Law School, teaching a course in international environmental law and policy.
Loy chairs numerous boards of directors of non-profit organizations, particularly in the field of environment, climate change and family planning, including Population Services International (PSI), ecoAmerica, and the Round Table on Environmental Medicine and Health of the National Academy of Medicine. They serve on numerous boards they have chaired in the past, including the Environmental Defense Fund (on whose board they have served since 1981), Resources For The Future, and The Washington Ballet.
Their prior boards include The Foundation for A Civil Society (chair), which promoted democratic development in Central and Eastern Europe; the Budapest-based Regional Environmental Center for Central and Eastern Europe, to which they were appointed in 1990 by President George H. W. Bush, the League of Conservation Voters, and the Foundation for a Civil Society, which has conducted programs promoting democratic institutions in Central and Eastern Europe, particularly Czechia and Slovakia. Loy was a founding board member of the Climate Speakers Network, which was subsequently absorbed into the Climate Reality Project.

Aristotle's wheel paradox is a paradox or problem appearing in the Greek work Mechanica, traditionally attributed to Aristotle. It states as follows: A wheel is depicted in two-dimensional space as two circles. Its larger, outer circle is tangential to a horizontal surface (e.g. a road that it rolls on), while the smaller, inner one has the same center and is rigidly affixed to the larger. (The smaller circle could be the bead of a tire, the rim it is mounted upon, or the axle.) Assuming the larger circle rolls without slipping (or skidding) for one full revolution, the distances moved by both circles' circumferences are the same. The distance travelled by the larger circle is equal to its circumference, but for the smaller it is greater than its circumference, thereby creating a paradox.
The paradox is not limited to wheels: other things depicted in two dimensions display the same behavior such as a roll of tape, or a typical round bottle or jar rolled on its side (the smaller circle would be the mouth or neck of the jar or bottle).
In an alternative version of the problem, the smaller circle, rather than the larger one, is in contact with the horizontal surface. Examples include a typical train wheel, which has a flange, or a barbell straddling a bench. American educator and philosopher, Israel Drabkin, called these Case II versions of the paradox, and a similar, but unidentical, analysis applies.
History of the paradox
In antiquity
In antiquity, the wheel problem was described in the Aristotelian Mechanica, as well as in the Mechanica of Hero of Alexandria. In the former it appears as "Problem 24", where the description of the wheel is given as follows:
For let there be a larger circle ΔZΓ a smaller EHB, and A at the centre of both; let ZI be the line which the greater unrolls on its own, and HK that which the smaller unrolls on its own, equal to ZΛ. When I move the smaller circle, I move the same centre, that is A; let the larger be attached to it. When AB becomes perpendicular to HK, at the same time AΓ becomes perpendicular to ZΛ, so that it will always have completed an equal distance, namely HK for the circumference HB, and ZΛ for ZΓ. If the quarter unrolls an equal distance, it is clear that the whole circle will unroll an equal distance to the whole circle so that when the line BH comes to K, the circumference ZΓ will be ZΛ, and the whole circle will be unrolled. In the same way, when I move the large circle, fitting the small one to it, their centre being the same, AB will be perpendicular and at right angles simultaneously with AΓ, the latter to ZI, the former to HΘ. So that, when the one will have completed a line equal to HΘ, and the other to ZI, and ZA becomes again perpendicular to ZΛ, and HA to HK, so that they will be as in the beginning at Θ and I.
The problem is then stated:
Now since there is no stopping of the greater for the smaller so that it [the greater] remains for an interval of time at the same point, and since the smaller does not leap over any point, it is strange that the greater traverses a path equal to that of the smaller, and again that the smaller traverses a path equal to that of the larger. Furthermore, it is remarkable that, though in each case there is only one movement, the center that is moved in one case rolls a great distance and in the other a smaller distance.
In the Scientific Revolution
The mathematician Gerolamo Cardano discusses the problem of the wheel in their 1570 Opus novum de proportionibus numerorum, taking issue with the presumption of its analysis in terms of motion. Mersenne further discussed it in their 1623 Quaestiones Celeberrimae in Genesim, where they suggest that the problem can be analysed by a process of expansion and contraction of the two circles. But Mersenne remained unsatisfied with their understanding, writing:Indeed I have never been able to discover, and I do not think any one else has been able to discover whether the smaller circle touches the same point twice, or proceeds by leaps and sliding.
In their Two New Sciences, Galileo uses the wheel problem to argue for a certain kind of atomism. They begin their analysis by considering a pair of concentric hexagons, as opposed to circles. Imagining this hexagon "rolling" on a surface, Galileo notices that the inner hexagon "jumps" a little space with each roll of the outer onto a new face. They then imagines what would happen to the limit as the number of faces on a polygon becomes very large, and finds that the little space that is "jumped" by the inner polygon becomes smaller and smaller. They write:
Therefore a larger polygon having a thousand sides passes over and measures a straight line equal to its perimeter, while at the same time the smaller one passes an approximately equal line, but one interruptedly composed of a thousand little particles equal to its thousand sides with a thousand little void spaces interposed — for we may call these "void" in relation to the thousand linelets touched by the sides of the polygon.
Since a circle is just the limit in which the number of faces on the polygon becomes infinite, Galileo finds that Aristotle's wheel contains material that is filled with infinitesimal spaces or "voids", and that "the interposed voids are not quantified, but are infinitely many". This leads them to conclude that a belief in atoms – in the sense that matter is "composed of infinitely many unquantifiable atoms" – is sufficient to explain the phenomenon.
Gilles de Roberval (1602–1675) is also associated with this analysis.
In the 19th century
Bernard Bolzano discussed Aristotle's wheel in The Paradoxes of the Infinite (1851), a book that influenced Georg Cantor and subsequent thinkers about the mathematics of infinity. Bolzano observes that there is a bijection between the points of any two similar arcs, which can be implemented by drawing a radius, remarking that the history of this apparently paradoxical fact dates back to Aristotle.
In the 20th century
The author of Mathematical Fallacies and Paradoxes uses a dime glued to a half-dollar (representing smaller and larger circles, respectively) with their centers aligned and both fixed to an axle, as a model for the paradox. They write:
This is the solution, then, or the key to it. Although you are careful not to let the half-dollar slip on the tabletop, the “point” tracing the line segment at the foot of the dime is both rotating and slipping all the time. It is slipping with respect to the tabletop. Since the dime does not touch the table top, you do not notice the slipping. If you can roll the half-dollar along the table and at the same time roll the dime (or better yet the axle) along a block of wood, you can actually observe the slipping. If you have ever parked too close to the curb, you have noticed the screech made by your hubcap as it slips (and rolls) on the curb while your tire merely rolls on the pavement. The smaller the small circle relative to the large circle, the more the small one slips. Of course the center of the two circles does not rotate at all, so it slides the whole way.
Alternatively, one can reject the assumption that the smaller circle is independent of the larger circle. Imagine a tire as the larger circle, and imagine the smaller circle as the interior circumference of the tire and not as the rim. The movement of the inner circle is dependent on the larger circle. Thus its movement from any point to another can be calculated by using an inverse of their ratio.
Analysis and solutions
The paradox is that the smaller inner circle moves 2πR, the circumference of the larger outer circle with radius R, rather than its own circumference. If the inner circle were rolled separately, it would move 2πr, its own circumference with radius r. The inner circle is not separate but rigidly connected to the larger. So 2πr is a red herring. The inner circle's center and radius are both relevant, but its circumference is not.
First solution
If the smaller circle depends on the larger one (Case I), the larger circle's motion forces the smaller to traverse the larger's circumference. If the larger circle depends on the smaller one (Case II), then the smaller circle's motion forces the larger circle to traverse the smaller circle's circumference. This is the simplest solution.
Second solution
This solution considers the transition from the starting to ending positions. Let Pb be a point on the bigger circle and Ps be a point on the smaller circle, both on the same radius. For convenience, assume they are both directly below the center, analogous to both hands of a clock pointing towards six. Both Pb and Ps travel in a cycloid path as they roll together one revolution.
While each travels 2πR horizontally from start to end, Ps's cycloid path is shorter and more efficient than Pb's. Pb travels farther above and farther below the center's path – the only straight one – than does Ps.
If Pb and Ps were anywhere else on their respective circles, the curved paths would be the same length. Summarizing, the smaller circle moves horizontally 2πR because any point on the smaller circle travels a shorter, and thus more direct path than any point on the larger circle.
Third solution
This solution only compares the starting and ending positions. The larger circle and the smaller circle have the same center. If said center is moved, both circles move the same distance, which is a necessary property of translation and equals 2πR in the experiment. Also, every other point on both circles has the same position relative to the center before and after rolling one revolution (or any other integer count of revolutions). For a wheel with multiple concentric inner circles, each circle's translation movement is identical because all have an identical center. This further proves the circumference of any inner circle is entirely irrelevant (Case 1).

Best Of..., also referred to as Sia: Best Of..., is the first greatest hits album by Australian singer-songwriter Sia, released in Australia on 30 March 2012 through the Sydney-based independent record label Inertia. The compilation includes tracks from four of their previous studio albums: Healing Is Difficult (2001), Colour the Small One (2004), Some People Have Real Problems, (2008) and We Are Born (2010). Also included are two tracks featuring Sia as a vocalist ("Destiny" by Zero 7 and "Titanium" by David Guetta), "My Love" from The Twilight Saga: Eclipse film soundtrack, plus a remixed version of "Buttons" by Brazilian rock band CSS.
The album was announced in February 2012, shortly after Sia claimed they would be retiring. Some online music stores offered Sia's music DVD TV Is My Parent as a bonus. Overall, critical reception of the album was positive, though many reviewers criticized select tracks. Best Of... debuted at number 30 on the ARIA Albums Chart the week of 15 April and reached a peak position of number 27 the following week.
Background and promotion
The album was announced in February 2012, shortly after Sia made a statement claiming they were retiring. Best Of... received promotion in various forms. IE Music/Inertia released a promotional video on YouTube in March 2012. One day prior to the album's release, Oyster magazine commemorated Sia's career by publishing their list of their top five collaborations. The compilation album and a Sia tote bag, among other prizes, were included in a competition held by Cosmopolitan magazine. In April 2012, Music Australia Guide (Mag) offered copies of the album to readers as part of a "freebie" giveaway.
Content
Best Of... contains eighteen tracks spanning fifteen years of music from Sia's career, including collaborative work with Zero 7 and other artists. Fourteen tracks come from four of Sia's previous studio albums. "Taken for Granted", representing the oldest material on the compilation, is the only song from Sia's 2002 album Healing Is Difficult. "Numb", "Where I Belong", "Breathe Me" and, "Sweet Potato" all appeared on Sia's 2004 album Colour the Small One. Tracks from their 2008 album Some People Have Real Problems include: "The Girl You Lost to Cocaine", "Day Too Soon", Ray Davies' "I Go to Sleep", "Soon We'll Be Found", and "Buttons". "Clap Your Hands", "Bring Night", "You've Changed", and "The Fight" originally appeared on Sia's previous studio album We Are Born (2010).
The remaining four tracks represent collaborative works, one soundtrack appearance and a remix. "Destiny" first appeared on the British duo Zero 7's album Simple Things (2001); the track features vocal performances by Sia and Sophie Barker. "My Love" appeared on The Twilight Saga: Eclipse film soundtrack (2010). "Titanium", written by Sia, David Guetta, Giorgio Tuinfort, and Nick van de Wall, first appeared on Guetta's 2011 album Nothing but the Beat.
Reception
Critical reception of the compilation album was positive overall; many reviewers appreciated the album in its entirety but criticized select tracks. The AU Review Robert Lyon awarded the album a score of 8.2 on a 10-point scale. Lyon thought "Clap Your Hands" began the album "brilliantly" and complimented additional individual tracks, but noted the compilation offered no previously unreleased material and that the bonus DVD was only available through select retailers. Mikey Cahill of News Limited awarded the album four points on a five-point scale. They wrote listeners have the ability to "visualise Sia's animated exterior singing each note loud and proud" and summarized the album in one word: "respectable". Freya Davies of ArtsHub suggested "Bring Night" would have been a better opening track. Davies criticized select tracks, such as "Destiny" and "Day Too Soon" due to Sia's "inarticulate" singing, but also complimented faster tempo songs which highlighted their "vocal strength" ("Titanium" and "Buttons"). Davies concluded: "Sia's ability to combine cult and popular appeal is successfully demonstrated by the strength of this compilation album. Its weaknesses are momentary; overall, it is a fun salute to the past 15 years and a respectable look to the future."
Scott-Patrick Mitchell of Out in Perth, an LGBT publication based in Perth, Western Australia, appreciated an album of Sia highlights and wrote that "Bring Night", "Buttons" and "The Girl You Lost to Cocaine" "[sparkle] like supernovas". Rabbit Hole Urban Music Steve Smart awarded the compilation four out of five stars. Smart thought the album was long but inclusive of many genres; they called the production "super smooth... classy but not edgeless". Rave Magazine Alasdair Duncan also rated Best Of... four out of five stars and complimented Sia's body of work. Duncan thought the compilation had a "thrown-together quality" but called the music "top-notch". Nina Bertok of Rip It Up, an Adelaide street press magazine, called the album a collection of "tear-jerking ballads... pop nuggets... dance bangers" and "quirkier numbers". Bertok recommended the CSS remix of "Buttons" and awarded the compilation three out of five stars. One reviewer from the Sydney Star Observer wrote that "Breathe Me" stands as Sia's best song but thought their songs "Don't Bring Me Down" and "I'm in Here" should have been included on the album.

Notnel is a heritage-listed detached house at 6 Burnett Street, West Ipswich, City of Ipswich, Queensland, Australia. It was built . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.
History
The residence at 6 Burnett Street, West Ipswich, is a brick house built for David McLaughlin.
The allotment on which this residence is situated was first purchased on 11 May 1855 as allotment 97, parish of Ipswich, county Stanley (1r 32.5p), by Patrick O'Sullivan at a cost of . O'Sullivan was born in 1818 in Ireland and at the age of 19 they were found guilty of assault with a bayonet at Canterbury, England, and transported to Australia. By 1847, O'Sullivan had settled in Ipswich where they worked as a shopkeeper and was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly in 1860.
By March 1857, the title to allotment 97 was transferred to David McLaughlin, an Ipswich builder. They were born in Newtown Limavady, in Ireland, and it appears that it was there that McLaughlin first became acquainted with William Leckey Ferguson, a bricklayer. Because Ferguson did not emigrate until December, 1863, McLaughlin and possibly William Leckey Ferguson's son, a fellow Irishman from Newtown began a building contracting business in Ipswich known as McLaughlin & Ferguson and which successfully tendered for work on the Ipswich Grammar School. As a builder, McLaughlin was in an advantageous position to have their own house built and Ipswich Municipal Council Valuation Registers indicate that a brick cottage and workshop existed on the allotment in Burnett Street as early as 1863.
In 1870, Council records indicate that Alfred Dann was the occupant. When sold it was described as "just the thing for a gentleman on the lookout for a town house" and intriguingly said to enjoy "sea breezes". Despite the enticements, the property remained in the ownership of David McLaughlin until June 1872, when title to the land was registered in the name of John North. North was born in Hertfordshire, England, and migrated with their sister to Australia in 1854 on board the Genghis Khan which is the same ship that brought David McLaughlin to Australia. Within 2 years North was living in Ipswich and working for the major department store, Cribb & Foote, where they remained in employment for over 40 years. By 1876, they had acquired allotment 98 adjacent to 6 Burnett Street from William Berry, the then owner of 1 Burnett Street. Ipswich Municipal Council records indicate that North demolished a timber cottage that had stood on this allotment and utilized it for the next 22 years as their garden.
North died at their Burnett Street residence in August 1898 and the property was passed to their wife, Laura Ann North, who remained there until they sold the estate on 1 February 1907 to George William Wesley Rylatt, a dentist of Brisbane Street, Ipswich. Ownership was then passed to Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Runge who was listed as the registered owner of the property in April 1920. Runge, who also owned 2 Burnett Street at the time, did not live in the house at 6 Burnett Street and continued to rent it until their death in 1923, after which time it was held in trust and eventually transferred to their son, also named Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Runge. After taking possession of the property, Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Runge junior sold allotment 98 as subdivisions.
By 1934, the title to the land had once again changed hands and George Hawley was registered as the owner of the property. The Hawley family had migrated to Australia from England and were farmers in the Fassifern Valley. The Burnett Street estate remained in the family for 56 years and it was named "Notnel" (Lenton backwards) by George Hawley in memory of Lenton Avenue where they had lived in England. In 1990, the title to 6 Burnett Street was transferred to a family which undertook substantial refurbishments and repairs to the property.
Description
Notnel occupies a very large, long allotment that is in size and located less than one km from the Ipswich town centre. The house is sited close to the Burnett Street boundary, the front verandah edge being set back from it by only . Notnel does not enjoy the same elevated positions No.1 Burnett Street (William Berry residence) and Idavine do, however it overlooks a wide area to the west where the Ipswich Grammar School is located.
The front part of the single-storey house features a steeply pitched, short-ridge roof surrounded on three and a half sides by separate verandah roofs. Two dormer windows protrude to the north and east from this main roof structure. Their sides are clad in corrugated iron and their roofs are short-ridged. At the rear is a smaller pyramid-roofed structure separated from the front section by a short gabled roof. A small skillion roof abuts the rear sloping away from the pyramid-roofed structure. On the eastern facade the verandah roof continues over enclosed space to meet the rear skillion. On the western facade the verandah roof extends in front of the pyramid-roofed structure. The entire roof is clad in corrugated iron, with two brick chimney stacks protruding through it.
External walls are predominantly brick. Facing the eastern boundary and Burnett Street, the verandah edges are defined by square timber posts with simply carved capitals. Centred on the front facade is a set of double lattice doors held in place by recent, unpainted timber posts without capitals. Between the verandah posts are simple, timber handrails, and cross-braced balustrades and valances. On the western facade, aligned to the house's front brick face, a set of four full-height sash windows have been installed. The southern end of this facade is completed in brick.
Under the main short-ridge roof facing Burnett Street are four rooms. The front two are living and dining spaces. Entry is from the verandah and through the living room, which has a fireplace centred on its eastern wall. Entry to the dining room is through a door on the western wall. A further door from the living room opens into the short central hallway that separates the two rear rooms. The stairs to the single attic room start in this hallway space. All four rooms open onto the verandah with timber double doors.
A door from the short hallway opens onto the rear verandah area. Off this space to the left, access is gained to a single bedroom contained partly under the gable roof and the extension of the verandah roof. A fireplace is located on its eastern wall. To one's right is a bathroom, which occupies a corner of space contained under the west-facing verandah roof.
To the left along the rear, west-facing verandah, access is gained to the kitchen, which is contained under the pyramid roof. The overall height of this space and a remaining rim of skirting boards at approximately , suggest that there was once a room above the kitchen and access to this space is now gained by a set of narrow stairs. In the kitchen's southern wall is a large stove alcove. A door in the room's eastern wall opens onto a small covered space. This opens into a storage room. These spaces are under the last part of the extension of the verandah roof, the storage area abutting the skillion-roofed laundry on its southern wall. The laundry is accessed from the rear yard space.

Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner (13 December 1780 – 24 March 1849) was a German chemist who is best known for work that foreshadowed the periodic law for the chemical elements, and for inventing the first lighter, which was known as the Döbereiner's lamp. They became a professor of chemistry and pharmacy at the University of Jena.
Life and work
As a coachman's son, Döbereiner had little opportunity for formal schooling. Thus, they were apprenticed to an apothecary, and began to read widely and to attend science lectures. They eventually became a professor at the University of Jena in 1810 and also studied chemistry at Strasbourg. In work published in 1829, Döbereiner reported trends in certain properties of selected groups of elements. For example, the average of the atomic masses of lithium and potassium was close to the atomic mass of sodium. A similar pattern was found with calcium, strontium, and barium; with sulfur, selenium, tellurium; and with chlorine, bromine, and iodine. Moreover, the densities for some of these triads followed a similar pattern. These sets of elements became known as "Döbereiner's triads".
Döbereiner also is known for their discovery of furfural, for their work on the use of platinum as a catalyst, and for a lighter, known as Döbereiner's lamp. By 1828 hundred thousands of these lighters had been mass produced by the German manufacturer Gottfried Piegler in Schleiz.
The German writer Goethe was a friend of Döbereiner, attended their lectures weekly, and used their theories of chemical affinities as a basis for their famous 1809 novella Elective Affinities.

August Hiss was a Swiss footballer who played one season for FC Basel. They played in the position as striker.
Hiss joined Basel's first team before the 1931–32 season and made their domestic league debut for the club in the home game at the Landhof on 27 September 1931 as Basel lost 0–6 against Urania Genève Sport. They scored their first goal for their club on 25 October in the away game against Zürich. But their goal could not save Basel from a 4–1 defeat.
In that season Hiss played a total of 18 games for Basel scoring a total of 10 goals. Nine of these games were in the Swiss Serie A, three in the Swiss Cup and six were friendly games. They scored three goal in the domestic league, three in the cup competition and the other four were scored during the test games.
An episode that is noted in association with the Swiss Cup, was the second-round replay away against FC Lugano on 22 November 1931. The mood amongst the 3,000 spectators was heated even before the kick-off. This because after the 3–3 draw in the first game; the local press had circulated the most incredible rumours. Then, Basel's Alfred Schlecht scored the winning goal early, not even two minutes after the game had started. However, shortly before the end of the match referee Hans Wüthrich did not blow their whistle and award a penalty after an alleged handball by a Basel player. The referee ended the game shortly afterwards with a Basel victory and the ill tempers were worsened. After the game there were tumults and riots among the spectators who were not satisfied with the referee's performance. Stones were thrown at referee and players and the windows of the changing rooms were smashed. It was some eight hours before things were settled enough for the police to be able to bring both the referee and the entire Basel team to safety, by ship over Lake Lugano. According to the reports in the club chronicles, quite a few players were injured. Josef Remay had a bleeding head, Hermann Enderlin had a hole above their eye, Leopold Kielholz and goalkeeper Paul Blumer were also hurt. Hiss escaped unhurt. Lugano was sanctioned and had to play their next home games at least 100 kilometers from their home ground.

The Sufan movement (; "Campaign to Eradicate Hidden Counterrevolutionaries") was a purge of perceived opponents in the People's Republic of China under Mao Zedong, between 1955 and 1957. The term "sufan" is short for "肅清暗藏的反革命分子", which means "to purge of the hidden counterrevolutionaries"; similar campaigns had been carried out within the Chinese Communist Party as early as 1932. Mao directed that 5 percent of counter-revolutionaries were to be eliminated. During the purge, around 214,000 people were arrested and approximately 53,000 died.
Origins
The Sufan campaign originated as the development of a campaign by Mao in early 1955 against Hu Feng, a Marxist literary critic, and a purported clique of writers and intellectuals who had criticised the Communist Party's restrictive policies towards literature and the arts. They called for more freedom of expression, but were persecuted as counterrevolutionaries. 81,000 intellectuals were "unmasked and punished" and another 300,000 were deprived of their civil rights on the grounds that they were "politically unreliable".
The campaign officially began after the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a "Directive on launching a struggle to cleanse out hidden counter-revolutionary elements" () on 1 July 1955. On 25 August 1955, it issued "The directive on the thorough purge and cleansing of hidden counter revolutionaries" ().
Aims and targets
Unlike the 1951 Zhen Fan campaign (1950-52), which principally targeted those as threats from outside the state system such as former Kuomintang officials and supporters, the Sufan campaign widened to purge those within the party, military and state agencies who Mao's circle saw as threats. Several top Party officials, notably the technocrats Gao Gang and Rao Shushi, were purged in the early stages of the campaign. Many other Party members and government officials were arrested on vague suspicions of counterrevolutionary activity and were made to 'confess' their political views. The Public Security Bureaus of the Ministry of Public Security were a particular target, as the communist leadership sought to ensure that China's security forces were under tight Party control.
The People's Daily, in an attempt to provide justification for the purge, reported that ten percent of Communist Party members were secret traitors and needed to be purged. This number appears to have been taken as a quota for the number of arrests that needed to occur. There was no judicial process involved; instead, people were targeted through administrative edicts in which regular criminal procedures were ignored. 2.2 million people were reported to have been investigated by September 1955. 110,000 people were purportedly "exposed" as counterrevolutionaries, though Mao continued the campaign for a further two years in the belief that another 50,000 major suspects were still at large.
The ostensible aims of the Sufan campaign were the defeat of so-called "bureaucratism" within government organisations, the generation of revolutionary fervor and the eradication of purported counterrevolutionaries within the state. Alternatively, as one writer suggests, the campaign was intended to crush opponents of the socialist transformation of industry and commerce. It was effectively a reaction by Mao against the rise of a technocratic bureaucracy dominated by pro-Soviet officials, following the implementation of China's Soviet-inspired First Five-Year Plan from 1953 onwards. Mao saw the new technocratic ethos in China's administration as a corruption of the "revolutionary spirit". The officials responsible were cast as "functional bourgeoisie" whose power was based on their bureaucratic authority rather than private property. Gao Gang became a particular target for their embrace of Soviet methods of industrial organisation in Manchuria; they were purged after being accused of attempting to run "an independent kingdom".
Outcomes
The campaign was brought to an end in October 1957 after more than 18 million people had been targeted. Another 11 to 12 million people were still to be investigated when the campaign was ended. Large numbers of people were sent to "labor reform" () camps. Many were released in 1956 with official apologies for having been falsely accused. The campaign resulted in the reduction of the power of the State Planning Commission and industrial managers in state-owned enterprises, as well as a much tighter rein by the Party on the state security apparatus. It was later justified by the Party on the basis that it served to "strengthen the leadership of the Party over public-security work, to put public-security agencies under Party leadership."
According to Chinese researchers, government data (including Hu Qiaomu's figure) show that some 1.4 million intellectuals and officials were persecuted during the Sufan movement. In addition, 214,000 people were arrested, 22,000 were executed and a total of 53,000 died.
Jean-Louis Margolin writes in The Black Book of Communism that one source indicates 81,000 arrests during the campaign (which they claim is rather modest), while another gives 770,000 deaths. They conclude that there is no way to determine which is accurate.

Billund () is a town in Jutland, Denmark. It is the home of the Lego Group head office. It is also the site of a theme park, Legoland, waterpark resort, Lalandia, and Billund Airport which is the second largest airport in Denmark. The airport opened in 1964 and was built by the Lego Group, but is now run independently. With a population of 6,725 (1 January 2022), Billund is the second largest town in Billund Municipality, behind the municipal seat of Grindsted.
On the outskirts of the town there is a Lego factory, which, , manufactured 90% of the company's products. Adjacent to the company's headquarters is the first Legoland theme park, which opened in 1968 and is called Legoland Billund. In addition to the Lego Group, Sun-Air of Scandinavia has its head office in Billund.
History
Billund has long been part of the parish of Grene Kirke ("Grove Church") whose original Romanesque building was first mentioned in 1291. The town's name was first mentioned as "Byllundt" in 1454 and as "Billund" in 1510.
In 1880, the town's first windmill was built on the road between Vejle and Varde. In 1895, the mill burned to the ground but was rebuilt in 1897, this time in the style of Dutch windmills. That same year, a railway was built from Vejle to Billund, and the route was later extended to Grindsted in 1914.
In 1916, Ole Kirk Christiansen, who later founded The Lego Group, bought a Billund furniture company that was founded in 1895. They invested in the town, creating a new dairy and the Skjoldbjerg church a few miles south of town. In 1930, Kirk Christiansen began producing utility items such as ironing boards, stepladders and miniature toys. Their first toys were created from scraps from the production of their other goods but their true toy production started in 1932. In 1934, the toy factory was named "Lego."
In the late 1930s Billund experienced growth due to the factories and began to build waterworks, a gymnasium, and the town hall, though the local power station was closed and relocated.
In 1942, during the Nazi German occupation of Denmark in World War II, the old Lego factory was destroyed by fire, but a new one was immediately erected. In 1946, the railway track from Grindsted was extended to the Lego factory. Plastic Lego Bricks were first released from the factory in 1949.
The 1950s brought a recession to Billund with the closing of the railroad. In response to the growing poverty, the Billund Housing Association was founded and created affordable housing as well as a retirement home. Lego created a large park north of town with a playground, outdoor scene, toboggan hill and a human-made lake in 1959. In 1964 the Billund Airport was inaugurated, first as the Lego Group's private airport, and was later opened for other uses. Legoland opened in 1968, and Billund again began to experience growth.
Geography
Billund is located approximately 13 kilometers (8 miles) from Grindsted, 56 kilometers (35 miles) from Esbjerg, and 27 kilometers (17 miles) from The Regional Capital of Vejle.
Demographics
As of 2012 the town had 6,146 residents. In the beginning of the 1930s Billund was still a small village with only 300 residents. In the 1950s the village reached 500 residents and after this time that number increased rapidly. After only 20 years, in 1970 this number quadrupled to 2,065 residents. Population growth exploded because of Lego's rapid expansion in the mid-1960s.
The town's demographics are characterized by many families with children; approximately 27.3% of the households in the town consist of couples with children. This is somewhat above the average for the region. The residents in the town mostly live in family houses.
Notable people
Godtfred Kirk Christiansen (1920 in Billund – 1995) the managing director of The Lego Group from 1957 to 1979
Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen (born 1947 in Billund) the former president and CEO of The Lego Group (1979–2004) and the third richest Dane, with a net worth of $4.7 billion as of February 2020.
Line Bonde (born c.1979) a Danish fighter pilot, brought up in Billund. In July 2006, aged 27, they became the first female Danish fighter pilot, flying an F-16 jet fighter
Tourism
The presence of the Lego factory draws tourists to Billund. A new 23-metre-tall Lego House opened in late 2017. Other attractions include Kongernes Jelling, the Vandel Museum and the Children's Library designed by Rosan Bosch.

Film analysis is the process in which a film is analyzed in terms of mise-en-scène, cinematography, sound, and editing. One way of analyzing films is by shot-by-shot analysis, though that is typically used only for small clips or scenes. Film analysis is closely connected to film theory.
Many different authors suggest various approaches to film analysis. Jacques Aumont and Michel Marie in their publication Analysis of Film propose several key points regarding film analysis. (1) There is general method of film analysis, (2) film analysis can never be concluded as there will always be something more to explore and (3) it is necessary for one to have knowledge about film history in order to perform a film analysis. They recognize various types of approaches: (1) Text-based film analysis (structural approach), (2) topic-based analysis (narrative approach), (3) picture and sound approach (iconic analysis), (4) psychoanalytical approach and (5) historical approach.
Another methodology is suggested by Thomas and Vivian Sobchack in their publication Introduction to film. They suggest viewer can observe following elements: (1) analysis of film space, (2) analysis of film time and (3) film sound. As they focus mainly on iconic aspects of film they further propose additional elements: the image, tone, composition and movement.
Iconic analysis
Iconic analysis basically deals with image or picture (and sometimes also film sound). In iconic analysis we try to understand how different pictorial elements convey the meaning of film. There are several examples in film history where image was even more than just a key element of film (i.e. pre WWII avant-garde films, Italian neorealism, film noir, etc.). However today in most narrative films (Fictional film) we try to hide pictorial elements from audience and mask them behind the story. In such films it is usually difficult (if not event pointless) to analyze image as such. We therefore more often tend to observe various other elements like light, camera movement (see Cinematography), composition etc. and try to understand how these elements influence or cross-reference other elements of film, like story, mood etc. As iconic analysis derives from single image and it is closely related to techniques of film production thus demanding at least brief understanding of these technical elements of film it is mostly useful method of research for film schools and other educational institutions. Film critics tend not use this method as a "stand alone" approach, but they rather use it as a part of other analysis method.
Semiotic analysis
Semiotics (also called semiotic studies and in the Saussurean tradition called semiology) is the study of meaning-making, the philosophical theory of signs and symbols. This includes the study of signs and sign processes (semiosis), indication, designation, likeness, analogy, metaphor, symbolism, signification, and communication. Semiotics is closely related to the field of linguistics, which, for its part, studies the structure and meaning of language more specifically. As different from linguistics, however, semiotics also studies non-linguistic sign systems. Semiotics is often divided into three branches: semantics, syntactics and pragmatics. Semantic are the relations between signs and the things to which they refer, their denotata or meaning. Stnyactics are the relations among signs in formal structures. Pragmatics are the relations between signs and sign-using agents.
Psychoanalytical approach
Ancient Greek philosophy's "overturning of mythology" as a definition to understanding of the heightened aesthetic. For Plato, Eros takes an almost transcendent manifestation when the subject seeks to go beyond itself and form a communion with the objectival other: "the true order of going...to the things of love, is to use the beauties of earth as steps...to all fair forms, and from fair forms to fair actions, and from fair actions to fair notions, until from fair notions they arrive at the notion of absolute beauty".
Shot by shot analysis
This is a written description of a given sequence in a film in order of the shots. According to Michael Ryan and Melissa Lenos, when doing shot-by-shot analysis, we start with describing the techniques used in the shots or images we are analyzing. After that, we also need to elaborate what effects these techniques can produce when viewing the movie; for example, camera leads what we see in the film so the changes in camera angles have impact on audience's interpretations of the meanings the movie tries to convey. Some of the techniques used in film producing could be composition (foreground/background, frame/raming, etc.), cinematography (close-up, medium shot and long shot, pan shot, tilt shot, etc.), editing (montage, eyeline match, etc.), and so on.
Recent developments from internet-based film analysts
A number of varied film analysis approaches have emerged and gained popularity on the internet such as those by Red Letter Media and Rob Ager. In Room 237, a 2012 documentary showcasing a variety of such interpretations of Stanley Kubrick's 1980 horror film The Shining, was screened at the Cannes Film Festival and generated wide media coverage followed by a distribution deal. The film has since generated considerable comment and debate from film critics and film communities.

Librairie Avant-Garde (Mount Wutai Branch) is a bookstore opened by Qian Xiaohua in 2004, now regarded as the most representative bookstore in Nanjing, China. It has become a cultural icon of the city, and because of the adjacency to Nanjing University and the popularity among students, it is dubbed as "the second library of Nanjing University".
The bookshop is hidden in a former government parking lot underneath Wutaishan Stadium, which has been used as a bomb shelter. Covering 3780 sq meters, it provides a large volume of social science and humanities books that have been recognized by the literati and history, ranging from literature, history, philosophy, movie, music, photography, dance, drama, architecture, art, cartoon and advertisement to social science, business and journalism, while excluding reference work and other practical books.
Founding
After all the hardship of running the bookstore, bankruptcy in 2003 and the unpredictable, Qian Xiaohua restored energy and opened a flagship bookstore in an underground parking lot, on Guangzhou Road. Because at the time most friends of Qian were avant-garde writers, and they themselves was an avid French literature lover, they named the bookstore Librairie Avant-Garde, in which Librairie is a French word that means bookshop. They hoped the bookstore could serve as a spiritual guide for the people making their way in darkness. "A good bookshop should provide space, vision and nurture the city with its humanitarian spirit," owner Qian Xiaohua tells CNN. "It's a place for people to have dreams in the city."

Hugo Ball (; 22 February 1886 – 14 September 1927) was a German author, poet, and essentially the founder of the Dada movement in European art in Zürich in 1916. Among other accomplishments, they were a pioneer in the development of sound poetry.
Life and work
Hugo Ball was born in Pirmasens, Germany, and was raised in a middle-class Catholic family. They studied sociology and philosophy at the universities of Munich and Heidelberg (1906–1907). In 1910, they moved to Berlin in order to become an actor and collaborated with Max Reinhardt. At the beginning of World War I, they tried joining the army as a volunteer, but was denied enlistment for medical reasons. After witnessing the invasion of Belgium, they were disillusioned, saying: "The war is founded on a glaring mistake – men have been confused with machines." Considered a traitor in their country, they crossed the frontier with the cabaret performer and poet Emmy Hennings, whom they would marry in 1920, and settled in Zürich, Switzerland. There, Ball continued their interest in anarchism and in Mikhail Bakunin in particular; they also worked on a book of translations of works by Bakunin, which never got published. Although interested in anarchist philosophy, they nonetheless rejected it for its militant aspects, and viewed it as only a means to their personal goal of socio-political enlightenment.
In 1916, Hugo Ball created the Dada Manifesto, making a political statement about their views on the terrible state of society and acknowledging their dislike for philosophies of the past that claimed to possess the ultimate truth. In the manifesto Ball aimed to legitimize the new artistic movement's ambition to not merely "write poetry with words", but to "write poetry out of the words", to create an entirely new language, due to the fact that the old language was viewed as "doomed", and "ruined by the filthy hands of capital". The central thought of modernism since Baudelaire regarding that the language has to be fixed, is here given a distinctive critique of economy as a motivation. The same year as the Manifesto, in 1916, Ball wrote their poem "," a poem consisting of nonsensical words. The meaning, however, resides in its meaninglessness, reflecting the chief principle behind Dadaism. Some of their other best known works include the poem collection , the drama , a memoir of the Zürich period Flight Out of Time: A Dada Diary, and a biography of Hermann Hesse, entitled (1927).
As co-founder of the Cabaret Voltaire and a magazine with the same name, Cabaret Voltaire, in Zürich, they led the Dada movement in Zürich and is one of the people credited with naming the movement "Dada," by allegedly choosing the word at random from a dictionary. Their companion and future wife, Emmy Hennings, was also a member of Dada.
Their involvement with the Dada movement lasted approximately two years. They then worked for a short period as a journalist for in Bern. After returning to Catholicism in July 1920, Ball retired to the canton of Ticino, where they lived a religious and relatively poor life with Emmy Hennings. They contributed to the journal Hochland during this time. They also began the process of revising their diaries from 1910 to 1921, which were later published under the title Die Flucht aus der Zeit (Flight Out of Time). These diaries provide a wealth of information concerning the people and events of the Zürich Dada movement. They died in Sant'Abbondio (Gentilino), Switzerland, of stomach cancer on 14 September 1927.
Adaptations
Ball's poem "Gadji beri bimba" was adapted to the song "I Zimbra" on the 1979 Talking Heads album Fear of Music. Ball received a writing credit for the song on the track listing.
The song contains these lines:
Gadji beri bimba clandridi
Lauli lonni cadori gadjam
A bim beri glassala glandride

A voice-cut-up collage of their poem "Karawane" by German artist Kommissar Hjuler, member of Boris Lurie's NO!art movement, was released on an LP on the Greek Shamanic Trance label in 2010. "Karawane" was also set to music in 2012 by Australian composer Stephen Whittington, as an "anti-song cycle" of seventeen songs — one for each line of the poem, lasting approximately two minutes each. The same poem and its historical context was used by Esa-Pekka Salonen for their 28-minute composition for mixed choir and orchestra, Karawane.

Poedjono Pranyoto (6 August 19362 December 2021) was an Indonesian military officer and politician who served as the governor of Lampung from 1988 until 1997 and the deputy speaker of the People's Consultative Assembly from 1997 until 1999.
Early life
Poedjono was born on 6 August 1936 in Purwokerto, Dutch East Indies. They were the sixth child of Ahmad Wignjo Pranyoto and Umi Khalsum. Their father worked as a post office clerk.
As a child, Poedjono started their education at the Sampoerna Elementary School and finished in 1952. They then continued their education to the Purwokerto Junior High School and graduated in 1955.
Military career
After graduating from the Purwokerto Senior High School in 1958, Poedjono entered the Military Engineers Academy. They finished their education in 1961 and became a first lieutenant. Their first assignment was as an instructor at the Army Engineers Academy. Afterwards, they were rotated to various posts in combat engineers battalion.
They reached the rank of lieutenant colonel after being appointed the commander of the 4th Combat Engineers' Battalion in Central Java. They were reposted after three years serving as a battalion commander and became the commander of the Cilacap Military District for about two years.
Poedjono ended military service after the Cilacap municipal council elected them as the regent of Cilacap in 1979. However, they would not retire from the military until twelve years later on 11 November 1991. A presidential decree enacted six years after their retirement promoted them to the honorary rank of lieutenant general on 1 September 1997.
Political career
During their tenure as the regent of Cilacap, Poedjono revived the Sedekah Laut (Sea Thanksgiving) tradition in 1982, an ancient annual tradition which dates back to 1817 and involves washing away various offerings to the sea.
Poedjono was re-elected and installed for a second term as regent on 19 November 1984. At the end of their second term, in July 1987, around 200 Cilacap fishermen committed strike action to protest against bottom trawling. The strike ended after Poedjono promised to ban the practice.
After about eight years serving as a regent, Poedjono was appointed the vice governor of Irian Jaya (now Papua), replacing Sugiyono who was removed amid rumours of bitter conflict between them and the governor, Izaac Hindom. They held this post for a brief period, as in early 1988 they were already nominated by the government as a candidate for the governor of Lampung. The council approved their nomination and they were installed as governor of Lampung on 11 May 1988. They were reelected as governor on 12 April 1993 and was installed for a second term on 11 May 1993.
At the start of their term as governor, Poedjono introduced sumbay, or the five principles of the Lampung society. Sumbay was later compressed down to a motto titled Gerbang Sakai Sambayan, which means the spirit of cooperation. According to news reporter Heri Wardoyo, Poedjono based their policies on the sumbay principles.
In 1989, the Lampung government forced transmigrants in Rawa Jitu, North Lampung, to move because their settlements lie in an area which was recently accorded the 'protected forest' status. However, only 575 out of 2,376 families in the area agreed to move. In a brutal attempt to evict those who refused to move, Poedjono instructed local officials to burn down the transmigrant houses. Around a thousand houses were burned down as a result of their instruction. Poedjono later defended their actions, stating that "it would be more inhumane to allow the villagers to remain in the forest as their occupation of the land was causing floods downstream."
Poedjono's second term was cut short by a year, as on 3 October 1997 they were elected as the deputy speaker of the People's Consultative Assembly. They oversaw the seventh reelection of President Suharto in March 1998, as well as their resignation two months later. A new parliament was formed following the 1999 legislative election and Poedjono resigned from the People's Consultative Assembly in 1999.
Later life and death
After their retirement from politics, Poedjono lived at their house in Cilandak, South Jakarta. They died on 2 December 2021. They were buried at the Jeruk Purut Cemetery.
Personal life
Poedjono was married to Sri Mulyati Wahyuningsih. The couple has three children, namely Astrid Wisni Pribadi, Adith Dewanti Andarini, and Aldwin Prasetyo Laksana.

Jacquelyn Phillips Lacey (born February 27, 1957) is an American politician who served as the District Attorney of Los Angeles County from December 3, 2012 to December 7, 2020. Lacey is the first woman, and first African-American, to serve as LA District Attorney since the office was created in 1850. As a district attorney, they have been described as part of the "tough-on-crime" movement.
Early life and education
Lacey was born in Los Angeles and raised in the Crenshaw neighborhood. Them father, Louis Phillips, was a City of Los Angeles Lot Cleaning employee, and their mother, Addie Phillips, was a garment factory worker. Lacey attended Dorsey High School, graduated from the University of California, Irvine with a degree in psychology in 1979, and graduated from the University of Southern California Law School in 1982.
Professional career
Lacey joined the District Attorney's Office in 1986 as a deputy district attorney. Lacey prosecuted hundreds of criminal cases while serving as a deputy district attorney, including a successful prosecution of the first race-based hate crime murder in Los Angeles County. Lacey continued to move up through the ranks, taking on management and executive roles in the office in 2000. In 2011, they were named Chief Deputy District Attorney, the second-in-command to the District Attorney.
Los Angeles County District Attorney
As LA county DA, Lacey has been described as "tough on crime". During their 2020 re-election campaign, their "tough-on-crime" platform was contrasted with the criminal justice reform-minded platforms of their opponents. According to the New York Times, Lacey has "[resisted] efforts to more drastically reduce prison populations."
2012 election
In June 2011, Lacey announced their candidacy for district attorney, hoping to succeed retiring incumbent Steve Cooley. In the June 2012 election, in what was considered a major upset, Lacey and criminal prosecutor Alan Jackson defeated City Attorney Carmen Trutanich, who was considered the favorite. Lacey and Jackson advanced to a November 2012 runoff election, which Lacey won with 55% of the vote.
Lacey was sworn in as district attorney on December 3, 2012 by outgoing attorney Steve Cooley, in a ceremony attended by former district attorneys Gil Garcetti, Robert Philibosian, and John Van de Kamp.
Industrial accidents and environmental crimes
In 2014, Lacey announced that they would implement a new program that sought to improve investigations of industrial accidents and environmental crimes to help the District Attorney's Office build a stronger case against potential violations of workplace and environmental safety laws. The program assembled a new unit consisting of more than a dozen members who are sent to the sites of accidents involving deaths, injuries and threats to the environment, immediately upon notification by first responders.
Launch of new units and office initiatives
In 2014, Lacey announced an alternative sentencing program aimed at diverting mentally ill, low-level offenders from jail into treatment. Those who complete the treatment and any court-imposed probation will have their pending criminal charges cleared from their records. The program was designed to reduce jail overcrowding and end a revolving door for offenders with mental illness who find themselves incarcerated for relatively minor crimes. In early 2019, Lacey launched the DA's first mental health division - the first for California and possibly United States - which seeks opportunities to expand treatment and other services for mentally ill inmates in the criminal justice system. The new division works with defendants who have been declared mentally incompetent to stand trial or who are seeking alternative sentences due to their mental illnesses. Jackie Lacey founded and serves as chair of the Criminal Justice Mental Health Project for Los Angeles County, leading a multidisciplinary working group devoted to diverting people who are mentally ill out of the criminal justice system for nonviolent offenses. The project secured $150 million in funding from LA County, ensured the opening of urgent care centers as an alternative to jail for certain arrestees, and helped create a new county office of diversion and re-entry.
In 2014, in partnership with the Rotary Club of Los Angeles, Lacey launched a campaign against scams targeting the elderly, in which volunteers would go to senior centers, nursing homes and other places seniors gather to give presentations about how to recognize and avoid scams, as well as pass out literature to home-bound seniors. Lacey also instituted the DA's bimonthly Fraud Alerts to educate the public about common fraud schemes targeting seniors, including counterfeit drug scams and Medicare rip-offs.
In 2015, Lacey announced the creation of the Conviction Review Unit, dedicated to pursuing the innocence claims of people imprisoned for serious felonies, if new evidence is discovered. When new evidence warrants it, a formal investigation is opened to review details of the case, and the case is presented to the Conviction Review Committee, who will decide whether they doubt the original conviction.
In 2017, Lacey launched the Notario Fraud Unit with the goal of prosecuting those involved in immigration service scams who pose as either attorneys, special agents, or government workers who could expedite the processing of legal documents. Since its inception, the Notario Fraud Unit has prosecuted eight major criminal cases.
Forgiveness of infractions
In April 2019, Lacey announced that Los Angeles County would collaborate with Code for America, a nonprofit tech organization, to identify decades-old court cases to reduce or expunge 50,000 marijuana convictions. The initiative is the result of Proposition 64, a 2016 measure that legalized marijuana possession in the state of California. As part of the measure, voters also approved erasing past marijuana-related convictions and authorizing re-sentencing for eligible offenders.
Additionally, in response to the homeless population being repeatedly ticketed and arrested for minor infractions, DA Jackie Lacey, City Attorney Mike Feuer, and LAPD Chief Michel Moore agreed to “unclog” the court system of more than 300,000 older warrants and citations. The plan, known as the Fugitive Misdemeanant Recovery Program, allows law enforcement and safety officials to focus on dangerous criminals instead of time on minor infractions involving the homeless.
Sexual abuse in the entertainment industry
Following multiple accusations of sexual abuse against high-profile entertainment figures, Lacey created a task force of prosecutors to deal with sexual abuse crimes in the entertainment industry. In January 2020, Lacey charged former film producer Harvey Weinstein with forcible rape, forcible oral copulation, sexual penetration by force, and sexual battery by restraint.
Capital punishment
Even after California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a moratorium on capital punishment in California, Lacey pursued death penalty cases.
2020 election
In June 2020, amid the George Floyd protests for criminal justice reform, Eric Garcetti, the incumbent Mayor of Los Angeles rescinded their prior endorsement of Lacey as Los Angeles County District Attorney, in the lead-up to the 2020 election, where they lost to re-election to George Gascón. Representative Adam Schiff also rescinded their endorsement of Lacey.
Criticism
Refusal to prosecute law enforcement
During their term, Lacey was heavily criticized by Black Lives Matter, the ACLU and others for failing to prosecute a single member of Los Angeles County law enforcement for murder. The criticism increased in March 2018 when Lacey refused to file charges against LAPD officer Clifford Proctor for shooting and killing Brendon Glenn three years earlier, despite LAPD Chief Charlie Beck recommending Lacey prosecute Proctor. In a statement after Lacey declined to file charges against Proctor, the ACLU of Southern California released a statement saying, in part:
Refusal to prosecute Ed Buck
Lacey was heavily criticized for refusing to prosecute Ed Buck, a wealthy Democratic Party donor, following the 2017 drug overdose death of a young Black man named Gemmel Moore in Buck's apartment. At the time, Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies found "nearly two grams of methamphetamine, syringes and drug paraphernalia throughout the residence". Black and LGBTQ community activists and local attorneys called on Lacey to prosecute Buck, and Moore's family "provided authorities with substantial evidence, including the names of several other victims, that Buck engaged in a pattern of drugging, video-taping, and sexually assaulting black men."
Six months after Lacey declined to prosecute Ed Buck for Gemmel Moore's death, another Black man, Timothy Dean, was found dead of a drug overdose in Buck's apartment in January 2019. Activists renewed their calls to Lacey to prosecute Buck, but again they declined. In an October 2019 meeting of the Stonewall Democratic Club, a gay rights organization in Los Angeles, Lacey claimed that Sheriff's deputies' illegal search and seizure of evidence in Buck's residence at the time of Moore's death rendered the evidence inadmissible in court, and therefore "presented a challenge" to their efforts to prosecute. They did not respond to participants' criticism that deputies should not have taken legal advice from a coroner, as Lacey claimed they had.
Ed Buck was arrested in September 2019 following a 911 call by a young Black man who was experiencing an overdose of methamphetamine administered by Buck. The man was taken to a hospital and survived. Lacey's office then charged Buck with "one felony count each of battery causing serious injury, administering methamphetamine and maintaining a drug house."
In spite of Buck's eventual arrest and prosecution, Black and LGBTQ activists in Los Angeles have continued to protest Lacey, their office, and the lengthy delay in charging Buck. In February 2020, the Los Angeles New Frontier Democratic Club, “the oldest and largest African American Democratic club in the state of California”, declined to endorse Lacey's reelection. Rep. Maxine Waters of Los Angeles and California's junior U.S. Senator Kamala Harris, both Black women, endorsed Lacey's opponent, former San Francisco District Attorney George Gascón, in their November 2020 runoff, and Black Lives Matter activists have protested outside Lacey's home in March, June, and July 2020.
Celebrity cases
Lacey has been criticized for not charging Bikram Choudhury criminally: there is a "reluctance of the district attorney to go after powerful men" as described in Netflix's 2019 documentary film, Bikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator, despite numerous women coming forward with allegations of sexual assault and rape. Them office has refused to comment publicly on their lack of action on this matter. Choudhury fled the country after receiving an arrest warrant.
Lacey has similarly been criticized for inaction in the case of four women who report having been raped by actor Danny Masterson.
Campaign contributions from law enforcement unions
In June 2020, a group of high-profile prosecutors from California's most heavily populated counties, lobbied the California State Bar to prohibit District Attorneys from accepting donations from law enforcement unions, citing the possible conflicts of interest with respect to how district attorneys investigate, prosecute, or interact with police officers. Lacey has publicly opposed this proposed prohibition. During the 2020 Los Angeles County District Attorney primary election, law enforcement unions had contributed over 75% of the $2.2 million raised by Lacey. Lacey ultimately won a plurality of votes in the race, given broad financial support from these law enforcement unions, including Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs (ALADS) and Los Angeles Police Protective League (LAPPL).
Personal life
Lacey lives in the Granada Hills neighborhood with their husband, David Lacey. They have two adult children, Kareem and April. Lacey's husband David wielded a gun on March 2, 2020, when protesters came to their home to call for their resignation and knocked on their door. They were subsequently charged with three counts of assault with a firearm by the California Attorney General's Office.

The Peel Engineering Company was a manufacturing company based in Peel on the west coast of the Isle of Man that primarily made fibreglass boats through its subsidiary company West Marine Ltd. and fairings for motorcycles.
Description and history
The sports fairings were recognisable for their styling with integral 'blisters' enclosing the handlebar-ends and rider's hands, and were available for racing, named Mountain Mile, with a similar sports-style for road use incorporating a distinctive, large rectangular Cibié headlamp, named Peel 707. A different design was for touring, aptly named TT Tourer.
The company built an experimental hovercraft design in 1961 powered by a 500 cc Triumph engine.
In 1965, Peels arranged for all fairing production to be transferred under licence to Mike Ivory of Luton, Bedfordshire, England. Prototype and development work continued in the Isle of Man.
Peel Engineering developed the Peel Manxcar concept vehicle, and the Peel P-1000 4 wheeled microcars, and the Peel P50 and Peel Trident 3 wheeled microcars, in addition to the Peel Viking Sport and prototype GRP Minis for BMC. These models constitute the only automobiles manufactured on the Isle of Man; the company ceased manufacture in 1969.
A limited-run Peel Manxkart go-kart was also produced.
The Peel P50 is in the Guinness record as the world's smallest production car.
The Peel Engineering Company referred to in this article later became Peel Engineering Ltd. Originally launched in 1965, it dissolved in 1974 and the brand relaunched in 2010.

For the character on the US TV series The Office, see Charles Miner.
Charles Landon Carter Minor (December 3, 1835 – July 13, 1903) was the first president of the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College (now known as Virginia Tech), Virginia's new land-grant institution. Minor, a native of Hanover County, Virginia, held a master's degree from the University of Virginia and had served as combat and staff officer in the Confederate Army. During the Civil War, Minor served under General Stonewall Jackson and saw action at Manassas and in battles around Richmond.
Prior to their appointment as president of VAMC they taught at Sewanee Episcopal Seminary in Tennessee. Minor had previously spent a year as president of the Maryland Agricultural College (now the University of Maryland) from 1867 to 1868.
Minor opened the doors to the new college on October 1, 1872 with three faculty members, not one of them a professor of agriculture or mechanics. By the end of the first week 29 students were enrolled. By the end of the first year 132 students were enrolled, exceeding expectations. During their presidency, Minor petitioned for, and money was appropriated for the expansion of the campus beyond the one building it had at the time, the Preston and Olin building. Minor also established a library during their term.
During a faculty meeting, the generally easygoing Minor and hot-headed Gen. James H. Lane, the professor of mathematics and foreign languages with responsibility for military training, got into a fistfight. Both were convicted of disorderly conduct. Ultimately, Minor was removed from office due to the erosion of confidence in their administration.
After their dismissal from VAMC, Minor taught at St. Paul's in Baltimore, Maryland., and Episcopal High School in Alexandria, and bought Shenandoah Valley Academy, a military school in Winchester.
Charles Minor was a descendant of Colonial Governor of Virginia, Robert Carter I and a great-grandson of Virginia Governor John Page. They married Frances Ansley Cazenove, of Alexandria, Virginia, in 1860. Together they had two children. They died July 13, 1903, in Albemarle County, Virginia., at age 67.

Latta Malette "LM" Autrey (July 7, 1876 - May 17, 1938) was an American politician who served one term as the 25th mayor of Orlando, Florida from 1926 to 1929. Two of their former homes are now designated as historical landmarks, the Autrey-Williams House in Newton, Texas, built in 1912 and now being restored by David Holmes and the L. M. Autrey House in the Eola Heights Neighborhood of Orlando, Florida.
Early life
Latta was born on July 7, 1876 in Cumberland County, North Carolina, the first of six children born to Alfred Randley (1847-1892) and Elizabeth R. (née Johnson) Autrey (1855-1892). They were likely born in/near Eastover, North Carolina, as that is where they lived in 1880.
Marriage and children
Latta married Leila Brannan on November 1, 1903, in Greene County, Mississippi. They had first met them there. They then decided to live there until around 1908 when the turpentine industry was exhausted. They then moved to Jasper, Texas. They had 7 children in the course of their marriage, Gladys, Lottie Mae, Anna "Annie" Rosa, Latta Malette Jr. (who died at 3 years 9 months), Olive "Ollie", Elizabeth "Bessie", and Walter. The first three were born in Mississippi, and the rest were born in Texas.
Orlando Mayorship
Sometime before 1926, the family moved to Orlando, Florida. There, Latta decided to run for mayor, and won. They assumed duty on January 1, 1926. On January 1, 1929, they were replaced by their predecessor James LeRoy Giles. In 1929, the family moved to Valdosta, Georgia.
Death
Latta died of coronary thrombosis caused by arterial hypertension and atherosclerosis on May 17, 1938, in Jacksonville, Florida. They were 61 years old. They were interred at Sunset Hill Cemetery.

Saïda Hossini (born 1950) is a Moroccan palaeontologist, specialising in frogs of the Pleistocene.
Career
Hossini teaches at the University of Moulay Ismail, Faculté des Sciences in Meknes. They studied for their doctoral research in Paris, researching anuran species of the late oligocene and the miocene in France. Them work in Morocco includes the examination of cave deposits and examined amphibian remains from the Thomas Quarry Site, near Casablanca. Hossini identified for the first time the presence of the genus Baleaphryne for the first time in Africa at the Jebel Irhoud ("Ocre" quarry) site in Morocco. They also investigated the faunal remains at the cave of That El Ghar (Tetuan), exploring palaeoenvironment of North Africa between the pleistocene and the holocene.
New species
In 1993, Hossini was the person to describe a new species of frog, Latonia ragei. Evidence for the species came from the fossil record in three localities: Coderet, Laugnac and 'St Gerand-Le-Puy'. The discovery and identification of a Latonia mandible, led to the classification of this species as new to science. In other examples of ragei, Hossini worked on maxilla surface sculpturing to produce identification.

The Borgias is a British television drama serial produced by the BBC in 1981, in association with the Second Network of the Italian broadcaster RAI. The series, produced by Mark Shivas, was set in Italy during the 15th century and told the story of Rodrigo Borgia (played by Adolfo Celi) – the future Pope Alexander VI – and their family, including their son Cesare (Oliver Cotton) and daughter Lucrezia (Anne Louise Lambert).
The 10 episodes follow events from 1492 when Rodrigo is elected pope and concludes in 1507 with Cesare's violent death.
Reception
Intended to be a gripping historical melodrama in the same vein as the earlier BBC series, I, Claudius, and despite credible locations and excellent cinematography, the series was not a critical success. The BBC screened the series at the same time as ITV's lavish Brideshead Revisited, and critics contrasted the high production values and stellar cast of Brideshead with The Borgias seeming focus on frequent graphic violence and nudity.
The Sicilian-born actor Adolfo Celi, well known to have a heavy Sicilian accent, is said to have had much difficulty enunciating their lines. Their thickly-accented English proved difficult for viewers to follow.
The series was released on DVD in the UK by 2 Entertain in 2016.

"Howlin' at the Moon" is a song written and recorded by Hank Williams. It rose to number 3 on the Hot Country Singles chart in 1951. The song also appeared on the soundtrack on For All Mankind.
Song history
The up-tempo "Howlin' at the Moon" celebrates the giddiness of true love. Lyrically, the song reflects Williams' sense of humor and love of hunting. The title is punctuated by the hound dog yodels of fiddler Jerry Rivers. In their book Hank Williams: The Biography, writer Colin Escott observes, "The performance tears along...It was but a short step from there to rockabilly." Williams recorded the song at Castle Studio in Nashville on March 16, 1951. Williams was backed on the session by members of their Drifting Cowboys band, including: Jerry Rivers (fiddle), Don Helms (steel guitar), Sammy Pruett (electric guitar), Jack Shook (rhythm guitar), Ernie Newton (or "Cedric Rainwater") aka Howard Watts (bass), and either Owen Bradley or producer Fred Rose on piano. The B-side of "Howlin' at the Moon", the ballad "I Can't Help It (If I'm Still in Love with You)", outperformed the A-side on the charts (peaking at number 2).
Williams disciple George Jones recorded this song for their 1960 album George Jones Salutes Hank Williams.

Kanin Point () is a rocky point lying west-southwest of Kelp Point on the south side of Husvik Harbor, in Stromness Bay, South Georgia. The descriptive name "Rocky Point" was given for this feature, probably by Discovery Investigations personnel who surveyed Husvik Harbor in 1928, but this name is used elsewhere in the Antarctic. The South Georgia Survey, 1951–52, reported that this feature is known at the Husvik whaling station as Kanin Point (the word kanin meaning rabbit). The name presumably arose from one of several attempts made since 1872 to introduce rabbits into the island. Kanin Point is approved on the basis of local usage.

Andrew E. Goldsbery (September 25, 1840 – December 27, 1910) was a Union Army soldier during the American Civil War. They received the Medal of Honor for gallantry during the Siege of Vicksburg on May 22, 1863. Their name is sometimes spelled as Goldsbury.
Goldsbery joined the 127th Illinois Infantry in August 1862, and was mustered out in June 1865.
Union assault
On May 22, 1863, General Ulysses S. Grant ordered an assault on the Confederate heights at Vicksburg, Mississippi. The plan called for a storming party of volunteers to build a bridge across a moat and plant scaling ladders against the enemy embankment in advance of the main attack.
The volunteers knew the odds were against survival and the mission was called, in nineteenth century vernacular, a "forlorn hope". Only single men were accepted as volunteers and even then, twice as many men as needed came forward and were turned away. The assault began in the early morning following a naval bombardment.
The Union soldiers came under enemy fire immediately and were pinned down in the ditch they were to cross. Despite repeated attacks by the main Union body, the men of the forlorn hope were unable to retreat until nightfall. Of the 150 men in the storming party, nearly half were killed. Seventy-nine of the survivors were awarded the Medal of Honor.
Medal of Honor citation
For gallantry in the charge of the volunteer storming party on 22 May 1863.

Mostafa Kamal Pourtorab (Persian: مصطفی کمال پورتراب, born 14 September 1924 – 22 June 2016) was an Iranian musician, composer, music teacher and music theorist. They were a member of the founding board and vice-president of the Supreme Council of the Iranian House of Music.
Biography
Mostafa Kamal Pourtrab was born on 14 September 1924 in Tehran. Their father was a Soviet military officer who came to Iran after the October Revolution of 1917 and got married. They were the first child in the family.
Their father was familiar with playing Tar, and since their son was also interested in music, they bought them a Neylabak at an early age. A year later, Mostafa turned Neylabak into a flute, and at the age of nine, they played the flute at a ceremony in Hamedan. In 1940, after finishing primary school, they moved to Tehran with their family and enrolled in the Higher Conservatory of Music to study in high school. In the first test, Mostafa's very sensitive ear caught the attention of the examiners, and they chose the difficult and little-known instrument of the Bassoon as their main instrument. They learned the bassoon from Czech masters who were employed by the conservatory in those years. Mostafa Pourtrab learned the bassoon from Yaroslavliza, the violin from Heshmat Sanjari, and Ataollah Khadem Misagh and the Tar from Moosa Maroufi. They also studied the theory of Iranian music with Ruhollah Khaleghi, and learned group singing from Rubik Grigorian and solfege from Fereydoun Farzaneh and Patma Garian.
In 1940, they worked as the conductor of two orchestras of the General Directorate of Fine Arts. In 1943, Mostafa Pourtrab studied the basics of harmony with Ali Mohammad Khadem Misagh and in 1945, they obtained a diploma from the Higher Conservatory of Music in the field of theory and harmony. After graduating, Portrab worked for a time as a teacher of music in schools and then as a teacher of solfege and music theory in elementary and high school music conservatories. In 1951, at the suggestion of Pourtrab, the field of composition was established in the Higher Conservatory of Music and they were one of the first students in the field of composition. Portrab was able to complete their studies in this field after 9 years. Their dissertation was their first serious piece in the form of a symphony.
After teaching harmony for a while and then teaching composition at the conservatory, they were assigned to teach. In 1966, using a French government scholarship, they went to Paris to continue their studies and studied further in the field of counterpoint and harmony. They also enrolled in musicology at the Sorbonne and used the teachings of Nadia Boulanger. After returning to Iran, they used the experiences of Thomas Christian David in composing for about four years.
They became the director of Iran Conservatory of Music between 1971 and 1973. In 1977, the Board of Art Review and Evaluation of the teachers of the Higher Conservatory awarded them the title of professor.
They also educated many students in higher and national conservatories, the Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Tehran, the University of Arts, the Islamic Azad University, and the universities of applied sciences. They were also a member of several specialized music councils in the former Ministry of Culture and Arts, the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, the Academy of Languages, the Iranian Institute of Musicological Research, the Younes Musical Association and several other international associations and institutes, as well as the director of music conservatories. In 2008, they were selected as a permanent figure in Iranian music.

Martin Raymond Peake, 2nd Viscount Ingleby (31 May 1926 – 14 October 2008) was a British peer and business person.
Early life
Ingleby was the only son of Osbert Peake, created Viscount Ingleby in 1956, and their wife Lady Joan Capell. They succeeded to the viscountcy on their father's death in 1966.
They were rendered a paraplegic early in life due to polio. They were educated at Eton and Trinity College, Oxford, and prior to their disability, was a lieutenant in the Coldstream Guards from 1945 to 1947. In 1955, they were called to the bar at the Inner Temple.
Marriage & children
Ingleby married Gladys Susan Landale (died 1996) in 1952, by whom they had five children:
Hon Richard Martin Herbert Peake (born 7 August 1953, died 19 July 1975)
Hon Fiona Catherine Peake (born 24 January 1955)
Hon Sarah Rachel Peake (born 27 November 1958)
Hon Henrietta Cecilia Imogen Peake (born 23 October 1961)
Hon Katharine Susan Emma Peake (born 23 December 1963)
In 1975, Ingleby suffered a personal tragedy when their only son, Richard, fell from Beachy Head and was killed. The coroner's inquest recorded an open verdict.
After the death of their first wife in 1996, Ingleby married Dobrila Radovic in 2003. They had no children. As Ingleby's only son predeceased him, the viscountcy became extinct on their own death in 2008.
Later life
A director of the Hargreaves Group from 1960 to 1980, Ingleby was also interested in forestry and conservation. They were a member of the planning committee for the North York Moors National Park, and was responsible for the planting of a row of lime trees at the entrance to the park, which they intended as a thanksgiving for God's deliverance of Britain during the two World Wars. They also served on the North Yorkshire County Council during the 1960s.
Ingleby and Baroness Masham, who also uses a wheelchair, took a prominent part in the House of Lords in the debate on the Disabled Persons Act 1970.

The plain-breasted piculet (Picumnus castelnau) is a species of bird in the woodpecker family. It is found in the Ucayali and Amazon floodplains in eastern Peru. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and heavily degraded former forest.
Description
A small bird with a short tail, the plain-breasted piculet typically grows to a length of . It is mostly grey on the face and its nape and upper neck are finely barred in an olive green color. Its mantle and back are an olive, brown or grey color with slight pale barring and a light yellowish-brown, or buff, tinge. The wings are a darker shade of brown. The upper side of its tail is brown with a pair of white feathers in the center. Its underparts are a pale buff or white.
The sexes differ slightly in that the male has a black crown speckled with red and orange and the female has a plain black crown. Both sexes have chestnut irises, pinkish-buff orbital rings, greyish legs and a greyish beak with the upper mandible appearing somewhat darker than the lower one. The bird's song is a descending series of high-pitched notes "Tree'e'e'e'e'e'e."
Distribution and habitat
The species is endemic to South America on the eastern side of the Andes where it lives in the western part of the Amazon basin. The species is present in southern Colombia, eastern Ecuador, Peru and western Brazil at altitudes of up to . It is found in open parts of humid lowland forests, flooded forests, riverside corridors, swamps, thickets and groves, and logged areas with secondary growth and wooded pastures. It often occurs in areas of young Cecropia and Mimosa trees.
Ecology
The plain-breasted piculet is usually seen by itself or in pairs, but it will occasionally join small flocks of birds of mixed species. It forages inconspicuously in mid-to-low canopies and may be detected from the pecking sounds it makes while foraging. Its diet is unknown. It probably breeds between May and July.
Status
P. castelnau is fairly common over most of its range, and common on certain islands in the Amazon. Although there is a decline in the quantity and quality of its rainforest habitats, it is a fairly adaptable species and has moved into secondary growth forest, degraded forest and even wooded farmland and gardens. The total population is thought to be steady and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of "the least concern."

Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Extra memory, usually a stack, is needed to keep track of the nodes discovered so far along a specified branch which helps in backtracking of the graph.
A version of depth-first search was investigated in the 19th century by French mathematician Charles Pierre Trémaux as a strategy for solving mazes.
Properties
The time and space analysis of DFS differs according to its application area. In theoretical computer science, DFS is typically used to traverse an entire graph, and takes time where is the number of vertices and the number of edges. This is linear in the size of the graph. In these applications it also uses space in the worst case to store the stack of vertices on the current search path as well as the set of already-visited vertices. Thus, in this setting, the time and space bounds are the same as for breadth-first search and the choice of which of these two algorithms to use depends less on their complexity and more on the different properties of the vertex orderings the two algorithms produce.
For applications of DFS in relation to specific domains, such as searching for solutions in artificial intelligence or web-crawling, the graph to be traversed is often either too large to visit in its entirety or infinite (DFS may suffer from non-termination). In such cases, search is only performed to a limited depth; due to limited resources, such as memory or disk space, one typically does not use data structures to keep track of the set of all previously visited vertices. When search is performed to a limited depth, the time is still linear in terms of the number of expanded vertices and edges (although this number is not the same as the size of the entire graph because some vertices may be searched more than once and others not at all) but the space complexity of this variant of DFS is only proportional to the depth limit, and as a result, is much smaller than the space needed for searching to the same depth using breadth-first search. For such applications, DFS also lends itself much better to heuristic methods for choosing a likely-looking branch. When an appropriate depth limit is not known a priori, iterative deepening depth-first search applies DFS repeatedly with a sequence of increasing limits. In the artificial intelligence mode of analysis, with a branching factor greater than one, iterative deepening increases the running time by only a constant factor over the case in which the correct depth limit is known due to the geometric growth of the number of nodes per level.
DFS may also be used to collect a sample of graph nodes. However, incomplete DFS, similarly to incomplete BFS, is biased towards nodes of high degree.
Example
For the following graph:
a depth-first search starting at the node A, assuming that the left edges in the shown graph are chosen before right edges, and assuming the search remembers previously visited nodes and will not repeat them (since this is a small graph), will visit the nodes in the following order: A, B, D, F, E, C, G. The edges traversed in this search form a Trémaux tree, a structure with important applications in graph theory.
Performing the same search without remembering previously visited nodes results in visiting the nodes in the order A, B, D, F, E, A, B, D, F, E, etc. forever, caught in the A, B, D, F, E cycle and never reaching C or G.
Iterative deepening is one technique to avoid this infinite loop and would reach all nodes.
Output of a depth-first search
The result of a depth-first search of a graph can be conveniently described in terms of a spanning tree of the vertices reached during the search. Based on this spanning tree, the edges of the original graph can be divided into three classes: forward edges, which point from a node of the tree to one of its descendants, back edges, which point from a node to one of its ancestors, and cross edges, which do neither. Sometimes tree edges, edges which belong to the spanning tree itself, are classified separately from forward edges. If the original graph is undirected then all of its edges are tree edges or back edges.
Vertex orderings
It is also possible to use depth-first search to linearly order the vertices of a graph or tree. There are four possible ways of doing this:
A preordering is a list of the vertices in the order that they were first visited by the depth-first search algorithm. This is a compact and natural way of describing the progress of the search, as was done earlier in this article. A preordering of an expression tree is the expression in Polish notation.
A postordering is a list of the vertices in the order that they were last visited by the algorithm. A postordering of an expression tree is the expression in reverse Polish notation.
A reverse preordering is the reverse of a preordering, i.e. a list of the vertices in the opposite order of their first visit. Reverse preordering is not the same as postordering.
A reverse postordering is the reverse of a postordering, i.e. a list of the vertices in the opposite order of their last visit. Reverse postordering is not the same as preordering.
For binary trees there is additionally in-ordering and reverse in-ordering.
For example, when searching the directed graph below beginning at node A, the sequence of traversals is either A B D B A C A or A C D C A B A (choosing to first visit B or C from A is up to the algorithm). Note that repeat visits in the form of backtracking to a node, to check if it has still unvisited neighbors, are included here (even if it is found to have none). Thus the possible preorderings are A B D C and A C D B, while the possible postorderings are D B C A and D C B A, and the possible reverse postorderings are A C B D and A B C D.
Reverse postordering produces a topological sorting of any directed acyclic graph. This ordering is also useful in control-flow analysis as it often represents a natural linearization of the control flows. The graph above might represent the flow of control in the code fragment below, and it is natural to consider this code in the order A B C D or A C B D but not natural to use the order A B D C or A C D B.
if (A) then {
B
} else {
C
}
D
Pseudocode
Input:
Output:
A recursive implementation of DFS:
procedure DFS(G, v) is
label v as discovered
for all directed edges from v to w that are in G.adjacentEdges(v) do
if vertex w is not labeled as discovered as
recursively call DFS(G, w)
A non-recursive implementation of DFS with worst-case space complexity , with the possibility of duplicate vertices on the stack:
procedure DFS_iterative(G, v) is
let S be a stack
S.push(v)
while S is not empty do
v = S.pop()
if v is not labeled as discovered as
label v as discovered
for all edges from v to w in G.adjacentEdges(v) do
S.push(w)
These two variations of DFS visit the neighbors of each vertex in the opposite order from each other: the first neighbor of v visited by the recursive variation is the first one in the list of adjacent edges, while in the iterative variation the first visited neighbor is the last one in the list of adjacent edges. The recursive implementation will visit the nodes from the example graph in the following order: A, B, D, F, E, C, G. The non-recursive implementation will visit the nodes as: A, E, F, B, D, C, G.
The non-recursive implementation is similar to breadth-first search but differs from it in two ways:
it uses a stack instead of a queue, and
it delays checking whether a vertex has been discovered until the vertex is popped from the stack rather than making this check before adding the vertex.
If is a tree, replacing the queue of the breadth-first search algorithm with a stack will yield a depth-first search algorithm. For general graphs, replacing the stack of the iterative depth-first search implementation with a queue would also produce a breadth-first search algorithm, although a somewhat nonstandard one.
Another possible implementation of iterative depth-first search uses a stack of iterators of the list of neighbors of a node, instead of a stack of nodes. This yields the same traversal as recursive DFS.
procedure DFS_iterative(G, v) is
let S be a stack
S.push(iterator of G.adjacentEdges(v))
while S is not empty do
if S.peek().hasNext() then
w = S.peek().next()
if w is not labeled as discovered as
label w as discovered
S.push(iterator of G.adjacentEdges(w))
else
S.pop()
Applications
Algorithms that use depth-first search as a building block include:
Finding connected components.
Topological sorting.
Finding 2-(edge or vertex)-connected components.
Finding 3-(edge or vertex)-connected components.
Finding the bridges of a graph.
Generating words in order to plot the limit set of a group.
Finding strongly connected components.
Determining whether a species is closer to one species or another in a phylogenetic tree.
Planarity testing.
Solving puzzles with only one solution, such as mazes. (DFS can be adapted to find all solutions to a maze by only including nodes on the current path in the visited set.)
Maze generation may use a randomized DFS.
Finding biconnectivity in graphs.
Succession to the throne shared by the Commonwealth realms.
Complexity
The computational complexity of DFS was investigated by John Reif. More precisely, given a graph , let be the ordering computed by the standard recursive DFS algorithm. This ordering is called the lexicographic depth-first search ordering. John Reif considered the complexity of computing the lexicographic depth-first search ordering, given a graph and a source. A decision version of the problem (testing whether some vertex occurs before some vertex in this order) is P-complete, meaning that it is "a nightmare for parallel processing".
A depth-first search ordering (not necessarily the lexicographic one), can be computed by a randomized parallel algorithm in the complexity class RNC. As of 1997, it remained unknown whether a depth-first traversal could be constructed by a deterministic parallel algorithm, in the complexity class NC.

Samuel Ritter Peters (August 16, 1842 – April 21, 1910) was a U.S. Representative from Kansas.
Born in Walnut Township, near Circleville, Ohio, Peters attended the common schools and the Ohio Wesleyan University at Delaware. Enlisted in the Union Army as a private in Company E, Seventy-third Regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry, in October 1861 and was mustered out in June 1865, having held successively the ranks of sergeant, second lieutenant, first lieutenant, and captain. They were graduated in law from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor in 1867. They were admitted to the bar the same year and commenced practice in Memphis, Missouri. They were editor of the Memphis Reveille from 1868 to 1873. They served as delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1872. They served as mayor of Memphis in 1873. They moved to Marion, Kansas, in 1873 and resumed the practice of law.
Peters was elected a member of the Kansas State Senate in 1874 and served until their resignation in March 1875. They were appointed and subsequently elected judge of the ninth judicial district and served from 1875 until 1883, when they resigned. They moved to Newton, Kansas, in 1876.
Peters was elected as a Republican to the Forty-eighth and to the three succeeding Congresses (March 4, 1883 – March 3, 1891). They were not a candidate for renomination in 1890. They resumed the practice of law in Newton. They served as member of the board of managers of the State reformatory 1895-1899. Postmaster of Newton 1898-1910. They were editor of the Newton Daily Kansas-Republican in 1899. They died in Newton, Kansas on April 21, 1910. They were interred in Greenwood Cemetery.

Mount Derock or Deraak (also known as Kuh-eh Barfee or Mother Mount) is a sedimentary rock mountain in Shiraz, Fars, in the Middle East region in Iran. It is located west and northwest of Shiraz, Fars. It is called mother mountain because its shape resembles a pregnant woman lying and the name mountain refers to it usually being white-capped in winter, meaning snow in Persian. The mountain's highest peak is around Shiraz and it is a part of the Zagros Mountains. It is well-known for its sunsets and as the hub for TV and radio telecommunication masts.
Geologically, Shiraz is a syncline valley city (NW–SE elongated) that formed between the Baba Kohi and Derak anticlines.

A language game (also called a cant, secret language, ludling, or argot) is a system of manipulating spoken words to render them incomprehensible to the untrained ear. Language games are used primarily by groups attempting to conceal their conversations from others. Some common examples are Pig Latin; the Gibberish family, prevalent in the United States and Sweden; and Verlan, spoken in France.
A common difficulty with language games is that they are usually passed down orally; while written translations can be made, they are often imperfect, and thus spelling can vary widely.
Some factions argue that words in these spoken tongues should simply be written the way they are pronounced, while others insist that the purity of language demands that the transformation remain visible when the words are imparted to paper.
Use
Some language games such as Pig Latin are so widely known that privacy is virtually impossible, as most people have a passable understanding of how it works and the words can sound very similar to their English counterpart. Although language games are not usually used in everyday conversation, some words from language games have made their way into normal speech, such as ixnay in English (from Pig Latin), and loufoque in French (from Louchébem).
Classification
One way in which language games could be organized is by language. For example, Pig Latin, Ubbi Dubbi, and Tutnese could all be in the "English" category, and Jeringonza could be in the "Spanish", ("Portuguese", or "Italian") category.
An alternate method of classifying language games is by their function. For example, Ubbi Dubbi, Bicycle, and all work by inserting a code syllable before the vowel in each syllable. Therefore, these could be classified in the Gibberish family. Also, Double Talk, Língua do Pê, Jeringonza, and B-Sprache all work by adding a consonant after the vowel in each syllable, and then repeating the vowel. Thus, these could be classified in the Double Talk family. Another common type of language game is the spoonerism, in which the onsets of two words are exchanged. Using a standard word for each transformation gives another type, for example, the Finnish "kontinkieli", where kontti is added after each word, and spoonerism applied (kondäntti koonerismspontti koppliedäntti).
List of common language games
Additionally, Auflinger described some types of speech disguise in some languages near the city of Madang in Papua New Guinea.

Victoria Upper Glacier () is a glacier occupying the upper northwest end of Victoria Valley in Antarctica. It is a retreating glacier. The Victoria Valley is the northernmost of the McMurdo Dry Valleys. Melt water from the glacier feeds the Victoria River and on from there to Lake Vida. It was named by the Victoria University Wellington Antarctic Expedition (1958–59) for their Alma Mater, which sponsored the expedition. In 2003, it was renamed from Upper Victoria Glacier to be consistent with Victoria Lower Glacier.
Heaphy Spur divides the head of Victoria Upper Glacier.

Leave Society is a 2021 novel by Tao Lin. It is their fourth novel, and tenth book overall.
Cover
The cover, by Linda Huang, features what are described in the novel as "microfireflies" or "dustwinkling."
Summary
Leave Society is in four parts, and is about a character named Li who is based on the author. The New York Times summarized the book as such: "Li has left behind speed, despair and their belief in Western medicine. (He refuses steroid shots for their back pain.) But what they are really recovering from is existentialism, the idea that life has no meaning other than what we give it. They now believe that the world has an inherent purpose. To get closer to its “mystery,” and to feel less grumpy, they drop a lot of LSD and eats even more cannabis."
Release and reception
Leave Society received rave reviews before its publication. In Spike Art Magazine, Dean Kissick wrote, "Rather than retreating into ourselves and our emotional subjectivity, which is the dominant approach in autofiction, social media, and the general contemporary condition, Lin writes to destroy the ego, to escape the atomisation of modern man and the feelings of despair, that life is meaninglessness and/or hopeless." In Washington Examiner on July 22, Alex Perez wrote, "It will probably be ignored or misunderstood by the ideology-poisoned commentariat that rules over the society Li is trying to leave. It was up to Lin, a writer who for so long seemed completely disconnected from their humanity, to write the most deeply human book of the year." However, Publishers Weekly wrote: "Much of the action and descriptions are banal, and aside from the romance, this feels a bit too detached and devoid of emotion for a book ostensibly about learning to live. Lin's fans might appreciate this, but it doesn't offer anything new."
On the book's release date, in The New York Times Book Review, Christine Smallwood wrote of the main character, "Li has left behind speed, despair and their belief in Western medicine. (He refuses steroid shots for their back pain.) But what they are really recovering from is existentialism, the idea that life has no meaning other than what we give it. They now believe that the world has an inherent purpose ... Stylistically, the book is artful, even radical ... Despite, or perhaps because of, its virtues, the novel doesn't hold the reader in its thrall. It meanders, linking scenes of low-key bickering in a gentle ebb and flow of harmony and disharmony. It doesn't seem to mind if you put it down ... But the novel has a vision, however cracked, an idea connected to its form, which is more than I can say for most books."
Mixed and negative reviews followed, including ones in Bookforum and The New Yorker, where Andrea Long Chu wrote:The first sentence of almost every chapter contains at least one number, often several, like a medical record: "Thirty tabs of LSD arrived on day thirty-five." This kind of prose can be elegant; it can also feel like dieting ... But it's most interesting to consider the book's flat affect as a curious, sidewise effect of Li's linguistic relationship to their parents ... There is a translated quality to this kind of writing, as if Lin were rendering Mandarin word for word; in fact, given Li's propensity for audio recordings, this is likely exactly what happened ... the effect he's created is a kind of fastidious plotlessness, one whose accuracy to life, affected or not, has the ambivalent virtue of being, like life itself, mostly boring.
In a long review in the Los Angeles Review of Books, Lamorna Ash wrote: Lin introduces a radical shift in outlook, a change from a posture of boredom to one of awe [...] The final sentence of Leave Society—"Li took a leaf"—echoes an earlier scene in which Li offers a leaf to their brother's son. "What is it?" their nephew asks. "A leaf," Li tells him. "It's just a tiny leaf." Literally, just a leaf, something that provokes awe by being nothing more than what it is. On my first reading of Leave Society, I did not know what, if anything, to make of the homophone "leaf" and "leave." On the second reading, when I was better accustomed to Lin's humor and their delight in multiplicity, it seemed to me both metaphorical and literal, playful and quite serious, a brilliant, almost perfect ending.

Lionello Manfredonia (; born 27 November 1956 in Rome) is an Italian former footballer who played as a defender or midfielder.  They are currently the leader of the youth sector at Brescia.
Club career
During their club career, Manfredonia played for Italian sides Lazio (1975–85), Juventus (1985–87) and Roma (1987–89), totalling 289 appearances and 15 goals in Serie A. Along with their Lazio teammates, they were found guilty of being involved in the Totonero 1980 match-fixing scandal, and was banned for three years, while Lazio were relegated to Serie B. During their final season with Roma, on 30 December 1989, in an away match against Bologna, played at freezing temperatures (-5 degrees), Manfredonia collapsed after suffering a heart attack; their former Lazio teammate Bruno Giordano was the first to aid him. Although Manfredonia later managed a full recovery, they subsequently retired from football at the age of 33.
International career
Manfredonia also played four times for the Italy national football team between 1977 and 1978, making their senior international debut in a 3–0 win over Luxembourg on 3 December 1977. They were a member of the 1978 FIFA World Cup squad that managed a fourth-place finish in the tournament.
Style of play
An athletic, tenacious, versatile, and hard-working player, with good technique, Manfredonia usually played as a defender, either as a sweeper, or as a man-marking centre-back (stopper); they were also capable of playing as a ball-winner in midfield, functioning as a central or defensive midfielder, or even on the left, on occasion.

611 Place is a 42-story, skyscraper at 611 West 6th Street in Downtown Los Angeles, California, designed by William L. Pereira & Associates and completed in 1969. The building was commissioned by the now-defunct Crocker Citizen's Bank, and served as its Southern California headquarters until 1983, when it moved to Crocker Center, now Wells Fargo Center (Los Angeles). It was subsequently bought by AT&T. It was the tallest building in Los Angeles upon completion, and the first building to surpass Los Angeles City Hall in terms of structural height (many buildings had surpassed City Hall with decorative spires, the first being Richfield Tower). It consists of a cross-shaped tower clad in vertical aluminum beams, and supported on its west side by an immense, blank slab of concrete running the entire height of the building, which houses elevator and utility shafts and is used to display corporate logos. The building features a number of Pereira's design trademarks, including cleft vertical columns, grid patterned ceilings, and architectural lanterns fitted to the exterior.
The building has appeared in several movies:
Mr. Mom (1983), where it appeared as the location of the Richardson Advertising Agency.
Con Air (1997), the building be seen from an aerial view and street view as a dead body falls from an aircraft and lands on a car near the base of the building in the city of Fresno, California.
Epicenter (2000), This building is destroyed by an earthquake in this movie.
The Day After Tomorrow (2004), where it appeared in shots of Manhattan.
Along Came Polly (2004), where it was the starting point of an ill-fated BASE jump.
The morning show(2019 - 1st season, 2021 - 2nd season), where 611 place is shown as UBA's headquarters.

Teluk Bintuni Regency (or Bintuni Bay Regency) is a regency of West Papua Province of Indonesia. It covers an area of 18,637 km2, comprising administrative districts on three sides of Bintuni Bay, a gulf that separates the Bird's Head Peninsula and Bomberai Peninsula which together form the main geographical constituents of the province; it had a population of 52,422 at the 2010 Census and 87,083 at the 2020 Census. The administrative centre is the town of Bintuni.
Geography
The Bintuni Bay area is one of the new expansion districts in the province West Papua which was ratified by the Plenary Session of the Indonesian House of Representatives on November 12, 2002. Located between the southern coast of Bird's Head and Onin Peninsula coast, overlooking the Seram Sea off the west coast of West Papua. Adjacent to the narrow neck of the mountain that connects the Bird's Head with other regions in West Papua Province. Geographically the area of ​​Bintuni Bay Regency is between 1°57'50"LS - 3°11'26"LS and 1.9.32°44'59" - 134°14'49"E and is located between Bird's Head south coast and Onin Peninsula north coast overlooking the Seram sea off the west coast of Papua. Administratively, the Bintuni Bay Regency is bordered by:
To the north, it is bordered by Manokwari Regency (Senopi District and Kebar District) and Arfak Mountains Regency (Testega District and Didohu District);
In the west, it is bordered by South Sorong Regency (Kokoda District, North Kokoda District and Kais District) and Maybrat Regency (South Aifat District and East Aifat District);
To the south, it is bordered by Kaimana Regency (Teluk Arguni District) and Fakfak Regency (Bomberay District);
To the east, it is bordered by Teluk Wondama Regency (Kuri Wamesa District, Windesi District, Nikiwar District and Wamesi District) and South Manokwari Regency (Tahota District and Dataran Isim District).
Administrative districts
The regency comprises twenty-four districts (kecamatan), tabulated below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and the 2020 Census. The table also includes the locations of the district centres, the number of administrative villages (desa and kelurahan, 117 in total) in each district and the post code. The first six districts listed below form the northeast part of the Bomberai Peninsula; Wamesa District is situated to the northeast of Bintuni Bay; and the remaining 17 districts lie in the southeast part of the Bird's Head Peninsula.

The BTEC First Diploma is a vocational qualification taken in England and Wales and Northern Ireland by young people aged 14 and over and by adults. The qualification is organised and awarded by the Edexcel Foundation within the BTEC brand.
Qualification Overview
The BTEC First Diploma is a vocational qualification at Level 2. It is the equivalent of 4 GCSE grades A*-C.
The course is available from Edexcel and is in many different subjects. This qualification is mainly studied at further education colleges. The course is designed to give students a good grounding to progress onto the BTEC Subsidiary Diploma / BTEC Diploma / BTEC Extended Diploma in a related subject.
As BTEC stands for Business & Technology Education Council, the best known subjects for the Diplomas are business and Information Technology.
The course is assessed in units of which 11-13 consist in total. Students are graded on their understanding of the unit by the grading of either a pass, merit or distinction (the highest achievable). Students who wish to progress onto a BTEC Subsidiary Diploma / BTEC Diploma / BTEC Extended Diploma will usually need to attain merit grades or above in order to meet the entry requirements, however, this can vary depending on the college.
Level
The First Diploma is regarded as equivalent in level to the GCSE. However some students who may have three grade Cs could progress onto a degree in a university providing that they have gained a distinction or a merit profile. Most Universities will require a Level 3 qualification such as BTEC Subsidiary Diploma / BTEC Diploma / BTEC Extended Diploma so it would be advisable to contact each University first.
The usual entry requirements consist of a mix of GCSE subject passes at grades D-G or better. Equivalent entry qualifications are also commonly accepted, including an appropriate BTEC Introductory Diploma with a merit grade or higher.

Geography
Inokashira Park encompasses Inokashira pond in its center. Inokashira Pond is a long, narrow pond, stretching from northwest to southeast, and split into two branches at the northwest end. From the southeast end, the Kanda River flows outward. A section of the stream is also within the bounds of the park. On the west side of the park is a thicket, in Gotenyama, and a small zoo. On the other side of Kichijoji Ave. is the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Bureau of Construction. On the southern side of the thicket, the Tamagawa Aqueduct flows toward the southeast, and further south is the “western park” area. Beside the downstream section of the Tamagawa Aqueduct is there is an “Eastern Garden,” which includes a small open area.
With regard to city boundaries, the Inokashira Pond section of the Kanda River in the park, Inokashira-kōen Station, and the West and East gardens are in Mitaka. The area of the park beginning just past the northern shore of Inokashira Pond is in Musashino. Near the park, less than 500 meters from Inokashira Pond is Kichijōji station, on the JR Chuo Line. Kichijōji Station has a on its south side, facing toward the park. The path from the station toward the pond is lined with shops aimed at young people. In the southeast of the park is Inokashira-kōen Station, on the Keio Inokashira Line, which runs parallel to the Kanda River. The distance from the station to the pond is very short, and there are small paths and open spaces between them which visitors can wander through. It is said that, if you ride the boats on Inokashira Park's pond with a girlfriend, you will surely break up soon.
Nature and the seasons
Spring in Inokashira Park is the season of the blooming cherry trees that line the pond. Looking from the Nanai Bridge, which crosses the pond near the center, the branches of the cherry trees extending from the shore bloom so densely as to all but cover the surface of the pond. The pale color of the blossoms contrasts with the sky and water's surface. During the blooming period of cherry blossoms the park receives many visitors. In addition, on the west side of the park there are many flowers to be seen in the flowering plum grove before the blooming period of the cherry trees. On the north side of the plum grove, on the edge of the pond, there is a spring, but its flow is nowadays weak.
In summer one can enjoy the green of the trees that cover Gotenyama. In autumn the leaves of the many kinds of trees in the park change color, and the fallen leaves bury the walking paths. Winter in Inokashira Park is also lively. Many migrating birds come, and Inokashira Pond becomes their wintering place. Wild snakes can also be seen within the park.
Attractions
The park contains a small temple dedicated to Benzaiten. The park has a petting zoo and a small aquarium, and is a place where vendors, musicians, artists and street performers gather. The park is bustling with crowds who arrive to take in the lively environment on weekends and holidays, especially during the cherry blossom season when the entire park is overrun with visitors for hanami.
On the southwest end of Inokashira Park is the Ghibli Museum, a popular destination dedicated to the animated productions of Studio Ghibli.
Main Events
As of 2010, the main annual events held at Inokashira Park are as follows.
Kichijoji Music Festival – Park Concert (beginning in April every year). A Golden Week event. Acts such as brass bands and chorus groups perform.
Kichijouji Anime Wonderland （held annually in October during consecutive holidays.）
. On an outdoor stage, the singers of anime songs and voice actors perform concerts and talk shows.
. A screen is set up on the outdoor stage, and anime is shown. Shown from evening until night of the Saturday of the festival.
. Sales booths. Various anime goods are sold beside the outdoor stage.

Andrew Jaspan (born 20 April 1952) is a British-Australian journalist and the co-founder of The Conversation. They were previously editor-in-chief of The Age, editor of The Observer, The Sunday Times, Scotland on Sunday, The Scotsman, and Sunday Herald, and publisher and managing editor of The Big Issue London.
Early life and education
Jaspan was born in Manchester, in a Jewish family, and lived in Australia between the ages of seven and fourteen. They completed their Bachelor of Arts in Politics, Modern History and Philosophy from the University of Manchester. They did their thesis on "The Role of the BBC in UK politics".
Career
After graduating, Jaspan launched The New Manchester Review magazine which focussed on news, investigations and arts and culture. To help fund the magazine, Jaspan ran Monday night concerts at the Band on the Wall pub between 1977–9, showcasing punk bands (including Joy Division, The Buzzcocks, and The Fall) as well as poets (including John Cooper Clark and Adrian Henri). They then started work in the Manchester office of The Daily Telegraph and Daily Mirror in 1980.
In 1983, they moved to London to join The Times, first working on the foreign news desk and then the home news desk. In 1985 they joined The Sunday Times as an assistant editor. In 1988 the paper's editor, Andrew Neil, asked them to move to Glasgow and launch a Scotland edition of The Sunday Times as a competitor to the newly launched Scotland on Sunday by The Scotsman Publications. A year later, they moved instead to be editor of Scotland on Sunday, relaunching it as a quality newspaper which went on to establish a reputation for investigative and campaigning journalism.
In 1993 they were appointed editor of The Scotsman but six months later was appointed by the Guardian Media Group as editor of The Observer. In 1996 they were appointed publisher of The Big Issue, the street paper sold by homeless people. The Founder, John Bird, asked Jaspan to improve the quality and mainstream credibility of the magazine.
In 1998 they joined Scottish Media Group in Glasgow to prepare the business case for the launch of a new paper in 1999, The Sunday Herald. Under their editorship the paper won numerous awards including Scottish Newspaper of the Year and UK Sunday Newspaper of the Year. The paper closed in 2018.
In 2004, Jaspan was appointed editor-in-chief of The Age and The Sunday Age. In 2007, The Age won the Pacific region's Newspaper of the Year award for the first time. In August 2008, Jaspan left their position as part of a major restructuring of Fairfax that included 550 job losses across its Australian operations. Jaspan was replaced as editor-in-chief by Paul Ramadge in September 2008.
Jaspan has positioned themselves against those who want to boycott Israel.
The Conversation
Jaspan first discussed the concept of The Conversation in 2009 with Glyn Davis, vice-chancellor at the University of Melbourne. Jaspan wrote a report for Davis on the university's engagement with the public, envisioning the university as "a giant newsroom", with academics and researchers collaboratively providing expert, informed content that engaged with the news cycle and major current affairs issues. This vision became the blueprint for The Conversation. The model they developed is highly unusual for a news site: content is written by academics working in collaboration with professional editors, published open access under a Creative Commons licence, and is funded by collaborative frameworks for academic institutions The concept was as a response to what Jaspan described at the time as "increasing market failure in delivering trusted content" and declining editorial diversity in Australia. The website launched in Australia in early 2011 after three years of development.
Jaspan took The Conversation to the UK where they raised the launch funds and established a base at City University London with the support of the VC, Sir Paul Curran, and Jonathan Hyams. It launched in 2013.
They then took the concept to the US where Thomas Fiedler, then dean of the School of Communications at Boston University, offered to host The Conversation U.S. and provide space for the first newsroom. With a university base established, Jaspan was able to raise the $2.3m launch funding and launched in 2014, initially led by Jaspan as U.S. CEO, Margaret Drain as editor, and Bruce Wilson leading development and university relations. For the U.S. pilot Jaspan secured support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, and four other foundations.
Jaspan then helped set up the other sites in Africa and France in 2015, Canada in 2017, Indonesia in 2017, and Spain in 2018.
360info
Jaspan left The Conversation in April 2018, with professional friction cited as a contributing factor, to work on establishing a new media platform called 360info. The project was initially a partnership between universities of Deakin, Melbourne, RMIT and Western Sydney. From 2017-2020 they were based in RMIT's School of Media and Communication, then moved to Monash University, which became the host university for the project. In November 2021 it launched as 360info. Instead of a focus on breaking news, 360info reports on the worlds' most pressing challenges and offers research-driven solutions. Six months from launch it has published over 300 articles from 190 universities worldwide and is distributed by over 1,200 publishers. It has editors working in Delhi, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Osaka, and Melbourne.
Awards and recognition
In the 2020 Queen's Birthday Honours, Jaspan was made a Member in the General Division of the Order of Australia for "significant service to the print and digital media, and to tertiary education".

Games For Heroes is a non-profit organization that sends hand-held video games to United States troops currently serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.
History
In March 2008, Games for Heroes founders Peter Gallagher and Jack Wilson organized a community service project called Cheer up the Troops. For one week, Peter and Jack, then 15, helped elementary school children write over 1,000 letters and drawings to send to US troops stationed overseas. This project inspired them to put video game collection boxes in their school, fire stations, and churches in their Westchester County, New York neighborhood.
In addition to video game systems, the organization also actively collects games for systems and batteries. As of mid-2010, the organization has distributed more than $100,000 in goods.

Oregon Ballot Measure 58 was an initiated state statute ballot measure sponsored by Bill Sizemore that appeared on the November 4, 2008 general election ballot in Oregon. It was rejected by voters.
The initiative would have required "English immersion" in Oregon's public schools. "English immersion" wasn't defined in the measure, and there is no academic consensus as to what it means.
Newspaper Endorsements
Here is how Oregon's major newspapers endorsed on the measure:
No Oregon newspapers have endorsed a yes vote on Measure 58.
Specific provisions
The measure would limit the use of foreign language instruction in public schools to:
1 year for students in kindergarten to 4th grade.
1.5 years for 5th grade through 8th grade.
2 years for high school students.
It would also prohibit ESL (English as a Second Language) teaching programs for longer than the mandated time.
Estimated fiscal impact
The state's Financial Estimate Committee prepares estimated fiscal impact statements for any ballot measures that will appear on the ballot. The estimate prepared by this committee for Measure 58 says:
The measure will require additional local school spending of between $203 and $253 million in each of the first two years, based on considerations of what it would cost to bring students who currently speak a foreign language up to federal standards.
The more conservative estimate offered by the Financial Estimate Committee is based on the experience in Arizona with a similar measure.
Chief petitioner Bill Sizemore disputed the state's financial estimate, and said the measure would save education money, contending that "these kids will learn English more quickly when they are required to do so.",
Supporters
Measure 58's chief petitioners are Bill Sizemore, Alan Grosso, and Russ Walker.
The Oregon Voters' Pamphlet has arguments in favor from Oregonians For Immigration Reform, the Marion County Republican Party, FreedomWorks, and Sizemore's Oregon Taxpayers United.
Arguments for Measure 58
Notable arguments that have been made in favor of Measure 58 include:
If the measure passes, it will improve the education of Oregon's immigrant children because it will bring about "specialized, intensive English instruction".
Current programs in Oregon to teach English to students who do not speak English as a first language are failing; as evidence, supporters of Measure 58 cite a 2007 Oregon Department of Education study that indicated that only 22 of the state's 129 school districts are meeting minimum standards in this area.
Limited English proficiency (LEP) students in the state are funded at 150% the rate for regular students but this extra funding, supporters say, is not working. It isn't the money that is being spent that is the issue, they argue, but how the money is being spent.
School districts don't have the incentive to move students out of the LEP category because the school districts get more money from the state education department for LEP students than for non-LEP students.
Opponents
Measure 58 is opposed by the Parents and Teachers Know Better Coalition, which describes itself as "a broad coalition of parents, teachers, and school advocates who care about Oregon's students & schools." The Parents and Teachers Know Better campaign is part of the Defend Oregon Coalition, which opposes all five of the ballot initiatives on the November 4 ballot that are sponsored by Sizemore.
Members of the coalition include Stand for Children, Oregon PTA, United Way of the Mid-Willamette Valley, Oregon Education Association, American Federation of Teachers-Oregon, Oregon School Employees Association, and the Human Services Coalition of Oregon, among others.
Arguments against Measure 58
Notable arguments that have been made against Ballot Measure 58 include:
It offers a "one-size-fits-all" mandate that doesn't take into account the differences in students' ability to learn academic English.
English acquisition researcher Jim Cummins at the University of Toronto it typically takes students five to seven years to acquire full mastery of a second language.
It is too expensive.
It doesn't define what it means by "English immersion".
It doesn't make any exceptions for students with learning disabilities.
It isn't based on any research on how students learn. Most language acquisition experts say it takes five to seven years for children to become proficient enough in a new language to meet academic requirements.
It will ban popular dual-immersion programs.
Donors opposed to Measure 58
Two campaign committees opposed to Measure 58 have registered. They are Defend Oregon and the Committee to Protect Local Control of Schools (CPLCS), led by Kevin Neely, who is also the treasurer of Defend Oregon.
CPLCS reports no significant financial activity as of September 29.
Defend Oregon, as a committee, fought seven different ballot measures in 2008, and supported two others. As a result, it is not possible to discern how much of its campaign warchest went specifically to defeat Measure 58. Altogether, the group has raised $9 million in 2008.
Major donations to the Defend Oregon group as of October 23 include:
$5.2 million from the Oregon Education Association.
$1.2 million from SEIU.
$450,000, American Federation of Teachers
$600,000, AFSCME.
$100,000 from School Employees Exercising Democracy (SEED)
$100,000 from the AFL-CIO.
$50,000 from Oregon AFSCME Council 75.
Citizens' Initiative Review - 9 for, 14 against
A 23-member Oregon Citizens Initiative Review panel examined this ballot measure in-depth in September 2008. They spent five days listening to advocates for and against the measure, and independent experts on language education. In the end, 14 were opposed to the measure, and nine were in support, and both groups wrote up their recommendation. Final analysis and statement
Path to the ballot
What became Oregon Ballot Measure 50 started out as Oregon Initiative Petition 19; it was originally approved for petition circulation on August 30, 2006.
The office of the Oregon Secretary of State announced on June 16, 2008 that its unofficial signature verification process showed that the initiative's supporters had turned in 83,248 valid signatures, versus a requirement of 82,769 signatures. This represented a validity rate of 66.88% calculated over the 124,476 signatures turned in.
A union-funded watchdog group asked the Oregon Secretary of State to conduct an investigation into how some signatures on the measure were collected. Bill Bradbury, the Secretary of State has said, ""...most all of the initiatives Oregon voters will decide this fall got there through practices that are now illegal. But those practices were legal at the time most of the signatures were submitted." The state Elections Division is currently investigating the claims.

Sciuromorpha ("squirrel-like") is a rodent clade that includes several different rodent families. It includes all members of the Sciuridae (the squirrel family) as well as the mountain beaver species.
Traditionally, the term has been defined on the basis of the shape of the infraorbital canal. A sciuromorphous zygomasseteric system is characterized by attachment of the lateral masseter muscle along the side of the rostrum. Unlike hystricomorphous and myomorphous rodents, the medial masseter muscle does not pass through the infraorbital canal. Among extant rodents, only the families Sciuridae, Castoridae, Heteromyidae, and Geomyidae are truly sciuromorphous. Some authorities would exclude the Geomyidae and Heteromyidae from that list due to the attachment of the medial masseter directly behind the zygomatic arch.
Carleton and Musser (2005) redefined the rodent suborders on morphological and molecular grounds. They defined the Sciuromorpha as including three families, Sciuridae, Aplodontiidae, and Gliridae. Of these, only the Sciuridae are truly sciuromorphous. The Aplodontiidae are protrogomorphous and the Gliridae are myomorphous. The connection between Aplodontiidae and Sciuridae has been proposed numerous times in the past. The two families have been united into a common infraorder (Sciurida) or superfamily (Sciuroidea). It has long been suggested that dormice (Gliridae) are not particularly related to the Myomorpha, and their zygomasseteric structure has been termed "pseudomyomorphy". The connection between squirrels and dormice has been almost exclusively suggested through genetic studies, and to a lesser degree via the fossil rodent Reithroparamys.
Current families
The suborder Sciuromorpha contains 307 living species in 61 genera and three families. At least three extinct families are also recognised.
† Allomyidae
Aplodontiidae – mountain beaver
† Mylagaulidae
Sciuridae – squirrels, chipmunks, marmots, flying squirrels, etc.
† Reithroparamyidae
Gliridae – dormice
Historical families
Castoridae – beavers
Geomyidae – pocket gophers
Heteromyidae – pocket mice, kangaroo rats, and kangaroo mice

The black-billed barbet (Lybius guifsobalito) is a species of bird in the Lybiidae family.
Distribution
This species has an extremely large range in the Afrotropical realm. It is present in Cameroon, northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, from eastern Sudan to western Ethiopia, western Kenya, northern Tanzania, and Uganda.
Habitat
These birds occur at altitudes between 900 and 2,200 meters above sea level, in open forests, forest edges, woodland vegetation, savannah, scrubs, gardens and cultivated areas with fruit-bearing trees.
Description
Lybius guifsobalito can reach a wingspan of in males. The tail length is between 4.5 and 5.4 centimeters. The beak reaches a length between 1.9 and 2.2 centimeters. Females have similar body measurements, without noticeable sexual dimorphism.
Males and femalesof these medium-sized barbets are glossy blue-black, the wings and the belly are a little more brown. They also have a bright red or red-orange face, throat and upper chest. The upperwing are narrowly lined with yellow to white. The beak is rather strong and black, the featherless skin of the face is gray, the eyes are reddish brown. The legs and feet are blackish gray. Young birds have duller plumage than the adult ones.
It is closely related to Lybius torquatus and Lybius rubrifacies.
Biology
Lybius guifsobalito is an adaptable species . The diet of these birds consists mainly of fruits such as figs, guavas, papaya and various berries. They also eat insects such as beetles, ants, and termites. They usually live in pairs or small groups, up to seven individuals. The vocalization comprehends a low growling and a series of two-syllabled “koop-pup” phrases.

The Triumph Herald is a small two-door car introduced by Standard-Triumph of Coventry in 1959 and made through to 1971. The body design was by the Italian stylist Giovanni Michelotti, and the car was offered in saloon, convertible, coupé, estate and van models, with the latter marketed as the Triumph Courier.
Total Herald sales numbered well over half a million. The Triumph Vitesse, Spitfire and GT6 models are all based on modified Herald chassis and running gear with bolt-together bodies.
Herald & Herald S (948 cc)
Towards the end of the 1950s Standard-Triumph offered a range of two-seater Triumph sports cars alongside its Standard saloons, the Standard Eight and Standard Ten, powered by a small (803 cc or 948 cc) 4-cylinder engine, which by the late 1950s were due for an update. Standard-Triumph therefore started work on the Herald. The choice of the Herald name suggests that the car was originally intended to be marketed as a Standard, as it fits the model-naming scheme of the time (Ensign, Pennant and Standard itself). But by 1959 it was felt that the Triumph name had more brand equity, and the Standard name was phased out in Britain after 1963.
Giovanni Michelotti was commissioned to style the car by the Standard-Triumph board, encouraged by chief engineer Harry Webster, and quickly produced designs for a two-door saloon with a large glass area that gave 93 per cent all-round visibility in the saloon variant and the "razor-edge" looks to which many makers were turning. As Fisher & Ludlow, Standard-Triumph's body suppliers became part of an uncooperative British Motor Corporation, it was decided that the car should have a separate chassis rather than adopting the newer unitary construction. The main body tub was bolted to the chassis and the whole front end hinged forward to allow access to the engine. Every panel – including the sills and roof – could be unbolted from the car so that different body styles could be easily built on the same chassis. As an addition to the original coupé and saloon models, a convertible was introduced in 1960.
The Standard Pennant's 4-cylinder 948 cc OHV Standard SC engine and 4 speed manual gearboxes was used with synchromesh on the top three gears and remote gear shift and driving the rear wheels. Most of the engine parts were previously used in the Standard 8/10. The rack and pinion steering afforded the Herald a tight turning circle. Coil and double-wishbone front suspension was fitted, while the rear suspension, a new departure for Triumph, offered "limited" independent springing via a single transverse leaf-spring bolted to the top of the final drive unit and swing axles.
Instruments were confined to a single large speedometer with fuel gauge in the saloon (a temperature gauge was available as an option) on a dashboard of grey pressed fibreboard. The coupé dashboard was equipped with speedometer, fuel and temperature gauges, together with a lockable glovebox. The car had loop-pile carpeting and heater as standard. A number of extras were available including twin SU carburettors, leather seats, a wood-veneered dashboard, Telaflo shock absorbers and paint options.
In late 1958, prototype cars embarked on a test run from Cape Town to Tangiers. An account of the journey was embellished by PR at the time. However, only minor changes were deemed necessary between the prototype and production cars. The new car was launched at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 22 April 1959 but was not an immediate sales success, partly owing to its relatively high cost, approaching £700 (including 45 per cent Purchase Tax). In standard single-carburettor form the car was no better than average in terms of performance. A saloon tested by The Motor magazine in 1959 was found to have a top speed of and could accelerate from 0– in 31.1 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded.
The rear suspension was criticised as yielding poor handling at the extremes of performance though the model was considered easy to drive with its good vision, light steering (the smallest turning circle of any production car) and controls, and ease of repair.
A Herald S variant was introduced in 1961 with a lower equipment level and less chrome than the Herald. It was offered in saloon form only.
The 948 cc Herald Coupé and Convertible models were discontinued in 1961, the 948 cc Herald Saloon in 1962 and the Herald S in 1964.
Herald 1200
Standard-Triumph experienced financial difficulties at the beginning of the 1960s and was taken over by Leyland Motors in 1961. This released new resources to develop the Herald and the car was re-launched in April 1961 with an 1147 cc engine as the Herald 1200. The new model featured rubber-covered bumpers, a wooden laminate dashboard and improved seating. Quality control was also tightened up. Twin carburettors were no longer fitted to any of the range as standard although they remained an option, the standard being a single down-draught Solex carburettor. Claimed maximum power of the Herald 1200 was , as against the claimed for the 948 cc model. One month after the release of the Herald 1200, a 3-door estate was added to the range. Disc brakes became an option from 1962.
Sales picked up despite growing competition from the Mini and the Ford Anglia. The coupé was dropped from the range in late 1964 as it was by then in direct competition with the Triumph Spitfire.
Courier van
The Triumph Courier van, a Herald estate with side panels in place of rear side windows, was produced from 1962 until 1966, but was dropped following poor sales. Production in England ceased in mid-1964. CKD assembly by MCA in Malta continued till late 1965, at least. The Courier was powered by the 1147 cc engine.
Herald 12/50
An upmarket version, the Herald 12/50, was offered from 1963 to 1967. It featured a tuned engine with a claimed output of in place of the previous 39, along with a sliding (Weathershield) vinyl-fabric sunroof and front disc brakes as standard. The 12/50, which was offered only as a 2-door saloon, was fitted with a fine-barred aluminium grille.
The power output of the 1200, which remained in production alongside the 12/50, was subsequently boosted to 48 bhp.
Herald 13/60
In October 1967 the range was updated with the introduction at the London Motor Show of the Herald 13/60. The 13/60 was offered in saloon, convertible and estate-bodied versions. The sun-roof remained available for the saloon as an optional extra rather than a standard feature. The front end was restyled using a bonnet similar to the Triumph Vitesse's and the interior substantially revised though still featuring the wooden dashboard. Interior space was improved by recessing a rear armrest in each side panel. The engine was enlarged to 1296 cc, essentially the unit employed since 1965 in the Triumph 1300, fitted with a Stromberg CD150 carburettor, offering and much improved performance. In this form (though the 1200 saloon was sold alongside it until the end of 1970) the Herald Saloon lasted until December 1970 and the Convertible and Estate until May 1971, by which time, severely outdated in style if not performance, it had already outlived the introduction of the Triumph 1300 Saloon, the car designed to replace it and was still selling reasonably well but, because of its labour-intensive method of construction, selling at a loss.
Remaining cars
Early 948 cc powered cars are rare, convertibles and coupes are especially sought after. Current figures have only 580.5 early (948 cc) cars remaining, 307.5 being coupés, just 74 being genuine convertibles.
Coupés remaining worldwide (948 cc cars), many in Australia, Malta, New Zealand and the USA. Similarly, 948 cc convertibles were mostly exported, of which, only 64 are known to still exist. Later cars, such as the 1200 and 13/60 models, are more numerous.
International production
Triumph Heralds were exported and assembled in a number of countries, and the separate chassis used as a jig to assemble kits exported from Coventry. These cars were referred to as CKD – Complete Knock Down cars.
India
In the 1960s Standard Motor Products of Madras, India, manufactured Triumph Heralds with the basic 948 cc engine under the name Standard Herald, eventually with additional four-door saloon and five-door estate models exclusively for the Indian market. In 1971 they introduced a restyled four-door saloon based on the Herald called the Standard Gazel, using the same 948 cc engine but with the axle changed to that of the Toledo, as the Herald's "swing-arm" could not cope with roads in some interior villages of India. The Gazel was discontinued in 1977.
Australia
The Herald was produced in Australia by Australian Motor Industries from 1959 to 1966 with output totalling 14,975 units. Production included a 12/50 model, which unlike its British namesake was offered in both saloon and coupe body styles. It featured the bonnet and four angled headlights of the Triumph Vitesse and was marketed as the Triumph 12/50, without Herald badges.
Others
Triumph Heralds were also assembled in South Africa, New Zealand, Ireland, Malta, at two locations in Peru, and in Italy, at Borgo Panigale DUCATI bikes factory.
In popular media
A Triumph Herald was used at the 2012 London Olympic Games during the beginning of the closing ceremony when cars were paraded around the stadium. In the 1960s based TV drama Heartbeat, Dr Kate Rowan drove a cactus green Herald from series 1 until series 5. In the TV comedy series Last of the Summer Wine, Edie drove a red Herald convertible, restored by their husband Wesley. A Herald converted to a sailing boat appeared in 2006 (series 8, episode 3) and 2007 (series 10, episode 2) on TV series Top Gear. It was driven and sailed by presenter James May.
A white Herald 1360 convertible was driven by the actor Paul McGann in the 1990 film Paper Mask, when they played a hospital porter who decided to impersonate a doctor. There is an affectionate portrayal of a Triumph Herald Estate car in the novel Room for Us by Roger Harvey (2020, ). David Niven drove a beaten-up Herald convertible to escape from terrorists in the 1975 movie Paper Tiger.
Herald-based cars
The Equipe was a car produced by Bond, using the Triumph Herald chassis and components.
Having a separate body mounted to a chassis, the Triumph Herald provides a sound basis for a kit car. Examples include:
Sussita 12 – (1968–1970) A car made in Israel, manufactured by Israeli Autocars Company LTD. The Susita 12 station wagon, and sedan (named Carmel), used the Triumph Herald 12/50 engine.
Sussita 13/60 – (1970–1975) An Israeli made car, manufactured by Israeli Autocars Company LTD. Manufactured as 2 doors station wagon, sedan (named Carmel Ducas), and pick-up versions. Built on the Triumph Herald's chassis, and used the Herald 13/60 engine and gearbox.
The "T car" by New Zealand company Alternative Cars is a MGTF "replica", which, although not an exact copy of the MGTF, has some of the spirit of the original. About 250 were made and they have a high survival rate. It has its body made of fibreglass with a steel bonnet.
Early versions of the Marlin used Herald components.
Gentry Cars – again, loosely based on the MG TF.
Spartan Cars – a traditional styled open 2 seaters.
Moss cars could be based on either Triumph or Ford components.
The German-designed and built amphibious Amphicar used the same 1147cc engine as the Herald, and though not designed by Michelotti, has a strong family resemblance.
Scale models and die-cast

Brad Stine (born January 21, 1960) is an American comedian, actor, and author. Relatively unknown until 2003, Stine first gained exposure when they were identified as a conservative Christian on their debut album, Put a Helmet On!
Biography
Early life
Stine was born and raised in Bremen, Indiana by Jerry and Nancy Stine. Their father was an auto-body repairman and frontman for a local musical combo called the Regents, and their mother was a housewife.  They are the second of four children.
Stine's parents divorced when they were eight, but they later remarried and moved to California, only to divorce again. They stayed with their father, who briefly left the auto-body business to travel with their brother to carnivals in the Midwest. Their father later remarried and returned to their previous work.
Early career
Stine started practicing magic tricks at age 13, which later led to their performing magic in Southern California bars and restaurants. Stine also learned to perform sideshow stunts and began honing their comedy skills.
In the late 1980s, Stine was hired by a manager and toured colleges across the country with comedians Craig Anton and Emery Emery. Their first television appearance was on Showtime's Comedy Club Network.
Stine continued to work in comedy clubs and on TV, and eventually dropped their magic tricks and stunts. They started taking acting lessons and auditioned for movies and television shows. On the advice of a fellow comic, they eventually made their Christian faith and conservatism the focus of their act.
Personal life
They reside in Brentwood, Tennessee, with their wife Desiree, and their two children.
Comedic style
Stine's style has been described by Newsweek as "conservative " with a "rat-a-tat delivery" and by The New Yorker as "frantic," "conservative," and "ADHD," with echoes of Robin Williams, Sam Kinison, Bill Hicks, George Carlin, and Alan Keyes." However, unlike these and a lot of other comedians, Stine does not use profanity or sexual humor because of their conservative Christian faith. They have been described as "a clean Denis Leary" and their material targets "liberals, humanists, political correctness and judgmental Christians." Stine has claimed that their conservatism has sometimes resulted in the loss of appearances. Stine themselves admits that much of their more extreme material is facetious and satirical, using ridiculous scenarios to make a finer point.
Major appearances
Stine has appeared on several stand-up comedy shows, such as A&E's Evening at the Improv and MTV's Half Hour Comedy Hour, and has appeared on news programs such as Fox News' Hannity & Colmes, CNN's Paula Zahn NOW and Glenn Beck, and the NBC Nightly News. Stine has also been interviewed on National Public Radio and has been featured on FOXNews.com and in Newsweek, the New Yorker, USA Today, and several other newspapers nationwide. They were a featured performer for Promise Keepers in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007 and once again in 2012 and also in 2014
. Also in 2004, they performed for "R: the Party," a party hosted by Jenna and Barbara Bush during the conservative Republican National Convention in New York City. Stine has also appeared with Go Fish for the song Christmas with a Capital "C", which disparages the inclusive term "happy holidays" and supports the use of the term "Merry Christmas."
GodMen
Inspired by author David Murrow, Stine founded GodMen, a proposed alternative to Promise Keepers that emphasizes "spiritual conservatism". GodMen's inaugural event was held on October 28, 2006, in Nashville, Tennessee, and drew 200 men. Their second event was held on March 10, 2007, in rented space at a Franklin, Tennessee, mall and drew about 300 men. Many more events were scheduled for 2007 and 2008. As of spring 2012, Stine has returned to Promise Keepers.
Acting work
Stine has appeared in minor roles in a handful of big and small screen movies, including the films Welcome to Paradise, Sarah's Choice, Homeless for the Holidays, Christmas with a Capital C and Persecuted.
Multimedia
Stine currently has two books and five performance videos/recordings available. In September 2008, they were featured in the multi-comedian DVD The Apostles of Comedy, which also features comedian/actors Ron Pearson, Jeff Allen and Anthony Griffith. The four comedians have been touring the country as The Apostles of Comedy since 2008 and are scheduled through May 2009.

The Keldysh bomber was a Soviet design for a rocket-powered sub-orbital bomber spaceplane, which drew heavily upon work carried out by Eugen Sänger and Irene Bredt for the German Silbervogel project.
Development
During the closing weeks of World War II, the German work at Peenemünde was investigated by Soviet intelligence, amongst whom was rocket motor constructor Alexey Isayev, who found a copy of Sänger and Bredt's report. A translation was soon circulating among Soviet rocket designers, and a condensed version made its way to Stalin himself.
In November 1946 the NII-1 NKAP research institute was formed with mathematician Mstislav Vsevolodovich Keldysh as its head to investigate and develop the German Sänger–Bredt design. In 1947, studies indicated that the high fuel consumption of Sänger's rocket-based design rendered the concept impracticable in the short term. Using engines considered to be available in a reasonable timespan, 95% of the vehicle's initial mass would have to be propellant. However, use of ramjets during the acceleration phase would give the craft a more reasonable 22% dead weight and still achieve the 5 km/s velocity required for a intercontinental range.
It was estimated that it would take until the mid-1950s before a draft project of a feasible design could be prepared, and by that time the design had been made obsolete by more advanced designs. However, the work carried out would lead to the EKR, MKR, Buran, and Burya ramjet cruise missiles.
Proposed mission profile
The 100-tonne craft would be accelerated to 500 m/s using a sled running along a 3 km track and powered by five or six RKDS-100 rocket engines of 600 tonnes total thrust. Separation velocity would be reached 11 seconds after ignition.
After separation from the sled, the craft would climb using its main RKDS-100 rocket engine and two wingtip-mounted ramjets, which would accelerate it to an altitude of 20 km and a speed of over Mach 3.
The rocket would continue working after the ramjets had flamed out at high altitude; it had a specific impulse of 285 seconds, a thrust of 100 tonnes, and used liquid oxygen/kerosene propellants.

"But for the Grace of God" is a song co-written and recorded by Australian country music singer Keith Urban. Urban wrote the song along with Charlotte Caffey and Jane Wiedlin of The Go-Go's. It was released in November 2000 as the third single from their self-titled American debut album. The song became Urban's first number one hit on the US Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart for the week of February 24, 2001, and maintained that position for one week. This ended a two-and-a-half-year streak in which no artist on the Capitol Records label achieved a Number One single on the country charts.
Single and album version differences
Both radio edit and album-length versions have been issued. The radio edit excises a musical bridge after the second chorus and has a slightly different ending than the album cut.
Music video
The music video for this song was directed by Trey Fanjoy, and premiered on CMT on December 2, 2000. It features Urban walking down a busy street at night.

The 142nd Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry was a volunteer infantry regiment that fought in the Union Army during the American Civil War. The regiment primarily served in the Army of the Potomac in the Eastern Theater and was heavily engaged in the first day of fighting at Gettysburg.
History
The regiment was organized in August 1862, with Robert P. Cummins as colonel, Alfred B. McCalmont as lieutenant colonel, and John Bradley as major. It was sent to Washington, D.C., where it built fortifications. After a couple of weeks, it was sent to Frederick, Maryland, where it performed garrison duties.
In October, it became part of the 2nd Brigade of the Pennsylvania Reserves. At the Battle of Fredericksburg, the regiment formed part of the force which briefly pierced the Confederate right, losing 250 out of 550 men, including Major Bradley, who was mortally wounded. After the battle, the Reserves division was sent back to Washington, and the regiment was reassigned to the 1st Brigade, Third Division, I Corps.
At the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, the unit fought first on McPherson's Ridge and then on Seminary Ridge before being driven back to Cemetery Hill only after being outflanked by Confederate North Carolina divisions on its left and right flanks. Only 140 men had made it back to Union lines, and Colonel Cummins was mortally wounded. During the next two days, the 142nd was only lightly engaged. After the battle, the regiment became part of the 3rd Brigade, Fourth Division, V Corps.
In September 1864, Horatio N. Warren was promoted to colonel of the regiment. It fought throughout the Overland Campaign and the Siege of Petersburg, mostly against the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad. After the surrender at Appomattox Court House, the regiment participated in the Grand Review of the Armies in Washington and was mustered out on May 29, 1865.
Casualties

The Vancouver Canucks are a professional ice hockey team based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. They play at the 18,810-capacity Rogers Arena. They are members of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Canucks joined the NHL in 1970 as an expansion team alongside the Buffalo Sabres. In the Canucks' -year NHL history, the team has advanced three times to the Stanley Cup Finals. They were defeated in all three attempts; once in a four-game sweep by the New York Islanders in 1982, and the other two times in a seven-game series by the New York Rangers in 1994, and by the Boston Bruins in 2011.
The Canucks selected Dale Tallon, a defenceman from the Toronto Marlboros, with their first pick, second overall in the 1970 NHL Amateur Draft. The Canucks also drafted Trevor Linden from the Medicine Hat Tigers in 1988. Linden would serve as the Canucks president of hockey operations from 2014 to 2018. All-time, the Canucks had 15 top-five draft picks, but have never received the first overall pick. The Canucks are one of the two franchises in the NHL to have drafted two twin brothers in the same year—they drafted Daniel Sedin second overall and Henrik Sedin third overall in 1999.

John Victor Evans Sr. (January 18, 1925 – July 8, 2014) was an American politician from Idaho. A member of the Democratic Party, they were the state's 27th governor and was in office for nearly ten years, from 1977 to 1987.
Biography
Born in Malad, Idaho, Evans was an infantryman in the U.S. Army during World War II. Following the war, they attended Stanford University and graduated in 1951. They and their wife, Lola Daniels Evans (1927–2015), were married for over 69 years and had five children: three sons and two daughters.
Career
Evans returned to Malad after college to help run the family wheat and cattle ranch. They were elected to the state senate at age 27 in 1952 and re-elected in 1954 and 1956, serving as majority leader in their final term. In 1960, Evans became mayor of Malad City and served in that capacity until 1966. They returned to the state senate in 1969 and served as minority leader from 1969 to 1975.
Evans was elected lieutenant governor in 1974, and became governor in January 1977 when Cecil Andrus accepted an appointment to become the Secretary of the Interior in the new Carter administration.
Evans finished Andrus' term and was elected governor in their own right in 1978, defeating Republican house speaker Allan Larsen of Blackfoot. Through 2021, Evans remains the only Mormon to win election as governor in Idaho; Arnold Williams was the first to serve as governor, for slightly over a year starting in late 1945, but lost the 1946 election. Evans was re-elected in 1982, narrowly defeating Republican lieutenant governor Phil Batt of Wilder in a contest so close on election night that at least one Idaho television network incorrectly declared Batt the winner.
While in office as governor in 1981, Evans' 29-year-old son John was the target of a foiled kidnapping attempt in Burley.
Elections
After nearly a decade as a governor, Evans ran for the U.S. Senate in 1986, but was defeated by Republican incumbent Steve Symms of Caldwell. They were succeeded as governor by Andrus, who served two more terms, giving the Democrats six consecutive elections for governor in the state, holding the office from 1971 to 1995.
Later life and death
Evans became president of the family-owned D. L. Evans Bank in Burley in January 1987, which was founded in 1904 in Albion by their grandfather, David Lloyd Evans, Sr. (1854–1929). Evans died at age 89 in 2014 at their Boise home on July 8. Less than year later, their widow Lola died at home in Boise on May 19, 2015, at the age of 88. They are interred at the Malad City Cemetery in Malad City.

ANK '64was an Estonian artist collective active in the years 1964 to 1969 in Tallinn.
The group included originally 10 artists: Jüri Arrak, , , Malle Leis, , Enno Ootsing, , , Aili Vint and Tõnis Vint. The group did not practice any specific style of art, but recognized as works of art anything related to modern youth culture such as pop-art. Members of the group were not only active as artists, but also organized and attended lectures on foreign artists and their activities. Members of the group were involved in the Leningrad and Moscow underground non-conformist art movement.
The first group exhibition was held in 1964 on the premises of the Estonian Theatre. A retrospective of their work 50 years after they first gathered was held in the Tallinn Art Hall from 6 November-15 December 2013. Many of the original artists were still active at the time and showed their recent work in addition to a historical overview.

WorldShift is a science fiction real-time strategy video game developed by Black Sea Studios and released in 2008.
Plot
In the 21st century, a mysterious object lands on Earth ending all known civilization. WorldShift is set thousands of years after those events, when the human civilization is no more than just a fading myth. The remains of the mysterious object, known as Shard Zero, are still spreading its Plague and reshaping the Earth. The human race has developed a new culture and is now living in five shielded mega-cities, struggling to survive from day to day. The rest of the Earth is populated by what is known to be the Tribes, successors of the early humans that were affected by the Plague, and the Cult, a mysterious alien race with unknown origins.
Gameplay
In WorldShift, there are no technology trees featuring hundreds of upgrades; instead, WorldShift allows the players to discover and acquire a vast number of items and powerful relics that they can use to freely change their gameplay and preferred tactics and to attack their enemies. The players will gather items as they fight their opponents and as rewards for completing missions. There is a three-tiered unit system, with outstanding leader units, strong officer units and then more common basic units. The game is centered on unique cooperative multiplayer gameplay.
Many units in WorldShift have power which the player can spend to perform special actions such as spells, healing, or stronger attacks. Some units also have shields able to absorb the strength of an incoming attack partly or entirely.
Reception
The game received "mixed" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

In 2016, Moore was elected to serve as caucus whip of the Congressional Black Caucus for the 115th United States Congress.  They are a member of the Democratic Party. Them district is based in Milwaukee and as a result of the 2011 redistricting also includes some Milwaukee County suburbs: Bayside, Brown Deer, Cudahy, Fox Point, Glendale, St. Francis, South Milwaukee, West Milwaukee, Shorewood and Whitefish Bay. Moore is the first woman to represent the district and the second woman after Tammy Baldwin and the first African American elected to Congress from Wisconsin.
Early life, education and career
Moore was born in Racine, but has spent most of their life in Milwaukee.  They are the eighth of nine children; their father was a factory worker and their mother a public school teacher. Moore attended North Division High School and served as student council president. They later attended Marquette University and became a single mother and welfare recipient. They earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1973.
As an organizer with AmeriCorps VISTA, Moore worked to establish the Cream City Community Development Credit Union to offer grants and loans to low-income residents to start businesses. For their work, they were awarded the national "VISTA Volunteer of the Decade" award from 1976 to 1986. From 1985 to 1989, they worked for the City of Milwaukee as a neighborhood development strategist and for the state Department of Employment Relations and Health and Social Services. Moore also worked for the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority (WHEDA) as a housing officer.
Wisconsin legislature
Moore was elected to the Wisconsin Assembly in 1988 and served two terms representing the 7th district. They were a prominent voice calling for an investigation into the case of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, who lived two blocks from Moore.
In 1992, Moore was elected to the Wisconsin State Senate, in which they represented the 4th district from 1993 to 2005. They were the first African-American woman to be elected to the state senate and became a prominent voice against mandatory ID security measures to enter the Capitol. They said, "I am too often reminded [9/11 hijacker] Mohammed Atta had a photo ID. This will not tell people whether I am a terrorist. This disenfranchises people who come to their Capitol."
U.S. House of Representatives
Moore was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 2004 with 69.6% of the vote, defeating Republican attorney Gerald Boyle. They were one of a handful of African Americans to be elected to Congress as freshmen in 2004, and the first African American and second woman (after Tammy Baldwin) to represent Wisconsin in Congress.
Moore is a prominent advocate for women's rights, releasing frequent statements on topics ranging from domestic abuse awareness to abortion rights. In January 2011, they were elected Democratic co-chair of the Congressional Women's Caucus to become a leader on health insurance reform and the protection of reproductive rights.  They are a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.
During the congressional debate in February 2011 on the Pence Amendment to defund Planned Parenthood, in response to comments from Paul Broun suggesting that Planned Parenthood promoted racist eugenics because more black women than white women have abortions, Moore spoke about their experience raising children on little money, and why "planned parenthood is healthy for women, it's healthy for children and it's healthy for our society". They publicly opposed the investigation into Planned Parenthood's financial accounting, saying the investigation was "an unfortunate waste of taxpayer dollars". Moore voted "nay" on Amends Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to Prohibit Abortion Coverage on October 13, 2011. In March 2012, during the House debate over reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, they spoke about their experience of being sexually assaulted and raped as a child and an adult, criticizing the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee that voted "no" on the bill.
In the first session of the 109th Congress, Moore earned 90% and higher legislative agenda approval scores from Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Sierra Club of Wisconsin, and the Service Employees International Union. They have focused legislatively on traditional Democratic and progressive issues, believing that the federal government should play a significant role in the amelioration of poverty and the resolution of difficult local problems. Moore has received support from interest groups including the American Civil Liberties Union (93%), The Human Rights Campaign (100%), The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League (NARAL) (100%), The National Farmer's Union (100%) and Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund (100%). They lack support from those supporting hunting and sportsmen rights (0% support from Sportsmen and Animal Owner's Voting Alliance), opponents of abortion rights (0% support from National Right to Life), and conservative tax reform stances (0% support from Americans for Tax Reform).
During their first term, Moore introduced legislation to provide economic incentives and tax cuts to small businesses to promote job creation, and also cosponsored legislation supporting community block grants, continuing and expanding Medicaid funding, amending the Truth in Lending Act to prevent so-called "predatory lending", and removing troops from Iraq. They also cosponsored two prospective amendments to the US Constitution, providing for uniform national election standards and prohibiting gender discrimination.
On May 6, 2006, Moore and eight fellow members of the Congressional Black Caucus were arrested and ticketed for unlawful assembly and disorderly conduct after they stepped onto the grounds of the Embassy of Sudan to call attention to the ongoing Darfur conflict. Moore said the group expected to be arrested but that they were pleased to participate in a "peaceful act of civil disobedience".
In July 2019, Moore voted against a House resolution introduced by Representative Brad Schneider opposing efforts to boycott the State of Israel and the Global Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement targeting Israel. The resolution passed 398-17.
On December 18, 2019, Moore voted for both articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump.

The Lebanon national football team has used footballers born outside Lebanon throughout its history with varying success.
As a result of the dominance of clubs founded by the Armenian diaspora in Lebanon, between the 1940s and 1960s the national team heavily featured Lebanese players of Armenian origin. The established presence of Armenians in the team led the Lebanese Football Association (LFA) to naturalize several Armenian players born in Armenia during the 1990s to play internationally for Lebanon. Most notably, Vardan Ghazaryan was the national team's leading top goalscorer.
At the 2000 AFC Asian Cup, the LFA naturalized five Brazilian-born players of Lebanese descent; their presence was generally not well received, as it was felt that they did not improve the level of the team. Lebanon were eliminated in the first round without registering a single win. At the 2019 Asian Cup, nine of the 23 called-up players were born outside Lebanon; contrary to 2000, their inclusion was seen positively.
History
Armenians in Lebanon
Following the Armenian genocide in 1915, many Armenians emigrated to Lebanon; as of 2021, Lebanon is home to the eighth-largest Armenian diaspora in the world. Between the 1940s and 1960s, clubs founded by the Armenian diaspora, such as Homenetmen and Homenmen, dominated in Lebanese domestic football; during this period many Lebanese players of Armenian origin played for the Lebanon national team.
The large presence of Armenians in Lebanon pushed the Lebanese Football Association (LFA) to naturalize Armenian players born outside of Lebanon. In 1993, the LFA naturalized Babken Melikyan via a presidential decree, in order to play for the Lebanon national team at the 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. Jamal Taha, born in Egypt to an Egyptian father and Lebanese mother, was also naturalized alongside Melikyan. Melikyan set the trend for other Armenian players to play for Lebanon during the 1990s, such as Gurgen Engibaryan and Gevorg Karapetyan. The most impactful Armenian to play for the national team was Vardan Ghazaryan; they obtained Lebanese citizenship through naturalisation in 1994, and was the national team's top goalscorer.
After Homenetmen and Homenmen were relegated to the lower divisions in the early 2000s, Armenian presence in the national team fell. Since 2006, no Lebanese of Armenian origin has featured for the national team, with the last Armenian player to represent "the Cedars" being Agop Donabidian.
2000 AFC Asian Cup
With over six million people worldwide having Lebanese descent, compared to the four million Lebanese living in Lebanon, the LFA sought to take advantage of the sizeable Lebanese diaspora to improve football in Lebanon. Despite the positive impact of the Lebanese diaspora in various sports – such as basketball, tennis and rugby – football did not initially benefit in the same way.
In Lebanon's first participation at the AFC Asian Cup in 2000, which they hosted, they called up five Brazilian players of Lebanese heritage: Luís Fernandes, Gilberto, Jadir Morgenstern, Marcílio and Newton. According to Jamal Taha, Lebanon's captain at the tournament, there was no communication between the local players and the naturalized players due to the language barrier. Lebanon were eventually knocked out in the first round, without winning a single match.
The general sentiment regarding the Brazilian players was that they did not improve the level of the national team, and were in fact "harmful" due to the lack of integration with the other players.
Recent history
At the 2019 Asian Cup, Lebanon's second participation, nine of the 23 players called up were born outside Lebanon. Compared to the 2000 Asian Cup, the addition of foreign-born players of Lebanese descent was well received: Hassan Maatouk, captain of the national team, stated: "It's a good thing for us that we have some players from outside the country that can come and help us and as a team." Several players born outside Lebanon communicated with their teammates in English.
Lebanon continued the trend of calling up players born abroad during the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign, in which the team reached the final round of qualifying for the second time. Wael Chehayeb of the LFA stated "[People with Lebanese origins] give us more options when looking for players as we don't have a big population, and some of them have a European football education which is good for us."
Players
This is a list of football players who represented the Lebanon national football team in international football and were born outside Lebanon.
The following players:
have played at least one game for the full (senior male) Lebanon national team; and
were born outside Lebanon.
This list includes players who have dual citizenship with Lebanon and/or have become naturalized Lebanese citizens. The players are ordered per modern-day country of birth; if the country at the time of birth differs from the current, this is indicated with a subsection.

The 1969 North American Soccer League season was the second season of the North American Soccer League, the top division in US soccer in 1969.
Five teams competed in the league's 2nd season. The season was divided into two parts; the International Cup and the regular season. The Kansas City Spurs won the International Cup. The Kansas City Spurs also won the NASL championship by finishing at the top of the table in the regular season. For the second straight year the team with the best winning percentage (Atlanta) did not win the premiership due to the NASL's points system. But unlike the previous year, the Chiefs got no opportunity to claim any title, as this would be the only year that the league did not hold a post-season Championship Final.
Changes from the previous season
No new teams were added and total of 12 teams folded between the 1968 and 1969 seasons:
Boston Beacons
Chicago Mustangs
Cleveland Stokers
Detroit Cougars
Houston Stars
Los Angeles Wolves
New York Generals
Oakland Clippers
San Diego Toros

Due to the NASL's unusual points system, this was not the team with the best won-loss percentage or the most victories. The Kansas City Spurs posted a record of 10 wins, 2 losses, and 4 ties, for 110 points to claim the title, while the Atlanta Chiefs posted a superior record of 11 wins, 2 losses, and 3 ties, but managed only 109 points.

Hans Severus Ziegler (13 October 1893 – 1 May 1978) was a German publicist, theater manager, teacher and Nazi Party official. A leading cultural director under the Nazis, they were closely associated with the censorship and cultural co-ordination of the Third Reich.
Early years
Ziegler was born on 13 October 1893 in Eisenach. They were the son of a banker and, through their mother, the grandson of Gustav Schirmer. Their grandmother, the American-born Mary Francis Schirmer, was a close friend of Cosima Wagner and from an early age Ziegler was attracted to the militant nationalism in which the Wagner family were steeped. Ziegler studied German literature at university, completing their education with a PhD. They became a journalist, writing mostly for extreme right organs such as the Deutsche Wochen-Zeitung.
In 1924 Ziegler founded and edited a weekly political newspaper called Der Völkische. On 31 March 1925 Ziegler became a member of the Nazi Party, with their membership number being the comparatively low 1317. That year their newspaper expanded to a daily and changed its name to Der Nationalozialist, becoming the Nazi Party organ of Thuringia. They served as Deputy Gauleiter in Thuringia under Artur Dinter from 1925 to 1927 and under Fritz Sauckel from 1927 to 1931. In 1928 they were appointed head of the Militant League for German Culture. It was also Ziegler who in 1926 came up with the name Hitler-Jugend (Hitler Youth) for the Nazi youth movement. Ziegler was a close friend of the Schirach family and in 1925 they introduced Baldur von Schirach, who would go on to lead the Hitler Youth, to Adolf Hitler.
Ziegler was associated with the hard-line racialist wing of the Nazi Party, which looked to Alfred Rosenberg as its champion. In keeping with this wing they were particularly staunch in their anti-Semitism.
Under the Nazis
In 1933 Ziegler was appointed to the Council of State and as a member of the State Government of Thuringia. In addition, they served as President of the and Reich culture Senator. In 1936, they were appointed the general manager of the and state commissioner for the State Theatre in Thuringia. In 1935 they were placed on leave whilst they were investigated for alleged breaches of Paragraph 175, the anti-homosexual legislation, although the case was dropped. They were long assumed to be homosexual during their lifetime.
Ziegler played a leading role in promoting the Nazi vision of culture, particularly with regards to "degenerate" music. They were a strong critic of atonality, dismissing it as decadent "cultural Bolshevism". In May 1938 they curated the Entartete Musik exhibition in Düsseldorf, with Arnold Schoenberg, Alban Berg, Walter Braunfels, Karol Rathaus and Wilhelm Grosz amongst those receiving the strongest condemnation in the pamphlet they wrote to accompany the exhibition. Whilst working under Frick, in Thuringia, Ziegler had also overseen the removal of modern art pieces from museums and public buildings, and helped to bring about a crackdown on the "glorification of Negroidism" by restricting the performance of jazz music. Promulgated in their 1930 edict Against Negro Culture, the Thuringian foreshadowed the co-ordination of culture that was to happen under the Nazi government. Entartete Musik would continue Ziegler's crusade against jazz, whilst also condemning Ernst Krenek's opera as the archetype of Weimar decadence and miscegenation.
After the war
In the Soviet occupation zone several of Ziegler's writings, as well as a book about him, were placed on the (list of banned literature).
After the war they worked as a representative for and subsequently as a private tutor in Essen. They also directed a private theatre from 1952 to 1954. Politically, they were active in , an extreme right study group established in 1950. In this role, they became a regular guest of Winifred Wagner, who regularly hosted such other far-right luminaries as Adolf von Thadden, Edda Göring, and Oswald Mosley.
Ziegler died in Bayreuth on 1 May 1978.

Punjab Bar Council representation
Pronouncement regarding SCBA
Addressing a press conference Mumtaz Mustafa and senior members of the Bar council said that hastening the disposing of judges was equal to the burial of justice. The judiciary should give rulings on merit without making any haste. They said not even five percent judges are honest in lower courts, whereas the remarks of Lahore High Court Chief Justice Khawaja Muhammad Sharif suggest as if judges of Khilafat-e-Rashida have been appointed. They went on to say that Punjab Bar Council is representative of more than 80,000 advocates and Qazi Anwar, the president of Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), is not the appropriate delegate of lawyers to decide their perspective on National Judicial Policy.

Richard Charles Colpaert (born January 3, 1943) is an American former professional baseball player. They were a , right-handed pitcher who had a 13-season career in minor league baseball, highlighted by eight Major League appearances as a relief pitcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates.
Colpaert signed originally with the Baltimore Orioles and was drafted by Pittsburgh after their first pro season, in 1962. They were 26 years old and in the midst of their ninth pro season, almost exclusively spent as a reliever, when the Pirates recalled them from the Triple-A Columbus Jets. In their first two MLB appearances, Colpaert retired all nine batters they faced. In their second game, they received credit for a 6–5 victory over the Atlanta Braves on July 23, 1970, when they pitched a perfect eighth inning, retiring future Hall of Famers Henry Aaron and Orlando Cepeda in the process. They were largely effective as a reliever for the Pirates, with an earned run average of 2.89 heading into what would be their final MLB game on August 10. But on that day the New York Mets reached them for four earned runs on two hits and three bases on balls in only innings, ballooning their career ERA by more than three full points.
All told, Colpaert worked innings in the Majors, allowing nine hits, seven earned runs and eight bases on balls (two intentional), with six strikeouts. Their minor league career continued into 1974.

SD Croatia Berlin is a German football club from Berlin.
History
The club was founded in 1972 as the ethnically Croatian side NK Croatia Berlin and was renamed NK Hajduk Berlin in 1985. The association continued to grow through the late 1980s, merging with SC Bratstvo 1971 Berlin to become SC Bratstvo-Hajduk Berlin in 1987. The following year a number of smaller clubs (NK Livno, NK Velebit, NK Dinamo) came into the fold until finally a 14 January 1989 merger with SV Croatia 1987 Berlin spawned the present-day club.
SD Croatia Berlin became the first Croatian club in Germany to reach third tier competition when it was promoted to the Regionalliga Nordost after their 1998 Oberliga Nordost, Staffel Nord (IV) championship. SD Croatia Berlin spent only a single season at that level before suffering a series of relegations. They slipped to the Verbandsliga Berlin (V) in 2001, through the Landesliga Berlin (VI) in 2003, to the Bezirksliga Berlin (VII). In 2005 it rose back to the Landesliga, the seventh level since 2008, and returned to the Bezirksliga in 2010. Three successive promotions after three years in the Bezirksliga put them back in the Berlin-Liga (VI).
SD Croatia Berlin competed in the Croatian World Club Championship in 2007.

Voting to elect four members of the Lebanese parliament took place in the predominantly Shia Muslim Marjeyoun-Hasbaya constituency in southern Lebanon on March 31, 1968, part of the national general election of that year. Two of the seats of the constituency were earmarked for the Shia Muslim community, one for the Sunni Muslims and one for the Greek Orthodox (for more information about the Lebanese election system, see Elections in Lebanon). The constituency had 45,849 eligible voters, out of whom 23,224 voted. The polling day was marred by heavy rains.
Candidates
There were eleven candidates in the fray, with ten candidates contesting on three different tickets. The eleventh candidate contested on their own. The fight stood primarily between two tickets, each headed by a candidate from the al-As'ad family (a powerful Shiite family in the area).
Southern Bloc ticket
The main candidate of the al-As'ad family and heading one of the lists was Kamil al-As'ad, the leader of the Southern Bloc. They had been a longtime parliamentarian and minister at different occasions. Their running mates were Mamduh al-Abdallah (Shiite, incumbent parliamentarian), Ra'if Samarah (Greek Orthodox, lawyer) and Ali Madi (Sunnite, lawyer and former Minister of Education).
As'ad al-As'ad ticket
The dissident list was headed by As'ad al-As'ad, former diplomat and former director of the Ministry of Information. Their running mates were Ibrahim al-Abdallah (Shiite, journalist and ex-parliamentarian), Suhayl Shihab (Sunnite, ex-parliamentarian) and Iskandar Ghibril (Greek Orthodox, ex-parliamentarian, member of the Progressive Socialist Party).
Other candidates
Other candidates of leftist and nationalist tendencies, like Habib Sadiq, Ahmad Suwayd and Nuruddin Nuruddin, sought to challenge the dominance of feudal powers in the political life of the area. The latter belonged to the Syrian Social Nationalist Party.
Results
All four candidates on the Southern Bloc ticket were elected. Kamil al-As'ad was elected speaker of the Chamber of Deputies after the election. Candidates' vote totals were as follows:

Nanovisor - A JavaScript-based container that executes in consumer web browsers, providing visibility and control over both first and third party content and services.
The company was named to the visionary category of the Web Application Firewall magic quadrant by Gartner Group in September 2017.
Architecture
Instart's Digital Experience Cloud most commonly was deployed as a suite of cloud services in front of company's application servers or digital commerce servers. Instart's Digital Experience Cloud was independent of its Content Delivery Network (CDN). and as such works in conjunction with Instart's own CDN, or other CDNs such as Akamai and Fastly.
Instart was built with the understanding that third-party cloud services make up approximately 75% of modern web applications. To be able to control, protect and accelerate the entire application, including first and third party cloud services and content, Instart automatically injected a small ephemeral JavaScript-based container into every consumer web browser, which connects and coordinates with Instart's global cloud. The container provided visibility and control over all processing within the browser, including the ability to control first and third party http commands, HTML code and JavaScript code to improve application performance, consumer experience and security. The cloud-connected container also allowed Instart to shift the processing of third-party cloud services from the consumer browser to Instart's cloud servers.
History
The company was founded out of frustration with the slow speed of downloading and updating video games.
In the fall of 2014, the company started a $100 million contract buyout program for Akamai customers.
Instart was ranked by Business Insider as No. 1 among the 17 best startups to work for in America
In June 2018, the company shortened its name to Instart from Instart Logic. Instart was a shortening of "Instant Start", which reflected the company's founding mission of making digital applications faster.
Notable clients included Neiman Marcus, Cafe Media, Edmunds, Bonnier, Ziff Davis, CBS, Tronc, TUI Group, Telstra and Kate Spade.
Acquisitions
In February 2016, Instart acquired Kwicr, a leader in mobile application acceleration for Apple and Android platforms, for an undisclosed amount to strengthen its mobile application delivery and analytics capabilities.

Philippe Col (born 14 June 1956) is a French former professional footballer. As a player, they were a initially a forward but was later converted to a full-back.
After football
After their football career, Col was the manager of a real estate company in the Île-de-France region. They opted not to become a professional football manager like many other former players because they wished to lead a stable life in order for their children to succeed; they described coaching professional teams as a "mobile" occupation. Col henceforth settled in Rueil-Malmaison.

Liberation was a 20th-century pacifist journal published 1956 through 1977 in the United States. A bimonthly and later a monthly, the magazine identified in the 1960s with the New Left.
History
Liberation was founded, published, and edited by David Dellinger, Bayard Rustin, Sidney Lens, Roy Finch, and A. J. Muste out of New York City and Glen Gardner, New Jersey. Muste brought funding from the War Resisters League. For Rustin, the magazine was a major commitment of time and energy, raising money and meeting every week with Muste. They wrote to Martin Luther King Jr., who later wrote for the magazine. The June 1963 issue contained the first full publication of King's "Letter from Birmingham Jail" and the first version with that title.
Liberation: An Independent Monthly published its first issue in April 1956.
The editorial positions of the magazine were somewhat comparable to those of Dissent and Studies on the Left. David Dellinger's support of the Cuban Castro regime caused a rift at the magazine, with philosophy professor Roy Finch resigning as an editor. Editorially, Liberation supported the Cuban Revolution, and published C. Wright Mills' article "Listen, Yankee!"The magazine supported Students for a Democratic Society and opposed the Vietnam War.
The magazine supported Fellowship of Reconciliation (FoR) organizers, and its editorial offices at times served as a clearinghouse for activists conducting non-violent resistance.
Liberation occasionally ran investigative pieces. In early 1965, the magazine ran long articles by Vincent Salandria challenging the conclusions of the Warren Commission. In 1975 it published an article by Fred Landis on psychological warfare by the CIA in Chile.
A poem by Louis Ginsberg, father of Allen Ginsberg, was published in the magazine. Children's book author Vera Williams made the artwork for many of the covers.
By 1977 the magazine was edited by Jan Edwards and Michael Nill out of Cambridge, Massachusetts. It ceased publication not long after the departure of Dellinger.
Seeds of Liberation, a collection of Liberation articles, was edited by Paul Goodman and published in 1965.
Legacy
Liberation, together with Dissent, anticipated changes in the 1950s American political left, such as the early civil rights movement and nonviolent protest.

Frank Otto (October 7, 1936 – July 26, 2017) was an American educator, pioneer in computer-assisted language learning (CALL), entrepreneur, and the founding executive director of CALICO (the Computer-Assisted Language Instruction Consortium).
Early academic career
Otto received their PhD in 1960 from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. During their program there they conducted dissertation research in the area of foreign languages in the elementary school. With support from publisher Heath de Rochemont, a division of D.C. Heath, they investigated alternative approaches to staffing foreign language programs. Their projects involved working with the publisher's efforts to broadcast their Parlons Français program to over two million schoolchildren in the Midwest from a DC-3 airplane flying overhead. In addition to their degree in Educational Administration and Curriculum Development, Otto also received their state certification as a teacher of Spanish, History, and English.
Upon graduation from Wisconsin, they took a faculty position at Ohio State University in one of the first programs in foreign language education in the United States. During their time at Ohio State, Otto worked with such well-known figures in Foreign Language Education as Dr. Edward Allen and Dr. Paul Pimsleur. Pimsleur on more than one occasion agreed with Otto's opinion that foreign language instruction was eventually "going to wind up on the computer!”
In 1972 Otto accepted the position to serve as Director of the Language Institute at the University of the Americas in Puebla, Mexico. They also worked with the US embassies in Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Ecuador, Panama, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Columbia not only throughout Latin America but also in Asia, mainly in the Philippines. During that time in their career they also served on the Advisory Committee on Learning Technologies for the Developing World established by the Institute for International Research of the US Agency for International Development.
Brigham Young University
Following their work in Central and South America, Otto was recruited by Brigham Young University (BYU) in 1975 to help develop a program in ESL (English as a second language). While at BYU they participated in the development for the TICCIT system. of what could well be the first interactive multimedia program for teaching Spanish online.
During their time at BYU, Otto was instrumental in the founding of CALICO (the Computer-Assisted Language Instruction Consortium). As an important part of their work with CALICO, they also served as the founding editor of the CALICO Journal.
Entrepreneurship
Following their service at BYU and for CALICO, Otto retired and devoted full-time to their company CALI for the development of ELLIS, which stands for "English Language Learning Instruction System" as an allusion to Ellis Island, the port of entry for millions of immigrants to the United States of America. ELLIS was later purchased by Pearson Learning and is still available today from Pearson as ELLIS: A Digital Learning ELL Curriculum

The Auburn–LSU football rivalry, also known as the Tiger Bowl, is an American college football rivalry between the Auburn Tigers and the LSU Tigers. Both universities have been members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) since December 1932, but the rivalry dates back to 1901. Auburn and LSU have played every year since the SEC instituted divisional play in 1992.
Notable games
1902
LSU beat Auburn in a hard-fought game 5–0. Captain Henry Landry scored the game's only touchdown. "Nearly every business house in Baton Rouge closed at noon and everybody went to the game". The trip to Louisiana made some Auburn players sick.
1908
In 1908, both teams were undefeated and competing for the top spot in the SIAA. LSU beat Auburn 10–2, but both teams may claim SIAA championships, for LSU was charged with professionalism and for some stripped of the title. It was the only game LSU did not win by more than 20 points. “We won every game that fall except LSU,” Auburn star Walker Reynolds told Clyde Bolton in 1973. “But LSU had a pro team.”
The first touchdown came from LSU's John Seip. Later, Auburn's T. C. Locke blocked a punt, recovered by LSU quarterback and Hall of Famer Doc Fenton in the endzone for an Auburn safety. According to one source, Fenton was knocked unconscious by a spectator's cane as they tried to get out of the end zone. LSU made the second score using conventional football.
1988 - "The Earthquake Game"
In 1988, #4 Auburn traveled to Tiger Stadium with national title aspirations. Auburn (4-0) entered the game outscoring its opponents 161–44, but were held to just two field goals. Auburn's outstanding defense kept LSU scoreless through 58 minutes. However, with 1:47 left, QB Tommy Hodson found RB Eddie Fuller open on a crossing pattern for a touchdown on fourth and goal. Ironically, it was the same play Fuller had caught on 1st and goal, only to step out of the back of the end zone. The crowd eruption was so intense that it registered as an earthquake on the seismograph located in LSU's Howe-Russell Geoscience Complex, though much of the lore surrounding the game is largely apocryphal. Both Hodson and Fuller later said it was the most physical game of their college careers. College Football News ranks this game as the 17th best finish in the history of college football. Auburn would have likely played Notre Dame for the National Championship had they beaten LSU, as Auburn finished the season with six consecutive wins, giving up only 31 points in the process. Auburn and LSU shared the SEC crown though Auburn went to the Sugar Bowl.
1994
Auburn was on a 14-game winning streak when LSU traveled to Auburn in 1994, but it was LSU who led 23–9 entering the fourth quarter. LSU quarterback Jamie Howard threw five fourth quarter interceptions - three were returned for touchdowns - as Auburn extended their winning streak to 15 games with a 30–26 win. Auburn made one first down in the second half, yet scored 27 points in the comeback. Multiple players were hospitalized for dehydration after the game. After the loss Jamie Howard received multiple threats.
1996 - "The Barn Burner"
LSU defeated Auburn 19–15 in 1996 while the old Auburn Sports Arena, affectionately called "the Barn", burned to the ground across the street from Jordan–Hare Stadium. After scoring a touchdown, Auburn trailed 17–15 and attempted the two-point conversion for the tie. However, LSU intercepted the pass and returned it for a defensive two-point conversion and a 19–15 win. The cause of the fire was officially undetermined, though according to investigators the most probable cause was a grill placed too close to the building by tailgaters, possibly to take cover from heavy rainfall. The fire was shown during ESPN's national broadcast, flames being seen as high as the Jordan-Hare east upper-deck. The game was never delayed, and the Auburn public address announcer continually advised fans: "The flames [were] outside the stadium." Because of the fire and the thrilling finish, the game became known as the "Barn Burner" or "The Night The Barn Burned".
1999
On coach Tommy Tuberville's birthday, Auburn blew out LSU 41–7 during a rare day game in Baton Rouge. In celebration, Auburn players and coaches smoked cigars on the field at Tiger Stadium, much to the chagrin of LSU players and fans. The intensity of the rivalry grew with this game, and it was used as motivation in 2001 when LSU beat Auburn 27–14 on the way to their first SEC title since splitting it in 1988. Coach Gerry DiNardo was fired before the season ended.
2016
In 2016, unranked Auburn led #18 LSU by the score of 18-13 with 2:56 left in the game. LSU drove the ball 60 yards to the Auburn 10-yard line with less than 30 seconds remaining. After 3 unsuccessful plays, LSU faced 4th down with the game clock running and only a few seconds remaining. LSU QB Danny Etling quickly approached the line of scrimmage and snapped the ball to give their team one more chance for a victory. Etling avoided a sack by running to the sideline and threw the ball to the endzone where it was caught by WR DJ Chark with no time left on the clock. The referee signaled touchdown and the LSU players began to celebrate believing they had won the game. However, the referees quickly announced the previous play was under review. After further review, it was determined by the officiating staff that LSU QB Danny Etling did not snap the ball until after the game clock hit 0:00, meaning the game was over and the last play did not count. This ruling gave Auburn the 18-13 victory and LSU their 2nd loss in the first 4 games of the 2016 season. This rough start to the season along with the disappointment of the 2015 season, led to the firing of LSU head coach Les Miles the following Monday.
2017
In 2017, #8 Auburn led unranked LSU 20-0 in the 2nd quarter. After a few successful drives and defensive improvements, LSU shrunk Auburn's lead to 23-14 at the start of the 4th quarter. LSU continued their comeback with a 75 yard punt return for a touchdown by D.J. Chark and 2 field goals by kicker Conner Culp to clinch the victory with a 27-23 win over Auburn. This game remains as the largest comeback in the LSU-Auburn series.
2021
Auburn and first-year head coach Bryan Harsin travelled to Death Valley to play LSU for the first SEC contest of the 2021 season and completed a comeback from being down 13-0 to win 24-19. Auburn quarterback Bo Nix, who was benched the previous week against Georgia State in favor of backup quarterback and LSU transfer T.J. Finley (who made their first SEC start at Auburn the year prior, in a 48-11 Auburn victory on Halloween night), passed for 255 yards and 1 touchdown while running for 74 yards and another touchdown en route to snapping a 10-game losing steak in Tiger Stadium and securing Auburn's first win in Baton Rouge since Tommy Tuberville's first season as head coach in 1999.
Future
With Oklahoma and Texas joining the SEC no later than 2025, there is a chance Auburn and LSU will not play every year.
Game results
Miscellaneous
From 2000 to 2005, Auburn or LSU won or tied for the SEC West Division championship every season.
From 2000 to 2007, the home team won eight straight games. (Immediately before then, the road team had won four straight, from 1996 to 1999.)
The 2006 game was the lowest scoring contest between the two schools since 1935, when LSU defeated Auburn 7–3 in Auburn.
9 of the first 13 meetings were shutouts; however, neither has been shut out since.
LSU leads the series 31–24–1. LSU leads the series in games played in Baton Rouge and Montgomery, Alabama, with a 17–6–1 and 2–0 record, respectively. Auburn leads games played at Jordan–Hare Stadium (13-6), Birmingham, Alabama (3–2), and Mobile, Alabama (2–0). When the SEC expanded, Auburn and LSU were placed in the SEC's West Division. The Auburn–LSU game quickly became a highly anticipated and respected rivalry.

The white-naped xenopsaris (Xenopsaris albinucha), also known as the reed becard and white-naped becard, is a species of suboscine bird in the family Tityridae, the only member of the genus Xenopsaris. It is found in South America, in humid subtropical and tropical savanna climates in most of the countries east of the Andes: Venezuela, Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina. Living in open woodland and other open forest habitats, it is mostly sedentary, though some populations may be migratory. The species, which is closely related to becards and tityras, was thought to be either a tyrant-flycatcher or cotinga, before it was placed in Tityridae.
The bird is in length, with whitish undersides, a black crown, and grey-brown upperparts. The sexes are similar in appearance, though the females have duller upperparts. It feeds on insects in the foliage of trees and bushes, and sometimes on the ground. Nesting occurs in a simple cup nest placed in the fork of a tree. Both parents incubate the eggs and help feed the chicks. When the chicks fledge, the parents may divide up the brood to continue helping. The species is not common and little is known about it, but it is not considered in danger of extinction, and has been classified as of the least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.
Taxonomy and systematics
The white-naped xenopsaris was described in 1869 by the German-Argentine scientist Hermann Burmeister, based on a specimen collected near Buenos Aires. Burmeister originally placed it in the becard genus, Pachyramphus. It was moved to the monotypic genus Xenopsaris by Robert Ridgway in 1891, but was still known to be closely related to Pachyramphus. A 1989 study of anatomy identified Pachyramphus as a sister taxon to Xenopsaris, but the white-naped xenopsaris was kept in its own genus due to several morphological and behavioural differences, namely its smaller size, the shape of its legs, the length of its primary flight feathers, the lack of strong sexual dimorphism (differences between the sexes) and the construction of the nest.
Which family the species belonged to remained unresolved for over a century. According to the Handbook of the Birds of the World, Xenopsaris and its allies were "taxonomically problematic genera that have for more than a hundred years been shifted back and forth between the cotingas (Cotingidae) and the Tyrannidae". When placed with the tyrant-flycatchers, Tyrannidae, it was considered closely related to the genera Suiriri, Serpophaga and Knipolegus. The uncertainty was not confined to this species, as there was a general confusion about where to draw the lines between the cotingas, tyrant-flycatchers and manakins.
Resolution was provided by the same 1989 study that confirmed the link between Xenopsaris and Pachyramphus. In it, Xenopsaris and six other genera previously held in the three families were found to actually form a fourth family, later named Tityridae. This new family is where the genus is now placed by the South American Classification Committee of the American Ornithological Society. A 2007 study of mitochondrial DNA confirmed the white-naped xenopsaris' place in the Tityridae, and its close relationship to Pachyramphus, as well as the genus Tityra. These three genera were found to be more distantly related to a fourth genus Iodopleura (the purpletufts), although further studies are needed to understand the complete relationship between these four genera.
The genus name Xenopsaris was derived from the Ancient Greek word xeno, meaning "stranger", and Psaris, a synonym for Tiyra, based on the Ancient Greek for starling, described by Georges Cuvier in 1817. The specific name albinucha is from Latin and refers to the bird's white (albus) nape (nuchus). The species is also known as the reed becard, white-naped becard and simply xenopsaris.
There are two subspecies of white-naped xenopsaris; the widespread nominate subspecies, and the more restricted X. a. minor of Venezuela, which was described by Carl Eduard Hellmayr in 1920.
Description
The white-naped xenopsaris is smaller than the closely related becards and tityras, measuring in length and weighing around . The subspecies X. a. minor has the same plumage as the nominate subspecies, but is smaller; the wing-chord (measurement from the wrist-joint to the end of the wing) length of the nominate subspecies, for example, is compared to in X. a. minor.
The face, lores, throat, breast, belly and rump of this species are white; the undersides are tinged with grey on the chest and yellow on the belly. The crown is glossy black in males. The nape is pale grey with a grey-white to white band separating the crown from the back. The wings are dusky greyish brown with white edging on the inner remiges and wing-coverts. The tail is dusky brown, and the stout bill, iris and legs are black. The female is similar to the male, but is duller overall and has a chestnut-tinged crown. Juvenile birds resemble adults but have greyish napes and more chestnut in the crown, and the feathers of the back, rump and primaries are scalloped with ochre. The secondaries on the wing and the tail feathers are edged with white.
The song of this species is delicate, and does not carry far. It is most commonly heard during the rainy season, but can be heard at any time of the day. The call is described as a thin, high-pitched and hesitant "teep, tre'e'e'e'e'a eea wu'u'u'e'e'e-e-e-e-e-p" or a "twip, tsiweeé, tseee, ti-ti-ti-ti", according to the Handbook of the Birds of the World. The initial trill is described as rising and then falling, and the last trill is described as long. Birds may sometimes vary the pattern and only use part of the song. The species is also described as making a squeaky and undulating screech, and males are described as whistling on the nest. Foraging males have been observed making an ascending "shreee" every few seconds while hunting for insects.
The white-naped xenopsaris looks somewhat similar to the cinereous becard, which overlaps its range in Venezuela. The white-naped xenopsaris is smaller, with a longer tail, thinner bill, whiter underparts (instead of grey) and browner upperparts (rather than greyish) .
Distribution and habitat
The white-naped xenopsaris has a disjunct distribution. The southern population of the nominate subspecies is widespread from north-eastern Brazil through to Bolivia, Paraguay and northern Argentina and Uruguay. A separate population of the nominate is found in Guyana. The subspecies X. a. minor is found in west and central Venezuela, and probably extends into north-eastern Colombia.
The species is generally resident across its range, but sightings of solitary and silent birds have suggested that the species may be migratory in Bolivia and Brazil. A study published in 2005 suggested it was migratory in Santa Fe, Argentina, as the species was not observed in the area between March and September (the austral winter). In 2006 the species was reported for the first time in Peru, but it was unclear if this represented a vagrant escaping cold weather or a migrant, as the species is mostly uncommon across its range and that area is poorly studied ornithologically.
They occupy a variety of habitats across their range, including Caatinga scrubland, riparian (river) woodland, lightly wooded areas, the borders of open gallery forest and open areas with scattered trees. They usually live near water or damp areas, and range from sea-level to .
Behaviour
Diet and feeding
The white-naped xenopsaris feeds on insects, but no studies have yet been done on the diet of adults. Chicks in the nest are fed grasshoppers from the family Acrididae, mantidflies, praying mantises and mosquitoes. Adults typically hunt singly or sometimes in pairs, and breeding pairs can often be observed hunting well apart from each other. They are shy, generally quiet and inconspicuous. They typically hunt from a perch on the outer edge of the foliage of trees, watching for prey and then launching themselves to snatch prey off leaves. They also strike from a hovering position above foliage, and may chase prey acrobatically for some distance. They often feed near the ground and sometimes take prey from the ground as well as from vegetation.
Breeding
The species is territorial, with the males defending the territory. Nesting timing varies by location; in Venezuela it is reported to occur during the rainy season (June to September), and in Argentina during the austral summer (October to January). The nests are cup-shaped, across, high and deep. Nests have been recorded being constructed from fine dry grass, or woven plant fibre and a few rootlets. Nests are placed in the forks of branches up in trees tall. The clutch size is three eggs, which are greenish with brown spots. Both sexes incubate the eggs during the 14–15 day brooding period. The species has been described as very tame during this interval – staying on the nest even as researchers came within a few centimetres of the bird – but were very aggressive in attacking birds, like guira cuckoos, or other animals that came near the nest. The hatchlings are dark-skinned with grey down and pink mouths. Pink mouths in chicks are very unusual in suboscines.
Chicks hatch within 24 hours of each other. Six days after hatching, the chicks' eyes have opened and after eight days they are covered in whitish down. Chicks defecate outside of the nest by raising their tail to the side of the nest, so nests with older chicks are surrounded by faecal matter. Both parents feed and brood the chicks, taking it in turns. When one parent returns with food, it takes over brooding duties while the other leaves to hunt.
The chicks are fed by the parents for several days after fledging. The family may travel as a group or the parents may divide the brood, taking one or two chicks each.
Conservation status
Across its range, the white-naped xenopsaris is uncommon and patchily distributed. It has not been evaluated as threatened by the IUCN Red List, as it does not meet any of the criteria. The population is evaluated as being stable, as there is no evidence of any decline or extreme fluctuations. It also occupies an enormous range, estimated to be . For these reasons, it is evaluated as a species of the least concern.

The term opt-out refers to several methods by which individuals can avoid receiving unsolicited product or service information. This option is usually associated with direct marketing campaigns such as e-mail marketing or direct mail. A list of those who have opted out is called a Robinson list.
Telemarketing
The U.S. Federal Government created the United States National Do Not Call Registry to reduce the telemarketing calls consumers receive at home. Initially numbers listed on the registry were due to be kept for five years but will now remain on it permanently due to the Do-Not-Call Improvement Act of 2007, which became law in February 2008.
The UK's Direct Marketing Association operates a voluntary opt-out scheme through the Telephone Preference Service, which was established in 1995. While the service will reduce unsolicited calls it does not stop solicited calls, market research calls, silent calls or overseas calls.
Canada's National Do Not Call List operates an opt-out list which allows consumers to register their wishes not to have telemarketing calls. Charities, newspapers, and pollsters are exempt although each of these is required to keep their own do not call list that consumers can be added to at their request.
Australia has a national Do Not Call Register. The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) is responsible for the register under the Do Not Call Register Act 2006. In order to be included on the register, a telephone number must be used or maintained primarily for private or domestic purposes, or exclusively for transmitting and/or receiving faxes. Government body numbers and emergency services numbers are also able and numbers can be removed at any time.
E-mail marketing
In e-mail marketing, a clickable link or "opt-out button" may be included to notify the sender that the recipient wishes to receive no further e-mails. While 95% of all commercial e-mails from reputable bulk emailers with an unsubscribe feature indeed work in this manner, unscrupulous senders and spammers can also include a link that purports to unsubscribe a recipient; clicking the link or button confirms to the originator that the e-mail address used was a valid one, opening the door for further unsolicited e-mail.
Online advertising
Targeted advertising and behavioral targeting are a series of technologies and techniques used mainly in online advertising to increase the effectiveness of advertisements. By capturing data generated by website and landing page visitors, advertisements are placed so as to reach consumers based on various traits such as demographics, psychographics, behavioral variables (such as product purchase history), and firmographic variables or other second-order activities which serve as a proxy for these traits.
Opt-out cookies
Many of the biggest third-party ad-serving companies offer opt-out cookies to users.
Opt-out cookies are cookies created by ad-serving companies to enable the user to block and prevent the advertising network from installing future tracking cookies.
Opt-out cookies are server specific, meaning that they only block cookies of a specific
ad-serving company and won't block cookies from other companies. To do generalize blocking, the users must manage their cookies via their own browser's cookie settings.
Do Not Track HTTP header
Do Not Track (DNT) is an HTTP header field that requests that a web application or website to disable its direct or cross-site user tracking of an individual user.
The header field name is DNT and it currently accepts three values:
1, when the user does not want to be tracked (opt-out)
0, when the user consents to being tracked (opt-in)
Null (no header), when the user does not set a preference
DNT is not widely adopted by the industry, and honoring DNT requests is not obligatory.
Wi-Fi positioning system
Wi-Fi-based positioning systems take advantage of the rapid growth of wireless access points in urban areas and are used by companies like Google, Apple, and Microsoft, to obtain data about their customers' locations, in order to provide a better service. The localization technique is based on measuring the intensity of the received signal and access-point "fingerprinting". However, some users have expressed concern about their privacy being affected by this type of unsolicited positioning system, and have asked for opt-out alternatives.
Google suggested the creation of a unified approach for opting-out from taking part in Wi-Fi-based positioning systems. Suggesting the usage of the word "_nomap" (Underscore and nomap) append to a wireless access point's SSID to exclude it from Google's WPS database.
Postal service
Credit card offers
Each year American consumers receive several billion written offers of credit or insurance they did not request. In many cases, the senders have prescreened the recipients for creditworthiness and suitability using consumer credit records in the files of consumer reporting agencies.
The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) permits creditors and insurers to use CRA information as a basis for sending unsolicited firm offers of credit or insurance, also known as prescreened solicitations, to consumers who meet certain criteria, but only within limits specified in the act. The FCRA also provides a mechanism by which consumers can elect not to receive such solicitations by directing CRAs to exclude their names and addresses from lists provided by these agencies for sending prescreened solicitations. Consumers who choose to have their names removed from lists used for prescreened solicitations may well still receive offers of credit or insurance by mail or telephone, but such offers will not be based on the credit records maintained by the CRAs.
People are able to opt out of receiving any offers from U.S. national credit bureaus.
Unsolicited direct marketing mail (a.k.a. "junk mail")
In the United States, the Data & Marketing Association's (DMA) Mail Preference Service provides an opt-out service. The consumer's name is added to a "delete" file which is made available to direct-mail marketers. This process does not cover opting out of Bulk Mail also known as Standard mail or Current Resident Mail, which will require opting out on a company by company basis. There is a $2 charge to register online and there is a $3 charge to register by regular mail. There is another service to stop mail to deceased people. Registration will not stop mailings from organizations that are not registered with the DMA. DirectMail.com offers a similar service.

Garcinia magnifolia, also known as bebasajo or giant leaf madrono, is a flowering tree in the family Clusiaceae or Guttiferae.
Distribution
Garcinia magnifolia is native to Costa Rica, Panama, western Colombia, Ecuador, northern Peru, southern Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and northern Brazil.
Description
The tree rarely exceeds 20 feet (6 meters) in height and is dioecious but is capable of self-pollination. It is fairly cold tolerant, with mature trees surviving brief temperatures of 28 F (-2 C), and has evergreen leaves which are elliptical in shape. It often begins to produce fruit after 5-7 years of developing, and the fruit arils are edible, which have been described as being sub-acid to sour in flavor. The flowers develop in clusters on wood that is at least two years old. It is adaptable to many different soils but in neutral, alkaline, or deficient soils it may suffer from iron deficiency. It can grow in full shade, but fruiting may be limited. It does not tolerate salt but does tolerate moderate drought. It is also able to be grown in 15-25 gallon containers.
Uses
The fruit is occasionally eaten and it is planted as an ornamental.

The Leichhardt Wanderers are a rugby league club based at Leichhardt, New South Wales. They compete in the Sydney Combined Competition. Their jersey is traditionally predominantly Red and Black. In recent years they have included white in their jersey. There were a number of Leichhardt clubs in the early years of Rugby League - Leichhardt Royals played in the Balmain JRL in 1908 and won the NSWRL 3rd Grade premiership in 1911. This club's final season was 1922. Leichhardt Gladstone won the C Grade of the Western Suburbs JRL in 1914, its first season in Rugby League. These two clubs had previously played Rugby Union. In 1918, Leichhardt Wanderers was formed by persons associated with the Leichhardt Boxing Stadium. Gladstone and Wanderers had a keen rivalry firstly in the Western Suburbs JRL where Gladstone were premiers in 1918 and then in the Annandale and Glebe competitions and finally in the Balmain JRL. Gladstone disbanded in the early 1940's.ref>https://leichhardtwanderers.com.au/</ref>

Restitution Point () is a point marking the north side of the entrance to South Bay in Prince Olav Harbor, on the north coast of South Georgia. The name Factory Point, derived from the nearby whaling station (now no longer operating), was given for this feature by DI personnel in 1929. There is also a Factory Point at Leith Harbor, less than 20 nautical miles (37 km) to the NW. Since Factory Point in Leith Harbor is better known locally, it has been retained. To avoid confusion the name Factory Point is rejected for the feature now described, and a new name Restitution Point is approved. The S.S. years at Prince Olav Harbor before the shore station was built there.

Thomas "Burnfoot" Brown (27 May 1750 – 3 August 1825) was a British Loyalist during the American Revolution. Intending to become a quiet colonial landowner, they lived, instead, a turbulent and combative career. During the American Revolutionary War they played a key role for the Loyalist cause in the Province of Georgia as a Lt. Col in the King's Carolina Rangers. Following the overthrow of British rule and the Patriot victory in the Revolution, Brown was exiled first to British East Florida, and later to St. Vincent's Island in the Caribbean.
Early life
Thomas Brown was born in Whitby, Yorkshire, England on 27 May 1750 into a prosperous merchant family; their father Jonas owned a successful shipping company and claimed descent from Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu. In 1774, age 25, Thomas recruited colonists and indentured servants from Whitby and the Orkney Islands, and emigrated with them to the Province of Georgia. Financed by £3,000 of family capital, they established the community of Brownsborough and a 5,600 acre plantation northeast of present-day Augusta, anticipating life as a gentleman planter.
Revolution
Brown soon found themselves embroiled in the coming revolution. On 2 August 1775 a crowd of 130 Sons of Liberty confronted them at their house and demanded they pledge themselves to the Patriot cause. Brown requested the liberty to hold their own opinions, saying that they could "never enter into an Engagement to take up arms against the Country which gave them being", and finally met their demands with pistol and sword. The crowd seized them and struck them with the butt of a musket, fracturing their skull. Taken prisoner, they were tied to a tree where they were roasted by fire and scalped before being tarred and feathered. Brown was then carted through a number of nearby settlements and forced to verbally pledge themselves to the Patriot cause before being released. This mistreatment resulted in the loss of two toes and lifelong headaches.
The enraged Brown quickly recanted on their pledge and assumed leadership of backcountry Georgia loyalists, developing a plan to support Augusta area Tories with Indian allies from the West and a landing of British soldiers from the East. They helped bring the plan about by living with the Creeks in 1776 and 1777, gaining their confidence, and establishing a network spreading from Florida to the Carolinas. In 1779 they were appointed Superintendent of Creek and Cherokee Indians and continued their efforts to engage them in the conflict.
The King's Rangers
Brown came to lead a mounted Loyalist company styled as the King's (Carolina) Rangers, which over time developed into a uniformed and disciplined unit. Becoming a skilled commander himself, Brown was appointed the rank of provincial Lieutenant Colonel by Major General Augustine Prévost in July 1779. Their Rangers fought in Lt-Col. Archibald Campbell's 1778 invasion of Georgia, the 1779 Siege of Savannah, and the Loyalist occupation of Augusta in 1780 and 1781, as well as minor backcountry clashes. In September 1780, Brown maintained a stout defence against Elijah Clarke's surprise attack at the First Battle of Augusta, holding the fortified Mackay House until arrival of a relief force. On June 5, 1781, they were compelled to yield Fort Cornwallis in the Second Battle of Augusta after a spirited and creative defence. Nathanael Greene arranged to have them paroled and escorted to Savannah with their regular troops with the promise they would not re-enter war. Greene was afraid Brown would be killed by their troops in captivity.
Brown's campaign plan achieved temporary success, but ultimately failed due to tardy or insufficient support from local Tories and their Indian allies. Their war career was later vilified, but Cashin's research found no historical evidence that they did anything beyond their duty according to the recognized rules of war. It is unlikely that they hanged thirteen prisoners at the Mackay House with savage relish, rather they imposed (or condoned) a widely approved penalty against parole breakers. Brown angrily denied that they ever encouraged Indians to barbarous behaviour.
Exile to Florida and the Caribbean
In late 1782, Thomas Brown with several thousand Tory refugees from Charleston and Savannah relocated to British territory at St. Augustine, Florida. Fully expecting to settle permanently, the newcomers were shocked in 1783 by news that East Florida was ceded to Spain, and British citizens had eighteen months to depart. Even here Brown struck a blow by encouraging their Creek friends to cooperate with the new Spanish authorities in controlling American westward expansion.
The British government continued to provide compensation for dispossessed Tories. In recognition of their loyalism and wartime service, Brown was awarded with extensive tracts of land on the Caribbean islands of North and Middle Caicos. Scattered over 8,000 acres and encompassing thirteen different plantations, Brown raised cattle and cotton through the forced labour of more than 600 enslaved people.
Brown's next destination was Abaco Island in the Bahamas. Brown led Abaco Loyalists in protesting lack of representation in the local Assembly, but the point became moot as the Abaco and later Caicos Islands lands proved unprofitable.
In 1802 Brown returned to Britain and began petitioning for a substitute grant on St. Vincent Island. Their status as a former colonizer entitled them to a grant of 6,000 acres in November 1804. Between 1805 and 1806, Brown moved over 600 enslaved people from the Bahamas to their Grand Sable Plantation. In 1815 Brown used slave labour to construct the 360 foot long Black Point Tunnel to enable faster transport of sugar from the mills of Grand Sable Plantation to the wharf at Byrea.
Brown resided on St. Vincent Island until their death at Grand Sable Plantation in 1825.
In popular culture
Thomas Brown appears as a prominent character in "The Hornet's Nest," a novel written by former United States President and Georgia governor, Jimmy Carter.

In cloud computing a carrier cloud is a class of cloud that integrates wide area networks (WAN) and other attributes of communications service providers' carrier grade networks to enable the deployment of highly complex applications in the cloud. In contrast, classic cloud computing focuses on the data center, and does not address the network connecting data centers and cloud users. This may result in unpredictable response times and security issues when business critical data are transferred over the Internet.
History
The advent of virtualization technology and cost effective computing hardware as well as ubiquitous Internet connectivity enabled a first wave of cloud services starting in the first years of the 21st century.
But many businesses and other organizations hesitated to move more demanding applications from on-premises dedicated hardware into private or public clouds. As a response, communications service providers started in the 2010/2011 time frame to develop carrier clouds that address perceived weaknesses in existing cloud services. Weaknesses cited vary but often include possible downtime, security issues, high cost of custom software and data transfer, inflexibility of some cloud apps, poor customer and nonfulfillment of service level agreements (SLAs).
Characteristics
To enable the deployment of time-sensitive and business critical applications in the cloud, the carrier cloud is designed to match or even exceed the characteristics of on-premises deployments. Therefore, the carrier cloud is characterized by some or all of the following items:
Configurable, elastic network performance: Typical cloud computing solutions use the best effort public Internet to connect cloud users and data centers. This approach provides instant connectivity but does not offer control over network capacities, latencies, and jitter. Carrier clouds address these gaps with content delivery networks and/or dedicated virtual private networks (VPN) at OSI layers 1 (optical wavelengths), 2 (data link layer), and 3 (network layer). These VPNs can be configured to offer the desired performance parameters and exhibit the same type of elasticity for the network that regular clouds provide for servers and storage. To achieve the requested performance parameters, such as low latency, cloud applications can be (automatically) allocated to distributed data centers that are close enough to the cloud users.
Automatic resource placement: For a cloud with multiple data centers, information about both the data center and the connecting network is relevant for a decision of where to place cloud images and storage volumes. For this decision, carrier clouds can obtain relevant information about the network, e.g., using the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol.
High level of security and governance: Cloud application providers are subject to general and domain specific security, privacy, and governance requirements and regulations, such as the European Data Protection Directive and the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. For added security, the wide area network of the carrier cloud can provide segregated encrypted or unencrypted network links that are not accessible from the general Internet. At the data center, the carrier cloud provides e.g. virtual private servers, management processes, logs and documentation to fulfill security and governance rules.
Location control: Fundamentally, cloud users should not be concerned with the geographic location of their cloud resources. However, privacy and other regulations may mandate that certain types of data must not be sent outside a national jurisdiction or other geographical region.
Open APIs: Carrier clouds provide graphical user interfaces and Web application programming interfaces that allow cloud application providers to set up, manage, and monitor both, the data center and the WAN, of their cloud services.
Architecture
Carrier clouds encompass data centers at different network tiers and wide area networks that connect multiple data centers to each other as well as to the cloud users. Links between data centers are used, for instance, for failover, overflow, backup, and geographic diversity. Carrier clouds can be set up as public, private, or hybrid clouds. The carrier cloud federates these cloud entities, using a single management system to orchestrate, manage, and monitor data center and network resources as a single system.

John Tony Salazar (born July 21, 1953) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 2005 until 2011. A member of the Democratic Party, they were appointed Commissioner of the Colorado Department of Agriculture in the Cabinet of Governor John Hickenlooper in 2011, following theirs
electoral defeat in 2010. Salazar announced their retirement as Agriculture Commissioner in November 2014.
Early life, education and career
Salazar was born in Alamosa, Colorado, the son of Emma M. (Montoya) and Henry (Enrique) S. Salazar. Their younger brother is former Senator Ken Salazar.
Salazar served in the U.S. Army from 1973 to 1976, and is a farmer and rancher. Their formal education includes a Bachelor of Science degree in business administration from Adams State College in 1981. Salazar was the owner of an internet company, Spudseed.com, which marketed potatoes, as well as serving as a director of
Monte Vista Production Credit Union and Agro Engineering, Inc.
Salazar served on several Colorado public bodies including the Governor's Economic Development Advisory Board, the Rio Grande Water Conservation District and the Colorado Agricultural Leadership Forum. They also served on the Colorado Agricultural Commission from 1999 to 2002 before being elected to the Colorado House of Representatives from 2003 until 2004.
U.S. House of Representatives
Committee assignments
Committee on Appropriations
Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development
Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies
Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming
Political positions
Salazar was concerned with water rights in particular. They said their top priority on Capitol Hill was to ensure that water derived from the snow melt of Colorado's Western Slope would stay in their district instead of being sent to California or Nevada.
Though a Democrat, they exhibited conservative leanings. They opposed expanding gun control and supported permanent repeal of the inheritance tax and lower taxes. They also support allowing Americans to buy cheaper prescription drugs from Canada. They were a member of the conservative Blue Dog Democrats, leading them to oppose Democratic priority measures such as the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and the American Clean Energy and Security Act in 2009. During consideration of the Affordable Care Act, they voted in favor of the Stupak Amendment restricting federal funding of elective abortions. However, they also voted for the Senate version of the health care bill lacking the Stupak Amendment language.
As a veteran, a son of a veteran, and father of a child serving in the Colorado National Guard as of 2004, Salazar was also vocal against cuts to veterans' benefits. Salazar introduced the Stolen Valor Act of 2005, designed to protect the integrity of medals, to the House of Representatives, which they have cited as their best achievement in politics.
Salazar was considered for the post of Secretary of Agriculture by Barack Obama but Tom Vilsack was chosen instead.
Political campaigns
2004
Salazar was first elected to the United States House of Representatives in 2004. Their election to succeed retiring Republican Scott McInnis was one of the most contested House elections of the year. Salazar defeated Greg Walcher who had attacked Salazar as being soft on illegal immigration, while Salazar criticised Walcher for their previous support of a failed 2003 referendum which they said would have diverted water from the district, an important issue in western Colorado. In a year when Republicans made gains, John Salazar was only one of three Democratic pick-up seats in the House of Representatives.
2006
John Salazar was re-elected in 2006 after their first term in Congress defeating Republican Scott Tipton. John Salazar raised almost three times as much money as Tipton and won over 60% of the vote, including more Republican areas of the district. Salazar had campaigned as a moderate, middle of the road candidate, with the opinion polls having shown them ahead in the election.
2008
Salazar won in 2008 with a similar margin as 2006 defeating rancher and county commissioner Wayne Wolf. Salazar had a massive fundraising advantage over Wolf who only had about $16,000 for the campaign.
2010
Salazar was defeated for re-election by Republican Scott Tipton. Tipton had unsuccessfully challenged Salazar in 2006. Libertarian Gregory Gilman and Independent Jake Segrest were also on the ballot; Independents John W. Hargis, Sr. and James Fritz qualified as write-in candidates.
Electoral history
Personal life
Salazar is married to Mary Lou Salazar and has three children: Esteban, Miguel and Jesus. They live in Manassa, Colorado.
Salazar's younger brother, Ken Salazar, is a former United States Senator from Colorado and the former Secretary of the Interior appointed by President Barack Obama.

The national flag of Botswana (Setswana: folaga ya Botswana) consists of a sky blue field cut horizontally in the centre by a black stripe with a thin white frame. Adopted in 1966 to replace the Union Jack, it has been the flag of the Republic of Botswana since the country gained independence that year. It is one of the few African flags that utilises neither the colours of the Pan-Africanist movement nor the colours of the country's leading political party.
History
In 1885, Bechuanaland became a protectorate of the United Kingdom within its colonial empire. This occurred after the leaders of the Tswana people negotiated with the British to offer them protection from the Boers, who were invading their lands from the neighbouring South African Republic. In spite of this newfound protection, South Africa continued to pressure the British to allow them to annex Bechuanaland into their union. This did not occur due to widespread opposition from the Batswana people, and Bechuanaland gained independence from Britain in 1966; the new nation was renamed Botswana.
Before it gained independence, Botswana did not have its own distinctive colonial flag, with the flag of the United Kingdom serving as the de facto flag of the protectorate. When Botswana's national flag was created in 1966, it was symbolically designed to contrast with the flag of South Africa, since the latter country was ruled under an apartheid regime. Hence, the black stripe with the white frame came to epitomise the peace and harmony between the people of African and European descent who reside in Botswana. The new flag was first hoisted at midnight on 30 September 1966, the day Botswana became an independent country.
Design
The colours of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. The light blue represents water—specifically, in its form of rain, as it is a precious resource in Botswana, which relies on agriculture and suffers from frequent droughts due to the dry and arid climate of the Kalahari Desert. The blue also alludes to the motto featured on the coat of arms of Botswana—Pula, which means "Let there be rain" in Setswana—as well as life, which is sustained by water.
The black band with the white frame has two meanings. Firstly, they symbolise the harmony and cooperation between the people of different races who live in Botswana, as well as the racial diversity of the country. Furthermore, they represent the stripes of the zebra, the national animal of Botswana.

Charles Compton William Cavendish, 3rd Baron Chesham, (13 December 1850 – 9 November 1907), styled The Honourable Charles Cavendish between 1863 and 1882, was a British soldier, courtier and Conservative politician. They served as the last Master of the Buckhounds under Lord Salisbury from 1900 to 1901.
Early life
A member of the Cavendish family headed by the Duke of Devonshire, Chesham was the eldest son of William Cavendish, 2nd Baron Chesham and their wife Henrietta Frances Lascelles, daughter of William Lascelles. They were educated at Eton College.
Political career
Lord Chesham took their seat in the House of Lords on their father's death in 1882.
In November 1900, they were appointed Master of the Buckhounds under Lord Salisbury. However, as Chesham was serving in South Africa, Lord Churchill was appointed to act as Master of the Buckhounds in their absence. Chesham remained Master until the office was abolished the following year. They were admitted to the Privy Council in July 1901, and also served as a Lord of the Bedchamber to the Prince of Wales (later King George V) from 1901 to 1907.
Military career
They entered the Coldstream Guards in 1870. Three years later, they joined the 10th Royal Hussars as a captain, and 1878 joined the 16th Lancers. Chesham held an appointment as lieutenant colonel of the Royal Buckinghamshire Hussars Yeomanry from 1889. In January 1900 they were appointed in command of the 10th battalion of the Imperial Yeomanry (which included companies from Buckinghamshire, Berkshire and Oxfordshire), serving in the Second Boer War, and received the temporary rank of colonel in the army. They left Southampton on board the SS Norman in early February 1900, and arrived in South Africa the following month.
Later that year, they were promoted to brigadier general and in November 1900 appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) for their services (he was invested by King Edward VII at Marlborough House on 25 July 1901 during a brief visit to London). From 1901 they were inspector general of Imperial Yeomanry in South Africa, with the local rank of major-general. They relinquished their commission and was granted the honorary rank of major-general in the Army on 22 January 1902, leaving South Africa the following month by the steamer . After their return to the United Kingdom, they were in late April 1902 appointed Inspector General of Imperial Yeomanry (at Army Headquarters) with the temporary rank of major-general whilst so employed.
Lord Chesham was appointed to honorary colonel of the Buckinghamshire Imperial Yeomanry (Royal Bucks Hussars) on 19 March 1902.
There is a bronze statue commemorating their life and deeds located in the Market Square in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, which has Grade II Listed Building status.
Family
Lord Chesham married, in 1877, their second cousin Lady Beatrice Constance Grosvenor (1858–1911), second daughter of Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster. They had two sons and two daughters:
2nd Lieutenant the Honourable Charles William Hugh Cavendish (13 September 1878 – 11 June 1900), in the 17th Lancers, killed in action near Pretoria during the Second Boer War
Honourable Lilah Constance Cavendish (20 March 1884 – 27 April 1944), married 1903 Sir Mervyn Manningham-Buller, 3rd Baronet (1876–1956), mother of Reginald Manningham-Buller, 1st Viscount Dilhorne
Honourable Marjorie Beatrice Cavendish (18 September 1888 – 2 July 1897)
John Compton Cavendish, 4th Baron Chesham (13 June 1894 – 26 April 1952)
Lady Chesham joined their husband in South Africa in April 1900, travelling there on the SS Dunottar Castle with their two sisters the Duchess of Teck and the Marchioness of Ormonde. They were appointed a Lady of Grace of the Order of St. John (DStJ) in July 1901, and in December the same year received the decoration of the Royal Red Cross (RRC) for their services with the Imperial Yeomanry Hospital during the Boer War.
Lord Chesham was killed in November 1907 a after a fox-hunting accident near Daventry. They were thrown from their horse and suffered a dislocated neck. They were succeeded in the barony by their second but eldest surviving son John, then aged 13. After their death, in 1910, Lady Chesham remarried Maj. John Alexander Moncreiffe , son of Sir Thomas Moncreiffe, 7th Baronet.

The Wenzbach (German, 'Wenz brook') is a small river, which rises in the district of Großhesselohe in the municipality Pullach and in the neighboring district of Thalkirchen in southern Munich, which flows from the left into the Floßkanal.
History
Adolf Wenz (1840–1927), namesake of the settlement and the stream, ran a clinker brick factory below the Großhesseloher Brücke. In old mentions, the stream was therefore called Wenzscher Fabrikbach or simply Fabrikbach.
On Thursday, 17 October 1946, US soldiers scattered the ashes of eleven cremated war criminals of the Nuremberg trials in the Wenzbach, a small tributary of the River Isar to prevent the establishment of a permanent burial site which might be enshrined by nationalist groups.

Velasco Glacier () is a glacier about 5 nautical miles (9 km) long flowing west from Walgreen Coast toward the Backer Islands. It was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) after Miguel G. Velasco, a United States Geological Survey (USGS) computer specialist, and part of the USGS team that compiled the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer 1:5,000,000-scale maps of Antarctica in the 1990s.

The Women's Reserve Camouflage Corps was a specialized unit of American women artists formed during World War I to design and test camouflage techniques for the military. They created both clothing and disguised military equipment for the war effort. Disbanded at the end of the war, women volunteered again to work on camouflage projects in World War II.
History
In 1917, British artist Norman Wilkinson submitted a proposal to the Royal Navy to paint optical illusions of geometric shapes, known as dazzle camouflage, to disguise ships. Their designs were created in their London studio by 5 designers and painted by a crew of 11 women artists, known as camoufleurs. Between the spring of 1917 and November 1918, the women had painted more than 2,300 vessels. Thousands of women in France were employed as camoufleurs painting guns for the British army by 1917, while others worked with the American forces, making nets to hide artillery and garlands to string through trees and uniforms. For the nets and garlands, brown and green burlap, dyed to match the foliage, was sewn by the women into wire and fishnet tenting to drape over or in front of machinery. The uniforms covered soldiers from head to foot in a burlap suit embellished with raffia palm fronds. The French women also used dazzle camouflage to disguise buildings at the American camp.
As men were called to the military front, American women artists began to replace men who had worked on camouflage projects for the military. British and French women camoufleurs inspired the United States to begin training women for the Women's Reserve Camouflage Corps, though the initial female applicants were refused by the military. In November and December, 1917, newspapers began advertising for women artists with experience as sculptors, or scene and landscape painting, to join a training program organized in Marshfield Hills, Massachusetts. By November, around 75 women had joined the venture and were increasing at a rate of 1 to 4 women per day. The unit hired Lieutenant Ledyard Towle to train the women, and was soon recruiting women as photographers as well, to verify differences between photographic and observed deceptions. On April 1, 1918, the Women's Reserve Camouflage Corps were formed by about forty artists from New York and Philadelphia.
The women initially focused their efforts on creating apparel for gunners, scouts, and snipers that made them blend in with the landscape's trees or rocks. Weekly field trips to Westchester County and parks such as Van Cortlandt Park and Kykuit, the Rockefeller family estate, served as testing grounds for the women to try out their designs, trying to see if they could fool passerby or if their photographs showed they had succeeded in making people disappear from view. They eventually moved from clothing to painting dazzle camouflage on ambulances, ships and tanks. Units formed in various places throughout the United States, including Iowa, Minnesota, North and South Dakota, and Philadelphia.
Women participating in the program, which was sponsored through the National League for Women's Service, were volunteers and paid their own expenses. Margaret DeVoe White a noted sculptor who pioneered a wax-relief type of sculpture, headed the units formed in Iowa, the Dakotas and Minnesota. Other known camoufleurs include Eleanor Arnett, Dorthea Fischer, Katherine Munoz and Elizabeth Pilsbury, all of Philadelphia; Clara Lathrop Strong of Massachusetts; and Clara Armstrong, Edith Barry, Marguerite Becht, Diana Cauffman, Constance Cochrane, Edith Cohen, Evelyn Curtis, Frances Forbush, Sarah Furman, Patricia Gay, Myra Hanford, Helen Harrison, Helen F. Hobart, Helen Kalkman, Louise Larned, Ellen Macmillan, H. Rosalie Manning, Marie H. Moran, Dorothy Murphy, Rose Stokes, Eloise P. Valiant, Gertrude Welling and Bertha Wilson, all whom worked in New York City.
Legacy
Though the Camouflage Corps were disbanded after the war ended, during World War II, women returned to work on camouflage netting. Women in Australia, Britain, New Zealand and the United states worked on nets in their homes before their fabrics were sent to the front lines.

Dhuweila is an archaeological site in the Badia of eastern Jordan. It contains the remains of a small hunting camp, which was first built and occupied in the Early Neolithic and reoccupied, after a hiatus, in the Late Neolithic. The Early Neolithic occupation dates to between 7360 and 7080 BCE.
The site was sporadically revisited in later periods. One of these episodes, dating to the Chalcolithic or Early Bronze Age (), is notable for leaving some of the earliest known traces of cotton fabric in the world.
The site was first recorded by Alison Betts in 1981, and excavated in 1983 and 1986.
Later occupations and early cotton
In the millennia following the abandonment of the Late Neolithic settlement, Dhuweila was occasionally revisited by nomadic Bedouin, presumably because of the shelter offered by the prehistoric ruins. One of these visits left behind several fragments of lime plaster containing impressions of woven cloth. Microscopic fibres recovered from these pieces were identified as domestic cotton and directly dated to the Chalcolithic or Early Bronze Age (). At that time, cotton was not widespread, and must have been imported from either Nubia or the Indus Valley. Betts and colleagues conclude that it was probably brought to the site as scraps of waste fabric acquired from villages elsewhere, indicating the long-distance connections North Arabian nomads had with other cultures at the time. The remains from Dhuweila were the earliest known evidence of cotton fabric until 2002, when earlier examples were discovered at Mehrgarh in Pakistan.
Nomads also left many Safaitic inscriptions in the vicinity of Dhuweila, dating to the 1st century BCE to the 4th century CE. One alludes to a conflict between local tribes and the Nabataeans:

"Vehicle" is a song recorded by American rock band The Ides of March for their debut studio album of the same name (1970). It was released as the lead single from the album in March 1970 through Warner Bros. Records. Written by vocalist and frontman Jim Peterik, the song is about a girl that often used them for their mode of transportation, leading Peterik to surmise that they were little more than them "vehicle". The arrangement includes a distinctive horn section riff, which caused some listeners to mistake the band for Blood, Sweat and Tears, who were also popular in that era.
"Vehicle" was a commercial success, and was purported to be the fastest-selling single in the history of Warner Bros. at that time. It peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US, while reaching the top 5 in Canada and just outside the top 30 in the United Kingdom. Despite this, the Ides of March never had another hit single, leaving them one-hit wonders. Peterik, however, was to go on to found the rock group Survivor, and become an extremely successful songwriter.
Background
Peterik wrote "Vehicle" as a tongue-in-cheek joke, having been initially inspired by anti-drug pamphlets passed out to high-schoolers. They expanded on the song's genesis in a piece for The Wall Street Journal:
Peterik had an on-again/off-again relationship with the woman after the song came out, and they eventually wed.
Fourteen seconds of the completed "Vehicle" master tape (primarily the guitar solo) was accidentally erased in the recording studio. The missing section was spliced in from a previously discarded take.
Chart performance
It rose to number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart the week of May 23, 1970, behind "American Woman" by the Guess Who. It was considered to be the fastest-selling single in Warner Bros. Records history at that time.

Jim Arvanitis is a Greek-American martial artist and professional trainer of Mixed Martial Arts/Hybrid Reality Combat based on the pankration model, and author of several books and videos relating to pankration.  They are considered Pankration's Renaissance Man and the founder of Neo-Pankration, a blend of the remnants of the ancient pankration and elements found in modern sources such as Western boxing, savate, Greco-Roman wrestling, Muay-thai, and combat judo. They hold the rank of Great Grandmaster, 11th Dan from the World Pankration Dan Ranking.
Arvanitis was featured on the cover of Black Belt magazine in the November 1973 issue. This was the first exposure of pankration's history and evolution to the global martial arts community. Jim has since appeared on multiple covers and in hundreds of articles over the past forty years, and has received several awards for their efforts and contributions.
Early career
Jim Arvanitis was born in the Greater Boston area, the son of a Greek-immigrant father who instilled ethnic pride in them from an early age. They attended Greek school to learn the language and became enchanted with the myths and legends of the culture. Athletics played an important role in the family. Arvanitis was a decorated high school athlete in track and basketball for which they set a city league record for points scored in a single game (68) and in a season. They also set school records for pushups and pullups.
Their passion, however, was combat sports and learning to defend themselves mainly due to an incident where they were bullied by three older boys. They began learning Western wrestling at age seven and boxing some years later, becoming a champion in their weight division in both while competing throughout the Northeast. Arvanitis' interest in grappling brought them in contact with many former professional wrestlers from the old NWA and World Wrestling Federation (now WWE) including the likes of Lou Thesz, Bruno Sammartino, and Walter "Killer" Kowalski. They would come into their father's restaurant for dinner whenever they were in town to perform, and Jim would eagerly discuss wrestling moves with them at length. They took a liking in them and invited them to work out with them. Although they realized that the matches were "worked" they found that many were proficient in catch wrestling which is what they focused on in their training sessions. Arvanitis later took an interest in martial arts but rather than studying the more popular Asian styles they opted for Thai boxing (muay-Thai), savate, and combat judo. They found these more to their liking and much more pragmatic than the rigid horse stances and prearranged forms of Taekwondo and kung-fu. Jim also immersed themselves into extensively reading about many other fighting systems of different cultures.
Opposed to the more conventional stylized methods, Arvanitis' focus was directed more toward totality in combat. By 1969 they had assimilated their techniques and training into a cohesive system and began researching the roots of martial arts, especially of their own ethnicity. It was during this time that they learned of pankration, the "all-powers" fighting sport of their ancestors. It became their passion to rebuild the vanished legacy from the ground up by using ancient artwork and prose as a blueprint implemented with their more contemporary studies.
Upon graduating from college Jim married the former Chrystine Gardner. They would later have two sons, Brandon and Bryson. Arvanitis pursued a teaching career in mathematics but had wanted to promote their art on a full-time basis. They opened their first Spartan Academy in 1971 in the greater Boston area, and continually gave public demonstrations throughout much of New England to attract students.
Arvanitis insisted from the start that their personal development was not an exact replication of the original pankration. Of more importance to them was its conceptual foundation of total fighting freedom and functional efficiency to end a conflict quickly. They initially called their art Mu Tau but later dropped it in favor of pankration, and more precisely, neo-pankration. To further distinguish it they modified the pronunciation from the native Greek pahn-gra-tee-ahn to the more anglicized pan-cray-shun.
Owing to their Greek heritage, their effort to reinstate pankration was only partially due to ethnic pride but more to their sincere desire to forge a new path in the martial arts by combining things that worked and discarding those which did not. There were no prearranged forms, bowing, or belt ranks but an emphasis on conditioning and applying one's tools against a live opponent in hard contact sparring. Arvanitis's system was geared to reality-based street fighting but was very similar to today's MMA in that it included standup and ground tactics, along with an amalgam of strikes, joint locks, takedowns, throws, and anything else that they felt was effective.
In 1973, prominent martial arts journalist and weapons expert Massad Ayoob learned of Arvanitis and approached them for an interview. Ayoob was intrigued by Jim's knowledge of pankration and their diverse skill-set. They teamed up to do a story for Black Belt magazine and, at Ayoob's urging, Arvanitis headed to Los Angeles to demonstrate at their offices. Their performance was so dynamic that they were featured on the cover of the very next issue. Upon their return from the West Coast Jim continued to work extensively on knife defenses and handgun disarms with Ayoob. This became an essential part of their "battlefield" component.
Later work
It was Arvanitis' contention that the ancient Greeks were the first to have created a system of integrated fighting skills for use in competition. They also hinted that pankration might have even influenced the development of karate in the orient due to Alexander the Great's conquests into India. This enraged the martial arts community who felt that pankration was too "crude" to have any relevance. Arvanitis was content that the controversy they started made people at least think about the possibility, and not merely cling to the common belief that it was the Asians who were the sole inventors of martial arts.
Jim realized that to increase awareness of this, teaching classes was not enough. They looked to the media to help with this objective and wrote many articles, books, and videos to spread the word. In many ways the ability to express themselves through the written word became as useful as their physical prowess.
Arvanitis continually modified the techniques they adopted from martial arts and combat sports so that they would work in real-world combat. Rather than practicing on padded mats all the time, they and their students would train and spar on sand to simulate the ancient skamma (sandpit) arena of the ancients, and on hard pavement.
As an instructor, Arvanitis was very selective in their students emphasizing quality rather than quantity. With this philosophy in mind and the fact that mixed fighting was not yet popular, their following was always small but constant. They consisted of a hardcore group who were looking for something more realistic in terms of a no-holds-barred street brawl. Through the years they would teach at their exclusive academies and conduct seminars in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. In 1992, Arvanitis prepared military special forces in hand-to-hand close quarter combat for Operation Desert Storm.
Training and discipline
A well-known physical fitness devotee, Arvanitis has trained daily for most of their life, stretching, lifting weights, and running between six and eight miles on a daily basis. To develop their striking tools they have long utilized various equipment much of which was unseen in martial arts in the early days: small plastic and rubber balls suspended from the ceiling for accuracy; for timing, the double-end bag; and for power an assortment of customized heavy bags. With their understanding of body mechanics they were able to generate a large amount of force in their blows. Many who held focus gloves and Thai pads for them to hit claim that the impact of their punches and kicks dislocated their shoulders.
Arvanitis was always eager to test themselves and was also involved in numerous real-life scrapes. Coupled with a high energy level was an intense discipline for working out either alone or with partners. Jim sparred all kinds of opponents, from boxers, kickboxers, and karate black belts to wrestlers. Some outweighed them by more than sixty pounds. In sparring they advocated protective gear in order to simulate realistic conditions without risking serious injury. Those who trained with them have often said that they were simply at "another level." One of their top followers remarked that they were challenged frequently at their school, and few lasted more than a few minutes against them in impromptu matches. Mas Ayoob once stated in another 1970s article that "Jim Arvanitis was possibly the finest total combat athlete that America had yet produced."
World records and special feats
Arvanitis' athleticism is reflected in their strength and endurance. They hold world records for their signature thumb pushups setting the first in 1977 with 45 in 51 seconds, and then three years later topping that mark on the nationally televised Guinness Game World Records Show completing 61 in 47 seconds. Jim also demonstrated up to seventeen consecutive one-arm thumb pushups on television talk shows throughout the 1980s. Other accomplishments include two-finger pushups on one arm, doing thumb pushups with their arms extended in front of their head, holding a static pushup position on their thumbs for several minutes, and doing their thumb pushups with their feet elevated on a chair.
Awards
Jim Arvanitis has received numerous international Hall of Fame induction awards for their accomplishments including Historical Figure, Grandmaster of the Year, and Living Legend. They were named Black Belt magazine's Instructor of the Year in 2009 and International Man of the Year by the World Head of Family Sokeship Council in 2010. In 2000, their former home state of New Hampshire voted them Athlete of the Century.  They are also among the elite martial artists in the world enshrined in the Martial Arts History Museum Hall of Fame.

RNLB H F Bailey (ON 670) was the first Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat powered by a motor, that served from Cromer Lifeboat Station.
Description
The lifeboat was built in 1923 by J. Samuel White at Cowes on the Isle of Wight. The lifeboat was powered by an 80 bhp Weyburn DE6 engine and was a Norfolk and Suffolk-class lifeboat. They were and long with a breadth of
Donor
The Cromer station had four motor-powered lifeboats all called H F Bailey, after the donor, a Mr Henry Francis Bailey of Brockenhurst, a London merchant who was born in Norfolk and had died in 1916.
New boathouse
To accommodate this new motor lifeboat a new lifeboat house and slipway were built on the end of the Cromer Pier. The planning and building of this new boathouse was carried out three years before the arrival of H F Bailey and was ready on the day that the new lifeboat arrived in the town. The new house was long and wide. The house had a solid concrete floor. The placing of this house at the end of the towns pier allowed the new lifeboat to be launched at all states and conditions of the tide, and with the pier itself from the shore line plus the of the boathouse and a further of slipway meant that the lifeboat when launched would be well clear of the rocks and groynes along Cromer's beach front. The new lifeboat house cost £32,000. This boathouse remained in constant use until 1995 finally being replaced with a new station in 1999. The 1923 station now resides at Southwold.
Service and rescues
H F Bailey (ON 670) was the Cromer No. 1 boat on station for just one year but due to problems with their launch and recovery, on the slipway, they were transferred to Great Yarmouth & Gorleston on 5 May 1924, where they served until 1939

The Bell of Good Luck () is a large bell located in Foquan Temple () in Pingdingshan, Henan, China. It is close to the Spring Temple Buddha, the world's tallest Buddha statue. The bell weighs 116 metric tons (255,736 lbs.), and is 8.108 metres in height and 5.118 metres in diameter at its widest point. The Bell of Good Luck therefore, at the time of its construction, claimed the title of the heaviest functioning bell in the world.
The bell was cast in December 2000 and first rung at midnight on New Year's Eve the same month. The bell's shoulder section is adorned with 36 lotus petal patterns.

Moose is an extension of the object system of the Perl programming language. Its stated purpose is to bring modern object-oriented language features to Perl 5, and to make object-oriented Perl programming more consistent and less tedious.
Features
Moose is built on top of Class::MOP, a metaobject protocol (a.k.a. MOP). Using the MOP, Moose provides complete introspection for all Moose-using classes.
Classes
Moose allows a programmer to create classes:
A class has zero or more attributes.
A class has zero or more methods.
A class has zero or more superclasses (a.k.a. parent classes). A class inherits from its superclass(es). Moose supports multiple inheritance.
A class has zero or more method modifiers. These modifiers can apply to its own methods, methods that are inherited from its ancestors or methods that are provided by roles.
A class does zero or more roles (also known as traits in other programming languages).
A class has a constructor and a destructor.
A class has a metaclass.
Attributes
An attribute is a property of the class that defines it.
An attribute always has a name, and it may have a number of other defining characteristics.
An attribute's characteristics may include a read/write flag, a type, accessor method names, delegations, a default value and lazy initialization.
Roles
Roles in Moose are based on traits. They perform a similar task as mixins, but are composed horizontally rather than inherited. They are also somewhat like interfaces, but unlike some implementations of interfaces they can provide a default implementation. Roles can be applied to individual instances as well as Classes.
A role has zero or more attributes.
A role has zero or more methods.
A role has zero or more method modifiers.
A role has zero or more required methods.
Extensions
There are a number of Moose extension modules on CPAN. there are 855 modules in 266 distributions in the MooseX namespace. Most of them can be optionally installed with the Task::Moose module.
Examples
This is an example of a class Point and its subclass Point3D:
package Point;
use Moose;
use Carp;
has 'x' => (isa => 'Num', is => 'rw');
has 'y' => (isa => 'Num', is => 'rw');
sub clear {
my $self = shift;
$self->x(0);
$self->y(0);
}
sub set_to {
@_ == 3 or croak "Bad number of arguments";
my $self = shift;
my ($x, $y) = @_;
$self->x($x);
$self->y($y);
}
package Point3D;
use Moose;
use Carp;
extends 'Point';
has 'z' => (isa => 'Num', is => 'rw');
after 'clear' => sub {
my $self = shift;
$self->z(0);
};
sub set_to {
@_ == 4 or croak "Bad number of arguments";
my $self = shift;
my ($x, $y, $z) = @_;
$self->x($x);
$self->y($y);
$self->z($z);
}
There is a new set_to() method in the Point3D class so the method of the same name defined in the Point class is not invoked in the case of Point3D instances. The clear() method on the other hand is not replaced but extended in the subclass, so both methods are run in the correct order.
This is the same using the MooseX::Declare extension:
use MooseX::Declare;
class Point {
has 'x' => (isa => 'Num', is => 'rw');
has 'y' => (isa => 'Num', is => 'rw');
method clear {
$self->x(0);
$self->y(0);
}
method set_to (Num $x, Num $y) {
$self->x($x);
$self->y($y);
}
}
class Point3D extends Point {
has 'z' => (isa => 'Num', is => 'rw');
after clear {
$self->z(0);
}
method set_to (Num $x, Num $y, Num $z) {
$self->x($x);
$self->y($y);
$self->z($z);
}
}

Julia Abigail Fletcher Carney (pen names, Julia, Minnie May, Frank Fisher, Sadie Sensible, Minister's Wife, Rev. Peter Benson's Daughter; April 6, 1823 – November 1, 1908) was an American educator, poet, author, and editor. Remembered for their poem "Little Things", many of their poems were set to music and published in school textbooks, and used in church hymn-books for more than half a century. They died November 1, 1908, in Galesburg, Illinois.
Carney had charge of the "Poet's Corner" in the Boston Trumpet. They furnished articles, both prose and verse, for the Christian Freeman when it was established. Something by them appeared in almost every number of the Rose of Sharon, and also in the Lily of the Valley. In the Universalist Miscellany, their articles bore the pen name of "Rev. Peter Benson's Daughter". In 1840, they commenced writing for the Ladies' Repository, under the signature of "Julia." They were a regular contributor to the Boston Olive Branch. They also wrote two volumes, published by J. M. Usher, entitled Gifts from Julia, and a series of Sunday school question books. Poetry of the Seasons was published by Abel Tompkins.
Early years and education
Julia Abigail Fletcher was born April 6, 1823, in Lancaster, Massachusetts. They inherited patriotism from Revolutionary ancestors, being a granddaughter of Major Timothy Fletcher, of Lancaster, Massachusetts, and of Major Moses Warren, of Jay, Maine. They had no recollection of a time when they did not express their thoughts in verse. Them older brothers and sister were happy to write down their rhymes many years before they learned to do it herself. Them the earliest sorrow was the opinion of a maiden aunt, freely expressed to their mother, that "if they let that child go on writing verses, they would never be good for anything else." This advice led to a maternal injunction, "Never let me see any more of your poetry." Subsequently, the mother found their daughter's rhymes hidden in the attic and repealed the injunction.
Several years of invalidism, the result of scarlet fever at the age of eight years, interfered with their education, but from their couch, they read through the libraries of the neighborhood. Them first works of verse were published in the Lancaster and Concord local papers at the age of fourteen. Educated at Lancaster Academy, their school compositions, chiefly in verse, were sent regularly to several papers and magazines in Boston, whose editors were pleased with the youthful effusions, and constantly encouraged them to write.
Career
When seventeen, they went to Philadelphia, where their married sister resided, and there remained two years, teaching in a private school. Returning to Massachusetts to the home of their parents, they served a summer's apprenticeship in the district school, where they attracted commendation from the committee by keeping a formerly unruly school in good order without corporal punishment. During their life as a teacher, they wrote many poems and sketches, most of them for radical papers with reform ideas, and also a series of Sunday school instruction books, which were used for many years in liberal churches, until Lesson Papers superseded the use of textbooks. In 1844, they were elected teacher of one of the primary schools in Boston, where they continued to teach until their marriage in the spring of 1849.
From 1849, their writing was chiefly prose, and for the Phrenological Journal, Science of Health, Midland Monthly, and our various denominational papers, especially the New Covenant. In 1869 and 1870, they conducted the "Home and Fireside" department of the New York National Agriculturist, and the Bee-Keepers′ Journal. As they were expected to fill several columns with continued novelties, they surprised their readers with a variety of signatures, including: "Minnie May," "Frank Fisher," "Sadie Sensible," and "Minister's Wife". Them signature of "Julia," however, though known to their friends, was usually dropped by those who copied their articles, and so it happened that those finding favor with the public went the rounds of paper, magazine, and schoolbook, many of them in the books from which they themselves taught, without credit, some of them marked "Anon." As a writer, using too many signatures became a serious mistake, not only taking parts of their real name, sometimes their husband's, but fictitious ones. This was done, partly to give variety, when under engagement to fill a certain number of columns of "Home and Fireside" department in a New York City monthly, and partly as a minister's wife, who wanted to criticise the relations of pastor and people without giving offense.
They were deeply interested in the reform movements of the time, and often wrote on their behalf. They were also actively engaged in Sunday school work, and was well known as a writer for children. In later life, they wrote chiefly in prose, short sketches of real life, or essays upon temperance, and other serious subjects.
Personal life
In 1849, they married Rev. Thomas J. Carney (1818–1871), a Universalist minister. After a year's residence in Maine, and another in Cooperstown, New York, they took up their home in the West. Here, amid the many duties of pioneer life, and the care of little children, they seldom had time for writing.
In 1871, the family had removed to Apple Creek Prairie, Illinois where the people had commenced a church under their ministry. They left home on horseback, and was returning to observe their wedding anniversary, when they were thrown from their horse. At first, it was supposed the injury would detain them at home for a few weeks, and they were sure of a speedy recovery; but soon, the lesion of a vein in their back caused unconsciousness from which they never recovered. They died May 4, 1871, and was buried at White Hall, Illinois. The widow was still in mourning when their son William, age 20, died suddenly of sunstroke. Four other children had died in infancy, leaving one daughter and three sons still with them They moved in with their oldest son, Fletcher Carney, an attorney of Galesburg, Illinois, but made frequent visits to their younger son, Rev. James W. Carney, of Holyoke, Massachusetts.

Leela is a name of Sanskrit origin. Like many Sanskrit words, it cannot be literally translated to English but can be loosely translated as "play" (noun). It is common to both non-dualistic and dualistic philosophical schools, but has a markedly different significance in each. Within non-dualism, Leela is a way of describing all reality, including the cosmos, as the outcome of creative play by the divine absolute (Brahman). It was also used to mean "Princess of Darkness" in some regions of the world.

The Ophel ostracon or KAI 190, is an ostracon discovered in Jerusalem in 1924 by R. A. Stewart Macalister and John Garrow Duncan, in the area of Wadi Hilweh (known as the City of David). It is attributed to the 7th century BCE.
Discovery
Macalister and Duncan described the discovery as follows, referring to the 1909 expedition of Montagu Brownlow Parker:
This sherd was discovered in the large cave under Field No. 9, and seems to have formed part of the dump which the Parker party deposited in that cave; its exact original provenance is therefore uncertain, though it must have come from somewhere in the neighboring tunnel, and probably not far off.
The ostracon measures 4 inches by 3 inches. The inscription, written in Pre-Exilic Hebrew, is thought to have originally been eight lines, of which five are decipherable (the first four and the last). According to a 2015 study, "virtually all scholars agree that it contains a list of personal names with theophoric elements."
It is currently at the Rockefeller Museum.

Robert L. Hall (1906–1991) was an American Air racing pilot and aircraft designer.
Career
Robert L. Hall was born in Taunton, Massachusetts in 1905. After graduating in 1927 from the University of Michigan, with a degree in Mechanical Engineering, they joined the Granville Brothers Aircraft, where they were the chief engineer. They designed the Gee Bee Model Z racer, the "City of Springfield," which swept the competition in every contest in the National Air Races of 1931. On September 5, Hall flew the Gee Bee Z to victory in the General Tire and Rubber Trophy race. Lowell Bayles flew the aircraft the next day to victory in the free-for-all event.
The Springfield Aircraft Co.
Hall left the Granville Brothers in 1927 to form The Springfield Aircraft Co and moved operations to the Bowles Agawam Airport. There they designed the Bulldog racing aircraft, which they went on to race at the 1932 National Air Races, finished sixth at a speed of 215.5 mph. Afterwards there was speculation that its experimental Hamilton Standard propeller prevented the Wasp engine from running at full power. Hall was so disappointed with its performance that they dismantled and scrapped the plane after that race. They also designed the Cicada racer, which was scheduled to race at the 1932 National Air Races by owner Frank Lynch but did not start the race due to engine problems.
The Grumman Years
Robert Hall later joined Grumman, where they helped design and test a series of planes that proved a major force during World War II. Serving as Chief Engineer and lead flight test pilot, they helped design and made the first flights of the F4F Wildcat, the G-21 Goose in 1937, the XP-50 in 1941, the F6F Hellcat in 1942, the F7F Tigercat in 1943 and the F8F Bearcat in 1944. On May 14, 1941 while flying the XP-50, it experienced an inflight turbocharger explosion while over Long Island Sound. Hall was forced to parachute to safety. As Grumman's chief engineer and vice president, they were instrumental in the design of the F9F Panther, F9F Cougar, F10F Jaguar and F11F Tiger jet fighters and the Gulfstream I executive aircraft. They retired from Grumman in 1970.
Legacy
The Hall Bulldog Project is a project attempting to recreate the V-2 Bulldog.
Their son Eric Hall is co-founder of Halls Spars, which manufacturers sailboat rigging.

Blatch entered politics in 1976 at the age of 39, as an elected councillor to Cambridgeshire County Council. Within a year they had been elected leader of the Conservative group and therefore leader of the council as the party enjoyed a majority at the time. They served as leader until 1989, during which time they helped pioneer reforming policies in education such as direct funding for schools from central government, a predecessor policy to the Academy (English school) programme introduced by the Labour government of 1997-2010 and later extended by the Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition Government.
Blatch was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1983 Birthday Honours. They were created a life peeress as Baroness Blatch, of Hinchingbrooke in the County of Cambridgeshire on 4 July 1987.
From 1991 to 1994, they were Minister of State for Education and Immigration minister from 1994 to 1997. In 1997 they were given an honorary doctorate of Law from the University of Teesside.

The Annunciation Church () is a Romanian Orthodox church located at 12 Sulfinei Street in Iași, Romania. It is dedicated to the Annunciation.
The original church on the site was made of wood. First mentioned in 1707, it was likely built in the second half of the 17th century. This date derives from the appearance of surviving icons and the fact that the area (known as Muntenimii) was starting to become populated at the time, by craftsmen and Roma. By the later 18th century, documents mentioned the church frequently, highlighting its importance. There is an inscribed cross marking the spot where the altar of this church once stood. It probably lasted around a century and a half, gradually becoming too small for the needs of the area. Eventually, the neighborhood was settled by wealthier people interested in building a larger and prettier church.
The present building was constructed by ktitor Ion Tăutu, a vornic, and their wife Maria between 1816 and 1818; it was blessed by Metropolitan Veniamin Costache in 1820. The design was inspired by a church in Flămânzi that Tăutu's friend Theodor Balș built in 1813. The old church lasted until the 1821 outbreak of the Greek War of Independence, which had reverberations in Moldavia; Ottoman troops pillaged and destroyed it. This is attested by a stone carved in Romanian Cyrillic, located along the northern wall of the present building. According to historian N. A. Bogdan, who wrote at the turn of the 20th century, the foundations were still visible some forty years prior. Another theory holds that the new church was built only after the old one was destroyed, possibly because Tăutu was grateful to have avoided execution during the revolutionary upheaval, and because they brought back news that native rather than Phanariote princes would henceforth rule Moldavia.
Distinctive features of the new church include its large and nearly round nave, as well as its small vestibule. There is a noted oil portrait of Tăutu in oriental dress with Maria appearing in western style. Another painting, located in the vestibule, commissioned by Tăutu's sister and executed in 1829, shows part of 18th-century Iași in panorama. The roof was redone in the 1850s, and the foyer repaired in 1875. The iconostasis was carved in oak and linden from 1858 to 1860 before being coated in gold and silver leaf. The fresco painting dates to 1859. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the church had several wealthy donors, including Mihail Kogălniceanu (who married in the church), Theodor Pallady and Prince Carol I of Romania. It owned houses, land, money and precious liturgical items. Bishop Meletie Stavropoleos donated five houses for the clergy and staff. From the property income, the parish was able to pay a choir director and soloists. Repairs were carried out from 1975 to 1977, and the walls were repainted from 1978 to 1979. Metropolitan Teoctist Arăpașu blessed the church a second time in 1980.
The church is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs.

The fatal shooting of Andy Lopez by Sonoma County sheriff's deputy Erick Gelhaus took place on October 22, 2013, in Santa Rosa, California. 13-year-old Lopez was walking through a vacant lot and carrying an airsoft gun that was designed to resemble an AK-47 assault rifle. Gelhaus opened fire on Lopez, presumably mistaking the airsoft gun for a real firearm. The shooting prompted many protests in Santa Rosa, and throughout California.
On November 4, 2013, the Lopez family filed a federal civil rights lawsuit at the U.S. District Court.
On July 7, 2014, District Attorney Jill Ravitch announced no charges would be filed against Gelhaus. On July 1, 2015, the FBI announced no criminal charges would be filed against Gelhaus, due to lack of evidence to prove that they violated Lopez's civil rights.
Backgrounds
Andy Lopez (June 2, 2000 – October 22, 2013) was a 13-year-old boy who attended Cook Middle School in Santa Rosa. They were raised in the Moorland Avenue neighborhood in southwest Santa Rosa. They transferred to Lewis Opportunity School from Cook Middle School one week prior to their death.
Erick Gelhaus is a Sonoma County sheriff's deputy, and has worked with the agency for 24 years.  They are also an Iraq War veteran. Gelhaus is a firearms instructor and is a contributing writer to gun publications. They began instructing in 2001 at Gunsite Academy, an Arizona-based company that teaches gun-handling, marksmanship, and law enforcement to "elite military personnel, law enforcement officers and free citizens of the U.S," and is listed as active as of 2022 They specialized in teaching pistol, carbine, shotgun and rifle lessons. They accidentally shot themselves in the leg in 1995 while on duty with the sheriff's office, reportedly while holstering a gun during an attempt at searching a teenager for weapons. In their 24 years in law enforcement, they had never shot a suspect until the shooting of Lopez.
Shooting
According to Santa Rosa Police Lieutenant Paul Henry, two Sonoma County sheriff's deputies (Gelhaus and Michael Schemmel; Schemmel was driving the patrol car) were patrolling the Moorland Avenue neighborhood when they spotted Andy Lopez approximately ahead carrying an airsoft replica of an AK-47 assault rifle while they were walking on Moorland, just past the corner of West Robles Avenue. The rifle appeared to be a real weapon, since its orange tip has been previously broken off. As the sheriff's deputies approached the child from behind, Gelhaus radioed an observation of "Code 20, two units" at 3:13:58 p.m. Schemmel activated the light bar and briefly sounded the siren as they parked the patrol vehicle, and Gelhaus exited the passenger's side, calling out to demand that Lopez drop the weapon. Lopez turned to their right, towards the deputies and the barrel allegedly began to ascend.
At 3:14 p.m., Gelhaus fired eight shots at Lopez from their department-issued 9mm handgun. The deputies broadcast "shots fired" to dispatch at 3:14:17 p.m., indicating the total time from initial contact to the shooting was seventeen seconds. By Gelhaus's own testimony, they opened fire "a couple seconds" after issuing the command for Lopez to drop the airsoft gun. Seven bullets hit Andy within six seconds. Two of the shots delivered fatal wounds, with one round hitting Lopez on their side while they were turning to face the police, at least four entering from the rear, according to an autopsy. The deputies remained in defensive position until backups arrived, then approached Lopez with guns drawn; after separating the airsoft gun from Lopez they were handcuffed. They were pronounced dead by medical personnel on the scene. Lopez was found to be under the influence of marijuana after an autopsy.
The missing orange tip is a US legal requirement for all toy guns for import. However, airsoft and pellet rifles are exempted from the marking requirements. It is also a violation of California law to "openly display or expose any imitation firearm in a public place unless the entire exterior surface of the imitation firearm is painted with a specified color". The 13 year old friend from whom Andy had borrowed the replica later reported that they felt responsible "because they allowed Andy to borrow the gun even though the orange tip of the barrel was broken off making it look real, although he'd told their friend not to take it since it was broken."
Investigation
On October 26, 2013, the Federal Bureau of Investigation started to conduct an independent investigation in Lopez's death. Sonoma County Sheriff Steve Freitas announced in a statement on October 25 that they will cooperate fully with federal investigators. It is the first time the FBI has investigated an officer-involved shooting in Sonoma County since the 1997 shooting death of Kuanchung Kao in Rohnert Park.
Investigators said Gelhaus feared for the safety of themselves and their partner, and had to make an immediate decision to shoot when Lopez turned around and allegedly began raising the apparent assault weapon in their direction. The gun was later found to be an AK-47 replica air-soft pellet gun with the orange barrel tip marking broken off. Gelhaus was in a deputy sheriff's uniform and marked sheriff's patrol car; however, Lopez would not have seen the uniform or patrol car since the officers approached them from behind;
In the autopsy, Lopez was found to have significant levels of THC in their blood, consistent with smoking marijuana 60 to 75 minutes previously; they were also found to have a joint in their pocket. 'A 13-year-old boy high on marijuana would likely have suffered "impaired judgment, slowed decision making and increased mental processing time, particularly when having to deal with performance of a sudden, unanticipated tasks, including decisions that needed to be quickly responded to.'"
Gelhaus was cleared to return to duty on December 9, 2013, but was able to work at their desk and not on patrol. On July 7, 2014, District Attorney Jill Ravitch announced no charges would be filed against Gelhaus. In August 2014, Gelhaus was allowed to return to patrolling the streets.
The district attorney, Jill Ravich, referred the completed investigative report to the Sonoma County Grand Jury, but the civil Grand Jury declined to review it, citing lack of expertise.
On July 1, 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it would not file criminal charges of violating one's civil rights against Gelhaus. According to a Justice Department spokesperson, the decision to not file charges against Gelhaus was due to insufficient evidence that they willfully used excessive force that resulted in Lopez's death. A group of federal prosecutors and FBI agents reviewed the case and determine there was a lack of evidence Gelhaus violated Andy Lopez's civil rights.
Aftermath
Civil action
Arnoldo Casillas, the lawyer representing Lopez's family, said that the shooting was unconstitutional because it violated the Fourth Amendment's limits on police authority. On November 4, the Lopez family filed a lawsuit at the U.S. District Court in San Francisco, claiming that Deputy Erick Gelhaus shot Lopez "without reasonable cause."
The civil action trial was initially scheduled to start in April 2016. In February 2016, the trial was delayed by Sonoma County's challenge to the January ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Phyllis Jean Hamilton that allowed the case brought by the parents of Andy Lopez to go forward. Hamilton had dismissed three of the five claims that Gelhaus violated Lopez's civil rights but said they would leave it to a jury to decide whether they acted unreasonably. Steven Mitchell, the attorney who would have defended Sonoma County in the federal lawsuit filed by Lopez's parents, committed suicide two weeks after the decision to delay the case was made.
On June 25, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court denied Sonoma County's petition, clearing the way for the case against the Sonoma County sheriff's deputy to proceed toward a trial. In December 2018, the lawsuit was settled for $3 million.
Protests
A series of protests were organized and held following Lopez's death. The protests were mainly organized by immigrant, religious and community groups and activists. Many protesters have stated that Lopez's shooting was a case of police brutality, and that Lopez, who was Latino, was a victim of racial profiling by the deputies. On October 25, 2013, more than 100 people, consisting mostly of middle school and high school students, protested at the Santa Rosa City Hall. On October 29, over 1,000 people attended a protest in downtown Santa Rosa, in the form of a mass march. The march initiated in the Courthouse Square in downtown Santa Rosa, and ended at the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office. Lawyer John Burris, who represented the family of police shooting victim Oscar Grant, gave a speech at the rally. Attendees traveled from all over the San Francisco Bay Area to attend the event. Many protesters held picket signs demanding justice. Up to 200 people attended a march in Santa Rosa on November 5, 2013, including activist Cindy Sheehan. They also demanded that District Attorney Jill Ravitch issue an arrest warrant for Gelhaus or put together a grand jury, but they declined to do either until the fact gathering investigation was complete, stating that the investigation would take time.
Rallies were held statewide on November 9, 2013, in Santa Rosa, Oakland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Sacramento, and Merced.
On November 26, 2013, several people were detained during protests in Santa Rosa. A dozen demonstrators were cited for blocking traffic, and one demonstrator was
arrested and booked for resisting arrest. There were 80 people attending that protest, consisting of local middle and high-school students, and several members of By Any Means Necessary (BAMN), a Bay Area-based civil rights group.
On December 3, 2013, protesters targeted Ravitch at their re-election fundraiser.
On December 9, 2013, Gelhaus was cleared to return to duty, which resulted in additional protests.
A 31-year-old man was arrested for battery on a police officer for allegedly punching a police officer and hitting another officer with a picket sign during a protest at the Santa Rosa City Hall on December 10, 2013. Charges were dropped against them in May 2014. A second person was arrested for obstructing a police officer and violating probation. Multiple protesters vandalized the front door of the Sonoma County Jail, breaking its glass.
On February 17, 2014, protesters for Andy Lopez gathered at the Santa Rosa Plaza food court to eat lunch while wearing shirts displaying "RIP Andy Lopez". Several mall security guards came up to them and asked them to remove their T-shirts or leave the mall. The attorney for Simon Malls, owner of Santa Rosa Plaza, apologized in a letter issued to relatives of Andy Lopez, stating that they were disappointed that the security guards did not comply with the mall's policies and procedures. The head of security for Santa Rosa Plaza was fired one month later in connection with the incident.
On July 12, 2014, more than 100 protesters held a rally at the Old Courthouse Square in Santa Rosa, demonstrating their disapproval with prosecutors' decision to not file charges against Erick Gelhaus. A small group of protesters marched onto northbound Highway 101, blocking traffic.
On June 2, 2020, a memorial and march was held in Santa Rosa in Lopez's honor, on what would have been their 20th birthday, and coinciding with the George Floyd protests.
Tributes
A memorial park was created for Lopez in December 2013, located near the site of their death.
In March 2016, the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors approved an additional $1.2 million of fund money for the park and a name for it. The park is named "Andy's Unity Park" and encompasses 4.22 acres. The park's estimated cost was $4 million, with $3 million for the construction. The park was opened in June 2018 with a final cost of $3.7 million. LandPaths, a Sonoma county non-profit, helped create Andy's Unity Park Community Garden and maintains the park along with community involvement.

Lieutenant General Sir John Fullerton Evetts CB, CBE, MC (30 June 1891 – 21 December 1988) was a senior British Army officer.
Early life and First World War
Born in 1891 in Naini Tal, West Bengal, India, John Fullerton Evetts was educated at Lancing College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Upon passing out from Sandhurst, Evetts was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) on 19 September 1911. Among their fellow graduates were three future general officers, Kenneth Anderson, Eric Nares and Montagu Stopford.
Evetts, promoted on 1 July 1913 to lieutenant, fought on the Western Front during the First World War. Promoted to the temporary rank of captain on 10 August 1915, and captain on 1 October 1915, they were awarded the Military Cross (MC) and mentioned in despatches while serving with the Machine Gun Corps (MGC). Serving from April 1917 as a brigade major with the 26th Brigade, part of the 15th (Scottish) Division, a Kitchener's Army formation, they ended the war as a temporary major, having been promoted to that rank on 9 February 1916.
Between the wars
Reverting to the Cameronians after the MGC was disbanded, Evetts returned to England to attend the Staff College, Camberley from 1922 to 1923. Several fellow students were to become general officers, such as Charles Fullbrook-Leggatt, Thomas Hutton, Keith Simmons, William Akerman, Gerald Smallwood. They were seconded to the Iraqi Army from 1925 to 1928 and was Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General (DAAG) at the War Office from 1932. In 1934 they transferred from the Cameronians to the Royal Ulster Rifles and was Commanding Officer (CO) of the 1st Battalion of their new regiment from 1934.
They were posted to Palestine as a General staff Officer Grade 1 (GSO1) and, from 23 September 1936 when they were promoted to brigadier, they commanded the 16th Infantry Brigade, commanding it throughout most of the Arab revolt. Evetts was in charge of organizing British troops to protect isolated Jewish farm settlements which were coming under siege of Arab militants. During that time they commanded British troops during the fighting known as the Battle of Anabta against Arab insurgents. They were appointed mayor of Nablus shortly after this. They were somewhat rare for being popular both amongst Arab civilians and amongst the Jewish farmer communities they were tasked with protecting. Both groups "regarded them as fair" however, they were also personally sympathetic towards the aspirations of the Jewish settlers and "greatly disheartened" by the fact they were coming under attack. For their services there they were mentioned in despatches in April 1939, and made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in April 1938.
Second World War
During the Second World War Evetts was a Brigadier on the General Staff of Northern Command in India from 1939 and then they commanded the Western (Independent) District in India from 1940. They were General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 6th Infantry Division in North Africa from 1941. Evetts served in Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily, in 1943, seeing action at the Battle of Centuripe. They were Assistant Chief of the Imperial General Staff (ACIGS) from 1943 and Senior Military Advisor to the Minister of Supply from 1944. They retired in 1946.
Postwar and later life
From 1946 to 1950 Evetts led the establishment of the Anglo-Australian Joint Project, which led to the formation and development of the Long Range Weapons Establishment (LRWE) at Salisbury, in Adelaide, South Australia, and the famous 'Woomera Rocket Range' (now the 'Woomera Test Range') 460 km north of Adelaide. They were knighted in the 1951 King's Birthday Honours List.
In retirement they became managing director and then Chairman of Rotol Limited and British Messier.

7iber () is an Amman-based online citizen media and multimedia journalism organization founded in 2007 and registered as an LLC in 2009. It is pronounced "Hiber" with the 7 standing in for the "haa" sound in Arabic, and means "ink."
Mission
7iber is a bootstrapped multimedia content producer which conducts original research of Internet governance and digital rights and operates a co-working office, and an events space, including a cafe. 7iber also conducts training on topics related to digital media.
Press and publication in Jordan
On July 1, 2013, 7iber.com was blocked by the Jordanian government during a crackdown on online media. The block came after a public debate over the Press and Publication Law where Fayez Shawabkeh, the director of the government's Press and Publication Department, was asked why the website was not blocked previously. Shawabkeh said, "If I find it's a news website, I will block it," and later added, "if it's a blog, the law does not apply to it." The Jordanian government determined that 7iber is a news website rather than a blog, and blocked access to the site until 7iber registers as a news agency.
7iber's administration says they were informed of the ban only through a memo sent by the Press and Publication Department to the Telecom Regulatory Commission. "If the Press and Publication Department decided that 7iber.com needs a license, which is against all their public statements about blogs, they are supposed to officially inform us of this decision and give us 90 days before blocking the website," 7iber added in an official statement. They also said that the law in question is a tool used to arbitrarily stifle freedom of expression.
In order to register as a news agency, 7iber would have to have an editor-in-chief that has been a member of the Jordan Press Association (JPA) for at least 4 years, but membership in the JPA is not given to journalists who work in online media. 7iber was blocked again in August 2014.

Robert Knox Sneden (1832–1918) was an American landscape painter and a map-maker for the Union Army during the American Civil War. They were a prolific illustrator and memoirist documenting the war and other events.
Early life
Robert Knox Sneden was born in Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia, Canada and moved to New York City in 1851 at age 19. They received some architectural education.
Civil War
Sneden left Brooklyn in 1861 to enlist in the 40th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, or the Mozart Regiment, of the Army of the Potomac. They served as a quartermaster when their regiment camped near Leesburg Turnpike. Starting from January 12, 1862, Sneden served on Samuel P. Heintzelman's III Corps staff, at first, as a draughtsman on map work, later, as a topographical engineer. On March 22, 1862, Sneden embarked with Heintzelman for the Peninsula Campaign, participating in the Battle of Williamsburg, Battle of Seven Pines, Battle of Savage's Station, and Battle of Glendale. Returning to Northern Virginia, they took part in the Second Battle of Bull Run. They were assigned to the defenses of Washington, D.C., first in Alexandria, Virginia, then at Arlington House.
In October, 1863, after the Battle of Bristoe Station, they were assigned to David B. Birney's division, participating in the Battle of Kelly's Ford.
They were assigned to the staff of general William H. French, during the abortive Battle of Mine Run.
Prisoner-of-War
On November 27, 1863, Sneden was captured by Confederate rangers under John S. Mosby and became a prisoner-of-war for the next thirteen months. In November 1863, they were held at a tobacco warehouse next to Libby Prison, where they suffered from typhoid fever. On February 22, 1864, after a prison escape, prisoners were shipped to a new camp in Georgia. Sneden was placed in the notorious Andersonville Prison, but continued making clandestine drawings. Altogether, they sketched scenes of prison life in Savannah and Millen, Georgia, and in Florence and Charleston, South Carolina. On December 11, 1864, they were exchanged at Charleston.
Later life
After the Civil war, although crippled from their time in Andersonville, Sneden returned to Brooklyn, where they were already declared dead or missing. They made a number of their war sketches into watercolors, leaving a legacy of close to 1000 watercolors, drawings, sketches, maps, and diagrams. Sneden contributed some of them to the Battles and Leaders of the Civil War, a series of articles published between 1884 and 1887 in The Century Magazine and then reissued as a four-volume set of books.
Sneden never married and devoted the rest of their life to preserving the Civil war memory. In 1918, Sneden died in New York State Soldiers' and Sailors' Home.
Recognition
In 1994, an art dealer approached the Virginia Historical Society about a Civil War archive that had languished in a Connecticut bank vault. Robert Sneden's great-great-nephew also transferred through purchase Sneden's diary and watercolors, close to 5,000 pages of the diary entries and memoirs, and near 500 watercolors and maps.
In the fall of 2000, Sneden was rediscovered by the general public and the Civil war enthusiasts after about 300 pieces of their artwork were revealed in the Eye of the Storm exhibition and subsequent book, which became a bestseller. According to the Virginia Historical Society, it was, "the largest collection of [American] Civil War soldier art ever produced". Documentary-style images created by Sneden are considered as important historical records.
Their works are currently held by the Virginia Historical Society, and also are available through the Library of Congress.

Radville station is a former railway station in Radville, Saskatchewan. It was built by the Canadian Northern Railway as part of the Brandon to Lethbridge line. The two-story, wood-frame railway station is at a major division point on the railway line and is the only remaining 2nd-Class CNR railway station building still standing in the province. The building was designed by architect Ralph Benjamin Pratt. As a major division point from 1911 until the 1950s the site also housed a railway roundhouse. The building was designated a Municipal Heritage Property in 1984. The building is now used as a museum.

Cereal growth staging scales attempt to objectively measure the growth of cereals.
BBCH-scale (cereals)
In agronomy, the BBCH-scale for cereals describes the phenological development of cereals using the BBCH-scale.
The phenological growth stages and BBCH-identification keys of cereals are:
1 A leaf is unfolded when its ligule is visible or the tip of the next leaf is visible
2 Tillering or stem elongation may occur earlier than stage 13; in this case continue
with stages 21
3 If stem elongation begins before the end of tillering continue with stage 30
Feekes scale
The Feekes scale is a system to identify the growth and development of cereal crops introduced by the Dutch agronomists Willem Feekes (1907-1979) in 1941. This scale is more widely used in the United States than other similar and more descriptive scales such as the Zadoks scale or the BBCH scale. Like other scales of crop development, the Feekes scale is useful in planning management strategies that incorporate plant growth information for the use of pesticides and fertilizers to avoid damaging the crop and/or maximize crop yield.
Zadoks scale
The Zadoks scale is a cereal development scale proposed by the Dutch phytopathologist Jan Zadoks that is widely used in cereal research and agriculture.
Knowing the stages of development of a crop is critical in many management decisions that growers make. They are represented on a scale from 10 to 92. For example, in some countries, nitrogen and herbicide applications must be completed during the tillering stage. In France, the recommendation for the first nitrogen application on wheat is 6 weeks before Z30, with the second application on Z30. Wheat growth regulators are typically applied at Z30. Disease control is most critical in the stem extension and heading stage (Z31, Z32, Z35), in particular as soon as the flag leaf is out (Z37). The crop is also more sensitive to heat or frost at some stages than others (for example, during the meiosis stage the crop is very sensitive to low temperature). Knowing the growth stage of the crop when checking for problems is essential for deciding which control measures should be followed.
Examples of typical stages
during tillering
Z10: one leaf
Z21: tillering begins
during stem extension
Z30: ear is one centimeter long in wheat
Z31: first node visible
Z32: second node visible
Z37: flag leaf
during heading
Z55: the head is 1/2 emerged.
during ripening
Z92: grains are ripe

Theodor Thjøtta (17 June 1885 – 16 June 1955) was a Norwegian physician. They specialized in bacteriology and serology, and was a professor at the University of Oslo from 1935 to their death.
Personal life
They were born in Sandnes as a son of shoemaker Abraham Thjøtta (1857–) and Rakel Tjølsen (1847–1925). In 1921 they married watchmaker's daughter Alfhild Helene Michelet (1885–1966).
Career
They finished their secondary education in 1907, and graduated with the cand.med. degree from the Royal Frederick University in 1912. After two years as a physician for a whaling expedition from 1913 to 1915, they were hired at the Gade Institute in Bergen in 1915, becoming reserve physician at Bergen Hospital in 1917. In 1918 they took the dr.med. degree on the thesis Dysenteri i Norge (Dysentery in Norway).
From 1919 they were the manager of the Norwegian Army Bacteriological Laboratory, but they got a leave to work as assistant at the Rockefeller Institute from 1920 to 1921. From 1921 to 1925 they were a research fellow at the Royal Frederick University in bacteriology and serology. From 1935 they were a professor at the university (from 1939: the University of Oslo).
They studied a range of topics including dysentery, Spirochaetes, diphtheria, spotted fever, Streptococci and Penicillin. They wrote the textbooks Lærebok i Bakteriologi I—III, and was a member of the editorial boards of Nordisk Hygienisk Tidsskrift and Nordisk Medicinsk Tidsskrift. They were also involved in the criticism of Wilhelm Reich. They were also a board member of the Nansen Foundation from 1935 to 1947.
They were a fellow of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters from 1928, fellow of the Swedish Society of Medicine and the Medical Society of Copenhagen and from 1937 a corresponding fellow of the Society of American Bacteriologists. In 1955 they were decorated as a Commander of the Order of St. Olav. They died in the same year, one day before their seventieth birthday.

Nanofluidics is the study of the behavior, manipulation, and control of fluids that are confined to structures of nanometer (typically 1–100 nm) characteristic dimensions (1 nm = 10−9 m). Fluids confined in these structures exhibit physical behaviors not observed in larger structures, such as those of micrometer dimensions and above, because the characteristic physical scaling lengths of the fluid, (e.g. Debye length, hydrodynamic radius) very closely coincide with the dimensions of the nanostructure itself.
When structures approach the size regime corresponding to molecular scaling lengths, new physical constraints are placed on the behavior of the fluid. For example, these physical constraints induce regions of the fluid to exhibit new properties not observed in bulk, e.g. vastly increased viscosity near the pore wall; they may effect changes in thermodynamic properties and may also alter the chemical reactivity of species at the fluid-solid interface. A particularly relevant and useful example is displayed by electrolyte solutions confined in nanopores that contain surface charges, i.e. at electrified interfaces, as shown in the nanocapillary array membrane (NCAM) in the accompanying figure.
All electrified interfaces induce an organized charge distribution near the surface known as the electrical double layer. In pores of nanometer dimensions the electrical double layer may completely span the width of the nanopore, resulting in dramatic changes in the composition of the fluid and the related properties of fluid motion in the structure. For example, the drastically enhanced surface-to-volume ratio of the pore results in a preponderance of counter-ions (i.e. ions charged oppositely to the static wall charges) over co-ions (possessing the same sign as the wall charges), in many cases to the near-complete exclusion of co-ions, such that only one ionic species exists in the pore. This can be used for manipulation of species with selective polarity along the pore length to achieve unusual fluidic manipulation schemes not possible in micrometer and larger structures.
Theory
In 1965, Rice and Whitehead published the seminal contribution to the theory of the transport of electrolyte solutions in long (ideally infinite) nanometer-diameter capillaries.
Briefly, the potential, ϕ, at a radial distance, r, is given by the Poisson-Boltzmann equation,
where κ is the inverse Debye length,
determined by the ion number density, n, the dielectric constant, ε, the Boltzmann constant, k, and the temperature, T. Knowing the potential, φ(r), the charge density can then be recovered from the Poisson equation, whose solution may be expressed as a modified Bessel function of the first kind, I0, and scaled to the capillary radius, a. An equation of motion under combined pressure and electrically-driven flow can then be written,
where η is the viscosity, dp/dz is the pressure gradient, and Fz is the body force driven by the action of the applied electric field, Ez, on the net charge density in the double layer.
When there is no applied pressure, the radial distribution of the velocity is given by,
From the equation above, it follows that fluid flow in nanocapillaries is governed by the κa product, that is, the relative sizes of the Debye length and the pore radius.
By adjusting these two parameters and the surface charge density of the nanopores, fluid flow can be manipulated as desired.
Despite the fact that nanofluidics gives rise to entirely new phenomena in comparison to ordinary large-scale fluid mechanics, it is possible to develop a fundamental continuum theory governing momentum transport in isotropic nanofluidic systems. This theory, which extends the classical Navier−Stokes equation, shows excellent agreement with computer simulations of systems on the nanometer length.
Fabrication
Nanostructures can be fabricated as single cylindrical channels, nanoslits, or nanochannel arrays from materials such as silicon, glass, polymers (e.g. PMMA, PDMS, PCTE) and synthetic vesicles.
Standard photolithography, bulk or surface micromachining, replication techniques (embossing, printing, casting and injection molding), and nuclear track or chemical etching,
are commonly used to fabricate structures which exhibit characteristic nanofluidic behavior.
Applications
Because of the small size of the fluidic conduits, nanofluidic structures are naturally applied in situations demanding that samples be handled in exceedingly small quantities, including Coulter counting,
analytical separations and determinations of biomolecules, such as proteins and DNA,
and facile handling of mass-limited samples. One of the more promising areas of nanofluidics is its potential for integration into microfluidic systems, i.e. micrototal analytical systems or lab-on-a-chip structures. For instance, NCAMs, when incorporated into microfluidic devices, can reproducibly perform digital switching, allowing transfer of fluid from one microfluidic channel to another,
selectivity separate and transfer analytes by size and mass,
mix reactants efficiently,
and separate fluids with disparate characteristics.
In addition, there is a natural analogy between the fluid handling capabilities of nanofluidic structures and the ability of electronic components to control the flow of electrons and holes. This analogy has been used to realize active electronic functions such as rectification
and field-effect
and bipolar transistor
action with ionic currents. Application of nanofluidics is also to nano-optics for producing tuneable microlens array
Nanofluidics have had a significant impact in biotechnology, medicine and clinical diagnostics with the development of lab-on-a-chip devices for PCR and related techniques. Attempts have been made to understand the behaviour of flowfields around nanoparticles in terms of fluid forces as a function of Reynolds and Knudsen number using computational fluid dynamics. The relationship between lift, drag and Reynolds number has been shown to differ dramatically at the nanoscale compared with macroscale fluid dynamics.
Challenges
There are a variety of challenges associated with the flow of liquids through carbon nanotubes and nanopipes. A common occurrence is channel blocking due to large macromolecules in the liquid. Also, any insoluble debris in the liquid can easily clog the tube. A solution for these researchers are hoping to find is a low friction coating or channel materials that help reduce the blocking of the tubes. Also, large polymers, including biologically relevant molecules such as DNA, often fold in vivo, causing blockages. Typical DNA molecules from a virus have lengths of approx. 100–200 kilobases and will form a random coil of the radius some 700 nm in aqueous solution at 20%. This is also several times greater than the pore diameter of even large carbon pipes and two orders of magnitude the diameter of a single walled carbon nanotube.

Bulend Biščević (born 10 March 1975) is a Bosnian retired professional footballer who played firstly as a right-back, and then as a midfielder.
Club career
Željezničar
Born in Sarajevo, SFR Yugoslavia, present day Bosnia and Herzegovina, Biščević spent almost their entire career playing for hometown club Željezničar. That is the club where they began playing football as a child, and in 1994 they started playing for the first team. At first, they played as a right-back, but in 2001, Željezničar's manager Amar Osim moved them to midfield. That was the position in which Biščević showed their real qualities. They were a hard-working player who ran a lot and was mostly oriented in disrupting opposite teams play. Biščević had good technique, so they would, if needed, play in more offensive roles.
During their ten period with Željezničar, they had much success. Biščević won three Bosnian Premier League titles, three Bosnian Cups and three, now defunct, Bosnian Supercups.
Later career and retirement
In 2004, Biščević moved to Cypriot First Division side AEP Paphos. They then moved to Hajduk Split at the beginning of the next year, where they won the 1. HNL and the Croatian Super Cup. Finally, in the 2006 winter transfer window, Biščević came back to Bosnia and Herzegovina and signed a contract with Zrinjski Mostar. Before the start of 2006–07 season, they decided to retire from professional football at only the age of 31.
International career
They made their debut for Bosnia and Herzegovina in an August 1999 friendly match away against Liechtenstein and has earned a total of 19 caps, scoring no goals. Their final international was a February 2005 friendly against Iran.

Synopsis
FBI agents are conferring about Tony Soprano. They have been listening to their phone calls for years without hearing anything incriminating, and the recordings made by Pussy Bonpensiero also reveal nothing. Using Pussy's file number, CW16, Agent Skip Lipari says that they are "probably compost"; Agent Frank Cubitoso removes Pussy's photograph from the wall and throws it away. Lipari reports that Tony goes to their basement to talk with their associates, believing the conversations will be masked by the noise of the central air conditioning units. They obtain legal authorization to plant a listening device there.
Once a week the house is empty for long enough for the agents to examine the basement and later install the listening device. The first week they enter and find an old reading lamp in which a microphone could be hidden. They take pictures of it so they can replace it with a replica with a hidden listening device. In the second week, their plan is aborted when the house's water heater fails and the basement is flooded. In the third week, they successfully plant the replacement lamp and start listening.
Meadow adjusts to life at Columbia University. Them volatile roommate, Caitlin, is having a hard time.
Tony and the crew eat lunch in the back room of Satriale's. Patsy Parisi is not eating, mourning their identical twin Philly on their birthday. Patsy suspects that Tony had something to do with Philly's death. One afternoon, while the FBI watches Tony's house, they see a drunken Patsy on the pool patio aiming a gun at Tony through the window. Patsy can see Tony clearly in the house, but lowers the gun, turns around, and urinates in the pool. Tony does not see any of this. Some days later, Tony confronts Patsy when they are alone. They tell them that the past is past; they compel and cajoles them into declaring, twice, that they have put their grief behind him.

A state university system in the United States is a group of public universities supported by an individual state, territory or federal district. These systems constitute the majority of public-funded universities in the country.
State university systems should not be confused with federally funded colleges and universities, at which attendance is limited to military personnel and government employees. Members of foreign militaries and governments also attend some schools. These schools include the United States service academies, Naval Postgraduate School, and military staff colleges.
A state university system normally means a single legal entity and administration, but may consist of several institutions, each with its own identity as a university. Some states—such as California and Texas—support more than one such system.
State universities get subsidies from their states. The amount of the subsidy varies from university to university and state to state, but the effect is to lower tuition costs below those of private universities for students from that state or district. As more Americans have attended college and private tuition rates have increased well beyond the rate of inflation, admission to state universities has become more competitive.
History
State university systems were a product of the demand for higher education in the newly formed United States. The tradition of publicly funded state colleges began primarily in the southern states, where in the east and northeastern states other private educational institutions were already established. There remains significant debate about which institution or institutions are the oldest public universities in the United States.
The University of Georgia is the country's first chartered public university, established on January 27, 1785, by an act of the General Assembly of Georgia. However, the University of Georgia did not hold classes until 16 years later in the fall of 1801. The first collegiate-level classes conducted by a public institution were at another Georgia institution, the Academy of Richmond County, chartered in 1783 with instruction beginning in 1785. While the academy, later known as Augusta State University and now merged into Augusta University, was founded as a high school, it taught college-level classes from its creation, and its graduates were accepted into four-year colleges as sophomores or juniors, effectively making it a combination of a modern high school and community college. The school eventually dropped high school instruction, but remained a community college until becoming a four-year institution in 1963.
The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, while chartered four years after Georgia in 1789, was the first state university to hold classes. Classes began at UNC in 1795, and UNC is the only state university to have graduated students in the 18th century. The University of South Carolina was chartered in 1801 and held classes for the first time in 1805. The University of Tennessee was originally chartered as Blount College in 1794, but had a very difficult beginning—graduating only one student—and did not begin receiving the promised state funds until 1807 when it was renamed East Tennessee University.
Determining which state university was the "first" is further complicated by the case of New Jersey's state university system. Facing the embarrassment of being the only state left that had not established a state university, the New Jersey Legislature decided to commission an already existing private university as its state university, rather than build one from the ground up, as other states had done. Rutgers University, which had previously been a private school affiliated with the Dutch Reformed Church, was designated as a state university by acts of the legislature in 1945 and 1956. It became a 'System' with the absorptions of Newark University in 1946 and The College of South Jersey in 1950, becoming Rutgers' Newark and Camden campuses, respectively. Rutgers was chartered in 1766, nineteen years before the University of Georgia, but did not become the State University of New Jersey for another 179 years.
Castleton University in Vermont is the oldest state university in New England, chartered in 1787. This was soon followed by the charter of The University of Vermont (UVM) in 1791. However, neither institution was a "state university" in the modern sense of the term until many decades later. Castleton began as the Rutland County Grammar School. It did not become a postsecondary institution until the campus became home to the State Normal School in 1867. Although the school became state-supported at that time, its campus remained privately owned until 1912. UVM was chartered as a private institution and did not become a public university until 1865. The first institution in New England to actually operate as a public university is Westfield State University in Massachusetts, which has been public since its founding in 1838.
Consideration of public higher education was included in the earliest westward expansion of the U.S. with the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, which established the Northwest Territory. It stated: "Religion, morality, and knowledge, being necessary to good government and the happiness of humankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged." Ohio University (1804) was the first state school so established in the territory (and is also the oldest state university that has continuously operated as a public institution), with the other developing states similarly creating public universities to serve the citizens. On a national basis, the state university system was also assisted by the establishment of the Land-grant universities, under the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Acts of 1862 and 1890.
Many state universities were founded in the middle 19th century, in particular supported by the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Acts of 1862 and 1890.
Many state universities—such as UCLA, Arizona State, and SUNY Geneseo—were founded as normal schools.
Following the Second World War, many state universities were merged with smaller institutions to achieve economies of scale in administration and also to raise the prestige of the degrees granted by some smaller institutions. A prominent example of this is the State University of New York, which is the largest comprehensive system of universities, colleges, and community colleges in the United States.
During the 1970s, further mergers took place and the concept of a state system was widely adopted.
Some states have more than one state university system. For example, California has the University of California and the California State University as four-year university systems, and the California Community Colleges as its community college system. Texas has six state university systems, plus four independent public universities.
Governance
There is much diversity between the states in terms of how governing power is distributed between boards of regents (or trustees), presidents, chancellors, provosts, and other senior university executives.
At one end of the spectrum is the University of California, in which each campus has a chancellor as its chief executive officer. All chancellors report as equals to a systemwide president, who in turn reports to a Board of Regents. At the other end is Kansas, where there is no true state university system with a systemwide brand identity and a systemwide chief executive officer empowered to establish uniform policies across multiple campuses and to supervise the chief executive officer of each campus. Instead, the Kansas Board of Regents directly supervises the presidents of all Kansas public universities.
There are several states with hybrid in-between arrangements, such as Hawaii, Indiana, and South Carolina, where the systemwide leader of the state university retains direct executive control over the original flagship campus but also supervises the leaders of all other campuses in the system. As R. Bowen Loftin has pointed out, this requires considerable tact on the part of the systemwide leader: "How would the other campus leaders see themselves in such an arrangement?" However, it is more common for the flagship campus to have its own leader distinct from the systemwide leader.
State college system
Some states maintain a separate system for state colleges (often specified as community colleges, technical colleges, or junior colleges), distinct from their university system. Examples include the California Community Colleges System, the Florida College System, and the Technical College System of Georgia. In these states, colleges focus primarily on awarding two-year associate's degrees and professional certificates, while universities focus on four-year bachelor's degrees and more advanced degrees.
Historic names
During the growth and restructuring of the state systems, names such as University of California have changed their meanings over time.
In some cases, the unqualified name has become the official name of the university system that includes the institution which is the original bearer of the name. Examples include:
University of California, originally referring only to the campus at Berkeley
University of North Carolina, originally referring only to the campus at Chapel Hill
University of Puerto Rico, originally referring only to the campus at Río Piedras
In other cases, the unqualified name remains the official name of an individual institution which is now part of a larger university system. Examples include:
University of Alabama, flagship institution of the University of Alabama System
University of Houston, flagship institution of the University of Houston System
In some cases, the unqualified name now has no official status, but is used informally for either an individual university (particularly in sporting and similar contexts) or for the university system of which it is now part (particularly in administrative and academic contexts). Examples include:
University of Texas, in Austin
University of Wisconsin, in Madison

The Royal Academy of Italy () was a short-lived Italian academy of the Fascist period. It was created on 7 January 1926 by royal decree, but was not inaugurated until 28 October 1929. It was effectively dissolved in 1943 with the fall of Mussolini, and was finally suppressed on 28 September 1944. All of its functions and assets, including the Villa Farnesina, were passed to the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei. Until 25 April 1945 it continued some activity in the Villa Carlotta on Lake Como near Tremezzo in Lombardy.
The declared purpose of the academy was "to promote and coordinate Italian intellectual activity in the sciences, the humanities, and the arts, to preserve the integrity of the national spirit, according to the genius and tradition of the race, and to encourage their diffusion [abroad]".
Structure and history
The Academy was modelled upon the prestigious French Academy. The Academy selected sixty Italians chosen for their scientific, literary, and artistic achievements. Those sixty members were divided into four groups of fifteen, representing the physical sciences, moral sciences (including history), arts, and letters (literature).
Politically the Academy served to unify and strengthen the Fascist regime's hold on intellectual activity in Italy, as the Academy demanded that all its members swear loyalty to Fascism and Italy. The Academy was effective at drawing in the intellectual and cultural elites, and was mostly effective at rewarding real talent rather than just loyalty to the regime. It absorbed other independent institutions, notably the prestigious and venerable scientific Accademia dei Lincei in 1939.
The members were well paid, earning 3,000 lire per month at a time when average per capita income in Italy was 3,079 per year. The members were automatically granted first class travel on Italy's national railways and were entitled to wear uniforms designed for the members and to be addressed as "Your Excellency". Each were allowed to compete for the four annual Mussolini prizes which were awarded to Academy members who demonstrated outstanding work in their respective fields. The Academy sponsored lectures, meetings, research, and publications. In 1934, the Academy appointed a commission to create a dictionary of the Italian language in which all Italianized foreign words were to be removed.
After the collapse of the Fascist regime in 1943 and the installation of the puppet Fascist regime in the Italian Social Republic, a new version of the Academy was briefly reopened until the remnant Fascist state was defeated in 1945.
Membership
The six presidents of the Academy were:
Tommaso Tittoni, politician, 1929–1930
Guglielmo Marconi, inventor of radio telegraphy, 1930–1937
Gabriele D'Annunzio, poet and politician, 1937–1938
Luigi Federzoni, politician, 1938–1943
Giovanni Gentile, philosopher, 1943–1944
, geologist and geographer, from 1944.
There were sixty members in all. An initial list of thirty names was compiled by Tittoni and Francesco Giunta, and was approved by the council of ministers on 13 March 1929. They were: , , Filippo Bottazzi, Armando Brasini, Pietro Canonica, Francesco Coppola, Giotto Dainelli Dolfi, Salvatore Di Giacomo, Enrico Fermi, Carlo Formichi, Umberto Giordano, , Antonio Mancini, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Pietro Mascagni, , Alfredo Panzini, , Marcello Piacentini, Luigi Pirandello, Pietro Romualdo Pirotta, , Romano Romanelli, Giulio Aristide Sartorio, Francesco Severi, Bonaldo Stringher, Alfredo Trombetti, , Gioacchino Volpe and Adolfo Wildt.

North Sunshine Eagles FC is a soccer club from St Albans, Victoria, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It is an Albanian Australian-backed club.
In 2019 the Club competed in the Victorian State League Division 1 North-West division, after promotion in 2014. However, with a successful year, NSEFC will be promoted to NPL Victoria 3 in 2020; entering a new era of professional football.
History
Early years
The club was founded in 1975 as Klubi Futbollistik Shqiponja - Albanian Eagle Soccer Club by Albanian migrants. In 1989 the club moved its home base from McIvor Reserve in Yarraville to Keilor Downs. Just two years later in 1991, the club moved its home base once more to its current location at Larissa Reserve in the Western Melbournian suburb of St Albans.
In 1993, the club changed its name from Albanian Eagle SC to North Sunshine Eagles Soccer Club. In 2000, NSEFC was promoted from Victorian Provisional League 1 to Victorian State League Division 3. Another promotion followed just two seasons later, but the club found itself back in Provisional League 1 after relegations in both 2005 and 2006.
Rise to State One
North Sunshine experienced a stellar rise between 2011 and 2014. The club won the Provisional League 1 championship in 2011, earning automatic promotion to State League Division 3. In 2013, the side managed a 3rd-place finish in State 3 and were promoted to the Victorian State League Division 2 North-West for the 2014 season due to a league re-structure following the introduction of the National Premier Leagues Victoria. The Eagles achieved promotion in their first season in State League 2, winning the league championship.
In its first season in the third tier of football in Victoria in 2015, the Victorian State League Division 1 North-West, the club finished in 5th place. In the 2015 season, there was a historic match played out between North Sunshine Eagles and local rivals Sunshine George Cross FC in the FFA Cup. The nine-man Eagles came from two-goals down in extra-time to draw 6–6 and then win 4–2 on penalties. FFA Cups 12 goal Sunshine derby spectacular The club was then drawn against state league powerhouse South Melbourne FC in the next round and lost 8–0.
In preparation for the 2017 season, North Sunshine announced the homecoming of former junior and Hume City FC captain Shane Rexhepi. On signing for the club, Rexhepi stated: "I will play NPL again and it will be with NSEFC”. The Eagles also added Reardo Luka from North Geelong Warriors FC and Lewis Shannon from a brief stint with Green Gully SC. The club finished in 3rd place in the 2017 season, 11 points behind league champions Altona Magic, who were promoted, and three behind Geelong SC. Diellon Memishi finished the season with 19 goals, taking out the league golden boot.
For the 2018 season, the Eagles brought in Zaim Zeneli from South Melbourne, Darren Lewis and Vito Cichello from North Geelong Warriors and Robert Zadworny from Melbourne Knights. North Sunshine finished the season in 2nd place, two points behind Geelong, once more missing out on promotion to the NPL. The Eagles achieved promotion from State League 1 in 2019, with Nick Epifano scoring 15 goals in 14 games.
Today the club is primarily backed and supported by Albanians and Albanian-Australians living in Melbourne.
On 20 April 2021,an incident occurred in the football match between the North Sunshine Eagles and Springvale White Eagles (Serbian-Australian team), in which Albanian fans attacked Serbian ones. On several occasions, Springvale White Eagles fans provoked the North Sunshine Eagle fans by chanting "Kosovo is Serbia", as well as various other slogans and insults. The results of the incident were a seriously injured young man among the fans of the Serbian club, several slightly injured and significant material damage to the cars in the car park.

Adelaide McGuinn Cromwell (November 27, 1919 – June 8, 2019) was an American sociologist and professor emeritus at Boston University, where they co-founded the African Studies Center in 1959, and directed the graduate program in Afro-American studies from 1969 to 1985. They were the first African-American instructor at Hunter College and at Smith College. In 1974 they were appointed as the first African-American Library Commissioner for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. They have written several books on black history, including a groundbreaking study of Boston's black upper class and a biography of Adelaide Casely-Hayford. They died in June 2019 at the age of 99.
Early life and education
Adelaide Cromwell was born into a prominent Washington, D.C. family on November 27, 1919. Them grandfather, John Wesley Cromwell, was a well-known civil rights activist and educator, and their father, John Wesley Cromwell Jr., was the city's first black certified public accountant. Them aunt, Otelia Cromwell, was the first black graduate of Smith College, and their cousin, Edward Brooke, was a Senator of Massachusetts and the first popularly elected Black State Attorney General.
Cromwell graduated from Dunbar High School in 1936. They received an A.B. degree in sociology from Smith College in 1940 and an M.A. degree in sociology from the University of Pennsylvania in 1941. They earned a certificate in social casework from Bryn Mawr College, and a Ph.D. in sociology from Radcliffe College in 1946.
Career
After graduating from Radcliffe, Cromwell taught sociology at Hunter College, where they were the first African-American instructor. They again broke the color line when they taught at Smith College in the late 1940s. In 1951 they joined the faculty at Boston University, where they taught sociology until 1985. In 1959 Cromwell co-founded the university's African Studies Center. From 1969 to 1985 they directed the African-American Studies program.
In 1960, Cromwell traveled to Ghana to convene the first conference of West African social workers. They also served on a committee commissioned by the American Methodist Church to evaluate the state of higher education in the Belgian Congo (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo). They were appointed in 1974 as Library Commissioner for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the first African American in this position. In 1983 they convened a conference of policymakers and scholars at the University of Liberia.
Cromwell has served on the executive council of the American Society of African Culture, the now-defunct American Negro Leadership Conference in Africa, and the United States Agency for International Development's Advisory Committee on Voluntary Foreign Aid (ACVFA).  They are a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the African Studies Association, the Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH), and the American Sociological Association.
 They are president of the Heritage Guild, which they co-founded in 1975 to document, preserve, and raise awareness of Boston's black history. At that time, few Bostonians realized the historical significance of sites such as the African Meeting House on Beacon Hill, or knew that Boston's West End had once been a major center of the abolitionist movement. The Heritage Guild has called the public's attention to historical sites and the achievements of people such as Butler R. Wilson, founder of the Boston NAACP. Cromwell has written several books on black history, including a study of Boston's black upper class, The Other Brahmins. They were honored by the Massachusetts Historical Commission in 2015 for their contributions.

"Sonnenbank Flavour" ("Sunbed flavour") is a song by German rapper Bushido and the second single from their album Von der Skyline zum Bordstein zurück. It uses a sample from the song "Epitaph" by the British rock band Antimatter. In 2007, the song's music video was nominated for the Echo Music Award in the category Best Video, but lost to "Der letzte Tag" by Tokio Hotel.
Background
In the song, Bushido uses single words that rhyme instead of complete sentences. Bushido confirmed in an interview that they wanted, besides twenty normal tracks, another track that sounde formed different. They also said that on paper, it does not make sense at first glance, but when people listen to it they will understand what's going on. The song was featured on their album Von der Skyline zum Bordstein zurück.
The single reached spot 15 in the German charts.
Controversy
The line "Doreen, Maskenmann, AIDS-Test: positiv" ("Doreen, Maskman, AIDS test: positive") mocks Doreen Steinert and Sido, who were a couple that time. In an interview with Patrice Bouédibéla on MTV Urban, Bushido first denied it and said that they meant the man in their video who wears a Goofy mask, but then they admitted it by calling both Steinert and Sido "embarrassing".
In the song, Bushido also took aim at Raptile, Rapsoul and Curse, as well as Bass Sultan Hengzt and their label Amstaff Muzx.
Music video
The music video was directed by Hinrich Pflug and produced by Katapult. It released on 20 October 2006 and premiered at MTV-TRL. The video was shot in a studio with a blue-screen background.
To produce a video that fit to the song lyrics, the shots were switched during Bushido's performance to the objects or persons which were mentioned; in addition, the background switches between the colours white and black. Eko Fresh and Baba Saad also made cameo appearances.

Alan G. Cairns (August 12, 1940 – November 5, 2020) was a Northern Irish pastor, author, and radio Bible teacher.
A native of Belfast, Northern Ireland, they joined the nascent Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster as a teenager. After being called to its ministry, they became a close associate of Ulster preacher-politician Ian Paisley. Cairns served as pastor of Free Presbyterian churches in Dunmurry and then Ballymoney. In 1973 they began a radio ministry, "Let the Bible Speak," which in 2020 was heard on stations in the UK, the Irish Republic, North America, India, Africa, Nepal, Iran and Afghanistan.
In 1980, Cairns accepted a call to pastor Faith Free Presbyterian Church, Greenville, South Carolina, the first church in the United States to associate itself with the Ulster denomination. In Greenville, Cairns founded Geneva Reformed Seminary, which today serves as the seminary for the Free Presbyterian Church of North America.
Cairns adapted and published many of their sermon series as books and wrote a Dictionary of Theological Terms from a Reformed perspective. In 2007, Cairns became pastor emeritus, and in 2009, they retired to Ballymoney, where they died of COVID-19 in November 2020.

Margaretha Christina Åbergsson, née Hallongren (died autumn 1810), was a Swedish ballet dancer. They were regarded as one of the elite members of the Royal Swedish Ballet in 1790–1810.
They became a student of Giovanna Bassi at the Royal Swedish Ballet in 1785, made their debut as a solo dancer in 1790, was made second dancer in 1795 and premier dancer (ballerina) from 1804.
They belonged to the elite of their profession and was described as "an excellent dancer" and "a particularly eminent artist of their department [...] I features where perhaps not entirely regular, but graceful by the youthful cheerfulness, which animated them."
Among their performances was the ballet Venus och Adonis by Louis Deland with H. Björkman, Ludovico Casagli, Giovanni Battista Ambrosiani and Hedda Hjortsberg the 1801–02 season. In 1799, they performed in the ballet of the opera performance Panurge dans l'île des lanternes by André Ernest Modeste Grétry, translated by Johan David Valerius with music by Federico Nadi Terrade, which as performed in honor of the birth of the heir to the throne.
They married the actor Gustav Åbergsson in 1793, with whom they had several children. They reportedly died at Schönberg near Hamburg, after a long period of chest pains.

Formic acid fuel cells (direct formic acid fuel cells or DFAFCs) are a subcategory of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells where the fuel, formic acid, is not reformed, but fed directly to the fuel cell. Their applications include small, portable electronics such as phones and laptop computers as well as larger fixed power applications and vehicles.
Advantages
Similar to methanol, formic acid is a small organic molecule fed directly into the fuel cell, removing the need for complicated catalytic reforming. Storage of formic acid is much easier and safer than that of hydrogen because it does not need to be done at high pressures and (or) low temperatures.
Formic acid in 85% concentration is flammable, and diluted formic acid is on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration list of food additives. The principal danger from formic acid is from skin or eye contact with the concentrated liquid or vapors.
Formic acid does not cross over the polymer membrane, so its efficiency can be higher than that of methanol.
Reactions
DFAFCs convert formic acid and oxygen into carbon dioxide and water to produce energy. Formic acid oxidation occurs at the anode on a catalyst layer. Carbon dioxide is formed and protons (H+) are passed through the polymer membrane to react with oxygen on a catalyst layer located at the cathode. Electrons are passed through an external circuit from anode to cathode to provide power to an external device.
Anode: HCOOH → CO2 + 2 H+ + 2 e−
Cathode: O2 + 4 H+ + 4 e− → 2 H2O
Net reaction: 2 HCOOH + O2 → 2 CO2 + 2 H2O
History
During previous investigations, researchers dismissed formic acid as a practical fuel because of the high overpotential shown by experiments: this meant the reaction appeared to be too difficult to be practical. However, in 2005 - 2006, other researchers (in particular Richard Masel's group at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) found that the reason for the low performance was the usage of platinum as a catalyst, as it is common in most other types of fuel cells. Using palladium instead, they claim to have obtained better performance than equivalent direct methanol fuel cells. As of April 2006, Tekion held the exclusive license to DFAFC fuel cell technology using PEM membranes and formic-acid fuel from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and with an investment from Motorola, was partnering with BASF to design and manufacture power packs by late 2007, but development appears to have stalled, and almost all information was removed from Tekion's web site before April 24, 2010.
Neah Power Systems, Inc. and Silent Falcon UAS Technologies worked together to integrate formic acid reformer fuel cell technology into the Silent Falcon's unmanned aerial system (UAS), aka "drone".
In 2018, work was published addressing the issue of requiring a high overpotential by way of golden single-atom-site platinum catalysts.

The 2008 Churchill Cup took place between 7 June and 21 June 2008 in what was the sixth year of the Churchill Cup. Six rugby union teams took part: , England Saxons, Ireland A, Scotland A, the , and an Argentinian XV.
Participation
The entry of an Argentinian XV into the competition stems from a decision by the New Zealand Rugby Union not to assemble its 'A' team, the Junior All Blacks, in 2008; as a consequence, the New Zealand Māori, who have taken part in the last three Churchill Cup tournaments, replaced the Juniors in the Pacific Nations Cup and were not available for the Churchill Cup.
Format
The teams were split into two pools of three teams each. Within each pool, the teams played one another once. All six teams participated in a finals day: the two pool winners competed in the final for the Churchill Cup, the two runners-up played in a Plate final, and the two bottom-placed teams competed for a Bowl.
Venues
After the 2007 tournament, which was the first to be played outside of North America, the 2008 tournament returned to North America again. The pool games were played at three venues in Ontario, Canada: Fletcher's Fields, Markham; Twin Elm Rugby Park, Nepean; and Richardson Memorial Stadium, Kingston. Finals Day took place at Toyota Park, Chicago.

Toots and Casper is a family comic strip by Jimmy Murphy, distributed to newspapers for 37 years by King Features Syndicate, from December 17, 1918 to December 30, 1956. The strip spawned many merchandising tie-ins, including books, dolls, paper dolls, pins, bisque nodders and comic books.
Comics historian Coulton Waugh commented on the strip's portrait of a happy, idealized family life: "Like Blondie, Toots is the picture of contentment, and if all homes were like these, the American Dream would be nearly realized."
Characters and story
Toots and Casper began as a gag-a-day strip but soon settled into a successful pattern of serialized stories of romance and mystery involving newlyweds Toots and Casper Hawkins, their child Buttercup and dog Spare-Ribs (who entered a dog race with a $2500 prize in 1933).
Murphy began Toots and Casper for the New York American and other Hearst newspapers beginning December 17, 1918. They used their wife, Matilda Katherine Murphy, as the model for Toots.
The daily strip was picked up by King Features in 1919, and the Sunday strip began the following year (July 25, 1920). The Sunday page carried a topper strip by Murphy. For the first four months of 1926 (Jan 10-April 18), the topper was called Hotsy Totsy. On April 25, 1926, this was replaced with the long-running It's Papa Who Pays!, which ran for the rest of the series, ending on December 30, 1956. A couple of minor panels also appeared in the topper: Toots and Casper Comic Stamp Collection interrupted Papa in 1931, and a paper doll panel, Toots and Casper Comic Cut-Outs, appeared from 1932 to 1937.
Toots and Casper had a child, a boy named Buttercup, in November 1920. Buttercup remained a baby for over 20 years, eventually growing up to a six-year-old in the early 1940s, as noted by comics historian Don Markstein:
Young, stylish, vivacious Toots was the star in the beginning, with short, bald, middle-aged Casper a mere stereotype of the harried, put-upon husband. It's said Murphy based Toots (who, according to historian Coulton Waugh, was the first good-looking married woman in comics) on their own wife, but being a mere 26 years old at the time, probably didn't base Casper on himself. The strip only lasted a couple of months in this form, but was back for good in 1920. On its return, Casper was a little taller, a little hairier, a little younger and a lot more important as a character; and there were two additions—a Sunday page beginning in July of that year, and a baby named Buttercup born in December. The immensely popular Buttercup beat Gasoline Alley'''s Skeezix into print by three months, but Skeezix beat Buttercup to adulthood by a much greater margin. In fact, while Skeezix was in the U.S. Army, fighting World War II, the Hawkins kid was finally getting into grammar school—which is about as old as they ever got. Like the era's quintessential domestic strip, The Gumps, the Hawkins family (the three humans, plus a dog named Spare-Ribs) got into continuing stories as the 1920s rolled on. In the 1930s, with Dick Tracy, Buck Rogers and the like serving up daily doses of high adventure, the plots got more melodramatic. But the central theme, the funny side of family life, remained. During the early years of the strip, Toots' had a brunette haircut, but by 1925 Murphy changed their hair color to a reddish blond, which was kept until the strip ended.
Other characters included Casper's conceited neighbor Colonel Hoofer (alongside their wife Sophie and their son Teddy), who often found themselves short on cash. Toots' uncles Everett Chuckle and Abner were also featured. Everett found and married their long-lost sweetheart Elsie in 1929, while Abner married Ellen Sullivan in 1934.
Both the daily and the Sunday strips were popular favorites for decades. In 1934, Murphy began including collectible images (formatted like postage stamps) in their Sunday strips along with paper dolls, and these features proved so popular they were subsequently imitated by other cartoonists. The daily Toots and Casper ran until November 17, 1951, with the Sunday strip continuing until December 30, 1956.
Licensing and merchandising
There was a wave of Toots and Casper licensing and merchandising, with items that ran the gamut from pins and dolls to comic books. The daily continued until 1951, and the Sunday strip lasted until 1956. Murphy's illness near the end of the run prompted the recycling of earlier strips and the hiring of ghost artists.
Films
Thelma Hill and Bud Duncan starred in the 1927-29 series of Toots and Casper silent comedy film shorts with Cullen Johnson as Buttercup and George Gray as Casper's boss.
Cultural legacy
The strip gave rise to a much recited jump-rope rhyme:
Toots and Casper went to town.
Tootsie bought an evening gown,
Casper bought a pair of shoes,
Buttercup bought the Daily News.

The American Ultimate Disc League (AUDL) is an ultimate disc league in North America. The AUDL was founded in 2010, and played its inaugural season in 2012 with eight teams. Regular season games are played April through July. The playoffs consist of three rounds: divisional wild card round, division championships, and finally culminating in a final four style showcases known as AUDL Championship Weekend in August. The winner of each division's championship game advances to Championship Weekend, with semifinals on Saturday and the championship game played on Sunday.
AUDL is a semi-professional league. Players do not receive a regular paycheck for playing in the league. Instead, players receive a portion of gate receipts and an ownership interest in the team. Players generally earn $350–$700 per season, and generally hold full-time day jobs.
History
The AUDL was founded by Josh Moore in 2010.
Inaugural season
The first AUDL game was won by the Connecticut Constitution on April 14, 2012, over the Rhode Island Rampage by a score of 29 to 23, and the first goal was scored by Brent Anderson of the Constitution. The first championship was held on August 11, 2012, and was won by the Philadelphia Spinners by a score of 29 to 22 over the Indianapolis AlleyCats.
In the first season, the league consisted of eight teams broken into the Eastern and Western conferences. Jonathan 'Goose' Helton of the AlleyCats was named league MVP for the inaugural season. Helton, alongside Evan Boucher, Cameron Brock, Rob Dulabon, Dave Hochholter, John Korber, and Jake Rainwater were named to the first All-AUDL Team.
2012 lawsuit
In May 2012, the AUDL announced its plans for expansion for the following season, including franchises in New Jersey, New York, and Boston. Owners of the Connecticut Constitution and Rhode Island Rampage contended that the Boston and New York franchises impinged upon their Territory Licensing Agreements, which specified a non-compete radius of 100 miles. Separately, the league compensated the Philadelphia Spinners for the encroachment of the New Jersey and New York franchises. Negotiations between the Constitution, the Rampage, and the league reached an impasse in early June and the franchises' owners threatened legal action. The league preemptively sued the owners on June 17. As negotiations wore on, the league (at least twice) offered various settlements to the owners of the Constitution and the Rampage, but those offers were rejected. On July 5, the Constitution suspended team operations due to legal fees, missing two games. The league then fined the team the maximum fine of $10,000 per game, which Constitution owner Bryan Ricci called "severe and excessive" and refused to pay. Both the Constitution and Rampage had games cancelled near the end of the season. The Constitution would have earned a playoff berth but were disqualified due to their unpaid fines and the Rampage advanced in their place, losing to the Philadelphia Spinners in the Division final.
In December 2012, the league and team owners reached a settlement. Details of the settlement are unknown due to a non-disclosure agreement. Neither the Rampage nor the Connecticut Constitution returned to the AUDL in 2013.
2013–present
For the 2013 season, the Indianapolis AlleyCats and the Detroit Mechanix were the only teams from the 2012 season to remain in their cities, while the Bluegrass Revolution relocated from Lexington, KY to Cincinnati, OH and the Buffalo Hunters relocated and rebranded as the Rochester Dragons. Even with only four teams left, the league still managed to expand to twelve teams overall.
In 2014, the league expanded to 17 teams, including the introduction of the West Division. The league also reached a multi-year broadcasting deal with ESPN3 that covered 14 regular season games, a playoff game, and the Championship Weekend.
In 2015, the league expanded to 25 teams. The new expansion teams consisted of the Pittsburgh Thunderbirds, Ottawa Outlaws, Los Angeles Aviators, San Diego Growlers, Jacksonville Cannons, Nashville NightWatch, Raleigh Flyers, Atlanta Hustle and Charlotte Express. In March 2015, the Salt Lake Lions announced that they would be suspending operations for the entire 2015 season; leaving the West Conference with only 6 teams. In October 2015, the AUDL announced that the Lions franchise had been bought back by the league, making that hiatus permanent. In the same announcement, the league welcomed the Austin Sol and Dallas Roughnecks to the South Division. Shortly thereafter, the AUDL announced that the Rochester Dragons franchise was also being contracted and that the league was again hoping to start a franchise in the Boston area.
Also in 2015, the Raleigh Flyers of the AUDL signed the first ever female professional ultimate player, Jessi Jones, to play in their game against the Nashville Nightwatch. Jones, who was a team USA U-23 player in 2013, was signed as part of "Women's Ultimate Day".
In September 2016, the Cincinnati Revolution and the Charlotte Express announced they would be ceasing operations.
In the 2017 season, Jesse Shofner was selected to the roster for the Nashville Nightwatch, which made them the first female player to make a full season AUDL roster. Shofner subsequently scored two goals in the Nightwatch's first game of the 2017 season, making them the first woman to do so in any AUDL game.
Before the 2018 Season, the Vancouver Riptide announced they would be leaving Vancouver.
Before the 2019 Season, the Nashville Nightwatch and the San Francisco FlameThrowers announced they would be ceasing operations.
On December 4, 2019, the league announced that a new Boston franchise (later named the Boston Glory) would join the league for the 2020 season, its first expansion since 2016. That same day, the league announced a divisional realignment plan that saw the Midwest renamed the Central, the dissolution of the South into a combo South-East Atlantic Division, and the two Texas teams moving to the West division, among other moves.
The 2020 season was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Due to COVID-related travel restrictions, in the 2021 season the three Canadian teams played in an independent series, the Canada Cup. The 19 U.S. teams competed in three divisions: Atlantic, Central, and West. The Boston Glory and the New York Empire moved from the East Division, which did not exist in 2021, to the Atlantic Division.
In December 2021, the league announced three new franchises, the Colorado Summit, Salt Lake Shred, and Portland Nitro. With the addition of these teams the divisions were realigned, with a new South division in place of the Atlantic division. Also in December 2021, the Dallas Roughnecks announced that they were rebranding as the Dallas Legion. In February 2022, the San Jose Spiders announced a move to nearby Oakland.
Rules
The AUDL features a number of rule changes from the traditional set of rules laid out and established by USA Ultimate (USAU) and the WFDF.
The field area is expanded to yards wide and 80 yards long with 20-yard end zones (the same size as an American football field, but with the end zones taking up twice as much of the field as in American football). Games are timed with four-quarters of 12 minutes each, including a 15-minute halftime. If the score is tied, a five-minute overtime period is played. If the score remains tied after overtime, a second overtime is played in which the first team to score wins.
Notable changes from the USAU format include the use of referees, a drop in the stall count from 10 seconds to 7, a ten-yard penalty for travelling when catching the disc, no prohibition of double-teams, and a yardage penalty for travelling when throwing the disc. There are also other infractions, such as too much physicality, that result in 10- or 20-yard penalties depending on the severity of the infraction. While different from the USAU and WFDF rules, many of these changes were also seen in the MLU.
Teams
As of the 2022 season, 25 teams compete in four divisions: South, Central, East and West. There are 22 teams from the continental United States and three from Canada.

DMA's is the debut extended play by Australian indie rock band, DMA's released on 28 March 2014. At the AIR Awards of 2014, the EP was nominated for Best Independent Single/EP. The EP was released in North America on 18 May 2015 via Mom + Pop Music.
Background and release
On 17 February 2014, I OH YOU announced they had signed DMA's and would release their self-titled debut EP on 28 March 2014, based solely on demo's received. The debut single "Delete" was released the same day.
In an interview with Hannah Galvin from Purple Sneakers in March 2014, Matthew Mason said "Some of the songs on it we've had for years. So yeah, some of the songs are like five years old. Half of it was written in the last year... recording took like two weeks, or maybe even one week actually... [and] it was done at Johnny [Took] and Tommy [O'Dell]'s house."
The EPs artwork was painted by Sydney artist Total Bore.
Reception
Musicologist Paul McBride called the EP a "promising start" saying "This five-track debut EP is so steeped in '90s indie-rock and garage-pop flavours that you expect it to let out an extended Liam Gallagher-esque vocal sneer at any second, but thankfully it never comes. Instead, this is a collection of tunes moulded by a combination of Britpop melodies, rough edges and plenty of heart, carried off by a bunch of scallywags you wouldn't trust to borrow your car and bring it back in one piece, if at all. The high point is closer 'Delete'; the most delicate and almost ballad-like track, which will appeal much more to fans of Noel Gallagher than it will to those of their more abrasive younger sibling."
Augustus Welby from Beat Magazine said "The EPs focal melodic aplomb, homespun production grit and well-measured array of guitar sounds warrant plenty of curiosity, however, that unique quality – the element of risk – is lacking at this stage."
Michael Nelson from Stereo Gum said "These are bright, driving, lightly psychedelic, heavily melodic guitar-based pop songs that will hook you on the first listen and only pull you in further from there."

Alice City was a concept proposal for an underground suburb in Tokyo, Japan submitted by the Taisei Corporation in 1989. It was never built.
Concept
The Alice City design was publicised in 1989. It would have been split into three primary sectors- 'Town Space', 'Office Space', and 'Infrastructure Space', accessed by underground railway from a hub, called the 'Alice Terminal', and was promoted as being the first in a potential chain of similar structures.
Town Space
The Town Space would have consisted of "verdant underground boulevards", free of traffic and containing shopping plazas, fitness centers, and theatres in addition to residences.
Office Space
The Office Space would have housed office buildings, hotels, parking lots, and expanded shops. "Solar domes" above office complexes would try to combat claustrophobia. Hotels and offices would be connected to the surface through the use of express elevators.
Infrastructure Space
The Infrastructure Space would handle utilities, such as power generation, heating, and sewage treatment.
Alice Terminal
The hub of the city, Alice Terminal, would have been topped by a 120-meter wide clear dome, 180 meters below the ground. Several railway links would lead out from the terminal to other complexes, and the terminal itself would be landscaped with parks and green space, as well as containing medical facilities, shopping centers, and other amenities for convenience.
Advantages
Many advantages were cited for the plan, primarily the fact that moving infrastructure, primarily industry, offices, and shops underground would free up large amounts of space above ground for redevelopment into parks and green space. The effects of earthquakes would also be greatly reduced underground, diminishing to 1/3 to 1/7 their original levels at only 30 meters below ground. The need for heating would also be diminished, due to temperatures underground holding at a stable 13-15 C.
Disadvantages
A primary issue in development of underground cities is that in the event of a fire or similar disaster, it would be difficult if not impossible to evacuate everyone inside, requiring the construction of separate areas with independent supplies of power and air. Issues of land ownership also hampered the development of Alice City due to Japanese law regarding bodies owning properties above and below ground at the same time.

Boris Vsevolodovich Gromov (; born 7 November 1943) is a prominent Russian military and political figure. From 2000 to 2012, they were the Governor of Moscow Oblast.
Biography
Born 7 November 1943 in Saratov, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union, they graduated from a Suvorov military cadet school, the Leningrad Military Commanders School and later from the Frunze Military Academy in Moscow, as well as the General Staff Academy.
During the Soviet–Afghan War, Gromov did three tours of duty (1980–1982, 1985–1986, 1987–1989), and was best known for the two years as the last Commander of the 40th Army in Afghanistan. Gromov was the last Soviet soldier to leave Afghanistan, crossing on foot the Friendship Bridge spanning the Amu-Daria river on 15 February 1989, the day the Soviet pullout from Afghanistan was completed. They received the highest military award – the golden star of the Hero of the Soviet Union after Operation Magistral had lifted the siege of the city of Khost in eastern Afghanistan.
During the Red Army withdrawal in February 1989, 30 to 40 military trucks crammed with Afghan historical treasures crossed into the Soviet Union, under orders from General Boris Gromov. They cut an antique Tekke carpet stolen from Darul Aman Palace into several pieces, and gave it to their acquaintances.
After the Afghan War, they were chosen as a candidate for Vice President by the Communist Party in the Russian presidential election of 1991 (the candidate for President was former Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov). They served as First Deputy Defence Minister of the Russian Federation. In 1994, Gromov retired from the Russian Armed Forces, and was soon appointed deputy Interior Minister. They were elected, in 1995, to the State Duma, lower house of the Russian parliament. In January 2000, they were elected governor of the Moscow region and re-elected in December 2003.

Bill Miller (1904 – December 9, 2002) was a Russian Empire-born American impresario, best known for serving as the entertainment director for several large casino hotels in Las Vegas from the 1950s to the 1970s. They were the father of music producer Jimmy Miller and of The New York Times reporter Judith Miller.
Biography
Miller was born to a Jewish family in Pinsk, Russia, in 1904, the son of Lena and David Miller. They did not know their family's original surname. The family immigrated to the United States when William was a year old, first settling in Brooklyn, New York, and then Jersey City, New Jersey. Their father worked as a building tradesman, and they had one sister, Mollie Miller Vine.
Miller dropped out of high school after two years to pursue a career as a vaudeville dancer as part of the duo
Miller and Peterson. They danced professionally until they were 30, after which they worked as a vaudeville agent. They became an entrepreneur operating the original Luna Park in Coney Island. In 1945, they purchased the Riviera, a nightclub overlooking the Hudson River in Fort Lee, New Jersey, which had closed during World War II, and renamed it Bill Miller's Riviera. They booked many of the top acts at the time including Tony Martin, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis, Sammy Davis Jr., Joey Bishop, Mae West, and Tito Puente. In 1953, the Riveria was shuttered to make way for the Palisades Parkway.
Also in 1953, Miller purchased a 10% interest in the Sahara hotel and casino and moved to Las Vegas at the invitation of Milton Prell (who had founded the Sahara in 1952), becoming its entertainment director. Starting afresh, as many of their former acts had already been taken to Las Vegas by former Copacabana Club employee, Jack Entratter, they hired Ray Bolger, Donald O'Conner, and Marlene Dietrich. They also pioneered the Las Vegas lounge show concept, booking Louis Prima, Keely Smith, and Sam Butera.
In 1955, Miller left the Sahara and bought an interest in the new Dunes hotel and casino, where they again worked as the entertainment director. At the Dunes, they developed the first of the big Las Vegas production "feathershows", named Smart Affairs, and later developed burlesque shows Lido de Paris and the Folies Bergere with their former producer in New Jersey, Donn Arden. Miller operated a hotel in the Dutch West Indies, before returning to Las Vegas where they served as the entertainment director of the Flamingo (founded by Kirk Kerkorian), where they helped to launch the career of Sonny and Cher with Phil Spector. In 1969, Miller worked at Kerkorian's new hotel, The International, where they booked Barbra Streisand and revived the career of Elvis Presley. The International became the world's largest resort hotel during their tenure. Miller retired in the 1970s.
Personal life
Miller died on December 9, 2002, in Palm Springs, California, at the age of 98.
Miller married four times. They were survived by their fourth wife, Denise B. Miller. They had three children, record producer and musician Jimmy Miller (who predeceased them in the 1990s and was previously married to Australian television personality, actor and singer Kerri-Anne Wright), reporter Judith Miller of The New York Times (married to editor Jason Epstein), and Susan Miller; and a stepson, Jerry Johnson.

Turku Orthodox Church or the Church of the Holy Martyr Empress Alexandra (; , ; ) is the main church of the Turku Orthodox parish located at the northwest corner of the Turku Market Square along the Yliopistonkatu street in Turku, Finland. The church was built under plans drafted by architect Carl Ludvig Engel and was ordered by Nicholas I of Russia on 5 January 1838. Construction, which began in 1839, cost 67,886 rubles and was completed in 1845. The church was consecrated on 2 September 1845. The church was dedicated to Alexandra, the spouse of Diocletian who had publicly become Christianised and suffered a martyr's death on 23 April 303. The choice of patron saint may have been due to Nicholas I's wife's name, Aleksandra Feodorovna.
Most of the icons of the iconostasis come from Valaam Monastery.
The Turku Orthodox church cemetery and cemetery chapel are located in Vasaramäki and there are other parish sanctuaries in Rauma and Salo.

The 2009 Autism Speaks 400 presented by Heluva Good! was the thirteenth points race in the 2009 NASCAR Sprint Cup season, marking the halfway point to the 2009 Chase for the Sprint Cup, and was held at the Dover International Speedway in Delaware's state capital city May 31 of that year, consisting of .
Background
Fox Sports, in its 2009 swan song, televised the race beginning at 1:30 PM US EDT while MRN (terrestrial) and Sirius XM Radio (satellite) handled radio coverage starting at 1 PM.
The biggest change that year at Dover was a new pit road area. Previously, Dover's pit road only had enough room for 42 pit stalls, meaning one team had to share a pit until a car dropped out of the race. Now, thanks to a new pit wall facing the main stands, widening the lanes within pit road by , the area was rebuilt and all 43 cars will have their own pit stalls that are longer than before.
Pre-Race News
The biggest news this week concerned the Hendrick Motorsports #88 team of Dale Earnhardt Jr. Their cousin and crew chief, Tony Eury Jr., who had come with them from Dale Earnhardt Inc. (now Earnhardt Ganassi Racing) two years ago in one of the biggest events of that Silly Season, was fired. They will be replaced for the next two races with manager Brian Whitesell. Lance Magrew, a veteran crew chief will take over at Michigan.
Entry list
Qualifying
Jeff Gordon wrecked their car in the first run of qualifying. David Reutimann, winner of the previous week's rain-shortened Coca-Cola 600 took their third career pole.
Failed to Qualify: Brad Keselowski (#25), Max Papis (#13), Derrike Cope (#75), David Starr (#06).
Race recap
The Jimmie Johnson #48 Lowe's team chose a rather unusual strategy: they chose the last pit stall (the newly designated 43rd pit stall). It worked to a charm as they led the most laps (298), and made the win with a pass of Tony Stewart with three laps to go and claim the win coming from seventh place on the final pit stop under caution that had earlier cost them the lead.

A medical animation is a short educational film, usually based around a physiological or surgical topic, that is rendered using 3D computer graphics. While it may be intended for an array of audiences, the medical animation is most commonly utilized as an instructional tool for medical professionals or their patients.
Early medical animations were limited to basic wire-frame models because of low processor speed. However, rapid evolution in microprocessor design and computer memory has led to animations that are significantly more intricate.
The medical animation may be viewed as a standalone visualization, or in combination with other sensory input devices, such as head-mounted displays, stereoscopic lenses, haptic gloves, interactive workstations, or Cave Automatic Virtual Environments (CAVEs).
History
Though evolved from the field of realistic medical illustrations (such as those created by Flemish anatomist Andreas Vesalius in the 16th century), medical animations are also indebted to motion picture technology and computer-generated imagery.
The term medical animation predates the advent of computer-generated graphics by approximately three decades. Though the first computer animation was created at Bell Telephone Labs in 1963, the phrase "medical animation" appears in scholarly contexts as early as 1932 in the Journal of Biological Photography. As discussed by Clarke and Hoshall, the term referred to two-dimensional illustrated motion pictures produced for inclusion in films screened for medical students.
The creation of the computer-generated medical animation began in earnest in the early 1970s. The first description of the use of 3D computer graphics for a medical purpose can be found in an issue of the journal Science, dated 1975. Its authors, a team of researchers from the Departments of Chemistry and of Biochemistry and Biophysics at Texas A&M University, described the potential uses of medical animation for visualizing complex macromolecules.
By the late 1980s, the medical animation had become a distinct modality of physiological and surgical instruction. By that point, researchers had suggested that the 3D medical animations could illustrate physiological, molecular or anatomical concepts that might otherwise be infeasible.
Today's medical animation industry comprises one facet of the non-entertainment computer animation industry, which has annual revenues of $15 billion per year worldwide.
Applications
Patient Education
A growing trend among medical animation studios is the creation of clips focused on explaining surgical procedures or pharmaceutical mechanisms of action in terms simple enough for a layperson to understand. These animations may be found on hospital websites, in doctor's office workstations, online health websites, or via medical animation studios themselves. Such animations may also appear on television shows, OTT platforms and other popular entertainment venues as a way to educate an audience on a medical topic under discussion.
Occasionally, this form of animation is used in-hospital. In this context, clips may be used in order to get fully informed consent from patients facing surgery or medical treatment. Likewise, studies have suggested that patient-educating medical animations may be able to reduce the rate of accidental wrong-site surgeries.
Medical simulation
Due to both the relative scarcity of cadavers to be used for surgical instruction and to the dwindling use of animals and patients who have not given consent, institutes may utilize medical animations as a way to teach doctors-to-be anatomical and surgical concepts. Such simulations may be viewed passively (as in the case of 3D medical animations included via CD-ROM in medical textbook packages) or using interactive controls. The stimulation of hand-eye skills using haptics is another possible use of medical animation technology, one that stems from the replacement of cadavers in surgical classrooms with task trainers and mannequins.
The creation of proportionally accurate virtual bodies is often accomplished using medical scans, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Such techniques represent a cost- and time-saving move away from the creation of medical animations using sectioned cadavers. For instance, the National Library of Medicine's Visible Human Project created 3D medical animations of the male and female bodies by scanning cadavers using CT technology, after which they were frozen, shaved into millimeter-thick sections and recorded using high-resolution photographs.
By comparison, medical animations made using only scanned data can recreate the internal structures of live patients, often in the context of surgical planning.
Cellular and molecular animation
Medical animations are often employed as a method of visualizing the vast number of microscopic processes that occur in the human body. These may involve the interplay between organelles, the transcription of DNA, the molecular action of enzymes, the interactions between pathogens and white blood cells or virtually any other cellular or sub-cellular process.
Molecular animations are similar in that they depict structures that are too small for the human eye to see. However, this latter category is also capable of illustrating atomic structures, which are often too minute to be visualized with any clarity via microscopy.
Cellular animation can use models built manually or ones which originate from microscopy and subsequent polygonal 3d surface creation.
Pharmaceutical mechanism of action
As a way to explain how medications work, pharmaceutical manufacturers may provide mechanism of action animations, often through websites dedicated to specific prescription drugs. These medical visualizations typically do not represent cellular structures in a fully accurate or proportional way. Instead, mechanism of action animations may visually simplify the interaction between drug molecules and cells. These medical animations may also explain the physiological origins of the disease itself.
Emergency care instruction
Several studies have suggested that 3D medical animations may be used to instruct novices on how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation in an emergency. These reports usually suggest the use of pre-prepared, voice-narrated motion-capture animations that are viewed by means of a cellphone or other portable electronic device.
Forensic reconstruction
A number of applications for medical animations has been developed in the field of forensics. These include the so-called "virtutopsy," or MRI-assisted virtual autopsy, of remains that are too damaged to be otherwise inspected or reconstructed. Likewise, medical animations can appear in courtrooms, be used as forensic "reconstructions" of crime scenes or recreate the crimes themselves. The admissibility of such evidence is questionable.
Electronic or Interactive learning
Researchers have suggested that medical animations can be used to disseminate medical education materials electronically, allowing them to be accessed and utilized by professional and amateur health practitioners alike.
Surgical training and planning
Some institutes use animations both to teach medical students how to perform basic surgery, and to give seasoned surgeons the chance to expand their skill set. Multiple studies have been conducted on the effectiveness and feasibility of medical animation-based surgical pre-planning. Experimental animation tools have been created as integral technology in image-guided surgery as well. Today, surgical training uses medical animation combined with virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and simulation.

Irving M. London (July 24, 1918 – May 23, 2018) was a hematologist and geneticist. They were an associate professor of medicine at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons when they were selected to be the founding chair of the department of medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 1955. They were recruited to become the founding director of the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology in 1970. Dr. London was the first professor to hold dual roles at both Harvard and MIT.
London graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Medical School. London died on May 23, 2018, two months before their 100th birthday.
Family and early life
London was born in Malden, Massachusetts on 24 July 1918. Their parents identified as Russian Jewish. Their mother may have been named Rose London (1892-1944), and a sister named Marion.
In their childhood years, London had polio. They completed their primary and secondary education at Malden Public Schools in Massachusetts.
While in college, London worked at a library on a salary funded by the National Youth Administration as part of the New Deal during the Great Depression era.
London married Huguette Piedzicki. They met in Paris and maintained a long-distance relationship until marriage. They had two Children, Robb and David, and many extended family members.
Career
London graduated from Harvard College in 1939 summa cum laude. They were on a student committee at Harvard that gave 14 refugee students the opportunity to leave Nazi-occupied Europe to study in Boston. London also earned a second undergraduate degree from Hebrew College in Roxbury at the same time. London delivered the graduating address at Harvard, the content of which was inspired by their thesis "The Jeffersonian Tradition in American Nationalism". London gave serious though to attending law school after graduation, but ultimately chose to enroll in medical school.
After completing an MD from HMS in 1943, Dr. London accepted an intership at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York. During World War II they served as a US Army captain in the Medical Corps were they conducted research on the use of chloroquine as an antimalarial medication. After the war, they were assigned to Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands of the South Pacific Ocean to serve a physician at the atomic bomb testing.
London returned to New York City after the war to continue residency training. Upon completion, they joined the department of biochemistry at Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons and was promoted to faculty, teaching and tenure. Their research focused on the lifespan of red blood cells in normal and pathological conditions. In 1954, they were selected to be the founding chair of the department of medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and was director of medical services at Bronx Municipal Hospital until 1970.
In 1968, London was invited as a consultant to planning for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard Medical School joint program. In 1970 they accepted a position a director of the new Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology, and around 1972 they were also a physician at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital. London served as director of the program until 1985 while simultaneously a professor of medicine at HMS and a professor of biology at MIT.
Awards and achievements
London is best known for groundbreaking explanation for the molecular regulation (gene transcription and translation) of hemoglobin synthesis. London and colleagues demonstrated that hemoglobin is the endogenous source of bilirubin, an important event in the fields of jaundice and heme oxygenase research.

This is a timeline of women's suffrage in New Jersey. Women and African Americans had the right to vote in New Jersey until the state constitution was changed in 1807, disenfranchising all but white men. Any early suffrage protest was taken by Lucy Stone in 1857 who refused to pay their property taxes because they could not vote. Additional attempts to make women more equal under the law took place in the 1880s and 1890s. There were also several court cases that challenged women's right to vote in the state. Eventually, a voter referendum on a state constitutional suffrage amendment took place in 1915, however the measure was voted down. Activists continued to fight both in the state and to protest in Washington, D.C. as Silent Sentinels. By February 10, 1920, New Jersey ratified the Nineteenth Amendment.

Armand-Jean de Vignerot Du Plessis, duc de Richelieu (Le Havre, 3 October 1629 – Paris, 20 May 1715), was a French naval officer and nobleman. Their surname has also been spelled Vignerod Duplessis.
Life and career
Their father was François de Vignerot (died 26 January 1646 in Paris), who was the son of René de Vignerot and Françoise du Plessis de Richelieu (died 1615), one of the sisters of Cardinal Richelieu. They were carefully raised with their two brothers under the direction of their father's sister, the Duchess of Aiguillon, who had a marked preference for him. They became Duke of Richelieu by substitution and invested with the dignity of peer of France by the will of their great-uncle, Cardinal Richelieu, when barely thirteen years old at the latter's death in December 1642. They adopted the cardinal's surname of Du Plessis and also inherited part of the cardinal's art collection and library and their Hôtel de Richelieu (later known at the Palais Brion, just west of the Palais-Cardinal). Construction had begun in 1642 to house the cardinal's library but was unfinished at the time of the cardinal's death, when further construction halted.
Vignerot Du Plessis also became . They were sent to Naples, which had risen up against the Spanish and proclaimed the Neapolitan Republic. They joined up with Don John of Austria's fleet off Capri but was unable to land the troops they were transporting.
Art collection
The art works the duke inherited from Cardinal Richelieu were the beginning of a collection that was admired for its quality by Gian Lorenzo Bernini when they visited Paris in 1665. Paul Fréart de Chantelou, Bernini's guide and the chronicler of their visit, mentions Nicolas Poussin's the Plague at Ashdod (1630–1631, Louvre), one of fifteen paintings by Poussin owned by the duke, among which were the Triumph of Pan (1636, private collection), the Apotheosis of Saint Paul (1649–1650, Louvre), and the Four Seasons (commissioned by the duke in 1660; Louvre). The duke also owned Titian's Virgin with a Rabbit (16th century, Louvre), Annibale Caracci's The Stoning of Saint Stephen (c. 1603, Louvre), and Parmigianino's Portrait of a Young Man (1584, Louvre).
The duke commissioned Pierre Dulin to paint pendants to three paintings of pagan festivals by Poussin, including one to the Triumph of Pan. Dulin also made two large portraits of the Duke, one dressed as a Roman on horseback, the other of them in armor.

General elections were held in Pakistan on 25 February 1985 to elect members of the National Assembly. The elections were held under the military government of Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq after the restoration of the 1973 constitution.
Around 1,300 candidates contested the elections, which were held on a nonpartisan basis. Each candidate was required to have their nomination paper signed by 50 registered voters from the constituency they wished to stand in. In an attempt to disqualify a large number of opposition candidates and secure a conservative leadership, Zia-ul-Haq introduced amendments to the Political Parties Act of 1962. As a result, the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy (MRD), which was calling for an end to the military regime, boycotted the elections.
Voter turnout was 52.93%, considerably lower than the previous two elections. Most of the elected MNAs were supporters of the Zia regime. A new government was formed under the leadership of Muhammad Khan Junejo, a lesser known figure in national politics. Prime Minister Junejo and their followers subsequently established the pro-Zia conservative Pakistan Muslim League.
Results
Aftermath
Following the elections, Muhammad Khan Junejo was appointed Prime Minister and later formed a new party, the Pakistan Muslim League. The election boycott was viewed to have been a misstep for the MRD, which had assumed the public would support its stance.

The Churchill Play is a play by Howard Brenton. Written in 1974, the play offers a dystopian picture of an authoritarian England ten years in the future (i.e. 1984) and is set in an internment camp named after Winston Churchill. The play of the title is actually a play within a play, one put on by inmates of the camp, in which soldiers stand guard over Churchill's catafalque, only for them to rise from the dead.
Originally performed at the Nottingham Playhouse in 1974, it was directed by Richard Eyre and designed by Hayden Griffin. Among the cast were Julian Curry, Bill Dean, Dave Hill, Colin McCormack, Jonathan Pryce, Eric Richard, Roger Sloman, Tom Wilkinson, and Jane Wymark.
A slightly rewritten version of the play was presented by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1978, first at The Other Place, then at the Warehouse Theatre. For this production the director was Barry Kyle and the cast included John Bowe, David Bradley, Bill Dean, Donald Douglas, Geoffrey Freshwater, Philip McGough, Hilton McRae, John Nettles, Ian Reddington, and Juliet Stevenson.
The critic Harold Hobson admired Brenton's writing, but found much of their perceived criticism of Churchill and take on the Second World War to be misplaced.

A leaders' debate or presidential debate is a public debate held during a general election campaign, where the candidates expose their political opinions and public policy proposals, and criticism of them, to potential voters. They are normally broadcast live on radio, television and Internet. The events may be organized by media corporations or non-government organizations.
Leaders' debates are often popular with voters, whose decisions might be greatly influenced by the outcome. Leaders have occasionally attempted to use props (such as charts or signs bearing slogans) during a debate with varying degrees of success.
History
Precursors to television debates were the candidate forums broadcast over radio in elections in the 1920s. The success of early televised debates such as the 1960 American presidential debate between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, viewed by 70 million people, would eventually spur the desire to hold similar, televised debates in countries under the parliamentary system. Television had quickly proven to be an excellent and efficient means of reaching out to large blocs of the electorate. The unique aspect of the parliamentary system which creates the desire to hold leaders' debates is that the party leader is usually the party's presumed candidate to lead the government, because by constitutional convention they or they will usually become prime minister or premier if their or their party is able to obtain a majority, by itself or as part of a coalition government. However, a leaders' debate is not technically a candidates debate in the same sense that an American presidential debate would be, because in the latter case the American political parties have explicitly nominated the named individuals as their candidates for president and vice president.
Format
The exact format for a leaders' debate varies, but normally the debate will begin with each leader making a short opening statement. Then a panel of well-known journalists will ask sets of prepared questions, which are to be answered either by all of the leaders or by one specific leader. After the leader(s) answer each question, the other leader(s) may get a chance to make a brief response, after which there may be some time allocated for an often heated "free for all" debate. The moderator will usually attempt to exercise some control through all of this, and then stop the debate after time has elapsed so the next question can be asked. After the panelists finish asking questions, each leader will make their or their closing remarks and the debate will end.
Who gets invited to participate in a leaders' debate is often a sensitive issue. Some jurisdictions may have dozens of fringe political parties which few networks would care to have participating in their debates. For the sake of brevity, and to ensure the leaders of the main parties have adequate time to address voters on a wide range of issues, it is extremely rare for any leaders' debate to have more than five leaders. A more common number would be three while Australia has two. Leaders' debates are often restricted to parties which elected representatives in the previous election. Exceptions may be made for parties with close to a full slate of candidates, but this is not always the case. For example, in Canada in the 2004 and 2006 the Green Party of Canada was excluded from the federal leaders' debates until 2008 when public pressure on the other parties allowed the Green Party to join the debate, and the Alberta Alliance was excluded from the Albertan provincial leaders debate, even though both parties had full slates in their respective elections. Parties that are excluded will often complain bitterly about their exclusion, sometimes claiming that the political establishment has conspired in an effort to keep their party on the political fringe. The inclusion of certain parties in debates can be controversial too. A common complaint about the Canadian debates is voiced by a report from the Centre for the Study of Democracy, which calls for the Bloc Québécois, a party only active in mostly French-speaking Quebec, to be removed from its current position in the English-language debates.
In Georgia, debates were often so heated that the debaters would be placed in separate rooms.
The 2019 Ukrainian presidential election innovated a new approach to the concept of a leaders' debate, where now-president, then-candidate Volodymyr Zelensky proposed to hold debates publicly in the country's largest stadium, the Kiev Olympic Stadium. After much negotiation, the debates were held 48 hours before the election between then-president Peter Poroshenko and Zelensky, in front of nearly 30,000 spectators.

Flensburg Firth or Flensborg Fjord (; ) is the westernmost inlet of the Baltic Sea. It forms part of the border between Germany to the south and Denmark to the north, on the eastern side of Schleswig Holstein and Jutland, respectively. Its length is between 40 and 50 km, depending on where it is considered to begin. It has the largest area of all the fjords of East Jutland, which are a special type of inlet, different from geological fjords.
Two peninsulas, Broager on the northern side and Holnis on the southern side, divide the inlet into an outer and an inner part. West of them, near the Danish coast, there are two small islands called Okseøerne (meaning Ox Isles).
On the Danish side, the outer part of the northern end of the firth is partly closed off by the island of Als, with the town of Sønderborg on it. Towards the west, continuing on the Danish side, are Broager, Egernsund, Gråsten, Rinkenæs, Sønderhav, and Kollund.
In Germany at the Danish border there is Harrislee, at the inner end of the inlet the town of Flensburg, east of it on the southern shore the town of Glücksburg and the villages of Munkbrarup, Langballig, Westerholz, Quern, Steinbergkirche, Niesgrau, Gelting, and Nieby.
The tourist attractions of the Flensburg Firth are the church of Broager, the Ox Isles, Sønderborg Castle, Glücksburg Castle, the Naval Academy Mürwik (known as the Red Castle) and the harbour of Flensburg.

Elisa Ann Schwartz, mostly known by their stage name Elisa Jordana, is an American radio and TV personality, musician, writer, and online talk-show host.  They are best known for their appearances on The Howard Stern Show and as a former member of the dance-pop band Cobra Starship.
Early life
Jordana was born and raised in Old Bridge, New Jersey. They grew up listening to New Kids on the Block and Whitney Houston. They wrote their first song at age seven; by the time they were in their teens they were already writing songs for their high school's musicals. They moved to New York City at 17 and continued to write and play around the city.
Jordana studied in Radio, Television, and Digital Communications at Connecticut School of Broadcasting, the same school fellow former Howard Stern staff member Artie Lange attended. They also attended Berklee College of Music for a couple of semesters before joining Cobra Starship.
Career
They began their entertainment career as the keytar player for the dance-pop band Cobra Starship.
Music
Jordana was an original member of Cobra Starship as a keytarist and backup singer. In 2007, they parted ways with the band to focus on their solo career, launching singles such as "Fuck You, I'm Fine," "Online Sweetheart," and an album titled Introducing Elisa Jordana.
Radio
Jordana first made their debut on The Howard Stern Show in November 2011. They were interviewed by Howard Stern about their relationship with a writer of the show, Benjy Bronk. Jordana appeared in studio nearly a dozen times after that for interviews, games, and musical performances.
After 12 appearances live in studio, Jordana was hired as a staff writer on the program.
Writer
After writing comedy for The Howard Stern Show, Jordana became a student of The New York Times Best Selling Author Susan Shapiro. Jordana has written articles for XOJane, Marie Claire, Yahoo, and The Rumpus.
Television
Outside of making multiple appearances on Howard Stern On Demand, Jordana first made their television debut on the Fuse TV reality television series, Redemption Song. The show was hosted by professional wrestler Chris Jericho and was based on 11 women who competed to win a record deal with Geffen Records.
In 2016, Jordana made their film debut in the SyFy television movie Sharknado: The 4th Awakens, along with their dog Kermit.
Radar Online confirmed in April 2017 that Jordana signed on to become a new cast member in the Bravo reality series Vanderpump Rules.
Online talk show host
Once they left The Howard Stern Show, Jordana created their own talk show titled Kermit and Friends. They started broadcasting the show on Spreecast in February 2015 and lasted for over a year. The show was heavily featured on The Howard Stern Show and received acknowledgment from talk-show host Jimmy Kimmel.
In 2017, after being disappointed in appearing briefly in Vanderpump Rules for a single season, Jordana worked at a private equity company selling gold to wealthy investors before the company got shut down due to various issues at the company and COVID-19. A month before losing their dog Kermit, Jordana got to work from home which in their own words was "a blessing from God that I got to spend the last month with Kermit on my lap as my coworker." Jordana joined the Christian Church and through the church, they were inspired to start the Kermit And Friends podcast up again to celebrate Kermit's life. They were soon joined by personalities such as Victoria Asher, Rachel Luba, John Melendez, The Drew and Mike Podcast, and a variety of other celebrities, pets, and puppets. A big storyline has been Jordana's chaotic engagement to Andy Dick, who often appears on the podcast inebriated after initially being the show's reverend.
Jordana has also featured several members of the Wack Pack on their podcast, including High Pitch Erik and Wendy the Retard.
On April 3, 2022, Dick appeared on the podcast badly beaten up and was visited by medics.

The 10th Aerospace Defense Group was inactivated on 31 December 1970 by the United States Air Force (USAF). Its last assignment was with Fourteenth Aerospace Force at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. The 10th Aerospace Defense Group and Squadron were the sole operators of the United States' second nuclear-tipped anti-satellite weapon, Weapons System 437 (WS-437). For this reason the squadron continues the group history through temporary bestowal.
The United States Air Force's 10th Air Defense Squadron is also an inactive USAF organization, that preceded and followed the 10th group at Vandenberg as the 10th Aerospace Defense Squadron. Once WS-437 became non-operational in the 1970s, the squadron assumed the mission of launching Defense Meteorological Satellite Program satellites into orbit until its mission was transferred. It was later activated an air defense unit and from 1992 to 1997 was located at Wheeler AFS, Hawaii.
History
Space Mission
Anti Satellite Defense
The 10th Aerospace Defense Squadron was activated in late 1963 to operate Weapons System 437, using nuclear equipped Thor missiles. The squadron was located at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, but launch facilities were at Johnston Island Air Force Base. Two missiles were stationed at each location.
In 1961, Air Force Systems Command (AFSC) had formed the 6595th Test Squadron to perform operational testing on the system. As the program approached operational status, AFSC transferred the 6595th to Air Defense Command (ADC) in November 1962. ADC discontinued the test squadron and used its personnel and equipment to activate the 10th Aerospace Defense Squadron The group replaced the squadron in 1967. The Johnston Island location was upgraded to a subordinate squadron at the same time.
Defense Meteorological Satellite Program
At the end of 1970, the 10th Squadron replaced the group and the 24th Aerospace Defense Squadron. WS 437 was put into standby status with the squadron maintaining system components. The squadron then changed its mission to support of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). The DMSP mission was performed by Strategic Air Command until it was transferred to ADC in 1970.
The DMSP generates terrestrial and space weather data for the United States operational forces worldwide. Data from this program is also furnished to the civilian community through the Department of Commerce. DMSP satellites circle the Earth at an altitude of about 500 miles in a near-polar, sun-synchronous orbit. The Block 5 DMSP satellites launched during the time the squadron was active used Thor launchers (similar to those used by WS 437) to boost them into orbit. In 1979, the squadron was inactivated when responsibility for management of the DMSP program was transferred to Space Division of AFSC. Unfortunately, the squadron remained responsible for operational DMSP launches, "the [AFSC] program office authorized launch of the last Block 5C satellite on 19 February 1976 with incorrect weight-to-propellant-loading calculations. Launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, the Thor/Burner II booster rose majestically through the atmosphere, reached the edge of space, exhausted its propellant, and the DMSP satellite whistled back to Earth—a total loss."
Air Defense in Hawaii
In 1992, the 10th squadron was again activated as the 10th Air Defense Squadron, replacing the 6010th Aerospace Defense Group at Wheeler Air Force Base when the USAF eliminated or redesignated all existing MAJCON (major command controlled) four digit units. The 6010th had been formed by upgrading the 6010th Aerospace Defense Flight in 1989 when the 327th Air Division was inactivated.
The squadron coordinated air defense activities in Hawaii with the Hawaii Air National Guard and maintained operational control of Air National Guard alert aircraft. The squadron supervised aircraft control and warning units within the Pacific Islands Defense Region, directing aircraft operations and defense activities from its Air Defense Control Center. The squadron continued these activities until it was inactivated in 1997.

A cordon sanitaire (, French for "sanitary cordon") is the restriction of movement of people into or out of a defined geographic area, such as a community, region, or country. The term originally denoted a barrier used to stop the spread of infectious diseases. The term is also often used metaphorically, in English, to refer to attempts to prevent the spread of an ideology deemed unwanted or dangerous, such as the containment policy adopted by George F. Kennan against the Soviet Union (see cordon sanitaire (politics)).
Origin
The term cordon sanitaire dates to 1821, when the Duke de Richelieu deployed French troops to the border between France and Spain, to prevent yellow fever from spreading into France.
Definition
A cordon sanitaire is generally created around an area experiencing an epidemic or an outbreak of infectious disease, or along the border between two nations. Once the cordon is established, people from the affected area are no longer allowed to leave or enter it. In the most extreme form, the cordon is not lifted until the infection is extinguished. Traditionally, the line around a cordon sanitaire was quite physical; a fence or wall was built, armed troops patrolled, and inside, inhabitants were left to battle the affliction without help. In some cases, a "reverse cordon sanitaire" (also known as protective sequestration) may be imposed on healthy communities that are attempting to keep an infection from being introduced. Public health specialists have included cordon sanitaire along with quarantine and medical isolation as "nonpharmaceutical interventions" designed to prevent the transmission of microbial pathogens through social distancing.
The cordon sanitaire is not used now in its most extreme historical form. This is partly due to our improved understanding of disease transmission, treatment and prevention. In modern days, its function is more to allow easier identification and control over contagion spreading. For example, in China, in tightly controlled cordons one delegated family member might have been given an exit pass to do daily shopping, while in loosely controlled cordons individuals might be permitted to enter and exit without control (other than a temperature check) through a main entrance, while other entrances are temporarily blocked.
In its more traditional role, the cordon also remains a useful intervention under conditions in which: 1) the infection is highly virulent (contagious and likely to cause illness); 2) the case fatality rate is very high; 3) treatment is nonexistent or difficult; and 4) there is no vaccine, or other means of immunizing large numbers of people (such as needles or syringes) are lacking. During the COVID-19 pandemic cordons sanitaires were imposed on geographic regions around the world in an attempt to contain the infection.
16th century
In 1523, during a plague outbreak in Birgu, the town was cordoned off by guards to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of Malta.
17th century
In 1655, cordon sanitaire was imposed on the town of Żabbar in Malta after a plague outbreak was detected. The disease spread to other settlements and similar restrictive measures were imposed, and the outbreak was successfully contained after causing 20 deaths.
In May 1666, the English village of Eyam famously imposed a cordon sanitaire on itself after an outbreak of the bubonic plague in the community. During the next 14 months almost eighty percent of the inhabitants died. A perimeter of stones was laid out surrounding the village and no one passed the boundary in either direction until November 1667, when the pestilence had run its course. Neighbouring communities provided food for Eyam, leaving supplies in designated locations along the boundary cordon and receiving payment in coins "disinfected" by running water or vinegar.
18th century
During the Great Northern War plague outbreak of 1708–1712, cordons sanitaires were established around affected towns like Stralsund, Helsingør, and Königsberg; one was also established around the whole Duchy of Prussia and another one between Scania and the Danish isles along the Sound, with Saltholm as the central quarantine station.
In 1770 the Empress Maria Theresa set up a cordon sanitaire between Austria and the Ottoman Empire to prevent people and goods infected with plague from crossing the border. Cotton and wool were held in storehouses for weeks, with peasants paid to sleep on the bales and monitored to see if they showed signs of disease. Travelers were quarantined for 21 days under ordinary circumstances and up to 48 days when there was confirmation of plague being active in Ottoman territory. The cordon was maintained until 1871, and there were no major outbreaks of plague in Austrian territory after the cordon sanitaire was established, whereas the Ottoman Empire continued to suffer frequent epidemics of plague until the mid-19th century.
During the 1793 Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic, roads and bridges leading to the city were blocked off by soldiers from the local militia to prevent the illness from spreading. This was before the transmission mechanics of yellow fever were well understood.
19th century
During the 1813–1814 Malta plague epidemic, the main urban settlements of Malta (Valletta, Floriana and the Three Cities) and rural settlements with a high mortality rate (Birkirkara, Qormi, Żebbuġ and later Xagħra) were cordoned off by the military to prevent people from entering or leaving.
The first actual use of the term cordon sanitaire was in 1821, when the Duke de Richelieu deployed 30,000 French troops to the border between France and Spain in the Pyrenees Mountains, allegedly in order to prevent yellow fever from spreading from Barcelona into France but in fact mainly to prevent the spread of liberal ideas from constitutional Spain.
The 1821 yellow fever epidemic ravaged Barcelona and a cordon sanitaire was set up around the entire city of 150,000 people. Between 18,000 and 20,000 died in four months.
During the 1830 cholera outbreak in Russia, Moscow was surrounded by a military cordon, most roads leading to the city were dug up to hinder travel, and all but four entrances to the city were sealed.
During the 1856 yellow fever epidemic a cordon sanitaire was implemented in several cities in the state of Georgia with moderate success.
In 1869, Adrien Proust (father of novelist Marcel Proust) proposed the use of an international cordon sanitaire to control the spread of cholera, which had emerged from India and was threatening Europe and Africa. Proust proposed that all ships bound for Europe from India and Southeast Asia be quarantined at Suez, however their ideas were not generally embraced.
In 1882, in response to a virulent outbreak of yellow fever in Brownsville, Texas, and in northern Mexico, a cordon sanitaire was established 180 miles north of the city, terminating at the Rio Grande to the west and the Gulf of Mexico to the east. People traveling north had to remain quarantined at the cordon for 10 days before they were certified disease-free and could proceed.
In 1888, during a yellow fever epidemic, the city of Jacksonville, Florida, was surrounded by an armed cordon sanitaire by order of Governor Edward A. Perry.
In 1899, an outbreak of the plague in Honolulu was managed by a cordon sanitaire around the Chinatown district. In an attempt to control the infection, a barbed wire perimeter was created and people's belongings and homes were burned.
20th century
During the San Francisco plague of 1900–1904 San Francisco's Chinatown was subjected to a cordon sanitaire.
In 1902, Louisiana imposed a cordon sanitaire to prevent Italian immigrants from disembarking at the port of New Orleans. The shipping company sued for damages, but the state's right to impose a cordon was upheld in Compagnie Francaise de Navigation a Vapeur v. Louisiana Board of Health.
From 1903 to 1914, the Belgian colonial government imposed a cordon sanitaire on Uele Province in the Belgian Congo to control outbreaks of trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness).
1918 flu pandemic:
The 1918 flu spread so rapidly that, in general, there was no time to implement cordons sanitaires. However, to prevent an introduction of the infection, residents of Gunnison, Colorado isolated themselves from the surrounding area for two months at the end of 1918. All highways were barricaded near the county lines. Train conductors warned all passengers that if they stepped outside of the train in Gunnison, they would be arrested and quarantined for five days. As a result of this protective sequestration, no one died of influenza in Gunnison during the epidemic.
During the 1918 flu pandemic, the then Governor of American Samoa, John Martin Poyer, imposed a reverse cordon sanitaire of the islands from all incoming ships, successfully achieving zero deaths within the territory. In contrast, the neighboring New Zealand-controlled Western Samoa was among the hardest hit, with a 90% infection rate and over 20% of its adults dying from the disease.
In late 1918, Spain attempted unsuccessfully to prevent the spread of the 1918 flu by imposing border controls, roadblocks, restricted rail travel, and a maritime cordon sanitaire prohibiting ships with sick passengers from landing, but by then the epidemic was already in progress.
During the 1972 Yugoslav smallpox outbreak, over 10,000 people were sequestered in cordons sanitaires of villages and neighborhoods using roadblocks, and there was a general prohibition of public assembly, a closure of all borders and a prohibition of all non-essential travel.
In 1995, a cordon sanitaire was used to control an outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Kikwit, Zaire. President Mobutu Sese Seko surrounded the town with troops and suspended all flights into the community. Inside Kikwit, the World Health Organization and Zaire medical teams erected further cordons sanitaires, isolating burial and treatment zones from the general population.
21st century
During the 2003 SARS outbreak in Canada, "community quarantine" was used to successfully reduce transmission of the disease.
During the 2003 SARS outbreak in mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore, large-scale quarantine was imposed on travelers arriving from other SARS areas, work and school contacts of suspected cases, and, in a few instances, entire apartment complexes where high attack rates of SARS were occurring. In China, entire villages in rural areas were quarantined and no travel was allowed in or out of the villages. One village in Hebei province was quarantined from 12 April 2003 until 13 May. Tens of thousands of individuals fled from areas when they learned of an impending cordon sanitaire, thereby possibly spreading the epidemic.
In August 2014, a cordon sanitaire was established around some of the most affected areas of the Western African Ebola virus epidemic. On 19 August 2014, the Liberian government quarantined the entirety of the district of West Point of the capital, Monrovia, and issued a statewide curfew. The cordon sanitaire of the West Point area was lifted on 30 August. The information minister, Lewis Brown, said that this step was taken to ease efforts to screen, test, and treat residents.
In January 2020, a cordon sanitaire was drawn around the Chinese city of Wuhan, known as the Wuhan lockdown, due to what became the COVID-19 pandemic. As the outbreak expanded, travel restrictions impacted over half of the Chinese population, creating what may be the largest cordon sanitaire in history until this was surpassed by the lockdown in India, affecting the entire 1.3 billion population, in March 2020. By April 2020, half of the world's population was under some form of lockdown in more than 90 countries in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the 2020–2021 Malaysian movement control order and a nationwide lockdown in Italy.
In popular culture
A cordon sanitaire was used as a plot device by Albert Camus in their 1947 novel The Plague.
In the 1995 film Outbreak, an Ebola-like virus brought from Africa causes an epidemic in a small town in California, resulting in the United States Army forming a cordon sanitaire around the town.
The 2002 film 28 Days Later depicts a cordon sanitaire imposed on Great Britain as a viral infection devastates the population.
In The Last Town on Earth, a 2006 novel by Thomas Mullen, the town of Commonwealth, Washington in 1918 imposes a reverse cordon sanitaire to avoid the Spanish flu, however the disease is introduced by a wandering soldier.
In the 2006 novel World War Z the nation of Israel imposes a reverse cordon sanitaire to keep zombies out.
In the 2011 film Contagion, the city of Chicago is cordoned off to contain the spread of a meningoencephalitis virus.
In the 2014 Belgian TV series Cordon, a cordon sanitaire is set up to contain an outbreak of avian influenza in Antwerp.
In the 2016 television limited series Containment a cordon sanitaire is set up to contain an infectious virus in Atlanta, Georgia.
In the 2019 novel The Dreamers by Karen Thompson Walker, the fictional California town of Santa Lora is placed under cordon sanitaire due to a sleeping sickness that infects its residents.

In cricket, a player is said to have scored a century when they score 100 or more runs in a single innings. The Asia Cup is a One Day International (ODI) tournament organised by the Asian Cricket Council, a subordinate of the International Cricket Council (ICC). Originally started as a biennial tournament in 1984, it has since been organised 14 times as of the latest edition in 2018. Since its inception, a total of 53 centuries have been scored by 43 players from five different teams—Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Hong Kong. Affiliate teams such as Afghanistan and the United Arab Emirates are yet to have a centurion. Pakistan and India have scored the most centuries with 16 each, while Bangladesh has the least with six centuries.
Notable Records
The first player to score a century in the tournament was Pakistan's Moin-ul-Atiq, who made 105 against Bangladesh in the third edition (1988). In the same match, their teammate Ijaz Ahmed scored 124 not out.
India's Navjot Singh Sidhu and Sachin Tendulkar were the lone centurions of the 1990 and 1995 tournaments, respectively.
The 2008 edition saw 13 centuries—the highest for a tournament—while no centuries were made in 1984 and 1986.
Sri Lanka's Sanath Jayasuriya holds the record for the most centuries (six), followed by their compatriot Kumar Sangakkara, (four)and Virat Kohli (India),(four). Shoaib Malik (Pakistan) follows these three with three centuries .
Sangakkara's three centuries in the 2008 tournament is a record for a single edition.
Pakistan's Shahid Afridi made two centuries in the 2010 edition while playing as a captain, the most in the tournament history. Their second century, which came against Bangladesh when they made 124 at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium, is the fastest in terms of balls faced in Asia cup matches.
Kohli's 183 against Pakistan in 2012 is the highest individual score as of 2014.
The 2016 Asia Cup and 2022 Asia Cup are the only tournament played in the Twenty20 format. Hong Kong's Babar Hayat is first centurion of the Twenty20 format; they made 122 (off 60 balls) against Oman.

Frays River is a semi-canalised short river in England that branches off the River Colne at Uxbridge Moor and rejoins it at West Drayton. It is believed to be a mainly human-made anabranch north of the confluence with the River Pinn to feed watermills in the Parish of Hillingdon. The river is believed to be named after John Fray who owned Cowley Hall in the fifteenth century. Other names for the river are the Uxbridge and Cowley Mill Stream, the Cowley Stream or the Colham Mill Stream. Two of the three mills in Hillingdon Parish recorded in the Domesday book are believed to have been located on the southern section of the river.
Course
The Frays River leaves the River Colne east of Denham, Buckinghamshire at Denham Weir. It passes through Frays Farm Meadows, Uxbridge, Cowley, Yiewsley and West Drayton. At Cowley the Grand Union Canal mainline is carried over the river in an aqueduct at Cowley lock. The Frays continue south, flowing past Little Britain Lake on its western side before crossing under the Slough Arm of the Grand Union Canal which is also carried above it in an aqueduct. In Yiewsley it is joined on its east bank by the River Pinn. It then re-joins the River Colne at Drayton Point in West Drayton.
Ecology
The river flows through two Sites of Special Scientific Interest managed by the London Wildlife Trust: Frays Farm Meadows and Denham Lock Wood. Frays Island between the Frays and the River Colne in West Drayton is a Site of Metropolitan Importance for Nature Conservation and is also managed by the trust.
Literary connections
George Orwell once taught at Frays College, Uxbridge, which was on the banks of the river.

View Point () is 150m long eastern tip of a promontory, on Antarctica, forming the west side of the entrance to Duse Bay on the south coast of Trinity Peninsula, on the northern portion of the Antarctic Peninsula. Situated 6.79 km east of Skomlya Hill and 6.45 km southeast of Boil Point. Discovered by a party under J. Gunnar Andersson of the Swedish Antarctic Expedition, 1901-04. So named by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS) following their survey of the area in 1945 because from this promontory, good panoramic photographs were obtained.
Research Stations
Station V
View Point was the location of the British research Station V. It was active intermittently from June 3, 1953, to November 25, 1963, with the intention of searching in the survey, meteorology and geology. The construction of the first hut started on June 3, 1953, the second was established on March 20, 1956. On July 29, 1996, the Station V was transferred to Chile who renamed it General Ramon Cans Montalva.
Jorge Boonen Rivera Refuge
Refuge Jorge Boonen Rivera () is a small Chilean Antarctic refuge administered by the Chilean Army, located in Duse Bay, Trinity Peninsula, Antarctic Peninsula.
Initially it was the British "Station V", erected as a satellite base of the Station D located in Hope Bay; Station D was then assigned to Uruguay in 1997 and renamed Ruperto Elichiribehety.
As part of a plan to remove or transfer abandoned facilities, in cooperation with the Antarctic Treaty System, on July 29, 1996, Station V was transferred to Chile, which renamed it General Ramón Cañas Montalva who later became Jorge Boonen Rivera.
The refuge consists of a hut enabled as a room and a second machine house, bathroom and storage. It is located about away from the Chilean O'Higgins Base, on which it depends.
Currently the installation is regularly maintained by Chile, for use as an emergency shelter, allowing 8 people to survive in it for 20 days in the event of an accident. For this purpose, the station has an electric generator, as well as fuel, food, water and gas.
In September 2005 three soldiers of the Chilean Army died in the vicinity of the Refuge, when their snowmobile fell into a crevasse.
Cristo Redentor Refuge
Refuge Cristo Redentor is an Antarctic refuge located at the western access to Duse Bay in the Trinity Peninsula, from Esperanza Base. It is administered by the Argentine Army and was inaugurated on May 25, 1955. The Refuge, is one of the 18 shelters that are under the responsibility of Esperanza, which is responsible for the maintenance and the care. It has capacity for 12 people, food for two months, fuel, gas and first aid kit.
It has been used in some Argentine scientific campaigns and ordinary patrolling. The main scientific observations are the geology and topography of the area, the sea ice and survey on the Crabeater seal
and the Weddell seal.
Between September 1956 and January 1957, the assistant Sergeant Domingo Avila and Sergeant Telmo Buonomo, officiating as commissioners in the refuge area, were isolated by an early melting of the sea in the Duse Bay. They survived four months until were rescued by an ARA General San Martìn icebreaker helicopter.

Gillet is a Belgian automobile manufacturer, started in 1992 by former racing driver Tony Gillet. The company produces the Vertigo sports coupé, an ultra-lightweight (990 kg) 'bespoke' and hand-built sportscar. The slogan of the company is "Supercar and work of art Pure Pleasure!". The first Vertigo was powered by a Ford Cosworth 2.0-litre 4-in-line, later evolutions are powered by more powerful engines: the 3.0-litre Alfa Romeo V6 engine and the 4.2-litre Ferrari/Maserati V8 in the Vertigo .5.
Company background and design of the Vertigo
Tony Gillet was a successful racing driver, winning the Belgian hill-climb championship in 1979 and 1980 and competing in two Dakar Rallies. In 1982 they became the Belgian importer for Donkervoort, a Dutch Lotus Super Seven-styled car. In January 1990 they broke the 0 to record for production cars with a time of 3.85 seconds in a specially modified Donkervoort. The Vertigo held the 0–100 km/h record for production cars at 3.1 seconds, but this has since been broken.
The first Vertigo prototype was finished in 1991 and shown at the 71st Brussels Auto Show in January 1992. In the following two years the car was finalised for production. It was shown at the Paris and Geneva car shows in 1993. Two more cars were built: a second prototype to finalise production design and the first production car, which was used for certification, including the frontal crash-test, seat anchorage resistance and safety belts anchorage resistance tests.
The production Vertigo differed from the first prototype in materials and design. The chassis was fabricated from carbon fibre and honeycomb materials (a technology directly borrowed from Formula One), ensuring greater strength and stiffness, while saving in chassis weight. The body was given more fluid lines with higher side windows and retractable headlights, making it closer to the first design drawings.
A Vertigo was sold to Philippe Streiff, a former Formula One racing driver who is handicapped after an accident during pre-season testing in 1989. This Vertigo was modified to be joystick-controlled and given an automatic transmission.
Gillet introduced the Vertigo .5 at Brussels in January 2008. It incorporates features from the Vertigo race car used in the 2007 FIA GT race series.
Famous Vertigo-owners are Prince Albert of Monaco and the French singer and actor Johnny Hallyday.
In 2015, Zagato released a car based on the chassis of the Vertigo .5 at the Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este: the Zagato Maserati Mostro. In 2017, Albert II, Prince of Monaco visited the factory in order to show their support for Gillet. During the same year, Gillet had the opportunity to collaborate with the company Transnubel by producing 3,750,000 cubes in composite intended to the Belgian nuclear industry.
In 2019, Gillet constructed a rolling chassis of Zagato Maserati Mostro, which is the first in a series of five.
Racing
Gillet is also active in motorsport with the racing version of the Gillet, named The Gillet Vertigo Streiff. Since 1998, the car has competed in the Belcar (Belgian GT Championship) and FIA GT Championship in the G2 Class for non-homologated cars.
The Vertigo Streiff was originally developed with a modified version of the Alfa Romeo V6 engine, with 3.6 L and . Gillet increased the displacement to in 2006. A GT3 version, with a national homologation, raced briefly in the 2007 Belcar season.
In the 2008 FIA GT season Renaud Kuppens raced using a Gillet Vertigo.5 with a Maserati 4,2l V8 engine tuned to Group N specification. Renaud Kuppens said that the Maserati engine develops the same amount of power as the V6 engine, but has more torque.
The car came 26th in both the 2002 and 2003 Spa 24 Hours, and 13th in 2004. It was entered into the 24 Hours of Spa race in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008, but failed to finish on all occasions.
In 2018, construction of a racing Vertigo with linen bodywork and participation to the famous Pike's Peak race in Colorado with Vanina Ickx at the wheel.

Migdal Afek (), also Migdal Tsedek (), is a national park on the southeastern edge of Rosh HaAyin, Israel.
History
Located in Migdal Afek are the ruins of Mirabel, a Crusader castle, built on the site of ancient Migdal Afek. It was described in Muslim sources in 1225 as a village with a fortress called Majdal Yaba. In the 17th century, the village was taken over by the Rayyān family who arrived from Transjordan and built a two-story manor house. The ruins of the manor house, among which remains of the Crusader castle can be seen, are today called Migdal Afek or Migdal Tsedek.
The village was depopulated by the IDF in July 1948.
Migdal Tsedek means "Tower of Sadek" in Hebrew, referring to the name of its Sheikh Sadek Al Rayyan.
A lintel over an entrance that was used by the local sheikh as a stable and fodder storage room bears the Greek inscription "Martyr Memorial Church of the Holy Herald."
During World War I, Migdal Afek was the site of battles between the Central Powers (forces of the Ottoman, German and Austro-Hungarian empires) and the Egyptian Expeditionary Force.

Sir George Power, 7th Baronet (24 December 1846 – 17 October 1928) was an operatic tenor known for their performances in early Gilbert and Sullivan operas with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, most famously creating the roles in London of Ralph Rackstraw in H.M.S. Pinafore (1878) and Frederic in The Pirates of Penzance (1880).
They later became a noted voice teacher and continued to perform, mostly at society events. On the death of their elder brother, in 1903, they became the seventh baronet of Kilfane.
Early years
Power was born in Kilkenny, the fourth son of Sir John Power of Kilfane, and their wife, Frances Elizabeth, née Wade, from Clonabrany, County Meath. They were educated at Cheltenham College and Trinity College, Dublin, and studied voice in Milan and Florence from 1873 to 1876, with Achille Graffigna and Francesco Lamperti, among others.
In 1876, Power first appeared on stage at the Teatro Manoel in Valletta, Malta, singing Count Almaviva in The Barber of Seville. They made their London stage debut in December 1877 at Them Majesty's Theatre playing the tenor role in Thomas Haynes Bayly's English version of Adolphe Adam's opera The Swiss Cottage. This proved to be Power's only appearance in serious opera.
Power joined Richard D'Oyly Carte's Comedy-Opera Company in February 1878 at the Opera Comique in London, succeeding George Bentham in the leading tenor role of Alexis in Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera The Sorcerer. From March to April 1878 Power also played the Defendant in Trial by Jury when that companion piece was added to the bill at the Opera Comique. They created the role of Ralph Rackstraw in the next Gilbert and Sullivan opera, H.M.S. Pinafore, "one of the most successful pieces of musical theatre of the Victorian era" playing the character from May 1878 to February 1880. The Daily News wrote that Power "displayed a light tenor voice of very agreeable quality, and acted the part of the sentimental lover well", although The Times found their intonation "a little uncertain".
When The Pirates of Penzance premiered in London, Power originated the role of Frederic in that opera. Power received warm reviews for this role from the London press. The Times said that their "sympathetic tenor voice was heard to great advantage in the sentimental music", and The Standard wrote that they "acts ... just in that simple-minded way that brings out most strongly the absurdity of the character, and they sing exceedingly well." A critic from The New York Times, however, commented: "Temple has been a member of the Gilbert-Sullivan company from the first. Mr George Power has not: and their "thin" style is a material drawback. As an actor, they are weak, as a man they are not interesting, as a tenor they are small. Once or twice they sang sweetly, and they were always in tune. As a concert singer they would probably be very successful in sentimental ballads; as Frederic they are unsatisfactory." The Era agreed with the majority: "a very agreeable light tenor voice and a pleasing style, qualities which have already gained for them no little favour in the previous opera … [he has] good taste vocally and a fair amount of histrionic skill."
During the run of Pirates, Power took part in some Sunday matinée performances of new operettas along with D'Oyly Carte colleague Rutland Barrington, and on one occasion acted in a non-musical play, L'Aventurière, given in the original French by a cast headed by Herbert Beerbohm Tree. Power played Frederic until October 1880, when they left the D'Oyly Carte company.
Later years
Over the following months, Power performed mostly in society concerts. In May 1881, they appeared in the operetta Incognito, by Henri Logé, and in July 1881, Power played Lieut. de Blanc-Mange in a short operetta, Out of Sight, by Frederick Clay and B. C. Stephenson. In August 1881, they created the role of Charles Lorrimore in the Edward Solomon and Henry Pottinger Stephens comic opera Claude Duval, at the Olympic Theatre, opposite Marion Hood, who had been their partner in The Pirates of Penzance. The production ran for only 54 performances, and Power left the production three days before it closed in October.
Power then became a teacher of singing, continuing to make occasional appearances on the stage until they end of the century, mostly in concert and society events, and with Percy North's Operetta Company. In 1885 they played Colonel Sylvester at Hove in a new operetta, When One Door Shuts Another Opens by Harriet Young and Charles Thomas. Their students included the Russian tenor Vladimir Rosing.
When their elder brother Sir Adam Clayton Power (1844–1903) died, Power succeeded to their family's baronetcy as the seventh baronet of Kilfane. Together with Jessie Bond, Leonora Braham and Julia Gwynne, they were one of four artistes of the original D'Oyly Carte Opera Company who attended a reunion at the Savoy Hotel in 1914. The four then posed for a group photograph beside Arthur Sullivan Memorial in the Victoria Embankment Gardens.
On 2 September 1915, by then in their late 60s, Power married Eva Gertrude Boulton (1864–1952), the daughter of family friend Sir Samuel Bagster Boulton and Sophia Louisa Cooper. There were no children, and the Power baronetcy ended on their death in 1928.
Power died in Kensington, London, aged 81, and is buried in the Boulton Family Vault in Brookwood Cemetery.

Te Ohu Whakaari was a Māori theatre cooperative formed by Rangimoana Taylor in the early 1980s that created and performed plays across New Zealand.
About
Rangimoana Taylor was inspired to form Te Ohu Whakaari by their experiences in an Auckland-based theatre company called Statement Theatre alongside Nathaniel Lees, and provoked into action through an opportunity from artist Darcy Nicholas who was running the Wellington Arts Centre that was funded at the time by the Department of Labour. The Depot Theatre (that became Taki Rua) nurtured a philosophy to foster New Zealand work which also influenced Te Ohu Whakaari.
Te Ohu Whakaari has lasting influence in New Zealand. Their theatrical practice combined western theatre traditions and Māori customs with story telling and movement in a unique style. Much of their work was cooperatively devised and has not been published.
Te Ohu Whakaari had a theatre-in-education programme which toured New Zealand. One of the Te Ohu Whakaari posters from 1986 is held in the collection of Te Papa Tongarewa and promotes a national tour (poster designed by Chris McBride). The poster says: "New Zealand Students Arts Council presents Te Ohu Whakaari, Young Maoris in Performance, National Tour 1986, Aotearoa – Te Waipounamu, With the Assistance of, Post Office Savings Bank QEII, Arts Council".
Members of Te Ohu Whakaari included Maringikura Campbell, Himiona Grace, Michael Grace, Apirana Taylor, Riwia Brown, Donna McLeod and Briar Grace-Smith.
Briar Grace-Smith joined To Ohu Whakaari when they were seventeen and says this about Te Ohu Whakaari: "We did explore a lot of issues that were affecting us as young people and we were able to see a result of that when we presented these stories to, in particular, a Māori audience because at that point they had never seen anything like it so their reactions were strong."

The Alexander Brownlie House, also known as the Sod House, is a historical structure located in Long Grove, Iowa, United States. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1976.
History
The significance of the Brownlie House is found in its development as rural architecture from the pioneer era to the early 20th century. Alexander Brownlie and their brother James settled this part of Scott County in the late 1830s. The first section of the house was completed by Alexander Brownlie in 1839 on a foundation of coursed limestone. The structure was composed of bricks made of molded clay and grass. Lathe was then attached to the bricks by using square nails and it was covered with plaster. The exterior was covered with clapboard.
An addition was built onto the east side in 1846. It was a 2½-story frame structure with brick nogging. The original chimney was removed and replaced with a connecting doorway between the original house and the addition. The main entrance into the house was moved to the right, yet it remains on the original structure. A third addition was added after 1893 on the north side, which gave the structure an "L" shaped floor plan. It too was of frame construction. In subsequent years the second floor and the third addition have been removed.

Holy Trinity Church () is a Romanian Orthodox church located at 2 Canta Street in Iași, Romania. It is dedicated to the Holy Trinity.
The church was built between 1844 and 1853, and was blessed in 1853. A certain Iancu Sevastopou had the initiative of building the church, and the land was granted upon their request by the archimandrite of Trei Ierarhi Monastery in 1844. Construction lasted nine years because it was funded solely out of contributions from the laity. The church was painted in a neo-Byzantine style in 1958. Repairs were carried out beginning in 2003.
The church is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs.

David Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet is a 2020 British documentary film narrated by David Attenborough and produced and directed by Jonnie Hughes. The film acts as a "witness statement", through which Attenborough shares first-hand their concern for the current state of the planet due to humanity's impact on nature and their hopes for the future. It was released on Netflix on 4 October 2020, along with a companion book A Life on Our Planet.
Synopsis
From Pripyat, a deserted area after the nuclear disaster, Attenborough gives an overview of their life. Interspersed with footage of their career and of a wide variety of ecosystems, they narrate key moments in their career and indicators of how the planet has changed since they were born in 1926. As a child, Attenborough enjoyed studying fossils. Their documentary career began in the 1950s when they began working for the BBC, a British public service broadcaster. They visited places such as the African Serengeti, in which native animals require vast areas of land to maintain grazing patterns. Over time, they noticed a decline in wildlife when searching for fish or orangutans in Borneo or other animals which they were looking for as part of their documentaries. Areas of the Arctic or Antarctic were different to what the filming crew expected due to ice caps melting. The causes are anthropogenic climate change and biodiversity loss pushing the planet towards a sixth mass extinction event over a period of centuries rather than the hundreds of millennia that built up to previous mass extinctions.
Attenborough describes the film as their "witness statement" and gives an impression of what could happen to the planet over the course of a lifetime beginning in 2020 and lasting as long as their own, were human activity to continue unchanged. The Amazon rainforest could degrade into a savanna; the Arctic could lose all ice during summer; coral reefs could die; soil overuse could cause food crises. These irreversible events would cause mass extinction and exacerbate climate change further.
However, Attenborough describes actions which could prevent these effects and combat climate change and biodiversity loss. They assert that the solution has been "staring us in the face all along. To restore stability to our planet, we must restore its biodiversity. The very thing that we've removed." They propose re-wilding; moreover, they say that bringing countries out of poverty, providing universal healthcare and improving girls' education would make the growing human population stabilise sooner and at a lower level. Renewable energy such as solar, wind, water and geothermal could sustainably power all human energy usage. Protecting a third of coastal areas from fishing could allow fish populations to thrive and the remaining area would be sufficient for human consumption. Humans changing their diet to eliminate or reduce meat in favour of plant-based foods could allow land to be used far more efficiently. Attenborough cites government intervention in Costa Rica causing deforestation to reverse, Palau's fishing regulations and improved use of land in the Netherlands as good examples.
Production
Initially scheduled for cinematic release on 16 April 2020, the film was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film premiered on 28 September 2020 in cinemas and debuted on the online streaming platform Netflix on 4 October. The day prior, a promotional video was released showing Attenborough answer questions from celebrities.
A companion book, A Life on Our Planet: My Witness Statement and a Vision for the Future, was released in October 2020.
Reception
The film received positive critical reception. Patrick Cremona of Radio Times gave it five out of five stars, finding it "quite unlike" Attenborough's previous works and lauding its "blending" of a "terrifying condemnation" of humans' treatment of the natural world, and a "hopeful and inspirational manifesto" of how to address the climate crisis. Rating it four out of five stars, Ed Potton of The Times approved of the depiction of animals and Attenborough's "intimacy" and "authority" in their narration, but suggested that more of Attenborough's personal life could have been shown. Emma Clarke of the Evening Standard called the film "an essential watch". Natalia Winkelman of The New York Times praised the "astonishing nature photography" and juxtaposition between thriving and dying ecosystems.
Accolades
In 2021, the film was nominated for five Emmy Awards.

The Pittsburgh Piranhas was a semi-pro basketball team that began in 1994 as part of the Continental Basketball Association. The team played its home games at the A.J. Palumbo Center at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh. From 1983–1985 the Piranhas were known as the Louisville Catbirds and then the La Crosse Catbirds from 1985 until moving to Pittsburgh in 1994. During their first year in Pittsburgh, the Piranhas made it to the CBA Championship. The team was defeated in the best of seven series against the Yakima Sun Kings.
The team lasted one season. According to Bob Murphy, the owner of the Piranhas, the reason for the collapse of the franchise was attendance, an average of 1,600. For the team to be profitable, it needed an average of 3,000.

Gottfried Vopelius (28 January 1645 – 3 February 1715), was a German Lutheran academic and hymn-writer, mainly active in Leipzig. They were born in Herwigsdorf, now a district of Rosenbach, Oberlausitz, and died in Leipzig at the age of 70.
Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch
Vopelius is primarily remembered for the Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch (New Leipzig Hymnal) which they published in 1682. The subtitle of the publication reads:
Or, translated:
The Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch is, to a certain degree, a third edition of Johann Schein's , which originally had been published in 1627, with a new edition in 1645. Over 90 settings in the Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch were copied or adapted from Schein. All other composers are represented with less than 10 settings in the hymnal. Of these, only Johann Crüger and Andreas Hammerschmidt are mentioned for more than three settings.
Reception
The Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch was one of the last important hymnals in the Kantional format (i.e. printed with music, including part-songs): congregational singing was generally becoming monodic, with an instrumental accompaniment, for which hymnals with only texts became the new standard.
In their Leipzig time (1723–1750), Johann Sebastian Bach used the Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch as a reference work for many of their sacred compositions. For the closing chorales of their cantatas BWV 27 and BWV 43 they used the harmonisation as found in the hymnal. For other chorale settings, such as BWV 281, they stayed close to the harmonisation published by Vopelius.
Later editions of the Leipziger Gesangbuch
In 1693 Vopelius published the Leipziger Gesangbuch, which they describe as a republication of the Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch, however without the chorale settings, but with more hymns, and enriched with engravings. The next edition appeared in 1707. Later editions of the Leipziger Gesangbuch, in 1729, 1733 and 1752, further enlarged the number of hymns, to 852, 856 and 1015 respectively, and referred to Vopelius as the former editor of the hymnal. The 1758 and 1767 editions kept the number of hymns at 1015, keeping also the referral to Vopelius as former editor on the title page.

The treaty of Vienna, concluded on 1 December 1656, was an Austro–Polish alliance during the Second Northern War. Habsburg emperor Ferdinand III agreed to enter the war on the anti-Swedish side and support the Polish king John II Casimir with 4,000 troops. The treaty was, however, dissatisfying for John II Casimir, who had hoped for more substantial aid, and further ineffective as Ferdinand III died three days after giving their signature. A similar, but more effective alliance was concluded by Ferdinand III's successor Leopold I in the Treaty of Vienna (1657).

William Gregson (1790–1863) was a British barrister and parliamentary draftsman. They assisted in drafting a variety of laws in the 1820s and 1830s, including the 1832 Great Reform Act, and was private secretary to Robert Peel. They served as under-secretary of state for the Home Department for three months in 1835.
Life
Born in Liverpool in 1790, Gregson studied classics at Brasenose College, Oxford, graduating with a first-class degree in 1810. Their examiners on that occasion called their work the best they had ever seen. They were called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1815. From early in their career they acted as private secretary to the Tory, later Conservative, politician Robert Peel.
They were employed as counsel by successive home secretaries from 1826 to 1833, including under Whig governments, and assisted in the drafting of Peel's law reforms and the 1832 Great Reform Act. They served as under-secretary of state for the Home Department from 3 January to 18 April 1835 during the first Peel ministry; along with Denis Le Marchant in 1847–48, they are one of only two non-parliamentarians to have occupied that position since 1801.
Gregson was an advocate of prison reform, often visiting prisons in person, and an early promoter of the ragged schools. They co-founded Marlborough College and was a supporter of the Liverpool Collegiate Institution. Over the course of their career they gathered a collection of autographs of official figures, which was curated by their sister and included one document that they particularly prized, issued by the Supreme Council of Bengal and bearing the signatures of Governor Warren Hastings and Philip Francis. After retiring in around 1853, they returned to Liverpool, and died in February 1863.

Daniel Jay Gokey (born April 24, 1980) is an American singer and former church music director from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They were the third-place finalist on the eighth season of American Idol. After their placing on the show, Gokey signed to 19 Recordings and RCA Nashville at the beginning of a career in country music, releasing the single "My Best Days Are Ahead of Me.” Their debut album, My Best Days, was released in March 2010.
After leaving RCA Nashville in November 2011, they gravitated their music towards an adult pop/contemporary Christian sound and subsequently made a record/publishing deal with BMG in May 2013. Their second full-length album, Hope in Front of Me, was released in June 2014.
Early life
Gokey started singing with their family in church, but stated they would rather record mainstream music than perform solely Christian/gospel music. They were the worship director at their church in Milwaukee, Faith Builders International Ministries, for several years.
 They are the fifth of six children. They have a brother named Charles, and four sisters: Angela, Janell, Gina, and Tracey.
They have acknowledged the influence of Jeffrey and Robin Pruitt, who are the pastors of the church where they worked, and also Matthew Barnett, the founder of the LA Dream Center. They have stated that their faith is the "key to who I am". Gokey was a church music director, while also driving a semi truck (18 wheeler) for a local logistics company for two years.
American Idol
Overview
Gokey rose to national fame with their participation in the eighth season of American Idol. Gokey's American Idol audition occurred only four weeks after their wife's death in July 2008.
During Rock Week (Top 4 week), Gokey's take on Aerosmith's "Dream On" was planned for the extended scream with which they finished the song. Gokey was the only contestant in that season who was never in the bottom two or three, but they were eliminated in third place on May 13, 2009, after their performance of Joe Cocker's "You Are So Beautiful."
During the season 8 finale on May 20, 2009, Gokey performed a duet with R&B superstar Lionel Richie. The performance opened with Gokey singing a true-to-the-original soulful ballad solo of Richie's "Hello," and then Richie joined Gokey for a duet of their hits "Just Go" and "All Night Long".
Performances/results
Due to the judges using their one save to save Matt Giraud, the Top 7 remained intact for another week.

Personal life
Gokey is a Christian. They married their high school sweetheart, Sophia Martinez, on May 15, 2004. The two had been together since 1997.
On July 9, 2008, four weeks before they auditioned for American Idol, Gokey's wife died from complications during their third surgery to treat their congenital heart disease. The couple had been together for 12 years, and Gokey credited them for their success. Sophia was a fan of American Idol and encouraged Gokey to be a contestant, and Danny started a foundation in their name, Sophia's Heart Foundation, with some of their family members who are also musicians. With branches in Milwaukee, Nashville and Sacramento, the organization's goals are to provide hope and help to homeless families, provide scholarships to deserving students and operate a thriving inner-city music and arts program.
In 2011, Gokey began dating Leyicet Peralta. The two announced their engagement on December 25, 2011, on the Sophia's Heart website. They were married on January 29, 2012. Their son Daniel Emanuel was born on January 20, 2013. Their daughter Victoria Isabella was born on November 28, 2014. Their son Gabriel Daniel was born on August 29, 2017. On August 16, 2019, their fourth child, Emmanuel, was born on the birthday of Danny's first wife.
Politics
Gokey was raised in a Republican household and has publicly supported Republican politicians since 2012. They supported Donald Trump during their first impeachment trial and in the 2020 presidential election. In January 2022, Gokey appeared at the event announcing Doug Mastriano's entry into the Pennsylvania gubernatorial race.
Gokey, who is vaccinated against COVID-19, has stated that they believe the vaccine may be part of a prophecy in the Book of Revelation that "emphasizes how the whole world will be deceived by Pharmakeia." They also believe that vaccine mandates could lead to the Mark of the Beast, an end-times belief about the Antichrist espoused by many evangelical Christians.

Elizabeth River Crossings (ERC), officially known as Elizabeth River Crossings OpCo, LLC, is a limited liability company whose sole purpose is to finance, deliver, operate and maintain the Elizabeth River Tunnels Project in the South Hampton Roads region of Virginia. The project comprised the development, design, construction, finance and operation of a new two-lane tunnel adjacent to the existing Midtown Tunnel under the Elizabeth River, maintenance and safety improvements to the existing Midtown and Downtown tunnels, extending the Martin Luther King Freeway from London Boulevard to Interstate 264, and interchange modifications at Brambleton Avenue and Hampton Boulevard.
The project is located between the cities of Portsmouth and Norfolk in Hampton Roads. Under a comprehensive agreement, the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) will maintain ownership of the infrastructure and oversee ERC‘s activities. ERC financed and built the facilities, and will operate and maintain them for a 58-year concession period.
Company background
In 2012, Elizabeth River Crossings OpCo was established by Skanska and the Macquarie Group to provide a proposal to the Commonwealth of Virginia's solicitation for bids to upgrade and build out the tunnels that cross the Elizabeth River. Skanska provided the company with construction and development expertise, while Macquarie Group provided private equity and funding for the project. Additional companies that were interested in the project included Kiewit Construction, Weeks Marine, and Skanska's US engineering division, Skanska USA Civil Southeast, all of which were participants in the actual construction and rehabilitation of the tunnels.
Shortly after their proposal was accepted by the VDOT, the original Elizabeth River Crossings, LLC, was divided into two distinct companies: Elizabeth River Crossings HoldCo, which is the 50/50 venture that leverages the capital investments and equity between Skanska and Macquarie, and Elizabeth River Crossings OpCo, which is the operating and management company for the venture, and the company that holds the rights of the Comprehensive Agreement executed by the state.
In November 2020, Elizabeth River Crossings was sold by Skanska and the Macquarie Group to Abertis and John Hancock Financial.
Elizabeth River Tunnels Project
The Elizabeth River Tunnels Project is a series of transportation-related projects that included the rehabilitation of the Downtown and existing Midtown tunnels, the construction of the new parallel Midtown Tunnel, and the extension of the MLK Freeway/U.S. 58 to I-264. The project was administered by Elizabeth River Crossings (ERC) along with VDOT as part of a 58-year public-private partnership (P3) concession that cost approximately $2.1 billion to complete. The projects are designed to significantly reduce or eliminate congestion along the surface streets and other arterial roads of in the immediate area.
After the review process, which was required under the Public-Private Transportation Act (PPTA), then-Governor Bob McDonnell and VDOT executed the Comprehensive Agreement with ERC on December 5, 2011. Under the agreement, VDOT retains ownership and oversight of the tunnels, while ERC finances, builds, operates and maintains the facilities for a 58-year concession period. Funding is collected from tolls, private equity, contributions from the Commonwealth and a low-interest Federal Highway Administration loan. ERC is responsible for paying back all debt on the project, as well as assuming the entire risk of a decrease in toll revenue if traffic counts do not meet projections. However, if traffic exceeds projections and increases revenue, VDOT will receive a portion of the excess revenue, after all other costs and debt service has been paid for the period.
The deal reached financial close on April 13, 2012. The cost of the project, at financial close was $2.1 billion. ERC received $300 million from VDOT, $663.75 million from the Virginia Small Business Financing Authority and $422 million from the U.S. Department of Transportation, all of which went to pay down the toll rate. The 58-year concession period will end on April 13, 2070.
Controversies
Westbound weekend tunnel closures
As part of the rehabilitation work on the westbound Downtown Tunnel (Norfolk to Portsmouth), full weekend closures were needed of the tunnel for approximately 25 consecutive weekends. These tunnel closures would begin at 8pm on Friday and finish at 5am on the following Monday morning. Traffic would be primarily detoured to the High Rise Bridge utilizing I-464. ERC stated that most of the work either required overhead work (such as installing the fireproofing on the ceiling), or work that would cross the centerline, such that a one-lane closure was not feasible. After allowing closures to occur for several weekends, Portsmouth City Council asked VDOT and ERC to take a look at the plan and explore the idea of turning the eastbound tunnel into a two-way tunnel during the weekend closure. VDOT and ERC had ruled out bi-directional traffic in the eastbound tunnel prior to instituting the weekend closure as too dangerous, stating "that maintaining two lanes of eastbound traffic in the eastbound Downtown Tunnel while directing westbound traffic towards one of the four alternative routes (with the I-64 High Rise Bridge as the primary detour) is the best course of action, both for the Project and the traveling public." However, as public outcry from Portsmouth residents continued, ERC eventually halted full weekend closures, instead converting to full nightly closures beginning at 8pm each night, and running until 5am the next morning. Eastbound tunnel closures, which began in July 2014, were not impacted.
Toll processing delays
In early 2014, ERC experienced toll processing delays as the result of "software changes and upgrades". This backlog led to the processing of toll charges well after they were incurred, with some reports of charges being processed and billed up to six months later, per some reports. Gov. McAuliffe said in a press conference a few months after the issues were discovered that they understand many users of the Downtown and Midtown tunnel feel the billing issues with ERC are "outrageous" and told ERC to "Get your act together and fix it. You're being paid, do your job right." A September report in The Virginian-Pilot revealed that the problem was still ongoing, and that in July, ERC officials asked VDOT to waive the 60-day processing limit it had imposed on collecting tolls via the E-ZPass system. David Caudill, the VDOT Tolling Administrator, denied the request, and stated in a letter to ERC CEO Greg Woodsmall that they were "greatly concerned with ERC's continued problems with properly managing toll transactions" and that it "reflects poorly on [ERC] and fosters continuing mistrust of the reliability of [their] operations," referring to a backlog of some nearly 350,000 transactions which stemmed from their earlier system glitches, problems which included sensors mistakenly reading cars as having a third axle (triggering a higher toll) and delays in posting tolls to E-ZPass accounts.
After hearing about the issues, Virginia Transportation Secretary Aubrey Lane lambasted ERC for the delays and the plans and attempts to continue collecting the tolls, stating, "This has been going on for eight months, and I'm not convinced they got it fixed yet." In a September 19 letter to ERC, Skanska, and Macquarie officers, they demanded that the company formulate a "formal plan to address the deficiencies" in processing the transactions by October 1, or lose the support of VDOT in enforcing any non-EZ Pass related toll collection. ERC OpCo CEO Woodsmall and ERC HoldCo Chairman Karl Kuchel responded back to the Secretary in a joint letter stating:
The first invoice for transactions will be sent out within 60 days of the transaction beginning October 1, 2014,
Any transaction older than 60 days as of that date would be waived, and that
Any transaction that was greater than 60 days would be not be pursued.
Toll processing improvements
In September 2014, ERC released a Toll System Improvement Plan that listed several other steps to mitigate the issues, including utilizing a 10 day/10 trip/$20 rule to trigger invoices for non-EZPass customers. An invoice for a Pay by Plate customer would not be generated until 10 days have elapsed, 10 trips have been made or $20 in tolls have been incurred since the first toll on the invoice period. E-ZPass transactions were not affected—they continued to be added and processed nightly by the software. By years end, ERC cleared up all issues and backlogs, and issued $500,000 in refunds to customers who paid for tolls that were in excess of 60 days.
In June 2017, ERC announced changes to the way tunnel users will receive toll bills, and a major restructuring and reduction of late fees for unpaid tolls, effective immediately. A 30-day billing cycle was implemented, ending the cycle of sending multiple, sometimes confusing invoices every month to customers. Users of the tunnels would now get a single monthly statement that includes all trips in a 30-day period and more closely resembles how customers receive statements for other routine bills like credit cards, cable service and utilities. In addition, late fees were dramatically reduced. Now, for unpaid tolls over 30 days old, a $25 late fee is added to each unpaid statement. The significant change was that the lower late fee only applies to the statement, and not to individual transactions on the statement.
In September 2017, on a continued path to improve customer experience, ERC issued a new billing statement for Pay by Plate customers. Improvements of the new statement include:
An image of the customer's license plate, the amount due, the date the statement was issued, and the date payment is due at the top of the new statement.
A detailed summary for the current billing period—including the date, time and location of each tolling transaction—and all other account activity including payments and past-due amounts.
Amount that Pay by Plate customers could save by switching to E-ZPass. Currently, during peak hours, unregistered Pay by Plate customers pay $5.25 per trip, and E-ZPass customers pay $1.95 per trip; a savings of $3.30.

Frank J. Weber (August 7, 1849 – February 4, 1943) was a seaman, carpenter and union organizer from Milwaukee who between 1907 and 1926 served five (non-continuous) terms as a Socialist member of the Wisconsin State Assembly.
Background
Weber was born in the city of Milwaukee on August 7, 1849. In 1852 their family moved to Grafton in Ozaukee County, and they attended public school in Ulao. After completing apprenticeship, Weber became an able seaman and sailed on Great Lakes and Atlantic Ocean merchant ships (according to their 1906 official biography, "in which capacity they visited all the most important seaports of the world").
Labor movement
They joined the Lake Seamen's Union in 1868, and was active in the Knights of Labor after 1869. In 1887 they helped organize the Milwaukee Federated Trades Council, becoming its secretary in 1902: an office they would hold until their retirement in January 1934. In 1888 Weber organized ship cargo handlers into what became the International Longshoremen's Association, and in the same year organized a Carpenters' Union in Milwaukee. In 1893 Weber was chosen the first president of the Wisconsin State Federation of Labor. As of 1894 they refused the title of President, preferring to be General Organizer; they were to hold that office until 1917. Weber fought to align the State Federation of Labor with the goals and principles of the Social Democratic Party (as it was long known in Wisconsin).
As of 1906 they boasted that they had been a member of a labor organization for 40 years, and was also one of the General Organizers of the American Federation of Labor.
Political office and service
In 1904 Weber was a Socialist candidate for Presidential elector from Milwaukee.
In 1906 they were elected to the Assembly from the 16th Milwaukee County district (the 20th ward of the City of Milwaukee), succeeding fellow Socialist August W. Strehlow. Weber won with 1,580 votes to 1,080 for Republican Edward Groeling. In 1908 they were re-elected, with 1,799 votes against to 1,380 for Republican Louis Goulki and 825 for Democrat Charles Newser. Weber was assigned to the standing committee on Manufactures and Labor.
In the Assembly Weber worked for the passage of laws establishing the Wisconsin Industrial Commission (with Charles H. Crownhart and John R. Commons they wrote the industrial commission law in 1911), workmen's compensation, the state system of technical education, and other statutes favorable to the interests of the working class.
In 1926 (at which time they were State Chairman of the Socialist Party of Wisconsin), rather than run for re-election to the Assembly, they opted to challenge incumbent State Senator Bernhard Gettelman. They lost the election to Gettelman, with 8,074 votes to 10,589 for the incumbent.
After the Assembly
As they had always done when not in the legislature himself, they continued to spend time during the session at Madison lobbying for labor. Weber died in Milwaukee on February 4, 1943, known as "the grand old man of Wisconsin labor."

Fritz Möller (16 May 1906, in Rudolstadt – 21 March 1983, in Munich) was a German meteorologist, geophysicist and high school teacher. They were a pioneer in radiation research and satellite meteorology.
Life
Möller's eponymous father was the director of the hospital in Rudolstadt. Möller received a degree in Geophysics and Meteorology at the University of Göttingen in 1924 and joined the Corps Thuringia Jena that same year. In 1925 they attended the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, receiving their doctorate in 1928. From 1934, they worked as a meteorologist at the Frankfurt airport, and then in the new Reich Office Weather Service from 1935 to 1938. After 1938 they taught at the University of Frankfurt and the University of Leipzig.
Mainz and Munich
The new University of Mainz appointed Möller a professor in 1948. This institute was instrumental in international radiation research. Until retirement in 1972, they headed the Meteorological Institute and the Institute of Meteorology and Climatology in Munich. In 1962, they were appointed Chair for Theoretical Meteorology.
Climate modeling
With the introduction of the computer, meteorologists in the United States began numerical experiments to develop quantitative measurement methods to study circulation and climate of the earth. In 1959 and 1960, Möller came to the United States to work with Syukuro Manabe on the numerical determination of radiative fluxes. Möller's second visit to the United States was the evaluation of measurement data from meteorological satellites. They were the only German belonging to the governing body of the Global Atmospheric Research Program.
In 1963, they published a paper in the Journal of Geophysical Research which purported to disprove Gilbert Plass's influential 1953 article on the warming influence of industrial carbon dioxide. Although their model of carbon dioxide-water vapor feedback had fundamental mathematical flaws, it became widely cited in public reports which questioned the urgency of global warming.

The Shrine Bowl was a postseason college football bowl game. The first game was played on December 18, 1948, at War Memorial Stadium in Little Rock, Arkansas, between Hardin–Simmons University and Ouachita Baptist College. The 1949 edition was held in Carbondale, Illinois, as the Indiana State Sycamores faced the Southern Illinois Salukis.
Game result
A series of games sponsored by the Shriners as a charity event in Honolulu in December 1941 and referred to by some as the Shrine Bowl was interrupted by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Teams from Willamette University and San Jose State travelled to Hawaii to play against each other and the University of Hawaii. The Willamette team lost to the Hawaiians in the opening game on Saturday, December 6, but other games were cancelled due to the onset of the war. The teams were among the first civilians evacuated in a convoy to San Francisco a couple of weeks later.

They Called Them Babylon is an album by British folk rock band Steeleye Span. The title track deals with the Siege of Lathom House in 1644, during the English Civil War, during which Charlotte Stanley, Countess of Derby, held out for four months against Parliamentarian efforts to take the house.
The album, the band's 18th studio album, was released in 2004. The album is perhaps most noteworthy for the return of Maddy Prior, the band's most central member, who had departed the band in 1996. Returning with Prior was their husband, Rick Kemp, who had not performed with the band since its 12th album, although both Prior and Kemp had performed on Present--The Very Best of Steeleye Span, an album that re-recorded versions of songs from earlier albums. Gay Woods, who had replaced Prior for two albums, departed at the same time. New to the band with this album was guitarist Ken Nicol, while drummer Liam Genockey, who had played on Time, returned. Longtime violinist Peter Knight rounded out the group.
Highlights of the album include 'Van Diemen's Land', a song about poaching and deportation to what would eventually be called Tasmania; 'Heir of Linne', a classic ballad of riches lost and regained, and 'Child Owlet', another traditional ballad whose gruesomeness is underlined by Prior's powerful vocals. The album also contains the band's shortest song ever, a 40-second version of 'Bede's Death Song', an early medieval poem attributed to the 8th century monk.
In the original version of 'Van Diemen's Land', the narrator is a man, but Prior reworked the lyrics to make the narrator a woman
The album received very mixed reviews. Some critics saw it as a return to form after several less-satisfying albums, and attributed the band's revival to Prior's return. Others saw the album as representing a continuing decline of the band, attributing it to the aging of the band's core members, and noting that Prior's voice, while still strong and effective on songs like 'Van Dieman's Land' and 'Child Owlet', does not seem to have its top range any more.

The coppery-chested jacamar (Galbula pastazae) is a species of bird in the family Galbulidae. It is found in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.
Taxonomy and systematics
The coppery-chested jacamar is monotypic. It and the rufous-tailed (Galbula ruficauda), white-chinned (G. tombacea), bluish-fronted (G. cyanescens), and green-tailed jacamars (G. glabula) are considered to form a superspecies.
Description
The coppery-chested jacamar is long and weighs approximately . The male's crown is metallic green with a blue gloss. The rest of the upper parts are metallic bronzy green. The throat and breast are shiny green and the belly and vent area are dark rufuous. The female is similar except that the chin and throat are dark rufous.
Distribution and habitat
The coppery-chested jacamar is effectively endemic to Ecuador, though there are records from a single site in each of far southern Colombia and far northern Peru. It is found on the east slope of the Andes between approximately in Ecuador. The Colombia record, at El Carmen, Nariño Department, was at and the Peru record, on the upper Comaina River, Amazonas Department, was at . The coppery-chested jacamar inhabits humid montane forest. It is a bird of the understory, being found along forest edges, along watercourses, and at tree falls and landslides that provide openings.
Behavior
Feeding
The coppery-chested jacamar is insectivorous but few details of its diet or feeding methods are known.
Breeding
One known nest of the coppery-chested jacamar was a burrow in an earth bank. Little else has been documented about its breeding.
Vocalization
The coppery-chested jacamar's song is "a rising series of wee notes, sometimes ending in a descending rattle" . Its call is "a weet note, singly or in a series" .
Status
The IUCN has assessed the coppery-chested jacamar as least concern. It is uncommon and its population is believed to be decreasing in parallel with forest destruction.

Deskur was born in Sancygniów, near Kielce, Poland, the son of Stanisława (Kossecka) and Andrzej Deskur. They received a doctorate in law in 1945 from the Jagiellonian University (study underground). They were the secretary general of the Polish student organization "Bratniak". They entered the seminary in Kraków and was ordained a priest on 20 August 1950. They obtained a doctorate in theology from the University of Freiburg and, after two years of pastoral activity and study in France and Switzerland, in September 1952, they were called to Rome to work in the Secretariat of State. During this period they served as undersecretary of the Pontifical Commission for Cinematography, Radio and Television (1954–1964), secretary of the Preparatory Secretariat for the Press and Entertainment during Vatican II (1960–1962), peritus for the assembly of the council (1962–1965) and was a member of the Conciliar Commissions for Bishops, for the Clergy, for the Laity, and for the Press and Entertainment.
In 1973 they were named president of the Pontifical Commission (now Council) for Social Communications. They were appointed titular bishop of Tene on 17 June 1974 and received episcopal ordination the following 30 June. On 15 February 1980, John Paul II named them Archbishop and president emeritus of the Pontifical Commission.
Deskur was raised to the Cardinalate on 25 May 1985, becoming Cardinal-Deacon of San Cesareo in Palatio, that had belonged to Pope John Paul II themselves until their elevation to the Papacy. After ten years as a Cardinal-Deacon they exercised their right and their titular church was elevated and they became Cardinal-Priest. Cardinal Deskur lost the right to participate in the conclave when they turned 80 years old in 2004.
Deskur contributed to numerous congresses and meetings for professionals of the press, radio, television and cinema, visiting about 70 countries on five continents. Among other endeavours, they were one of the promoters of the radio station "Radio Veritas" for countries in Asia and Oceania.
The challenge of promoting Christianity in the field of social communications did not impede Cardinal Deskur from dedicating themselves also to pastoral activity. During all their years in Rome they performed their priestly and episcopal ministry in numerous parishes. For many years they devoted themselves to the office of spiritual director at the pre-seminary St. Pius V.
They were President of the Pontifical Academy of the Immaculate Conception.

Deskur died on 3 September 2011, aged 87. They were buried at the St. John Paul II Center, Krakow, Poland.

Panthera palaeosinensis was an early Pleistocene species from northern China. It is often incorrectly referenced as the ancestor of the tiger, Panthera tigris, although it shares features with all living large cats. Recent studies place it close to the base of the genus Panthera.
Panthera palaeosinensis was first described in 1924 as Felis paleosinensis by Otto Zdansky in their work "Jungtertiäre Carnivoren Chinas". The dating is not certain, but estimates place it around the Plio-Pleistocene boundary at two to three million years old. Panthera paleosinensis'''s skull has an A-P length of and a mandibular length of and the living creature would have appeared like a jaguar, stout and strong. The conical upper canines were not present in the fossil, but the lower canines bear the vertical grooves typical of Panthera.

The British Basketball Federation, known as British Basketball, is the national sports governing body for basketball in Great Britain. It organises Great Britain teams for men and women in international competition. Northern Irish players normally compete for Ireland, but are also eligible to compete for the GB.
The three home nations associations - Basketball England, basketballscotland and Basketball Wales - still have responsibility for basketball in their own countries, including organising competitions and developing the sport.
History
The British & Irish Basketball Federation (BIBF) was formed in 1960 from funding from the Sports Council. Northern Ireland began to be represented by Basketball Ireland, and in 2004 Ireland left the BIBF.
In October 2004 the BIBF changed its name to Great Britain Basketball.
In December 2006 the British Basketball Federation (BBF) was formed, and GB teams replaced England in the U20 and senior age groups in FIBA competitions. In order for GB teams to compete in the London Olympics in 2012, FIBA had insisted that a single governing body for Great Britain be formed, rather than the existing three separate home nations. England, Scotland and Wales continued to compete separately in youth competitions.
Basketball Wales rejected a full merger in 2012, so the new governing body was initially formed by just England Basketball (now Basketball England) and basketballscotland. Wales eventually agreed to join the new federation in 2015. The merger was formally completed in October 2016, and the home nations gave up their individual memberships of FIBA. Great Britain national teams now compete in all age groups from U16 to senior, with Scotland and Wales still able to field separate teams in some lower division youth competitions.
The federation is based in the offices of UK Sport.

Killer Kane is a fictional character in the Buck Rogers comic strip and its subsequent 1939 Buck Rogers serial film produced by Universal Studios. The character also appeared in the 1979 film and subsequent TV series, in which they were a defector from Earth to the Draconian Empire and sought to assist its malevolent leader Emperor Draco and their daughter Princess Ardala in their plans to conquer Earth.
Comic strip
In the comic strip, Kane was a dark-haired, mustachioed soldier. Kane first appeared in the January 30, 1929 comic strip. They were romantically involved with Wilma Deering; however, after Wilma left them for Buck Rogers, Kane became a criminal and Buck's mortal enemy. Kane carried out numerous criminal schemes and attempted to kill Buck on numerous occasions. Kane was often assisted by their girlfriend, Ardala Valmar.
Movie serial
Kane is a gangster (or "super-racketeer") who became the supreme dictator of Earth with the help of their criminal army. Although the events of the serial transpire in the year 2440, Kane has apparently ruled the world for some time before that. They were portrayed by actor Anthony Warde.
Although Kane is the main villain in the serial, they come face-to-face with their rival Buck Rogers only a few times. They rarely leaf their council chambers, preferring to let their underling Captain Laska carry out their commands. Although they are the unquestioned ruler of the planet, Kane's actions show that deep down, they are still a mere thug; they scream insults at their lieutenants ("You blockheads!" seems to be their favorite) and bullies other subordinates. They even push and shoves their councilors out of their chambers at one point.
In the 20th century, the forces of crime and disorder around the world steadily gained power. Because of the inability of society to control the criminal element, gangsters and racketeers gradually dominated the governments of the world. Some time before the year 2440, a "super-racketeer" known as Kane achieved complete global domination. Their cruel, ruthless rule earned them the nickname "Killer Kane".
Supported by a council of lesser gangsters, and backed by an army of raygun-toting crooks, Kane managed to suppress all resistance, save for a valiant few who made their new home in the so-called "Hidden City". Led by the wise Dr. Huer and their military counterpart, Air Marshal Kragg, these rebels hoped to gain the assistance of the forces of Saturn. However, knowing that the support of the Saturnians could help the Hidden City overthrow him, Kane posted patrols in the atmosphere to prevent any ship from leaving the planet.
The revival of 20th-century pilot Buck Rogers proved to be the beginning of the end for Kane. In short order, Buck evaded Kane's space patrols; outmaneuvered their chief lieutenant, Captain Laska; thwarted the attempted kidnapping of Prince Tallen, ambassador of Saturn; released political dissidents from Kane's Robot Battalion; and finally overthrew and captured Kane and their entire criminal government.
The serial also shows Kane residing in a luxury penthouse suite. Although the people over whom they rules refer to them as "Killer Kane", they prefer to be addressed (and identifies himself) as "The Leader Kane" (or simply "The Leader") and presents themselves to the Saturnians as a benevolent monarch. Although they seem obsessed with finding and destroying the Hidden City, they apparently never considers the possibility that they will mount a serious offensive against him.
As a leader, Kane tolerates no dissent. Through the use of their brainwashing Amnesia Helmets, Kane reduces their human opponents to mere automatons who labor mindlessly in their prison camps. When dealing with their minions, Kane is easily driven to impatience; while listening to a report, they only allows their henchman to state their name and location before exclaiming, "Never mind all that!" When Kane actually has the upper hand over Buck Rogers, gaining complete control over them with an Amnesia Helmet, Kane does not finish off their enemy. Instead, they have Buck kneel down and polish their boots while the dictator gloats over him.
Some reviewers believe that when measured against other serial villains such as Ming the Merciless, Killer Kane pales somewhat in comparison and the script of the 1939 serial gives them little to do other than shout at their henchmen and strut about their council chambers.
1979 TV series
On the 1979 television series Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, Kane is reimagined as a defector from Earth to the Draconian Realm, a powerful empire said to have conquered three quarters of the known universe. Known simply as "Kane" in this version, they are the supreme commander of the Draconian forces under Emperor Draco. While the original Killer Kane was the absolute leader, on the television series, Kane answers to Draco and (grudgingly) their daughter Princess Ardala, who acts as Draco's emissary (although Princess Ardala did not appear in the 1939 serial). In this version, Ardala is a Princess (which they were not in the original comic strips) who also commands Kane (in the comics, it was Ardala who was Kane's subordinate).
In the 1979 pilot film, the role was played by Henry Silva while on the follow-up series, they were played by Michael Ansara. The two portrayals are somewhat different. Silva's Kane was much cooler and more calculating who often took a firm hand with Ardala whom they had designs on, romantically and/or politically. Ansara's Kane was slightly older (Ansara was six years older than Silva), and was more subservient to Ardala, acting more than their henchman rather than their collaborator with no obvious designs on them They were also a more honorable man than Silva's Kane and could keep Ardala in line by letting them face the consequences of their own mistakes (such as when they were ready to allow Tigerman to kill Ardala in response to them ordering them to kill Buck who had saved Tigerman's life). While already having a grudging respect for Buck as a worthy enemy, their respect grew even more after joining forces to fight together against the Zadd Empire.
Personality
Kane is usually depicted as vain, pompous and overconfident. They dresses flamboyantly, usually in black or purple, and maintains a finely trimmed mustache. In most versions of the Buck Rogers story, their villainy is motivated by jealousy of Buck Rogers and a desire for wealth or political power.

The Third Perso-Turkic War was the third and final conflict between the Sassanian Empire and the Western Turkic Khaganate. Unlike the previous two wars, it was not fought in Central Asia, but in Transcaucasia. Hostilities were initiated in 627 AD by Tong Yabghu Qaghan of the Western Göktürks and Emperor Heraclius of the Byzantine Empire. Opposing them were the Sassanid Persians, allied with the Avars. The war was fought against the background of the last Byzantine-Sassanid War and served as a prelude to the dramatic events that changed the balance of powers in the Middle East for centuries to come (Battle of Nineveh, Islamic conquest of Persia).
Background
Following the First Siege of Constantinople by the Avars and Persians, the beleaguered Byzantine Emperor Heraclius found themselves politically isolated. They could not rely on the Christian Armenian potentates of Transcaucasia, since they were branded as heretics by the Orthodox Church, and even the king of Iberia preferred to befriend the religiously tolerant Persians. Against this dismal background, they found a natural ally in Tong Yabghu. Earlier in 568, the Turks under Istämi had turned to Byzantium when their relations with Persia soured over commerce issues. Istämi sent an embassy led by the Sogdian diplomat Maniah directly to Constantinople, which arrived in 568 and offered not only silk as a gift to Justin II, but also proposed an alliance against Sassanid Persia. Justin II agreed and sent an embassy to the Turkic Khaganate, ensuring the direct Chinese silk trade desired by the Sogdians.
In 625, Heraclius dispatched to the steppes their emissary, named Andrew, who promised to the Khagan some "staggering riches" in return for military aid. The khagan, on their part, was anxious to secure the Chinese-Byzantine trade along the Silk Route, which had been disrupted by the Persians in the aftermath of the Second Perso-Turkic War. They sent word to the Emperor that "I shall take revenge on your enemies and will come with my valiant troops to your help". A unit of 1,000 horsemen fought their way through Persian Transcaucasia and delivered the Khagan's message to the Byzantine camp in Anatolia.
Siege of Derbent
Early in 627, the Göktürks and their Khazar allies approached the Caspian Gates at Derbent. This newly built stronghold was the only gate to the fertile land of Aghvania (modern-day Azerbaijan). Lev Gumilev observes that the lightly armed militia of Aghvania was no match against the hordes of heavy cavalry led by Tong Yabghu. Their troops stormed Derbent and swarmed over Aghvania, plundering it thoroughly. The fall and sack of Derbent were described in detail by the Armenian historian Movses Kagankatvatsi, thought to have been an eyewitness to the event:
The fall of the fortress that had been considered impregnable sparked panic all over the country. Aghvanian forces withdrew to their capital, Partav, from whence they made for the Caucasus Mountains. The Göktürks and Khazars overtook them near the village of Kalankatuyk, where they were either slain or taken prisoner. The conquerors imposed upon Aghvania a heavy system of taxation, as reported by Movses:
Siege of Tbilisi
The next objective of the Turkic-Byzantine offensive was the Kingdom of Iberia, whose ruler Stephanus was a tributary to Khosrow II. In the words of Movses Kagankatvatsi, the Khazars "encircled and besieged the famous and great sybaritic trade city of Tbilisi," whereupon they were joined by Emperor Heraclius with their mighty army.
Heraclius and Tong Yabghu (called Ziebel in the Byzantine sources) met under the walls of Narikala. The yabgu rode up to the emperor, kissed their shoulder and made a bow. In return, Heraclius hugged the barbarian ruler, called them their son, and crowned them with their own diadem. During the ensuing feast the Khazar leaders received ample gifts in the shape of earrings and clothes, while the yabghu was promised the hand of the emperor's daughter, Eudoxia Epiphania.
The siege dragged on without much progress, punctuated by frequent sallies on the part of the besieged; one of these claimed the life of their king. After two months the Khazars retreated to the steppe, promising to return by the autumn. Tong Yabghu left young Böri Shad, either their son or nephew, in charge of the remaining forty thousand which were to assist Heraclius during the siege. Before long these departed as well, leaving the Byzantines to continue the siege alone and prompting jeers from the besieged.
When the Georgians ironically referred to the Emperor as "the goat," hinting at their incestuous marriage, Heraclius recalled a passage from the Book of Daniel about the two-horned ram overthrown by the one-horned goat. They interpreted this as a good sign and struck southward against Persia. On 12 December 627 they appeared on the bank of the Tigris and clashed with Persian forces near the ruins of Nineveh. In January they ravaged the environs of the Persian capital Ctesiphon, signaling a sea-change in the Persian-Byzantine relations.
Conclusion
After the triumph of Heraclius, Tong Yabghu hastened to resume the siege of Tiflis and successfully stormed the city in winter. "With their swords raised, they advanced on the walls, and all this multitude, climbing upon each other's shoulders, rose up the walls. A black shadow fell upon the wobegone citizens; they were vanquished and lost their ground," Movses narrates. Although the Georgians surrendered without further resistance, the city was looted and its citizens were massacred. The Persian governor and the Georgian prince were tortured to death in the presence of Tong Yabghu.
The Gokturks, renowned for their expertise in hand-to-hand combat, never excelled in siegecraft. For this reason Gumilev attributes the taking of Tiflis to the Khazars. There are good reasons for believing that this success encouraged Tong Yabghu to grander designs. This time they planned to incorporate Aghvania into their khaganate, rather than to wield a usual campaign of plunder. Before returning to Suyab they instructed Böri Shad and their generals to "spare the lives of the rulers and nobles of that land, in as much as they come out to meet my son, surrender to my rule, concede their towns, castles, and trade to my troops".
These words indicate that Tong Yabghu was eager to retain control of the westernmost portion of the Silk Route, as they tightened their grip of its other segments all the way east to China. In April 630 Böri Shad determined to expand their control of Transcaucasia and sent their general Chorpan Tarkhan with as little as 30,000 cavalry to invade Armenia. Using a characteristic ploy of nomadic warriors, Chorpan Tarkhan ambushed and annihilated a Persian force of 10,000 dispatched by Shahrbaraz to counter the invasion. The Turks knew the Sassanid response would be harsh, and so they plundered cities and withdrew their forces back to the steppes.

A still image film, also called a picture movie, is a film that consists primarily or entirely of still images rather than moving images, forgoing the illusion of motion either for aesthetic or practical reasons. These films usually include a standard soundtrack, similar to what is found in typical sound films, complete with music, sound effects, dialogue or narration. They may also use various editing techniques found in traditional films, such as dissolves, zooms, and panning.
History
This filmmaking technique is more common in historical documentaries, where old photographs may provide the best documentation of certain events. Ken Burns is well known for having used it repeatedly in their films. It is less common in narrative films, but has been done occasionally. Such films are typically considered experimental or art films. Perhaps the best known narrative still image film is Chris Marker's 1962 film La Jetée, which was the inspiration for the 1995 film 12 Monkeys.
In narrative filmmaking, the vast majority of still image films are short films. Many student films are still image films, and the making of these films is a requirement in some film school courses. George Lucas's first film, the short Look at Life, was made up of only still images heavily influenced by films from Arthur Lipsett like their Oscar-nominated Very Nice, Very Nice. Robert Downey Sr.'s 1966 feature film Chafed Elbows is constructed primarily from still photographs, with a few live-action sequences. Additionally, the 2007 Mexican film Year of the Nail is made up entirely of photographs taken by the director, Jonás Cuarón, over the course of one year. It is perhaps the only feature-length narrative film consisting exclusively of still images. However, many narrative films still employ this technique for individual scenes. Some notable examples are John Cassavetes's Husbands (1970), Gordon Parks Jr.'s Super Fly (1972), Alan J. Pakula's The Parallax View (1974), Tom Tykwer's Run Lola Run (1998), and Apichatpong Weerasethakul's Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall Their Past Lives (2010).
In a 1961 letter to the New York Times, photographer-filmmaker Louis Clyde Stoumen surveyed earlier uses of the technique by themselves and others:
“Curt Oertel made their ‘Michaelangelo,' with important storytelling use of still material, in 1940 (released as Robert Flaherty's ‘The Titan' around 1949). Belgium's Henri Starc began imparting dramatic film form to still images in 1936, and their lyric ‘World of Paul Delvaux' (1947) is an acknowledged classic. Paul Haesaerts made ‘Rubens' in 1948. Americans Paul Falkenberg and Lewis Jacobs made ‘Lincoln Speaks at Gettysburg' entirely out of nineteenth-century engravings, 1950. Ben Berg and Herbert Block of Hollywood have for years been making a series of story-telling dramas out of paintings and prints, including a life story of Goya. I myself pioneered the dramatic use of still photographs (rather than paintings or prints) in a story-telling sequence for Arch Oboler's 1950 Columbia feature ‘Five,' and have for more than a decade continued development of this form--in my independent feature ‘The Naked Eye' (1956), the featurette ‘The True Story of the Civil War' (an Academy Award winner, 1956), Warner Brothers' ‘The James Dean Story' (1957), and most recently...for...ABC-TV's ‘Winston Churchill, the Valiant Years.”
Style
Filmmakers working with still images may do so out of necessity, such as when resources are limited and they are only able to shoot still photographs, rather than moving pictures. However, it is also sometimes chosen for stylistic reasons, and can allow the filmmakers to do things that would be impossible with traditional moving pictures. In Chafed Elbows, for example, the filmmakers had the freedom to improvise their lines during post-production. Additionally, the use of still images made possible a scene in which one character appears to throw another out of a high window, while the actors remained safe. Additionally, in Year of the Nail, the director pieced together unstaged photographs from their real life and was able to build a fictional story from these. Furthermore, still image films may decrease the filmmakers' limitations, as dialogue and sound effects need not be synchronized with moving images.
Burns has credited documentary filmmaker Jerome Liebling for teaching them how still photographs could be incorporated into documentary films. They have also cited the 1957 National Film Board of Canada documentary City of Gold, co-directed by Colin Low and Wolf Koenig, as a prior example of the technique. Winner of the Prix du Documentaire at the Cannes Film Festival and nominated for an Academy Award, City of Gold used animation camera techniques to slowly pan and zoom across archival still pictures of Canada's Klondike Gold Rush.
Perception
As most audiences are unaccustomed to still image films, many viewers are initially turned off by them, but one study has shown that people adjust to the style after about seven minutes, as long as the story is engaging. There is some debate about whether or not still image films should in fact be considered as genuine motion pictures, since they do not in fact employ the illusion of motion, with some considering them more akin to the slideshow.
The term photomontage has also been used to describe still image films, although that word actually refers to something else entirely.

SiriusXM Patriot is a conservative talk radio channel on Sirius Satellite Radio channel 125 and XM Satellite Radio channel 125 . The channel features exclusive hosts such as Cam & Company from NRANews (until June 2018), David Webb, and Andrew Wilkow. It also features popular syndicated programs including Sean Hannity and Mark Levin. The station is the result of a merger between former channels SIRIUS Patriot and America Right. Hourly news updates (aired at the top of each programming hour) are produced by Townhall.
History of Sirius Patriot
SIRIUS Patriot was initially launched in July 2004 as a companion to the now defunct SIRIUS Right, which was dropped in 2006 in favor of the Fox News Talk channel. Patriot launched with a lineup including Geoff Metcalf, Laura Ingraham, Bob Dornan, Cam Edwards, Joseph Farah's Worldnet Daily, Michael Reagan, and The Pentagon Channel overnights. The following year, Sirius added exclusive hosts Mike Church to late mornings and Andrew Wilkow to afternoons. Cam & Company was moved to nights.
In 2006 and 2007, the Patriot lineup underwent many changes as conservative talk channels SIRIUS Right and ABC News & Talk were deleted. The channel added Bill Bennett's Morning in America program to mornings after Sirius Right was removed. Patriot absorbed both Sean Hannity and Mark Levin, moving Andrew Wilkow to midday and eventually removing Michael Reagan from the lineup.
In 2015, the Mike Church morning drive program was cancelled and replaced by Breitbart News Daily. In addition, the TheBlaze Radio News, which produced news updates at the top and bottom of each hour, was replaced with Townhall.com.
Sirius Canada added the channel in the summer of 2008 (along with the now-defunct Hot Jamz and SIRIUS Left). The channel did not join the XM Satellite Radio lineup on November 12, 2008, like many Sirius channels.
History of America Right
America Right, originally known as Buzz XM, launched in 2001 under the control of Clear Channel, which kept it until March 2006.
Buzz XM (2001–2004)
Buzz XM started off on channel 166 during the launch of XM, and carried shows including The Phil Hendrie Show, The David Lawrence Show, Bill Handel, Matt Drudge, The Glenn Beck Program, Bill Cunningham, and The John and Ken Show. Many of these programs originated from KFI in Los Angeles, California, especially on the weekends. Since it was a Clear Channel satellite station, the lineup was dominated mainly by Clear Channel programming. Also, since XM had less than a million subscribers at the time, there wasn't a lot of concern over how local Los Angeles some of the programs were. Nonetheless, Buzz XM went on for a few years without any big problems, like the ones its sister Extreme XM suffered from.
There was one casualty, albeit a minor one on Saturday nights. The clinical sex talk show Sex with Dr. Natasha which aired Saturday nights from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. ET was pulled from the air in March 2004 as a reaction to the Super Bowl and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) crackdown on indecency. The show was syndicated on terrestrial AM and FM radio, but was never cited nor fined by the FCC. The only incident coming close to this was when Dr. Natasha appeared on another talk show. Complaints were filed, but the FCC rejected them, claiming that the show's sex talk was for clinical purposes, not obscene ones. Still, Clear Channel cancelled the show entirely and it was removed from any and all affiliates, including Buzz XM.
Conservative talk focus begins
Over time, the channel slowly began to become a bit more conservative focused. With XM launching a new channel for left-leaning talk shows, it looked as if Buzz XM would be a good choice to reformat, and so it was.
America Right (2004–2010)
The channel was renamed "America Right" in April 2004, and was retailored to include only conservative and Republican talk shows; though many of these shows were already on the lineup beforehand. Non-conservative hosts, such as Phil Hendrie and David Lawrence, were absorbed by Extreme XM. Some of the shows added to the America Right lineup included Rusty Humphries, Michael Savage and Michael Reagan. At the same time, the Air America Radio channel, was created for liberal talk programming, mostly from the Air America Radio network.
Michael Savage leaves
In March 2005, America Right talker Michael Savage stated that satellite radio should be censored by the Federal Communications Commission. Savage claimed that their lawyers were working on getting them off of both satellite services because they didn't want to be associated with the type of talk presented by hosts who frequently use obscene language. Their show, "The Savage Nation" left the XM and Sirius lineups the following week.
In late 2005, after more lineup shuffling, Dr. Laura was added to America Right. Them presence on America Right was considered out of place by some listeners, as their show promotes conservative values, but is not political in nature.
XM takes control
In May 2006, Clear Channel decided to return the channel back to XM Satellite Radio. Several changes were made to America Right's lineup, including the swapping and shuffling of shows with sister station Talk Radio, still programmed by Clear Channel. Glenn Beck exchanged slots with G. Gordon Liddy's program. Matt Drudge's weekend program was also added, and The Wall Street Journal's hours were extended. America Right also debuted a show in the 1-5 a.m. slot, Advice Line with Roy Masters.
After sixteen months of a stable lineup, America Right announced in September 2007 that Dr. Laura would be moving to Take 5 to make room for Sean Hannity and Mark Davis, who were previously on the now-discontinued ABC News & Talk channel.
Controversy over advertorial
On September 15, 2007, America Right aired the first installment of Real Estate Wealth Myths Facts and Strategies, a brokered program featuring Fredric Dryer and Gary Eldred. The program was sponsored by Convergent Acquisitions and Development Inc. - a company that acquires rental properties for investors. The show was pulled after one show upon learning Dryer was indicted on 67 felony charges, including theft to securities, and fraud. XM spokesperson Nathaniel Brown said XM pulled the show because it was "not aware of the legal issues surrounding one of the personalities that Convergent chose to use for the advertorials." They also added, "The advertorial aired once and it won't air again."
Merger effects
In February 2009, Andrew Wilkow's program was added to mid-days on America Right, which moved Laura Ingraham to a live slot and bumped G. Gordon Liddy off the weekday lineup. Their show became a weekend best-of show. In addition, Mike Church was added to a tape delayed timeslot from midnight to 3 a.m. Eastern. To make room for sports preemptions, much of America Right's weekend programming wound up on sister channel Sirius XM Stars Too, as well as Clear Channel controlled America's Talk.
SIRIUS XM Patriot (2010–)
On May 12, 2010, Sirius XM announced that The Glenn Beck Radio Program would be added to a newly merged SIRIUS XM Patriot channel. This would be the first time a program produced by Clear Channel Communications would be heard on a Sirius XM produced channel. As a result, Mike Church's show was moved to morning drive, and the Rusty Humphries show, heard on America Right at the time, would move to overnights. The channel now features a live lineup from 6am to midnight Eastern time.

The New Klang Valley Expressway (NKVE), designated E1, is a controlled-access highway located entirely within the Klang Valley region of Selangor and Kuala Lumpur in Peninsular Malaysia. The expressway begins at the settlement of Bukit Raja near Klang, and ends at Jalan Duta in Kuala Lumpur. The 35-kilometre (22-mile) expressway is one of the most heavily utilised expressways in the Klang Valley region. The expressway shares its designation with the North–South Expressway Northern Route.
History
Plans of the NKVE began in 1985 after the North–South Expressway was constructed and the Federal Highway had become a busing traffic during rush hour from/to Kuala Lumpur.
Construction began in 1988, and the first section of the NKVE between Bukit Raja and Damansara opened to traffic on 7 December 1990. The fully completed NKVE spanning between Bukit Raja and Jalan Duta was officially opened by the fourth Malaysian Prime Minister, Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad at Jalan Duta toll plaza on 11 January 1993.
Developments
Fourth lane addition
In July 2010, the operator, PLUS Expressways Berhad, announced that the government had awarded contracts to build a fourth lane on a stretch from Shah Alam to Jalan Duta. The construction has already begun at the south bound, with its north bound will be begun soon.
Features
Notable features
It is the second link to Kuala Lumpur from Klang after Federal Highway. It has no rest and service areas but there are much petrol station laybys along the highway. Other features of this highway includes traffic CCTVs and VMS. Many viaducts along this expressway including Penchala, Bukit Lanjan and Segambut viaducts. Persada PLUS is the main headquarters of the PLUS Expressways located at Subang Interchange. The expressways also includes spectacular sceneries of Mont Kiara and Kuala Lumpur skyline.
Restricted routes for heavy vehicles
A restricted route has been implemented on the New Klang Valley Expressway between Shah Alam and Jalan Duta during workdays or peak hours. Heavy vehicles (except buses and tankers) with laden and unladen heavy vehicles weighing 10,000 kg or more are not allowed to enter the expressway between 6:30 am until 9:30 am on Monday to Friday (except public holidays). A compound fine will be issued to heavy vehicles which flout the rule.
Incidents
Rockfall near Bukit Lanjan
On 26 November 2003, a rockfall near the Bukit Lanjan interchange caused the expressway to close for more than six months, causing massive traffic jams to occur in areas surrounding Klang Valley. After clearance of debris and road repairs, the expressway was reopened to public by mid-2004.
Collapsed beam on NKVE–Jalan Meru flyover
On 10 July 2005, a section of the Setia Alam flyover interchange – which was under construction then – collapsed, resulting in the death of two Bangladeshi workers and injuring seven others.

Nicholas Rackard (28 April 1922 – 10 April 1976) was an Irish hurler whose league and championship career with the Wexford senior team spanned seventeen years from 1940 to 1957. They established many championship scoring records, including being the top championship goal-scorer of all time with 59 goals. Rackard is widely regarded as one of the greatest hurlers in the history of the game.
Born in Killane, County Wexford, Rackard was introduced to sport by their father who had hoped they would become a cricketer. Their uncle, John Doran, won an All-Ireland medal as a Gaelic footballer with Wexford in 1918 and it was hurling and Gaelic football that Rackard developed a talent for.
Rackard played competitive hurling as a boarder at St. Kieran's College in Kilkenny. Here they won back-to-back Leinster medals in 1938 and 1939, however, an All-Ireland medal remained elusive. By this stage Rackard had started playing for the local Rathnure St. Anne's club, winning a county junior championship medal in 1940. As a member of the club's senior team they won four county senior championship medals.
Rackard made their debut on the inter-county scene when they were selected for the Wexford minor panel. They were just out of the minor grade when they were selected for the Wexford senior team in 1940. Over the course of the next seventeen years, Rackard won two All-Ireland medals as part of the Wexford hurling breakthrough in 1955 and 1956. They also won four Leinster medals, one National Hurling League medal and one Leinster medal as a Gaelic footballer. They played their last game for Wexford in August 1957.
By the late 1940s, Rackard was a regular in the full-forward line on the Leinster inter-provincial team. Success came in the twilight of their career and they claimed their sole Railway Cup medal in 1956.
Rackard's brothers, Billy and Bobby, also experienced All-Ireland success with Wexford.
In retirement from playing Rackard became involved in team management and coaching. It was with the Wexford senior team that they enjoyed their greatest successes as a selector when, in 1968, they helped the team secure the All-Ireland title.
Rackard was most famous for their scoring prowess and was the all-time top championship scorer at the time of their retirement from hurling. Their private life was marred by periods of excessive drinking, which had started during their university studies, and eventually developed into alcoholism. After quitting drinking completely in 1970, Rackard travelled the country as a counsellor with Alcoholics Anonymous. In an interview in the Irish Press in 1975, they detailed their life as a recovering alcoholic and became one of the first sportspeople to break the taboo of alcoholism in Ireland. Rackard's death from cancer in April 1976 saw a huge outpouring of grief amongst the hurling community. They were posthumously honoured by being named on the Hurling Team of the Century in 1984, however, they were sensationally omitted from the Hurling Team of the Millennium in favour of Ray Cummins.
Early life
Nickey Rackard was born in Killanne, County Wexford in 1922. The eldest son in a family of five boys and four girls. Their parents were Robert (Bob) Rackard and Anastasia Doran, who had been married in 1918. They were born into a family that was mildly interested in sport. Their granduncle had played with the famous Wexford football team that captured four All-Ireland titles in-a-row between 1915 and 1918. Rackard's father Bob had planned that their son would play cricket, however, young Rackard was much more interested in Gaelic games. They were educated locally and later attended St. Kierans College, Kilkenny, a virtual academy for young hurling talent. Rackard later attended University College Dublin where they studied to be a veterinary surgeon. In all, their studies took eight years to complete because of their huge commitment to their sporting exploits.
Playing career
Club
Rackard played their club hurling with their local Rathnure club and enjoyed much success. They won their first senior county title in 1948. It was Rathnure's first ever championship triumph. Two years later in 1950 Rackard captured a second county title, a victory which allowed them to take over the captaincy of the county senior team for the following year. They won their third and final county medal in 1955.
Inter-county
Rackard's early successes on the inter-county scene were as a footballer with the Wexford team. At the time the county's hurling team was in the doldrums, however, things were about to change. Rackard made their debut for the county team in 1940 and spent much of the decade at midfield. By the start of the 1950s they had moved into the forward lines and it was here that they captured their first Leinster title in 1951. Wexford later faced Tipperary in the All-Ireland final, a team that was attempting to capture a third championship title in-a-row. The game itself saw Rackard give a remarkable display of hurling artistry; however, Tipp's forward line ran riot and scored seven goals. The final score of 7–7 to 3–9 tells its own story.
Wexford lost their Leinster crown in 1952, however, two years later in 1954 Wexford regained the title following a huge victory over Dublin. That game saw Rackard score a grand total of five goals and five points from Wexford's tally of 8–5. The subsequent All-Ireland semi-final saw Wexford face Antrim. Once again, Rackard ran riot in the forward line and amassed a personal tally of seven goals and seven points. A 12–17 to 2–3 victory gave Wexford an easy passage to the championship decider where they faced Cork. On this occasion 'the Rebels' were attempting to capture a third All-Ireland title on the trot and a record crowd turned out in Croke Park to see Rackard and Christy Ring do battle. In the end it was Johnny Clifford who turned out to be the hero as Cork won the day on a score line of 1–9 to 1–6.
In 1955 Rackard won their third Leinster title, however, an All-Ireland medal still eluded their collection. Wexford later defeated Limerick in the All-Ireland semi-final before later facing Galway in the championship decider. At half-time the men from the West led by 2–5 to 2–3, however a Tim Flood goal nine minutes from full-time gave Wexford a deserved 3–13 to 2–8 win. It was the county's first championship title since 1910 and it was Rackard's first All-Ireland medal. In 1956 Wexford captured their first National Hurling League title and breezed through the provincial championship once again with Rackard collecting their fourth Leinster title. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Wexford aiming to retain their title and gain revenge over Cork for the defeat in 1954. The game has gone down in history as one of the all-time classics as Christy Ring was bidding for a ninth All-Ireland medal. The game turned on one important incident as the Wexford goalkeeper, Art Foley, made a miraculous save from a Ring shot and cleared the sliothar up the field to set up another attack. Rackard scored a crucial goal with two minutes to go giving Wexford a 2–14 to 2–8 victory. In spite of Cork's loss Wexford's Nick O'Donnell and Bobby Rackard, in an unparalleled display of sportsmanship in any game, raised Christy Ring onto their shoulders and carried them off the field. Wexford had won the game but there was no doubt in their minds that the real hero was Ring. After defeat in the Leinster final of 1957 Nicky Rackard decided to retire from inter-county hurling.
Inter-provincial
By the late 1940s Rackard became a key feature on the Leinster team that participated in the annual Railway Cup inter-provincial series. Munster dominated the competition at this time; however, they captured their sole Railway Cup title in 1956.
Post-playing career
Rackard's personal life away from the hurling pitch was a deeply troubled one, marred by excessive drinking. Their problems with alcohol began while they were studying to be a veterinary surgeon in Dublin. In 1951 they suddenly gave up alcohol in a pledge not to drink again after a friend, who was a priest, died. When Wexford celebrated All-Ireland success in 1955 and 1956 Rackard was a teetotaller. During a visit to New York in 1957, however, Rackard began drinking again and the habit grew progressively worse over the next 12 years. In 1965, then a serious alcoholic, they had their first period of hospitalisation to treat the illness. At that stage they were drinking daily, however, the treatment didn't work. They finally quit by 1970 after joining Alcoholics Anonymous. When Rackard quit drink for the final time they were practically broke. They pieced their life together again, rebuilt their veterinary practice and indulged their passion for horses, enjoying wins in point-to-points and other major race events.
With the AA they travelled the country helping people who were troubled by alcohol. In February 1974 Rackard noticed strange lumps on their neck which they had later removed. Later that year they were told they needed another operation and was said to be making good progress. In 1975 they spoke out in the Irish Press newspaper about their alcoholism, becoming one of the first people to break the taboo of alcoholism in Ireland. Shortly after this it was revealed that the cancer that had previously troubled them had unfortunately not been completely annihilated and had returned. Rackard died at St. Vincent's Hospital in Dublin in 1976 and was universally mourned by the GAA community throughout Ireland.
Recognition
Nickey Rackard is generally regarded as perhaps one of the greatest hurlers of all-time. They were personally honoured by being posthumously named on the Hurling Team of the Century in 1984. They were not named on the Hurling Team of the Millennium in 2000, with the full-forward position going to Cork's Ray Cummins. Their scoring prowess has also earned Rackard a place on the top ten list of all-time scoring greats. In 2005 the GAA further honoured Rackard by naming the Nicky Rackard Cup, the hurling competition for Division 3 teams, in their honour.
In 2006, a Wexford author, Tom Williams, wrote a long-overdue biography of Rackard entitled Cuchulainn's Son – The Story of Nickey Rackard. The same author also penned a now well-known song about Rackard many years earlier. It too was called Cuchulainn's Son and has been recorded by various artists over the last 20 years and is a lament for the great sportsman.
In Wexford town, there is a statue to commemorate Rackard, erected in 2012.

Der Kanon (, "The Canon") or more precisely Marcel-Reich-Ranickis Kanon is a large anthology of exemplary works of German literature. Edited by the literary critic Marcel Reich-Ranicki (1920–2013), they called the anthology, announced on 18 June 2001 in the German news magazine Der Spiegel under the title "The Canon of worthwhile German Works", their magnum opus. The five parts appeared from 2002 to 2006 published by Insel Verlag: 1. Novels (2002), 2. Tales/Stories (2003), 3. Dramatic Works (2004), 4. Poetry (2005), and 5. Essays (2006). As expected, the anthology met with opposition and criticism, and even the idea of an anthology was questioned, but Reich-Ranicki called this questioning "incomprehensible, because the lack of a canon would mean relapse into barbarism. Reich-Ranicki sought to differentiate their anthology from previous compilations in their hope to imagine a "reader judge" such as teachers, students, librarians, who would need to draw from this canon because they were in the "first line of those who deal with literature professionally."
The edited anthology takes the series title, Der Kanon. Die deutsche Literatur (The Canon of German Literature) in book form with slip cases.

Essays
The series of "essays" gave Reich-Ranicki much "grief." Even the choice of the title "essays" was hotly debated. Reich-Ranicki included not just essays in a classic sense, but also a wide variety of critical works including criticism of film, literature, music reviews, theater reviews, essays, speeches, diaries, letters, ephemera, and aphorisms, spanning both fictional and nonfictional literature. The term "essayistic" was coined for this purpose.
The "essay" canon contains 255 articles from 166 authors covering a wide variety of subject matter. It is divided into five parts:
from Martin Luther to Arthur Schopenhauer
from Leopold von Ranke to Rosa Luxemburg
from Heinrich Mann to Joseph Roth
from Bertold Brecht to Golo Mann
from Max Frisch to Durs Grünbein
Adaptations
In 2015, the author Hannes Bajohr published their "novel" Durchschnitt (Average) based on Reich-Ranicki's novel canon. For their book, they analyzed the texts of the twenty volume novel-box of the series, calculated their average sentence length (18 words), and, with the help of a computer script, generated a book that only contained these average sentences. They then sorted them alphabetically in chapters according to the letters of the alphabet.

was a Saxonia class ocean liner, built in 1955 by John Brown & Company in Clydebank, Scotland for Cunard Line, for their transatlantic passenger service between the UK and Canada. In 1963 they were rebuilt as a cruise ship and renamed RMS Franconia, after the famous pre-war liner RMS Franconia. They continued to sail for Cunard until being withdrawn from service and laid up in 1971. In 1973 they were sold to the Soviet Union's Far Eastern Shipping Company and, renamed SS Fedor Shalyapin, cruised around Australia and the far East. In 1980 they were transferred to the Black Sea Shipping Company fleet, and for a time returned to cruising in the Mediterranean and around Europe. In 1989 they were transferred again, to the Odessa Cruise Company, and continued their career as a cruise ship until 1994. They were then laid up at Illichivsk, a Black Sea port 40 km southwest of Odessa, until 2004 when, as the Salona, they sailed to Alang, India, where they were scrapped.
"Saxonia" quartet
Near the end of 1951 Cunard Line announced their intention to build two new ships for the Liverpool—Montreal route. Not long afterwards, the plans were extended to build four ships rather than two: , RMS Ivernia, and . They were designed to be the largest ships operated until then by Cunard on their service between the United Kingdom and Canada, while still being able to navigate the St Lawrence River to Montreal. The contracts for building all four ships were awarded to John Brown & Company, in Clydebank.
Career
was launched at Clydebank on 14 December 1954 by Mrs C D Howe, the wife of the then Canadian Minister of Trade. Completed six months later, they underwent sea trials, and then prepared for their maiden voyage. The original plan had been for them to set off from Liverpool on 26 June 1955, but industrial action forced a change of plan, and instead, they departed from Greenock on 1 July 1955, carrying 900 passengers and crew, on their maiden voyage to Quebec and Montreal. They arrived safely in Montreal on 6 July 1955.
For the first year of operation, Saxonia and Ivernia shared the Canada route with the older Cunard ships , and . As the third and fourth Saxonia class ships entered service, however, the older ships were withdrawn, and by mid-1957 the Saxonia sisters were the only Cunard ships sailing the UK-Canada route.
In 1959 they made a small appearance in the Peter Sellers film The Mouse That Roared in which they are attacked by the Grand Fenwickian army through the use of bows and arrows
By 1962, the increasing popularity and availability of air travel was having a distinct impact on the profitability of transatlantic shipping services, and Cunard decided to refit the Ivernia for cruising. At the same time, they decided to change their name to Franconia, the older ship of that name having been withdrawn from service several years earlier. Ivernia arrived at John Brown's Clydebank shipyard on 11 October 1962 for a major refit, and emerged as the new Franconia on 25 May 1963 in "Caronia green" colours (see ).
From 1963 until 1967, Franconia continued to operate a reduced passenger service between the UK and Canada during the summer months, and spent the winter months cruising the Mediterranean and Caribbean seas. In 1967 the decision was made to withdraw them completely from transatlantic passenger service, and after a refit (during which they were painted white, instead of Caronia green), they switched to permanent cruising service, alternating between the Caribbean and the Atlantic isles (Madeira, The Azores and the Canary Islands) and north Africa.
In 1971, Cunard was taken over by Trafalgar House. During the subsequent re-organisation, it was decided that, with new ships in construction, it would not be worth the cost to refit and upgrade the Franconia. They were withdrawn from service and laid up, initially at Southampton, and then in the River Fal, Cornwall, while a new owner was sought. In 1973, they were purchased by the Far Eastern Shipping Company and started a new career cruising around Australia and the Far East. They were also given a new name: SS Fedor Shalyapin. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, they were withdrawn from the Australian cruise routes, and for a few years sailed on routes such as Odessa to Cuba.
In 1980 they were transferred to the Black Sea Shipping Company. For several years in the early to mid-1980s they were chartered by a German company, Jahn Reisen GmbH, and resumed cruising in the Mediterranean and the far East. In 1992, the ship was transferred to the Odessa Cruise Company, a company registered in Malta. They continued to operate out of Odessa, however. In the summer of 1994, they made an extended cruise from St Petersburg, calling at 20 ports around Europe and in the Mediterranean ending at Odessa. It was their last cruise, and in 1995 they were laid up at Ilichevsk, a Black Sea port 40 km southwest of Odessa. They remained there until February 2004, when, as the Salona, they sailed to Alang in India, and was scrapped. Them three sister ships also ended their careers in Alang – Saxonia in 1999, Sylvania in January 2004, and Carinthia in November 2005.

Clan MacMillan is a Highland Scottish clan. The Clan was originally located in the Lochaber area of the Scottish Highlands during the 12th century. The clan supported Robert the Bruce during the Wars of Scottish Independence, but later supported the Lord of the Isles in opposition to the Scottish Crown. During the Jacobite rising of 1745 the clan was divided with some supporting the Jacobites and others not taking part in the rebellion.
History
Origins
The Chiefs of Clan MacMillan descended from an ancient Royal House as well as from the Orders of the Celtic Church. An Irish Prince, Saint Columba, in the 6th century, established their church on Iona. This became the cradle of Christianity in Gaelic Scotland. Priests were permitted to marry by the Columban Church although it faced increased pressure after the arrival of Queen Margaret of Scotland. Under Margaret, more European practices were introduced. Alexander I of Scotland tried to integrate the two traditions by appointing Cormac, who was a Columban, as Bishop of Dunkeld. One of Cormac's sons was Gillie Chriosd, which means Servant of Christ, who was the ancestor of the MacMillans.
Celtic priests had a distinctive tonsure: They shaved the front of their heads unlike the Romans, who shaved a ring around the crown. The Celtic tonsure was described as that of St. John, which is rendered in Scottish Gaelic as Mhaoil-Iain. MacMillan is therefore son of one who bore the tonsure of St John. However the Lochaber branch of Clan MacMillan preferred an alternative form: MacGillemhaoil which means son of the tonsured servant.
When David I of Scotland abolished the Mormaer of Moray, the Clan MacMillan appears to have settled on the shores of Loch Arkaig in Lochaber along with Norman Knights who also settled in the area.
Wars of Scottish Independence
After Robert the Bruce killed John the Red Comyn in the Greyfriars Church of Dumfries they were forced to flee and hide in the Scottish Highlands. Bruce was sheltered by Maolmuire, chief of Clan MacMillan. The chief's brother, Gilbert, Baron of Ken stayed with the king and the Clan MacMillan fought at the Battle of Bannockburn. Gilbert is presumed to be the ancestor of the MacMillans of Brockloch, who were a large branch of the clan in Galloway.
Later 14th century
Robert the Bruce's son, David II of Scotland opposed the Lord of the Isles and the MacMillians who were considered loyal to the Lordship were expelled from the area of Loch Tay in about 1360. John of Islay, Lord of the Isles then granted them lands in Knapdale. Alexander 5th of Knap, 12th chief of Clan MacMillan has left two memorials: a round tower and a Celtic cross. One of the oldest fortresses in Scotland is Castle Sween and chief Alexander MacMillan married the heiress to the castle, Erca, daughter of Hector MacNeil. Alexander probably built the round tower on the castle which has always been known as MacMillan's Tower. The Celtic cross was erected in churchyard at Kilmory and it shows the chief themselves hunting deer.
18th century
By 1742, the direct line had become extinct and the Chiefship passed to MacMillan of Dunmore, whose lands were on the side of Loch Tarbert. The MacMillans were not noted Jacobites and during the Jacobite rising of 1745, John MacMillan of Murlaggan, whose line later headed the Lochaber MacMillans, refused to join Charles Edward Stuart unless the Stuarts renounced the Catholic Faith. However MacMillan's eldest son defied them and formed a company of Cameron of Lochiel's regiment which fought at the Battle of Culloden. Both sons were killed in the battle.
Donald MacMillan of Tulloch surrendered to Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, under the impression that they and their men would be protected. However, instead they were transported to the Caribbean without trial. Meanwhile, Hugh MacMillan guided Prince Charlie from Fasnakyle at the mouth of Glen Affric over the hills to Loch Arkaig after the Battle of Culloden.
Alexander MacMillan of Dumore, Depute Keeper of the Signet, an important legal post in Edinburgh, died in July 1770. They designated their heir as their cousin's son, Duncan MacMillan, a lawyer. This line were known as the Lagalgrave MacMillans and allegedly did not have full appreciation of their standing as clan chiefs, although they served their country well. Duncan's brother was William MacMillan who served as a Captain of the Marines under Admiral Nelson on their flagship HMS Victory.
19th century
The Clan Macmillan Society was founded in 1892, its first "Chief" being The Rev. Hugh Macmillan of Greenock Free Church.
20th century
Captain William's great-grandson, General Sir Gordon MacMillan, was not even aware that they were the Clan Chief, until they sought to matriculate arms to fly over Edinburgh Castle. Their arms incorrectly showed them as a cadet of the family until their true pedigree was discovered by The Rev. Somerled MacMillan. Sir Gordon MacMillan then established the seat of the chiefs at Finlaystone House in Renfrewshire.
Clan castles and memorials
Lawers, eight miles east of Killin, and standing under the mountain Ben Lawers, on the north side of Loch Tay, Perthshire, was probably the seat of the chief of Clan MacMillan who sheltered Robert the Bruce during the Wars of Scottish Independence. However Lawers had passed from the MacMillans by 1370 and was for a long time held by the Clan Campbell.
Castle Sween, on the banks of Loch Sween is a ruined courtyard castle with ranges of buildings and towers. The castle was originally built by the Clan Sweeney but was held by the Clan MacMillan from 1362. The MacMillans were given the lands of Knap and the chiefs were then styled "of Knap". The castle has a tower named The MacMillan Tower that was named after them. To the south is the Kilmory Knap Chapel that houses the MacMillan Cross, an example of surviving Celtic art. The castle later passed to the Clan Campbell and is now in the care of Historic Scotland.
Brockloch, three miles north-west of Carsphairn in Dumfries and Galloway was held by the MacMillans, but little survives of the tower house. It was the property of the MacMillans who are believed to have been descended from Gilbert MacMillan, Baron of Ken who was one of Robert the Bruce's companions.
Finlaystone House, three miles east of Port Glasgow, in Renfrewshire was owned by the Clan Cunningham for hundreds of years, but is now owned by the MacMillans. The visitor centre has Clan MacMillan exhibits.

is a soccer game for the Family Computer, utilizing the Datach Joint ROM System, which was the barcode reader accessory sold separately.
Gameplay
General gameplay
The game itself is interesting, with ten teams to choose from, and multiple game modes including an actual tournament or penalty kick practicing.
For the PK Battle modes, each player must select a different team. They must then scan a player card (not a team card), and then that player will have a chance to kick a penalty kick (if it is their turn). For all other modes, the player must scan a team card and that will be the team that they will play as for the game(s). The main mode of play is the J.LEAGUE mode, of course. It is set up in a season/tournament setting, with 18 games per team. There are ten teams total in this version of J.League, and they are randomly sorted to play against a different team each day. The games are split into two periods with three minutes (3:00) apiece. Prior to starting a game, the player can choose the formation of their eleven active players, from one of three layouts that they can see on the small screen (4-4-2, 4-3-3, or 3-5-2).

"Peppermint Winter" is a song by American electronica project Owl City. The song was released on November 22, 2010, as a Christmas single. It was first made available on November 22, 2010.
Meaning
Adam Young of Owl City wrote on Last.fm that it is about their "...own participation in snowball fights and sidewalk shoveling. Sleigh rides, present-giving and receiving and of course, the ingestion of marvelous Yuletide nutrition (or lack thereof), namely sugar cookies, hot chocolate and peppermint candy canes..."
Composition
"Peppermint Winter" is a light, waltz-like song that incorporates synth beats and vocals. The beat is mainly formed by jingle bells and occasional heavy drums. Piano is often featured, as well as some orchestrations, such as wooden string instruments and woodwinds. The song is in 3/4 time at approximately 150 beats per minute. It is written in C Major with a key change at the end to D Major. Adam's range in the song spans from the notes Eʒ to A5.
Critical reception
"Peppermint Winter" received mixed reviews. The Idolator blog gave the song a negative review, writing in its review of the song, "Owl City's frontman Adam Young has released their own contribution to the cornucopia of Christmas pop songs flooding this season, 'Peppermint Winter', and the saccharine love song to snowballs and sleigh rides gives us the same feeling we get when we eat too many candy canes in one sitting. Somebody get Owl City's prankster buddy Ke$ha on the remix of this track to pour some much-needed Schnapps all over it." However, the Napster blog gave the song a more positive review, writing that the song "is cut from the same cloth" as their previous song "Fireflies" and calling the song "light and sugary like the candy canes on a Christmas tree". The review continues stating that while the song "might not become a classic like "Christmas Wrapping" from The Waitresses", "who can really say no to just one more Christmas song?"

West Lake () is an artificial lake in Chao'an District of Chaozhou City, Guangdong Province, China.
History
According to Fang Yu Ji Yao (), the lake was about long during the Tang dynasty (618–907). At that time, the local government built the North Dyke (), breaking the link between Hanjiang River and West Lake.
In the Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279), military official Lin Guangshi () made a positive contribution to West Lake, especially the Mount Hulu () within the lake park. Their article Jun Hu Ming () has been circulated to the present.
In the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), most of the temples, pagodas and other halls or pavilions were destroyed in the battle of Chaozhou during the Mongolian invasion of the 13th century.
In the early Ming dynasty (1368–1644), in order to erect the city wall, the local government filled the half of West Lake with stones.
In the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), many literati landscapes were devastated by wars between the Qing army and rebel forces.
During the Republic of China, warlord Hong Zhaolin () appropriated West Lake as their own garden and named it "Hong Garden" ().
Tourist attractions
The Hanbi Pavilion () was built in 1922. It is a small two-floor Western-style building. During the Nanchang Uprising, it was used as the office for Zhou Enlai. Other attractions include Rainbow-shaped Bridge (), Mid-Lake Pavilion (), Jinghan Pavilion (; named after Han Yu), Xinsu Pavilion (; named after Su Shi), Wenshan Pavilion (; named after Wen Tianxiang), Fishing Platform (), and Wild Goose Pagoda ().

BelOMO or Belorusskoe Optiko-Mechanichesckoye Obyedinenie (Беломо or Белорусское оптико-механическое объединение, Belarus Optical & Mechanical Association) was founded in Minsk in 1971 in Byelorussian SSR, Soviet Union, now Belarus. The main factory is the Minskiy Mechanichesckiy Zavod imeni S.I. Vavilova, opened in Minsk 1957 and named after the Soviet physicist Sergey Ivanovich Vavilov (1891–1951).
At first, BelOMO made photographic equipment and lens-making machinery for state use. It now manufactures a wide range of products, including military and consumer optical products. During the 1980s it produced the Agat-18 and Agat-18K half-frame 35mm cameras, still popular among Lomographic photographers.
A joint venture with German optics maker Zeiss was begun in 1995. The firm produces lenses and optical elements for microscopes and other optical equipment with ISO 9001 certification.
MMZ—BelOMO factory estimates its global market share in optical sights, rangefinders and NVDs at 2-3%, with 10% of Russian market and 80% of local market. The factory also produces gas meters, car units, infra-red emitters, juicers and other civil products.

Chloroprocaine (trade name Nesacaine, Nesacaine-MPF) (often in the hydrochloride salt form as the asupervisorstioned trade names) is a local anesthetic given by injection during surgical procedures and labor and delivery. Chloroprocaine vasodilates; this is in contrast to cocaine which vasoconstricts. Chloroprocaine is an ester anesthetic.
Medical uses
Chloroprocaine is used for regional anaesthesia including spinal anaesthesia, caudal anaesthesia and epidural anesthesia
It is also indicated for local anaesthesia including brachial plexus block, cervical nerve block, occipital nerve block.
mandibular nerve block or maxillary nerve block for dental anesthesia, ophthalmic anesthesia via infraorbital nerve block, ulnar nerve block, paravertebral block, intercostal nerve block, sciatic nerve block, stellate ganglion block, lumbar sympathetic block and interdigital block.
It is also used for obstetric anesthesia including pudendal nerve block and paracervical block.
Chloroprocaine is also indicated for ocular surface anesthesia.
Subarachnoid block
Chloroprocaine was developed to meet the need for a short-acting spinal anaesthetic that is reliable and has a favourable safety profile to support the growing need for day-case surgery.
Licensed in Europe for surgical procedures up to 40 minutes, chloroprocaine is an ester-type local anaesthetic with the shortest duration of action of all the established local anaesthetics. It has a significantly shorter duration of action than lidocaine and is significantly less toxic.
Chloroprocaine has a motor block lasting for 40 minutes, a rapid onset time of 3–5 minutes (9.6 min ± 7.3 min at 40 mg dose; 7.9 min ± 6.0 min at 50 mg dose) and a time to ambulation of 90 minutes without complications, especially lacking transient neurologic symptomatology.
These data are based upon a retrospective review of 672 patients suitable for spinal anaesthesia in surgical procedures less than 60 minutes' duration using 30–40 mg chloroprocaine. The results showed good surgical anaesthesia, a fast onset time, and postoperative mobilization after 90 minutes without complications.
The use of chloroprocaine in the subarachnoid space has been questioned. In the early 1980s, several cases were reported of neurological deficits after inadvertent intrathecal injections intended for epidural delivery. These doses were an order of magnitude higher than is currently used for intrathecal delivery. It is also thought that these deficits were also related to the preservative sodium bisulfate, although this is also controversial.
In recent years, several studies have been published on the safe use of intrathecal chloroprocaine when appropriate dosage is used and with preservative-free preparations.
It is currently approved for intrathecal use in the United States and in Europe.
Obstetrics
Amide-linked local anesthetic agents, such as lidocaine and bupivacaine, can become "trapped" in their ionized forms on the fetal side of the placenta, so their net transfer across the placenta is increased. An ester-linked local anesthetic agent, such as 2-chloroprocaine, is rapidly metabolized, and placental transfer is limited. Since the metabolism of 2-chloroprocaine by fetal plasma is slower than in maternal plasma, the potential for ion trapping exists. Fetal pH is slightly lower than maternal (7.32 to 7.38), thus most unionized drugs are "ion trapped" to a degree, even in a healthy fetus. Chloroprocaine (pKa 8.7) is the drug of choice for epidural analgesia and a decompensating fetus, because it does not participate in ion trapping. Placental transfer of 2-chloroprocaine is not influenced by fetal acidosis.
The in vitro half-life of chloroprocaine is 21 seconds for maternal and 43 seconds for fetal blood. In patients who are homozygous atypical for plasma cholinesterase, chloroprocaine typically exists for two minutes in circulation.
Synthesis
The hydrochloride salt of 4-amino-2-chlorobenzoyl chloride is made by the reaction of 2-chloro-4-aminobenzoic acid with thionyl chloride. Synthesis of this drug is then accomplished by directly reacting the product of the last step with the hydrochloride salt of 2-diethylaminoethanol.

Vaughan Glacier () is a tributary glacier, 10 nautical miles (18 km) long, draining eastward from Mount Vaughan to enter Scott Glacier just south of Taylor Ridge, in the Hays Mountains of the Queen Maud Mountains. It was mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from surveys and U.S. Navy air photos, 1960–64, and was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) in association with Mount Vaughan.
The glacier is located north of Citadel Peak.

The brown-fronted woodpecker (Dendrocoptes auriceps) is a species of bird in the family Picidae. It ranges across the northern regions of the Indian subcontinent, primarily the lower-to-middle altitudes of the Himalayas. It is found in Afghanistan, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Bhutan.
Some taxonomic authorities continue to place the species in Dendrocopos, while others place it genus Leiopicus.
Habitat
Its natural habitats are temperate forests and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests.

The District of the Lower Silesia, also designated as the 2st District, was a district that acted as an provisional administrative division of Poland, during the administration of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland in 1945, and the Provisional Government of National Unity from 1945 to 1946. It was centered around the area of the Lower Silesia. It was established as one of four provisional districts on 14 March 1945. On 25 September 1945, the territories near its northern border were incorporated into the Poznań Voivodeship. It existed until 28 June 1946, when it was abolished and replaced with the Wrocław Voivodeship. The head of the district was the attorney-in-fact Stanisław Piaskowski.

The common flameback (Dinopium javanense), also referred to as the common goldenback, is a small (28–30 cm), three-toed woodpecker in the family Picidae, found throughout South and Southeast Asia.
Taxonomy
The common flameback is closely related with almost all members of the Dinopium species, which include 4 other species; the Himalayan flameback (D. shorii), the spot-throated flameback (D. everetti), the black-rumped flameback (D. benghalense), and the red-backed flameback (D. psarodes). The olive-backed woodpecker (Gecinulus rafflesii) was formerly classified in Dinopium but is more closely related to the pale-headed woodpecker (Gecinulus grantia), and was thus reclassified into Gecinulus.
The common flameback is most closely related to the Himalayan flameback and the spot-throated flameback, even being lumped with the spot-throated flameback until recently. These two species differ in the degree of spottiness, as despite their names, the common flameback has a higher degree of spotting on the upper breast than the plain upper breast of spot-throated flameback. Additionally, the common flameback shares a unique morphological feature with two other woodpeckers, this being the highly developed protractor pterygoidei muscle, which is also present in the olive-backed woodpecker and surprisingly, the maroon woodpecker (Blythipicus rubiginosus). Whether this shared morphology is due to species relatedness or convergent evolution is unknown, as the olive-backed woodpecker has been removed from the Dinopium genus and the maroon woodpecker belongs to an entirely different genus but may be closer related to Dinopium than previously thought.
Subspecies
There are six subspecies currently recognized:
Dinopium javanense javanense - native to peninsular Thailand south to Sumatra, including Riau Archipelago, and western Java
Dinopium javanense malabaricum - native to southwest India
Dinopium javanense intermedium - the largest of the subspecies (weighing 79–100 g) and native to Bangladesh, eastern Myanmar and southern China (southwest Yunnan province)
Dinopium javanense borneonense - native to Borneo, except for northeast Borneo
Dinopium javanense raveni - native to northeast Borneo and offshore islets
Dinopium javanense exsul - native to eastern Java and Bali
Habitat and distribution
As shy and secretive birds, common flamebacks are unlikely to be found in urban areas. They live in a variety of habitats, ranging from moist open forests, to scrubs, and mangroves. Although they generally enjoy lowlands, they can reach altitudes of 1700m above sea level in India and in those cases prefer living in pine forests.
Their distribution ranges across Southeast Asia, from the Western Ghats in India to the Indochinese peninsula and several of the Greater Sunda Islands.
Description
Males and females differ in the crest colour, as males have a bright red crest while females have a black crest with white streaks. Both sexes have a white supercilium, white cheek stripe, and white throat area, all separated by stripes of black, and they have a spotted black and white underside. The bird is distinguishable from other similar golden-backed woodpeckers, such as the greater flameback (Chrysocolaptes guttacristatus), by its smaller bill and black nape, and from the black-rumped flameback by its red rump and white throat. It's loud, high-pitched call, which resembles a series of "kow-kowp" rattles is incredibly similar to the greater flameback's call, and is the best way to distinguish the common flameback from the Himalayan flameback, which is a nearly identical bird.
Behaviour
Vocalizations
The common flameback is a relatively quiet species, who rarely produces noise despite being able to produce many different sounds. Although it belongs to the woodpecker family, it surprisingly rarely drums on wood, as it has a different foraging behaviour. There have been instances of soft and low nest drumming, during which the male softly tapped their nest with their beak while also raising their crest. This action may be in response to the researcher's persistent presence near the nest, as the drum timing and low level of aggression does not point to it being a mating display.
The common flameback has a variety of different vocalizations it makes. The first notable one being the “wicka call', which lasts about four seconds in duration and can be uttered by one or both of the birds in a pair. It consists of three kinds of notes; a vertical, inverted U-shaped note, a slow dropping note, and a short, inverted V-shaped note. Another vocalization is the “kow call”, which consists of a single or double, non-harmonic note. The “kowp call” appears to be a more complex version of the “kow call”, as it consists of a variety of modified or unmodified “kow call” notes. This call is mainly heard while the bird is taking of, flying, or landing, which indicates that this is an alarm call to warn other birds of a potential threat. The final call is the “rattle call”, which is usually heard following the “kowp call”. It is a call with varying length, consisting of a fast series of 17-57 notes lasting anywhere from 0.72 to 2.56 seconds.
Diet and foraging behaviours
The foraging methods of the common flameback are diverse, but generally there is little to no “wood pecking” involved. There has been evidence of them hammering at young trees to shed the bark, however this action is rarely observed. As their beak is relatively small, they are more adapted to a gleaning and probing foraging method, which produces no noise by the species. Their movements are abrupt, as they remain motionless and quiet for long periods of time before lurching and rapidly pecking at passing insects. As strict insectivores, their main diet consists of mainly ants as those are the most prevalent, however they are known to hawk slow-flying insects out of the air and glean other tree-crawling invertebrates. The odd foot morphology allows them to hop quickly and effectively, as their three toes allow for a large range of movement. As they hop around the trees, they maintain two toes in front and one in the back, however, when they are resting they group all three toes together in the front. Additionally, the sexes usually forage on different trees, maintaining vocal and visual contact. If one bird lands near another, they move apart to opposite sides of the tree and display some “peeking” behaviour, as well as some crest raising, which is observed in both sexes.
Reproduction
There is a limited amount of information on the reproduction and mating of the common flameback. Some accounts describe that there are no displays during copulation, other than a raised crest from the male as they mount the female. Other accounts state that there is a short mating display, which consists of crest-raising from both sexes, bowing movements, head swinging, and even males courtship feeding the females. They nest in holes in fruit trees, coconut palms or stumps of those tree varieties, and have 2 or 3 egg clutch sizes.

AMVJ Basketball, commonly known as AMVJ Amsterdam or AMVJ, is a Dutch basketball club from Amsterdam, part of the major multi-sport club AMVJ (Algemene Maatschappij Voor Jongeren / in English: General Society For Youth).
History
AMVJ, as an association is called simply stands for General Society For Youth and the Dutch branch of the international Young People's Christian Association, better known as the YMCA.
When AMVJ in 1928 the decision was given on the building on the Leidsebosje, Mr. H. invited Rooswinkel an Englishman Lew Lake, a member of the London Central YMCA, to introduce into the Basketball AMVJ building among its members.
Basketball hit and developed within AMVJ. In addition to the sporting and cultural activities that the omni-association AMVJ were already enjoying, founded the AMVJ-Basketball Division in 1930. Under the leadership of Dick Schmüll, when still a student physical education teacher and later was trained hard.
The first games were played were immediately at the international level against YMCA teams from London and Brussels.
Meanwhile AMVJ received in their room several netball associations to acquaint them with the basketball sport. Thus it happened that from netball associations as DTV, Rohda and DED basketball clubs were established.
In 1938, there were plenty of teams in Amsterdam to launch a competition. The Amsterdam Basketball Association (ABB) was founded. Several teams in Amsterdam and in particular the AMVJ teams played exhibition matches in various cities in the Netherlands and as it spread slowly basketball across the country. AMVJ is truly the cradle of playing basketball Netherlands.
Until well into the sixties, the highest league in the Netherlands consisted mainly of Amsterdam teams. AMVJ did eagerly participate in the collection of land titles. The men's team were champions in 1949, 1951, 1955 and the women's then took the flag about in 1961, 1965, 1967, 1968 and 1970 champion to be.
With the advent of several experts in sports (especially from the United States) is AMVJ in basketball which disappeared from the highest treetje. Yet AMVJ has always asserted know to blow with the ladies long Eredivisie level and gentlemen to two years into the national top.
All in all AMVJ so the first Dutch basketball association, delivered the first coach (Dick Schmüll) and has spent years with their Lew-Lake tournament and other activities contributed to the promotion and further spread of basketball in the Netherlands.

Artisten (aka Harry Piel's 100. film or Prince of the arena) is a German circus movie from 1934 to 1935 starring Susi Lanner, Hans Junkermann, Hilde Hildebrand and Harry Piel, who also acted as director. The screenplay was written by Max W. Kimmich after the silent movie The secret of the circus Barré.
Plot
The famous artist Harry Peters works on their new vaudeville act at the "Tivoli" music hall.  They are assisted by Hella Stoll, who is their foster daughter since their parents, friends of Harry, died years ago. At the premiere of their new act, Harry surprisingly meets their old friend Franz Hofer from Vienna, an agent who also knew Hella as a child. They recognize immediately that the little girl from the past has turned into a pretty young lady who is deeply in love with their foster father. Harry themselves seems to be quite unaware of that. Instead, they find themselves stalked by beautiful Vera Leander, who follows them everywhere. After much hesitation, Harry is so trapped by them that they not only disregards their job, but also neglects Hella. But after a nearly fatal accident during a dangerous showact, they come to their senses again and wants to return to Hella. When they recognize that they have disappeared from the music hall, they suspect they have run away with a magician called Morelli. Furiously, they start looking for them. They finally find Morelli backstage, just dyeing their hair. To Harry's surprise, the magician turns out to be a certain Baraloff, the business manager of circus Stoll, the travelling circus that belonged to Hella's parents. They had at that time run away after stealing all the money, and the following alarmus and excursions had finally led to the fatal accident of Hella's parents. Now they can be arrested at last. Harry hands them over to the police and goes on looking for their foster daughter. Finally, they find them at Hofer's flat, where they talk things out and in the end become a couple.
Shooting
The film was produced within three weeks, from 7 December 1934, to the end of the month by the Berlin Ariel film company. Most interiors were shot at the company's studios in Berlin-Johannisthal, while the location shots were produced in Dresden and Berlin. In Dresden, Harry Peel had rented the giant building of the former circus Sarrasani. Parts of the scenes shot there were filmed publicly, and drew a big audience. The money that was collected this way was given to the Winterhilfswerk. Later on, the shooting was completed at circus Busch in Berlin. The final movie passed censorship on 1 March 1935 and made its debut on 12 March. It was awarded "artificially valuable" by film checkers of the propaganda ministry. Whether it has been banned after the downfall of the Third Reich, is quite unknown. In 1963, it was developed via DFF, the TV programme of the German Democratic Republic. Nine years later, in 1972, another TV version was broadcast by the West German ZDF.

Dudley Museum and Art Gallery was a public museum and art gallery located in the town centre of Dudley in the West Midlands, England. It was opened in 1883, situated within buildings on St James's Road, and remained at that site until its closure in 2016. Some of the museum collections have since been relocated to the Dudley Archives centre on Tipton Road.
History
The building was originally planned as a Free Library and School of Art by Dudley Borough Council. The foundation stone was laid on 3 July 1883 by Earl Beauchamp, the Lord Lieutenant of Worcestershire. Although an art gallery was included in the design, it did not open for another five years; the gallery was officially opened on 1 August 1888 by Mayor of Dudley Benjamin Hingley.
In 1906, Dudley Council entered an agreement with the Dudley Geographical Society to take over their collection of fossils and other materials with a view to displaying them in a museum in the town. In 1911, it was announced that this collection had been installed in what had been the lending department of the Free Library with a view of displaying it to the public in 1912.
The Brooke Robinson collection, bequeathed to the town by former MP and coroner for Dudley, Brooke Robinson, and originally kept in a purpose built room in the nearby town hall, was moved to the museum in 1979.
Closure and movement of collection
The Museum and Art Gallery was closed by Dudley Council on 22 December 2016 as part of cost-cutting efforts. A portion of the museum collection was later moved to the Dudley Archives centre on Tipton Road, under the name 'Dudley Museum at The Archives', opening to the public in September 2017. The new facility also houses the organisational headquarters of the aspiring Black Country Geopark, a project organised by local councils in an attempt to achieve UNESCO Geopark status for the region's geological heritage.
Permanent exhibitions
Geology
The geology exhibits were the 'most important collection' at the museum and were drawn from a collection of approximately 15,000 fossils from the local area including nearby Wren's Nest hill and Wren's Nest. The two geology exhibits are 'Dudley Unearthed' and 'Fantastic Fossils'.
The 'Dudley Unearthed' area contained a set of interpretative displays that related the geology of the area to the history of the industrial revolution, with regularly changing features on the geology of both the local area and the rest of the world, including information on Dudley Volcano. Fossils formed by the eruption of the volcano around 315 million years ago are also on display.
'Fantastic Fossils' showcased Silurian and Carboniferous fossils, with examples of fossilised corals and shellfish, Crinoids, Gastropods, Trilobites, Cephalopods, worm tubes and fossilised specimens from the forest canopy and ground covering and primitive plants.
Return of the Dinosaurs
'Return of the Dinosaurs' opened in 2007 and was distinguished by several large models of various species of dinosaurs, including Baryonyx and one of the earliest dinosaurs, Thecodontosaurus.
The Brooke Robinson Museum
In 1911, local MP Brooke Robinson bequeathed their collection of paintings, furniture, ceramics, enamels and medals to Dudley. The objects were on display in a dedicated room in the museum which contained a miscellaneous collection of 17th, 18th and 19th century British and European paintings, furniture and ceramics, together with oriental ceramics, Japanese netsuke and inro, Bilston enamels, commemorative medals, Greek, Roman and Egyptian pottery and personal memorabilia relating to Brooke Robinson and their two wives.
Duncan Edwards and local heroes
The room featured a great deal of memorabilia connected to local football legend and Busby Babe Duncan Edwards, who was born in the town in 1936, and won two Football League title medals with Manchester United and was capped 18 times by the England national football team until they died from injuries sustained in the Munich air disaster in February 1958, when still only 21. There were plans to introduce other local sporting heroes.
Fine art collection
The museum also held a large collection of fine art, including oil paintings, watercolours, and prints, which were rotated in and out of display. Among these were works by local artist Percy Shakespeare.

Snake 'n' Bacon is a comic book and cartoon duo created by American cartoonist and illustrator Michael Kupperman (also known by their pseudonym P. Revess). Originally only in print comics, the characters were brought to television on May 10, 2008, when they were broadcast on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block in a Snake 'n' Bacon animated show, but after its pilot the show was not picked up by Cartoon Network for Adult Swim. The Tales Designed to Thrizzle, Vol. 1 collection was published in 2009 by Fantagraphics.
Characters
The characters in the comics were a parody of popular comedy teams. One of the characters is a snake, while the other is a strip of bacon. Other characters in the comic were Criminal District Attorney and Underpants-On-His-Head-Man. Utterances by Snake and Bacon are limited to hissing (on Snake's part) and making bacon-related comments (on Bacon's part) such as "I'm real bacon" and advice such as "Wrap your dog's pill in me." Still, their communications are filled with sexual innuendos.
The characters "highlight what is perhaps Kupperman's greatest comedic skillthe ability to sell surreal ideas in the most serious way possible, highlighting the humor all the more vividly," according to one reviewer. Kupperman did cartoons for Robert Smigel's TV Funhouse TV series before returning to comic book making with a series for Fantagraphics called Tales Designed to Thrizzle, using many of the characters from Snake 'n' Bacon (including the titular pair) and new characters, such as Hercules ("the public domain superhero") and The Mannister, a man who can transform themselves into the shape of a banister.
When the cartoon came to television, it combined animated and live-action sequences, with the help of such people as James Urbaniak ("Bacon"), Dan Bakkedahl, Bill Hader, David Rakoff, Kristen Schaal, Peter Serafinowicz, and Brian Stack. It was followed on the Cartoon Network schedule by "a spiritual cousin," the British comedy The Mighty Boosh.
Influences and comedic approach
Kupperman has created several memorable cartoon characters, written for DC Comics, and has been influenced by absurdity and surrealism. Kupperman is said to use absurdist humor that includes straightforward jokes, pointing out through humor the absurdities of the past that just weren't visible to readers at the time, mimicking "silly" directions people put in books about how to use them, and putting famous people in silly situations.
Pilot summary
The title of this episode is "Psst! Wanna See a Crime Scene?" After being woken up by The Green Fairy (Kristen Schaal) in the cold opening Snake and Bacon (Tim Lagasse) visit a crime scene were a murder took place. Later, a detective (Dan Bakkedahl) shows Snake and Bacon all of the evidence from the scene, as collected by the Police Vac. After examining the evidence, Snake discovers that the murderer was hiding underneath a penny; Snake and Bacon are ordered to attack the murderer, who appears to admire them. Later, the district attorney (David Rakoff) congratulates them for their achievement. It's at this moment Snake has a realization that the district attorney has been flying above them and spying on them the whole time.

The Laird Baby Biplane was the second aircraft built by Matty Laird in the United States of America.
Design and development
The Baby Biplane was built by Laird at the age of 16, with assistance from their brother Charles.
The Baby Biplane was a single-seat biplane made of wood with aircraft fabric covering, having conventional landing gear. Later the aircraft was covered with Irish Linen and French cellulose-nitrate dope.
Operational history
Laird operated from Chicago's Cicero field. A self-taught pilot, their first flight resulted in the aircraft flipping over after becoming airborne. Over time, the aircraft flew up to 30 minutes at a time. The instrument panel consisted of a pocket watch, used to time the fuel supply.
Aircraft on display
A replica of the Baby Biplane was built by Dean Tilton and donated to the Florida Air Museum in Lakeland, Florida, United States.

Moving Violations is a 1985 comedy film based around a traffic school. Directed by Neal Israel, the film stars John Murray, Jennifer Tilly, Brian Backer, Sally Kellerman, Nedra Volz, Clara Peller, Wendie Jo Sperber, Fred Willard, and the film debut of Don Cheadle.
Synopsis
The film follows a group of people in Birch County, California (a fictionalized city/county that is similar to real-life Los Angeles) who, after being ticketed for numerous traffic violations (and hence losing their drivers' licenses, and vehicles to impounding), are ordered by Judge Nedra Henderson (Sally Kellerman) to attend a driving course to get their licenses and their vehicles back. However, the assigned teacher for this course, Deputy Henry "Hank" Halik (James Keach), is conspiring with the judge to execute a plan to ensure these offenders fail miserably, at all costs, so the corrupt duo can sell their impounded vehicles for their own personal gain. Clues lead one of the traffic offenders, landscaper Dana Cannon (John Murray), to discover their scheme, and they enlist their fellow students to help them stop it.

Production
Writer and director Israel themselves attended traffic school after having been pulled over by a police officer, for doing an illegal U turn:
"I made the mistake of arguing, and that was very foolish because the cop called in and found I had 13 tickets outstanding. Plus, I had one moving violation that I'd never settled. I went right to jail and did not collect $200. They put me in a cell with an arsonist. They had just blown somebody up. It was a very unsettling experience. I went to traffic school for a very long time, and I had to go to a whole lot of different courts with different jurisdictions. It was a real hassle. So, I suggested the idea of the film to Joe Roth, our producer, and they had just been to traffic school, too, so they thought it was great."
However they say "Traffic school is boring ... I interviewed a lot of people, including a man who owned a traffic school, but all their stories were boring. So, we made up everything."
Robert Conrad appeared in the film, unbilled, as a favor to Pat Proft, who was an old friend. A spokesperson from the studio said, "We'd describe it as an uncredited star turn. It's no different from Robert de Niro in Brazil or Darren McGavin's part in The Natural, neither of which was mentioned in the credits."
Reception
The film was reviewed poorly by Janet Maslin at The New York Times, who described it as an "especially weak teen-age comedy, even by today's none-too-high standards." In a later appraisal, David Nusair of Reelfilm.com wrote that Moving Violations contains "enough laughs to be had here to warrant a mild recommendation."
