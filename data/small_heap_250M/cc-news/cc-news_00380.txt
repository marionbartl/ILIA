Vancouver, British Columbia — A female stunt driver has died after a motorcycle crash on a set for the movie “Deadpool 2” in downtown Vancouver, police said Monday.
The driver's name was not immediately released.
Witness Sharmina Kermalli said she had just walked into a Starbucks next door to where the accident happened when she heard a loud crash. She ran out of the coffee shop and saw glass still falling on the body of the woman.
A crumpled motorcycle was seen lying on its side at the location of the accident near Vancouver's waterfront.
Police said officers were at the scene and investigators with WorkSafeBC, the provincial workplace safety agency, were also looking into the crash.
“We are deeply saddened by the accident that occurred on the set of ‘Deadpool 2' this morning. Our hearts and prayers are with the family, friends and colleagues of our crew member during this difficult time,” said a spokesman for 20th Century Fox.
Deadpool, a Marvel Comics superhero, is played by Vancouver-born actor Ryan Reynolds.
Another stuntman was fatally injured last month during production of “The Walking Dead” when he fell head-first onto concrete about 22 feet (7 meters) below after appearing to try to grab a railing to stop his fall.

Ride-hailing giant Uber is in talks over a possible merger with the Middle East rival Careem, according to Bloomberg — citing three people familiar with the matter.
The report suggests various deal structures have been discussed, although it also says that no deal has been reached — nor may ever be reached, as discussions are ongoing and may not come to anything.
Bloomberg's sources told it that Uber has said it would need to own more than half of the combined company, if not buy Careem outright.
Among the possible arrangements that have been discussed are for Careem's current leaders to manage a new combined business, day to day, with potentially both brands being retained in local markets.
Another proposal would have Uber outright acquire Careem.
Bloomberg also reports that Dubai-based Careem is in talks with investors to raise $500 million, which it says could value the ride-hailing company at about $1.5BN. Careem is said to have held early talks with banks about a potential IPO in January.
Neither company has publicly confirmed any talks.
An Uber spokesman declined to comment when asked to confirm or deny talks with Careem.
While a Careem spokeswoman, Maha Abouelenein, told us: “We do not comment on rumors. Our focus remains to build the leading internet platform for the region, from the region. That means expanding to new markets and doubling down on our existing markets by adding new products and services to the platform. We are only getting started.”
Uber has been reconfiguring its global business for several years now, pulling out of South East Asia earlier this year after agreeing to sell its business to local rival Grab — while also taking a minority stake in the competitor.
And Uber did a similar exit deal with another rival — Didi — in China back in 2016.
Last year it also threw its lot in with Yandex.Taxi in Russia, with the pair combining efforts via a joint venture — albeit one which gave Yandex the majority share.
But Uber has been talking up its position and potential in the Middle East — with CEO Dara Khosrowshahi telling a conference in May that he believes it can be the “winning player” in the market, as well as in India and Africa, and vowing it would “control our own destiny” in those markets.
That does not necessary take a Careem-Uber deal off the table, of course, though the (public) claim from Uber is that it's not willing to settle for a minority stake in the region, as it has elsewhere.
Responding in April to a question from CNBC about whether it might acquire Careem, Uber's COO Barney Harford ruled out doing any more transactions for minority stakes, saying: “It would be crazy for us as a hypergrowth company to not engage in conversations about potential partnerships. But we've been very clear, the markets that we remain in today are core markets for us.”
Harford also claimed Uber was positioned to be able to invest in its chosen growth markets on “an indefinite basis”, thanks to having reached profitability in other markets. It's also targeting 2019 for an IPO.
In March the Financial Times reported that Uber was in talks with Indian rival Ola over another possible merger — and the newspaper's sources poured cold water on the notion of Uber taking a minority stake there too.
Of course Uber may not want to have to shrink It's already retrenched global ambitions. But it may have to if it gets out-competed in its chosen plum markets.
Hence Careem's chest-puffing talk about just getting started — provided it can convince its investors to screw their courage to the sticking place and stay on board for the ride.
Investors in Careem, which closed a $500M Series E round a year ago at a $1BN+ valuation, include Saudi-based VC Kingdom Holding, German automaker Daimler, and Japanese tech giant Rakuten — which reportedly led the Series E.
Oskar Mielczarek de la Miel, a managing partner at Rakuten Capital who leads on its mobility investments and is also a Careem board member, declined to comment on the rumors of Uber-Careem merger talks when we asked to chat.
But he was happy to talk up the broader opportunity that investors seen coming down the road for ridesharing, telling us: “If you look at the industry everyone is talking to everyone, and while consolidation is an obvious trend, it won't be limited to the ridesharing players but draw other tech companies, OEMs and payment companies, to name a few.”
According to Careem's website, the ride-hailing firm operates in 15 countries, mostly (but not only) across the Middle East, offering its services in around 80 cities in all.
While Uber's website lists it being active in 15 cities in the Middle East and 15 in Africa.
Liam Gallagher was "drinking too much" after Oasis split.
The 45-year-old singer admitted that he went off the rails for a while in between the band's split in 2009 - after a furious bust-up between Liam and his brother Noel - and his current comeback as a solo artist.
He told USA Today: "A lot of personal stuff was going on. I was drinking too much. Then I thought, "You know what? I'm gonna go live in Spain, get me head together and get some sun on me bones.'"
And Liam revealed his comeback with his new album 'As You Were' was not influenced by a desire to recapture his fame but he simply wanted to get back to making music again.
He said: "I didn't go, 'I just wrote a song because I'm not famous anymore and I must get back to the top of the charts' There's none of that nonsense. I don't need to get any more famous. God, no. I didn't miss it terribly. I just wanted the universe to plow me some songs, which it did. If you're good to rock 'n' roll, it'll be good to you. And I've been good to rock 'n' roll."
Liam was the frontman in his and Noel's former band and while Noel has also gone on to find solo success, Liam claimed is not impressed with his 50-year-old brother's voice.
Speaking about his own voice, he said: "I should have taken better care of it. But I'm a snarly rock 'n' roll singer. You don't want to start watering it down because you'll end up sounding like Noel Gallagher. And we don't want that."
Meanwhile, Liam recently admitted he misses being in a band with his brother.
He said: "I would prefer to be in a band, and we should never ever have split up, but I'm certainly not yearning for it, you know what I mean? I was - I needed it four years ago, but I certainly don't f***ing need it now. I prefer to be in a band - one that makes the same kind of racket as Oasis. I miss being in a band with my brother. But it's not happening."
Big news outlets stupidly sold their soul to Facebook. Desperate for the referral traffic Facebook dangled, they spent the past few years jumping through its hoops only to be cut out of the equation. Instead of developing an owned audience of homepage visitors and newsletter subscribers, they let Facebook brainwash readers into thinking it was their source of information.
Now Facebook is pushing into local news, but publishers should be wary of making the same crooked deal. It might provide more exposure and traffic for smaller outlets today, but it could teach users they only need to visit Facebook for local news in the future. Here's how Facebook retrained us over the past 12 years to drain the dollars out of news.
Users first is Facebook first later
To be clear, Facebook's intention, that I believe to be earnest, is to foster stronger ties between its users and their communities to boost well-being. But that doesn't mean ripple effects are positive. The critical lens through which to view all of Facebook's strategy is that in the short term it puts users first, itself second and everyone else a distant, distant third. That includes developers, advertisers and definitely news publishers.
This strategy is actually self-serving in the long term, though, because Facebook only continues to dominate because its users don't leave. Back in 2010, Facebook decimated the virality of game developers like Zynga, which made lots of money because their News Feed spam threatened to push people away from the social network. That short-term hit to the bottom line paved the way for the depth of engagement that fuels quarters where Facebook earns $4 billion today.
This explains CEO Mark Zuckerberg's recent announcement that Facebook would make changes to enhance well-being even if it decreased time spent on the site or its ad revenue. Those consequences may be true in the short term. But it's a shrewd tactic when you zoom out. Left unchecked, the “Time Well Spent” movement could metastasize into a “Time to leave Facebook” movement. Better to trade away a few minutes per day per user now to keep those users for years to come.
Retraining newsreaders
When Facebook started, there was no feed. You browsed from profile to check up on friends. News Feed's launch in 2006 retrained users to just go to the Facebook home page where everything would come to you. Brands followed, investing to build an audience through Facebook's churning stream of content.
As Facebook's users shifted from PCs and Macs to Androids and iPhones, the company struck upon an enduring format for mobile. Desktop computers had big enough screens to accomodate multiple windows, and switching between browser tabs was quick, allowing users to easily hop between different sites. But on mobile with tiny screens, low quality app, poor connections, slow-loading sites, people seized upon Facebook's single app that pulled together content from everywhere. Facebook began to train us to keep scrolling rather than struggle to bounce around.
In 2011, when Facebook first took notice of Twitter, it launched its public figure Subscribe feature and news links gained more visibility in the feed. By 2014, “Facebook the big news machine” was in full swing with Trending, hashtags and news outlets pouring resources into growing their Pages. Emphasizing the “news” in News Feed retrained users to wait for the big world-changing headlines to come to them rather than crisscrossing the home pages of various publishers. Many don't even click-through, getting the gist of the news just from the headline and preview blurb. Advertisers followed the eyeballs, moving their spend from the publisher sites to Facebook.
In 2015, Facebook realized users hated waiting for slow mobile websites to load, so it launched Instant Articles to host publisher content within its own app. Instant Articles trained users not to even visit news sites when they clicked their links, instead only having the patience for a fast-loading native page stripped of the publisher's identity and many of their recirculation and monetization opportunities. Advertisers followed, as publishers allowed Facebook to sell the ads on Instant Articles for them and thereby surrendered their advertiser relationships at the same time as their reader relationships.
This is how Facebook turns publishers into ghostwriters, a problem I blew the whistle on in 2015. Publishers are pitted against each other as they make interchangeable “dumb content” for Facebook's “smart pipes.” Publishers wisely began pushing back, demanding more layout and monetization flexibility, and many abandoned the platform in favor of Google's less prescriptive AMP format for fast-loading mobile pages.
Still, publishers have few major sources of traffic outside of Facebook and Google Search. With the death of Google Reader and Twitter's move to an algorithmic feed, there's still no at-scale, unfiltered place to share or follow news.
Meanwhile, Facebook's only goal remains to provide value to users, and when it comes to content, it doesn't really care which publisher provides it as long as it's high-quality.
Siphoning resources to the center
Again and again, Facebook has centralized attention typically spread across the web. A few years back I wrote about “20 New Ways Facebook Is Eating The Internet,” and its appetite has only grown. It's trying to do the same with Watch (YouTube), Marketplace (Craigslist and eBay) and many other features. It's a smart plan that ends up arguably improving the experience for individual users — or at least offering new options while making Facebook more essential and much richer.
The problem is that for society as a whole, this leads to a demonetization and eventual defunding of some news publishers, content creators and utility providers while simultaneously making them heavily reliant on Facebook. This gives Facebook the power to decide what types of content, what topics, and what sources are important. Even if Facebook believes itself to be a neutral tech platform, it implicitly plays the role of media company as its values define the feed. Having a single editor's fallible algorithms determine the news consumption of the wired world is a precarious situation.
The business side is just as troubling. As Ben Thompson of Stratechery has described, advertisers are abandoning news sites and aggregating to Facebook where they can more efficiently target their exact customers, where they go every day. Why advertise on an intermediary news site when businesses can go straight to well of attention. Without the massive scale and adtech, individual publishers can't compete for dollars.
But if they resist working with Facebook and providing their content there, another publisher will happily bring the same stories to the social network in return for the short-term traffic boost. There's always someone else willing to offer up dumb content to the smart pipe.
Steamrolled by strategy change
And the real problem only manifests when Facebook shifts directions. Its comes to the conclusion that users want to see more video, so the format gets more visibility in the News Feed. Soon, publishers scramble to pivot to video, hiring teams and buying expensive equipment so they can blast the content on Facebook rather than thinking about their loyal site visitors. But then Facebook decides too much passive video is bad for you or isn't interesting, so its News Feed visibility is curtailed, and publishers have wasted their resources and time chasing a white rabbit… or, in this case, a blue one.
This happened to Page tab apps like musician profile provider BandPage, which was the No. 2 app on Facebook until Facebook banned default landing tabs. The startup lost 90 percent of its traffic after wasting years chasing Facebook's changes, and eventually sold for $8 million after raising $27 million. Open Graph newsreader apps met the same fate, built by publishers to meet the opportunity of Facebook's short-lived Ticker and “Josh read [clickbait article] on Washington Post Social Reader” stories.
Publishers are currently caught amidst of another massive Facebook strategy change. It's now striving to offset Russian election interference, fake news for profit, allegations of political bias, polarized society, the explosion of viral video, the absence of friends, and fears that too much scrolling hurts our well-being. That's led to Facebook proclaiming it will remove 20% of news from the News Feed as it prioritizes content that's not just meaningful, but stimulates meaningful interactions between users.
On this week's Q4 2017 earnings call, Zuckerberg said Facebook had already tweaked its algorithm to show fewer viral videos and optimize well-being. The result was a 50 million hours per day reduction in Facebook use, which translates to 2.14 minutes per daily user, or 5 percent of total time spent on Facebook. The company was willing to go so far as to make changes that led to its slowest ever user growth rate, and its first decline in total users anywhere as the U.S. & Canada region actually lost 700,000 Facebookers.
Yet it's the video makers and news publishers who will pay for this pivot of purpose. Facebook's revenue still reached a record $12.97 billion, and investors still boosted its share price higher. In fact, Facebook could actually earn money or at least break even from the “Time Well Spent” changes.
By decreasing total time spent but raising the quality of content people see, Facebook ends up with fewer total ad impressions but higher engagement rates as people are retrained to skip less of what they see. Advertisers still eager to reach its massive audience will compete in Facebook's ad auctions, paying higher prices. Facebook has the cash reserves and momentum to weather the short-term monetization drop in exchange for a healthier long-term future. Content creators are left trying to make ends meet.
Stay the course
And now local news site are facing the start of this dangerous cycle. Facebook says it will show more local news in the News Feed. It's testing a “Today in” local news digest in several cities. It's prioritizing content people discuss instead of passively consume. And Facebook is pushing its new mission to rebuild communities and Bring the World Closer Together that aligns with local news.
Sounds great, right? There's no doubt there's an opportunity here for local news outlets. But the key to keeping their boats afloat is not completely changing course to follow Facebook's siren call. Whether or not you think the company is purposefully trying to destroy the industries it invades or just modernize them to benefit users, publishers must meet Facebook with skepticism.
Facebook's next retraining appears to be that it's the best place to get local news, not your local newspaper or blog. It might happily display all the headlines with little encouragement for readers to click through, as it does with Today On. It might make images and videos load faster than they do on local sites. And they might bundle local news with Facebook Events and reviews of nearby places using personalization local sites can't match.
That might be good for the reader, and thereby for Facebook long term, but it's dangerous for the publishers. Facebook doesn't even have to purposefully poach advertisers from local sites, they'll just flow to it naturally as it becomes the local news destination.
They should still focus on turning occasional readers into repeat homepage visitors that bookmark the site and return frequently. They should track analytics about what kinds of stories those loyalists want, rather than the ones that might drive occasional traffic spikes of fly-by readers. They should invest in developing their own ad technology or partnering with more neutral third-party providers. And they should keep pushing email newsletter, event and subscription signups.
That's because there's no telling when Facebook's strategy around what users want or how to give it to them will change. Again, Facebook wants users to be informed and entertained, but it doesn't necessarily care how or by whom. And let's not forget that Facebook is quietly building up its Marketplace peer-to-peer selling feature in another part of its app to be the ultimate replacement for the classified ads that used to keep local news sites afloat.
Unfortunately, big, well-funded publishers staffed with true tech talent haven't been able to gracefully navigate the constantly changing playing field set by Facebook. So what hope to do smaller outlets without the technological or strategic prowess hope to have?
In Zuckerberg's hometown of Dobbs Ferry, NY, there's a beloved newspaper called The Rivertowns Enterprise. It's a destination for those seeking local news, with a loyal following for both its website and its weekly print edition, which many who grew up there get delivered to their homes around the country. Visit its site and you'll stumble across a variety of stories about city politics, high school sports and Main Street businesses that also advertise there.
But as Facebook turns its eyes toward local news as an answer to larger problems with well-being, false information and polarized communities, it also poses a threat to The Rivertowns Enterprise and outlets like it. The inevitable march of technological progress was merely accelerated by the dominant social network. But for now those publishers' best bet is to take a page from Facebook if they're going to survive: Put your own readers and your long-term viability first instead of gambling on short-lived favors.
NEW YORK DAILY NEWS – DAVID ZURAWIK
Bill O'Reilly's “The Spin Stops Here” tour stopped in Baltimore on Friday, and the former Fox News host played to thousands of empty seats at Royal Farms Arena.
Perhaps the best indication of the size of the crowd in relation to the hall is that 45 minutes before the show an usher came to me and about a dozen other ticket holders who were seated in the cheapest seats in the third level and gave us tickets to move down to level one — much closer to the stage.
Royal Farms declined a Baltimore Sun request for an official attendance figure. A spokeswoman for the arena also declined to answer questions about what capacity would be for the seating configuration used Friday night.
“We unfortunately do not give out this information,” she said in an email to The Sun.

Why mortgages rose so much
Mortgage rates rose as part of a sell-off in bond markets. According to conventional wisdom, investors dumped their bonds after the presidential election because they believe that Donald Trump will raise infrastructure spending and cut taxes. That would lead to bigger federal budget deficits.
"With Trump getting in, that brings in a lot of inflation fears and uncertainty that causes rates to go up," says Brian Koss, executive vice president of Mortgage Network.
Those of us who went to college in the 20th century were taught that federal budget deficits are inflationary and lead to higher interest rates. Apparently, a lot of bond traders went to college in the 20th century, because they sold bonds on the assumption that inflation is inevitable. When investors sold bonds, mortgage rates went up.
Those investors were jumping to conclusions. I'm not saying they're wrong; I'm saying it's too soon to know if they're right. They jumped to conclusions in two ways that I can think of:
The president isn't in charge of spending and taxes. Congress is. Who's going to get his way in the budget debate: Trump or House Speaker Paul Ryan?
Deficit spending doesn't always lead to higher interest rates. We had budget surpluses in the last half of the Clinton administration, and then George W. Bush brought back deficits. Under Bush, mortgage rates went down. The deficits got bigger under Barack Obama. Mortgage rates fell to record lows. Inflation was too low for the Federal Reserve's comfort.

What it means for housing
Higher mortgage rates will reduce demand for houses, right? We were taught that demand goes down when prices go up.
But the law of supply and demand doesn't have an iron grip on housing. You look for a home when you want to, and then you buy what you can afford, right? I mean, a lot of people buy their first homes when they start families. No one checks house prices and mortgage rates when deciding whether and when to have children.

"The lead-up to the election had no impact on home sales or demand; pent-up demand, historically low mortgage rates, relatively strong job creation and significant demographic tail winds created the best real estate market in a decade," says Jonathan Smoke, chief economist for Realtor.com.
He adds that a jump in mortgage rates could disrupt sales, but "we don't have a comparable period in history with good data to draw any sharper conclusions."
Elizabeth Rose, branch manager for Movement Mortgage, in Dallas, says: "I don't think this is bad news for housing at all. We can look back on history and see that people buy houses no matter what the interest rates are. The 1970s and 1980s are evidence of that."
She acknowledges that mortgage rates might affect some people's ability to buy. But she agrees with me that determined homebuyers will simply choose smaller houses or longer commutes in exchange for lower house prices. A lot of buyers won't even have to do that. Mortgage rates are in the 4 percent range. That's still low, and this rate increase doesn't affect affordability much.

You must go
When you cover the mortgage and real estate beat, you notice how inescapable the subject is. Case in point: A Tribe Called Quest's new album, "We Got It From Here … Thank You 4 Your service." The first two songs are about (among many other things) gentrification and environmental racism.
In "The Space Program," Q-Tip raps:
They'd rather lead us to the grayest water poison deadly smog
Mass un-blackening, it's happening, you feel it y'all?
Hey, ho, let's go
Speaking of A Tribe Called Quest, co-founder Phife Dawg died last spring, and New York renamed a crossroads after him. Malik "Phife Dawg" Taylor Way is the intersection of Linden Boulevard and 192nd Street in Queens, New York, near the spot where the group stood atop Nu-Clear Cleaners in their video for "Check the Rhime."
Fellow Queens musicians the Ramones also got an intersection named after them, too. Ramones Way is the intersection of 67th Avenue and 110th Street, right in front of Forest Hills High School, where the original members attended.

NHS trusts in England ended the last financial year with a combined deficit of £960m - more than £460m worse than planned - according to a report which reveals the state of hospital finances.
The report by the regulator NHS Improvement shows that some hospitals were able to improve their financial position while others sank into the red.
The deficit figure was released along with A&E performance figures which show 88.4 per cent of patients is seen in four hours at English hospitals, against a target of 95 per cent. The report also reveals that high demand on A&E caused an increase in the number of patients having to wait more than a year for planned treatment. Some 2,647 were waiting 12 months or more in March, compared to 1,513 a year earlier.
The overal deficit has improved since the end of 2015-16, when it stood at £2.45bn, NHS Improvement said.
NHS trusts in deficit included York Teaching Hospital, which missed out on payments from the national Sustainability and Transformation Fund (STF), which is dependent on meeting performance targets.
The York trust ended 2017-18 with a £24m deficit, around £27m worse than planned.
A trust spokesperson said: “Last year was the most financially challenging in our history. As a result of missing our control total, we did not qualify for receipt of the trust's share of the Sustainability Funding.
“One of the key pressures on our finances was staffing spend, and costs associated with filling vacant posts through agency and locum staff. Agency use remained high, and a number of decisions were made to strengthen staffing numbers in key areas in order to improve the safety of these services.” The report has been published after the Yorkshire Post revealed that hospitals were missing out on millions of pounds in performance-linked payments which included STF cash.
Among NHS organisation which benefited from the STF money was Leeds Teaching Hospitals, which ended the financial year with an £18.9m surplus.
Neighbouring Mid Yorkshire Hospitals Trust had a £20m deficit, around £17m worse than planned. Paula Sherriff, Labour's Dewsbury MP and shadow health minister, said: “Despite the best efforts of our hardworking NHS staff, this report is just the latest evidence to show that even as demand on services soars, our local hospital trusts are being systematically starved of the funding needed to deliver care.” The report also shows that at the end of the year, the NHS provider sector had 92,694 staff vacancies – an eight per cent vacancy rate. It included 35,794 nursing vacancies and 9,982 doctor vacancies. Providers filled most of the vacancies with temporary workers - but that led to £976m more being spent on NHS bank staff than planned.
Rising demand on hospitals saw more than 5.87m people go to A&E between January-March - more than 220,000 more than the same period last year.
Ian Dalton, Chief Executive of NHS Improvement, said: “Hundreds of thousands more patients have been to A&Es this year but the NHS did not buckle under the pressure.
“Despite epic challenges, NHS staff up and down the country displayed incredible resilience and saw more patients than ever before within four hours.”
DUBAI, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Stock markets in the Gulf that are most exposed to foreign funds were the chief losers in early trade on Sunday, taking their cue from global bourses, where the mood was soured last week by growing tensions between the United States and North Korea.
The Dubai index was down 0.5 percent as most shares fell, including commodities shipper Gulf Navigation, which was down 3.0 percent despite reporting a rise in second-quarter profit.
Shuaa Capital rose 0.8 percent, however, after it swung to a second-quarter net profit of 12.1 million dirhams ($3.3 million) from a loss of 50.8 million dirhams a year ago.
The investment firm said provisions for the period fell to 11 million dirhams from 57 million dirhams and that the regional expansion of its real estate and brokerage units are its "high priority" in the near term.
In Abu Dhabi, the index was down 0.5 percent, weighed down by declines in blue-chip banks; Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank fell 2.2 percent.
Qatar's index edged down 0.2 percent in very thin trade as 11 of the 20 most valuable companies declined. Qatar Investors Group was the worst performer, down 1.5 percent.
The Riyadh index was flat after 40 minutes of trade as 82 shares rose and 61 declined. Telecommunications firm Mobily was down 0.6 percent and its competitor Zain Saudi inched down 0.1 percent.
Local media reported that the telecommunications regulator and the Ministry of Commerce had closed one retail outlet from each company, and one of Saudi Telecom's outlets, because of issues related to compliance with rules on hiring sufficient numbers of Saudi citizens.
"Although closing these three branches will have a minor impact on sales, we believe it reflects CITC's (the regulator) commitment to improve the telecom industry in Saudi," said a research note by NCB Capital. (Reporting by Celine Aswad; Editing by Andrew Torchia and Alison Williams)

Despite the implementation of harm reduction measures and a province-wide state of emergency, drug users continue to die at an alarming rate in the Okanagan.
In Kelowna alone, fifty people have lost their lives in the first seven months of this year, compared to 47 in all of 2016.
Health officials say at this rate, the number of overdose deaths will likely double this year over last.
“That's very concerning for us and it shows that this crisis is not over,” said Chief Medical Health Officer, Dr. Trevor Corneil.
Paramedics in the Okanagan have responded to 1600 calls this year for suspected overdoses.
That is double the call volume compared to three years ago.
“Our crews are seeing substantial increases in the calls that they receive for opioid overdoses,” said paramedic Glenn Braithwaite.
Despite the operation of a mobile consumption site, thousands of cases of Naloxone distributed, and hundreds of referrals for treatment, Kelowna's death rate per capita exceeds that of Vancouver.
Corneil said stigmatization around drug use prevents professionals and parents from seeking help.
The majority of overdoses occur in private homes.
“We're really moving this year towards that hidden population looking at how we can reduce stigma for users,” he said.
Helen Jennens is a Kelowna woman who's lost two sons to drug overdoses.
Rian passed away in 2011 and Tyler, a father of two, died last year.
“We have his cell phone records and we could see he started looking for a dealer and had purchased in his mind heroin, and it was 100% fentanyl. There wasn't a grain of heroin in it,” she told Global News on Friday.
“We have to view this as a medical situation, not a moral failing.”
Jennens has turned her pain into passion and advocates for further government intervention to save lives.
She's part of a group called Moms Stop The Harm, which supports the distribution of clean heroin to addicts.
“Clean drugs can help prevent overdose deaths,” she said.
Corneil said he is in favour of the decriminalization of drug possession.
“One of the barriers is actually they fear the repercussions of being charged criminally.”
But Ottawa has said it has no plans to change Canada's drug laws, leaving some fearing the death toll will only continue to rise.
No one in the Global Okanagan Newsroom likes to drink mystery wine out of a brown paper bag more than our own Travis Lowe, so we sent him to get the Lowe Down on the Gold Medal Plates Mystery Wine Competition.
As Lowe finds out there's more to wine pairing then just adding cheese and there's more to cooking than just the correct application of heat.

“Marvin Gaye was a friend of mine, and he used to say, ‘Man, I wish I could sing like you, if I could have that growl in my voice,'” Edwards told the Tallahassee Democrat in 2013. “And I said, ‘Man, are you kidding me? I want to sing like you. Everybody wants to sing like you.' ”
While Edwards wasn't an original singer with the classic Temptations lineup — David Ruffin, Melvin Franklin, Eddie Kendricks, Paul Williams and Otis Williams — he was the official sixth member. It was his rough-and-tough signature voice that helped guide the Temptations through its funk-psychedelic period on classic tunes such as “Cloud Nine,” “Ball of Confusion (That's What the World is Today),” “Papa Was a Rollin' Stone” and “I Can't Get Next to You.” (“Cloud Nine” and “Papa Was a Rollin' Stone” were Grammy-winning songs.)
Edwards, who lived in the St. Louis area with his wife, Brenda Edwards, died in a hospital in Chicago. He had been in and out of hospitals since a May 2017 diagnosis, she said.
He was 74; he would have been 75 on Saturday.
ST. LOUIS, Mo.—Grammy-winning singer and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee Dennis Edwards, an unmistakable voice of classic Motown vocal group the Temptations, died Thursday of complications from meningitis, his family confirms.
The two met in 1965 when the Temptations and the Isley Brothers were working their way up in the music world, often performing shows together.
Ronald Isley of the Isley Brothers, a longtime friend of Edwards, called him “one of the greats. He had a gift, a talent, and he really sang. There aren't many people left with voices like his.”
The Temptations received a Lifetime Achievement Grammy in 2013 that Edwards received along with Otis Williams and survivors of the departed group members. The Temptations were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989.
Edwards, Isley and Aretha Franklin performed “A Song for You” together in 2011 in Cleveland at the 16th Annual Music Masters tribute concert honouring Franklin. It was one of Isley's last great memories with Edwards. “We had a ball,” he said. Franklin “asked about him every time I talked to her.”
Isley, who knew Edwards had been ailing, said, “We prayed for him and hoped he would get himself together and be able to come back. But he's with the Lord now.”
A number of other famous names paid tribute to Edwards, including Rev. Jesse Jackson, Kenny Rogers, Roland Martin and the Pointer Sisters (Edwards was briefly married to Ruth Pointer in 1977).
Erika Thomas said her father was loving, full of life and positivity, and was always complimentary of St. Louis, the city he adopted during the 1980s when he moved here to be closer to his mother. In his later years, he was often seen at the Fox Theatre and Peabody Opera House when classic soul artists passed through.
Edwards, born in Fairfield, Ala., in 1943, moved to Detroit as a boy. He sang in a gospel group and studied music at the Detroit Conservatory of Music before joining early Motown group the Contours in the 1960s. The Contours, best known for their 1962 hit “Do You Love Me” (recorded before Edwards joined them), opened for the Temptations; Edwards joined in 1968 as a replacement for his friend Ruffin.
“I had been hearing rumours about David and drugs and alcohol. One morning at 4 a.m., he knocked on my door. I said, ‘David it's 4 o'clock.' He said, ‘I'm leaving the Temptations, and they're gonna ask you to replace me.' ”
“I thought he was kidding,” Edwards said.
Edwards joined the Temptations just as the group, under the direction of the producer and songwriter Norman Whitfield, was developing a grittier sound, one largely influenced by the psychedelic soul of Sly & the Family Stone and very different from their earlier songs, like “My Girl” and “Ain't Too Proud to Beg.”
He said his time with the Temptations was amazing but also rocky. “I never imagined I'd be one of the last ones standing, me and Otis,” he said. “We really got caught up in the times, and how the heck did I make it? We dibbled and dabbled with alcohol and drugs. But it's important for people to know if you change your lifestyle and wake up, there is hope. I had a mother who prayed for me, and prayer changes everything.”
Williams fired Edwards in 1977, but he was in and out of the group for years to come.
Through it all, he focused on a solo career, scoring a huge hit with “Don't Look Any Further” featuring singer Siedah Garrett in 1984. The song received new life years later after rappers and singers heavily sampled its beat.
His solo career also included “(You're My) Aphrodisiac” and “Try a Little Tenderness.”
While touring as Dennis Edwards & the Temptations, Edwards ran into legal problems with his former group mate Williams and changed the group name to the Temptations Review.

Bristol stargazers are in for a treat this week as the skies light up in what's set to be a stunning astronomical display.
The annual Geminids meteor shower is set to peak in a matter of days, and it's expected to produce as many as 100 shooting stars per hour.
Astronomers consider the shower to be one of the best in the lunar calendar, this is because its meteors are bright and shoot across the skies quickly.
Last year, astrology fans were left disappointed when December's Supermoon washed out the Geminids, making its shower not as visible.
However, according to meteor experts timeanddate.com this year's shower is expected to have good viewing conditions.
Here is everything you need to know:
When will the Geminids meteor shower peak?
The Geminids meteor shower will peak on December 14 at around 2am. It is best to go outside, or stand in front of a window, at least 20 minutes before this time so that your eyes can adjust to the night sky.
Between this time the showers will be at their brightest and most visible.
How can I see it?
You won't need binoculars or a telescope to view the shower as these are designed to see objects that stand still as opposed to moving ones. The naked eye is best.
Moscow — Pint by frothy pint, a hoppy revolution is brewing in Russia.
This new generation of craft brewers began sprouting in the vodka capital of the world as foreign beers became too expensive and beer fans sought alternatives to mass-produced lagers. From juicy IPAs to velvety stouts and lip-smacking sours, beers served at breweries that opened in recent years in cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg offer visitors and locals alike the styles popularized in the last two decades by the craft beer boom in the U.S. and Europe.
Many breweries started after the currency collapse of 2014, when imported beer prices skyrocketed and supply fell.
“There was almost nothing being brought from outside,” said Alex Korobkov, co-owner of the Zagovor brewery and the RULE Taproom in central Moscow. “So people decided to brew something they had tried outside of Russia.”
Korobkov and a group of friends started Zagovor — which translates to “Conspiracy” in Russian — in 2014.
Today, there are over 100 craft breweries in Russia, said Nikita Filippov, co-founder of AF Brew in St. Petersburg, founded in 2012 and one of the craft beer pioneers in Russia. But Filippov said only around two dozen breweries have their own production capacities or long-term contractual base.
“If nothing dramatic happens in the Russian economics, hops and malt import policies, or beer restriction legislation, the future for craft beer in Russia is promising,” said Filippov.
All ingredients have to be imported — hops from the U.S. or Germany, grains from several European countries — and there are only a few facilities with the necessary equipment that serve as contract brewers.
Craft beer still represents a tiny segment of the beer market in Russia — around 1 percent, according to Dmitry Drobyshevsky, who runs the Russian beer trade news site Profibeer and analyzes the market.
Drobyshevsky said the market for Russian craft beers is expanding beyond its borders, to Europe and China.
“The Russian brewery Jaws (from Yekaterinburg) started selling beer in China in May,” he said. “Russian bars are starting to appear there, too.”
The surge in Russian craft beer is perfectly timed for the expected tourism bonanza when the country hosts the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Hundreds of thousands of foreign fans, many of them from the U.S. and Western Europe, will visit the 11 host cities.
And few things pair better with beer than soccer.
“They will find a country which is a million miles away from old stereotypes about Russia. They will find people who don't have vodka with caviar every meal but have the offer and knowledge in fine foods, fine spirits and craft beers,” said Filippov. “They will be greatly welcome to our country by a community of craft beer brewers and drinkers.”

Concerns have been expressed over new housing plans on the site of Hartlepool's hospital.
Regional property group Thirteen has been given £430,000 from a government fund to speed up home building on two sites in Hartlepool.
Keith Fisher
One is the Raby Estate project in Dyke House and the other is at the University Hospital of Hartlepool.
The hospital trust says the plans relate to surplus land on the hospital site, and the new homes would be designed for people with health related needs.
But hospital campaigners fear any building could prevent the site being extended for medical purposes in the future and undermine it.
Peter Mitchell, director of estates and facilities at North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust, said: “The trust has had discussions with Thirteen Group and health partners about the potential use of surplus land for new high-quality housing which would be specifically designed for people with health-related needs.
“These plans are in the pre-development stage and we will be meeting again with Thirteen to progress these.”
Thirteen says the Government funding will help address problems that hold up housing projects and encourage good design.
Chief executive Ian Wardle said: “We are delighted to have secured this funding from the Estate Regeneration Fund.
“Although there are no firm plans in place, the funding will support pre-development feasibility, including community consultation and engagement.
“It will allow us to build modern, high-quality new homes quickly in locations across the Tees Valley.”
Keith Fisher of the Save Our Hospital campaign said it will always contest the building of anything on the Holdforth Road site which is not directly connected to the hospital itself.
He said: “In short, any domestic building on our Holdforth Road site would be considered as deliberate attempts to prevent any future re-development of our ‘local' general hospital provision which a recurring stream of national experts have identified as the safer principle and also aligns with clear public demand.”
Fighting 4 Hartlepool Hospital echoed Mr Fisher.
A spokesman said: “We would hope that this project would not stop any necessary extensions in the future. How does this proposed plan fit within the context of the covenant already in place?
“All negotiations should be open and transparent. Requests for tender should be on a level playing field with no party holding discussions behind closed doors.”
A simple act of kindness is garnering a lot of praise for a Hawaiian Electric employee.
Jonny Okagawa pulled over on Kapolei Parkway Friday morning to help an elderly woman cross the street.
He was on his way to a job site when he saw her.
“I saw her zest for life and determination while crossing the street and she so reminded me of my recently passed grandmother,” he said. “As I talked to her, I was impressed by her strong spirit.”
Okagawa is a primary troubleman for HECO.
He says he thinks anyone placed in the same situation would have done the same.

Earlier this year, our solar system got a visitor the likes of which it has never seen. Astronomers first spotted the object on October 18th using the PanSTARRS 1 telescope in Maui. At first, the visitor appeared to be a first known comet to originate from outside our solar system, but further observations revealed it to be much stranger. Nevertheless, it was clear that the speeding visitor came from interstellar space, so the object was given the name ‘Oumuamua from the Hawaiian meaning “a messenger from afar arriving first.” Further analysis by the European Southern Observatory found the object to be perhaps not quite a comet, not quite an asteroid, and cigar-shaped. Based on the light bouncing off of it (or lack thereof), astronomers estimate the object to be among the darkest objects ever observed in space, absorbing 96% of the light that touches its surface.
Given the strange nature of the object, it wasn't long before speculation ran wild that we might have just encountered our first extraterrestrial spacecraft. Avi Loeb, the chair of Harvard's astronomy department, writes “the more I study this object, the more unusual it appears, making me wonder whether it might be an artificially made probe which was sent by an alien civilization.” In particular, scientists are struck by the long cylindrical shape of the object; ‘Oumuamua is estimated to be between 100 and 400 meters long with much smaller diameter. Such cylinder shapes are perfect for aerospace applications – just look at our own space shuttles and rockets – but are seldom seen in naturally occurring space objects like comets or asteroids which tend to be more spheroid.
With so much weirdness surrounding ‘Oumuamua, the Breakthrough Listen initiative has decided the object could be its best bet for discovering proof of alien intelligence. Breakthrough Listen hails itself as “the largest ever scientific research program aimed at finding evidence of civilizations beyond Earth” and shares facilities and researchers with SETI. In a press release issued this morning, Breakthrough Listen announced that even if the possibility of ‘Oumuamua being an alien ‘artifact' is low, it's worth checking out:
Researchers working on long-distance space transportation have previously suggested that a cigar or needle shape is the most likely architecture for an interstellar spacecraft, since this would minimize friction and damage from interstellar gas and dust. While a natural origin is more likely, there is currently no consensus on what that origin might have been, and Breakthrough Listen is well positioned to explore the possibility that ‘Oumuamua could be an artifact.
Even if the chances that ‘Oumuamua could be an alien craft are tiny, any possibility greater than 0% is exciting. Could this be it? Are we finally be close to getting a glimpse of a civilization far more advanced than our own? I sure hope so. If this festering dung heap of a civilization is the best the Universe has got, maybe it's best that we're all alone out here. Breakthrough Listen's observations of ‘Oumuamua begin tomorrow at the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia. Fingers crossed.

Last night, the Atlanta Film Critics Circle (AFCC) announced their selection for the year's top films, performers, and more. As a member of the group, which was founded this year, I was incredibly proud to be among my peers and discuss our selections. I definitely agree with the group's choice for Best Picture, which was Get Out. Surprisingly, the group also showed a lot of love towards Dunkirk, and while I can't really argue, that film hasn't really stayed with me in the way that others have this year (I do have a bone to pick with peers that Blade Runner 2049 wasn't recognized for Best Cinematography). That being said, I'm very glad that the Atlanta-based Baby Driver landed in the Top 10.

After arriving on Jan. 12, 2017 from the Philadelphia Zoo, the last three months were devoted to making her familiar with her new home. Once she was comfortable with her surroundings, Chang made her debut at the zoo in April.
Amur tigers, also known as Siberian tigers, are very rare, and are critically endangered in the wild. According to the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' (AZA) statistics, today's tigers are thought to occupy less than 7% of their original range. Threatened by habitat loss and degradation, poaching, tiger-human conflict, and loss of prey, four of nine subspecies have disappeared from the wild just in the past hundred years. Arguably the most endangered big cat remaining in the wild, Amur tiger numbers have dropped to fewer than 500. The future of the Amur tiger has been a major concern of the world's zoos for many years.
Managed by the AZA's Species Survival Plan (SSP), inter-regional transfers are arranged with careful attention to gene diversity in the hope that successful breeding will take place. Chang was sent to Connecticut's Beardsley Zoo as an excellent genetic match to the Zoo's resident male tiger, Petya. Chang can be seen in her new exhibit in the Predator area, near the Café.
“Chang is a beautiful tiger and is getting along very nicely with our Zoo staff, and with Petya,” said Gregg Dancho, zoo director. “We gave her ample time to become comfortable with her new surroundings, and now she's very much at home in her exhibit.”
Visitors will be able to meet Chang from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily, in the Predator area near the Cafe.
“The Zoo's breeding program exists to bolster the dwindling number of animals still in the wild,” said Dancho. “It's a real testament to our Zoo's strong reputation for working to protect endangered species and to educate our guests about them. It's an important part of our mission and we're justifiably proud of that.”

About Amur tigers
The Amur, or Siberian tiger, is a rare subspecies of tiger, and the largest cat in the world. Adult male tigers can weigh up to 675 pounds, with females weighing up to 350 pounds. Chang is small for a female Amur tiger, weighing 297 pounds. Similar to people's fingerprints, no two tigers have the same striped pattern. Amur tigers differ from other tigers with fewer, paler stripes, and a mane that helps to keep them warm. They live in southeast Russia as well as small areas of China and North Korea. They live for 10-15 years in the wild, and up to 22 years in captivity.
Londoners hoping Premier Doug Ford's promise to cut gas prices will actually happen are in luck.
Gas price watchdog Dan McTeague says he thinks Ontarians will see some relief at the pumps this summer after Ford announced Tuesday he has revoked the regulation that kept the province's cap-and-trade system in place.
Ford promised to cut gas prices by 10 cents a litre during the provincial election.

“It won't be done overnight. I think he's already signaled that half of that will be in the way of a cut in removing the 4.6 cents a litre that you're paying. When they average it out to gas stations, it works out to almost 5 cents a litre in terms of the cap-and-trade carbon tax,” McTeague of gasbuddy.com said.
The other half of the decrease will be done as a result of a reduction to the provincial fuel tax, which requires passing a new budget, he said.
But there are concerns oil companies may try to keep prices high.
“I think many people are worried that if there is a decrease coming from the provincial side that oil companies will simply pocket it,” McTeague said.
“If that is the case I would probably be the first [to know], as I give two-day advance notices in terms of wholesale price increases or decrease.
“I'll see it happening and I will very quickly call it offside,” said McTeague.
He adds commuters will notice the difference.
“Not only do I think it's going to happen because it's likely one of the most important announcements Ford made in the campaign, but the drop is scalable and viewable.”

Londoners are paying $1.379 for regular Wednesday morning. That's over 30 cents more expensive than last year.
Gas is more than 15 cents a litre cheaper in St. Thomas and more than 20 cents cheaper in Strathroy.
The newly sworn-in premier says his PC government will now begin winding down all the green programs that had been funded through the system.

Navajo Nation Employee Caught With Loaded Gun
Kimberly Barber, a Navajo Nation employee, got clipped by the Capitol Police in July.
Barber, who works for the tribe's Washington office, was arrested by Capitol Police on July 31 when an X-ray scan revealed a handgun in the briefcase she was bringing into the Cannon House Office Building 28.
The gun was loaded.
Barber was cited for a misdemeanor offense and was released the same day, according to her attorney, Charlie Galbraith of the Kilpatrick, Townsend and Stockton law firm.
Barber's next court appearance is scheduled for September 11, Galbraith said.
Barber has worked in the tribe's Washington office since 2014, Galbraith said. She is not a lobbyist, he added.
“Both Ms. Barber and the Navajo Nation will continue to fully cooperate with the Capitol police and the District of Columbia to ensure this unfortunate incident comes to a quick and just conclusion,” Galbraith said.
A Washington TV reporter had said that Barber was a lobbyist. The News 4 I-Team also reported that the gun was in a briefcase Barber checked at a security desk. The report also said that Barber told investigators that the gun belonged to a senior police officer with the Navajo Nation Police Department.
The News 4 I-Team report said that Barber told investigators that she had not been informed that there was a handgun in the briefcase.
The news team also said that according to court records the gun was unregistered.

CalFire and the Riverside County Fire Department put out a fire in a residential neighborhood in A Thousand Palms Monday afternoon.
The fire was reported at 12:23 p.m. and contained within half an hour. A family of five was forced out of their home, but reportedly declined assistance through the American Red Cross.
It took 23 firefighters to put out an attic fire at the single-story family home, according to Riverside County fire officials.
The two adults and three children who were displaced by the fire escaped the incident unharmed.

Apple confirmed today in statements to several media outlets that it will buy Shazam, pending approval. This news had previously been reported by TechCrunch, which had one source claiming the sale price was around $400 million—far less than Shazam's $1 billion valuation at its last round of funding.
Shazam is arguably best known for its music recognition technology; tap the "Shazam" button in the app for smartphones and it will usually identify whatever song it hears after just a few seconds. Shazam has become so popular that there's even a network TV game show called Beat Shazam hosted by Oscar-winner Jamie Foxx. In it, contestants must guess songs faster than Shazam can.
But Shazam has also invested in second-screen TV viewing features, image recognition, and augmented reality services and products. Shazam's talent and technology could be used in several of Apple's products and initiatives, including Apple Music, Siri, and augmented reality.
Shazam already integrates with Siri. You can ask Siri "what song is this" while a song is playing externally, and, after a long pause, it will provide you with the name and artist, along with a "buy" button for Apple Music/iTunes gussied up with Shazam logo. Currently, the Shazam app allows you to add a song to your Spotify playlist after identifying it, regardless of whether you're using an Apple or Android phone. We don't know yet what, if anything, will happen to that feature because of the Apple purchase.

That said, the acquisition is probably about much more than the widely known music recognition feature. Shazam has been developing augmented reality features that allow brands to serve up customized ads and transaction opportunities to users who use the app on visual or aural cues around them. Apple's Tim Cook has made it abundantly clear that he expects augmented reality to be one of Apple's biggest areas of growth and investment. Much of the iPhone 8 and iPhone X's hardware and software is built with AR specifically in mind, and Apple is even rumored to be working on a pair of AR goggles, though it will likely be a while before we see those in the market, if we do at all.
Shazam could help Apple further monetize these AR features, among other things.
An assistant commissioner of police, identified as one Christopher Osakue, has allegedly killed himself in Benin in Edo.
Osakue reportedly shot himself in the head with his service pistol in his residence located on Upper Sokponba on Wednesday, December 28, 2016, after sending a woman and little boy living with him on an errand. The late officer who was in charge training and development did not however leave any note behind. He was recently posted from Ondo to Edo state.
The ACP was said to have suffered a partial stroke some years back but he was gradually recovering from it before the incident occurred. A source in the area disclosed that a gunshot from the residence of the deceased was heard at about 5pm on the fateful day.
Security operatives from the Ugbekun police division were said to have later stormed the residence of the ACP who had hosted some youths in the area on December 25.
The Commissioner of Police, Haliru Gwandu, described the senior police officer's death as a case of suicide. Gwandu also explained that the pistol which he allegedly used to commit the act was signed for at the Ondo State Police command before he was posted to Edo.

Vallejo commissioners are set to ratify a decision made last year by the Architectural Heritage and Landmarks Commission (AHLC) which named a series of south Vallejo structures as city landmarks, during a meeting Thursday.
The AHLC approved an application in March 2016 requesting six buildings and structures at the former Sperry Flour Mill site, located at 790-800 Derr St. be added to the city's historic resource inventory and designated as city landmarks.
Adding the structures to the inventory list will become final after the March vote is officially ratified by the commission, staff wrote in a report.
Such a ratification is codified in the city's municipal code.
Submitted by the Vallejo Architectural Heritage Foundation, the application noted the historic significance of an administration building, flour mill, garage, grain silos, managers house, and a dock on the site which continuously produced floor for over 130 years.
An independent 2008 report found the six structures were eligible to be placed on the national and state register of historic places.
The report noted the significance of the plant during the United States involvement in World War I.
In recent years, the property has become a battleground, as City Hall reviews a proposed project by the Vallejo Marine Terminal (VMT) and the Orcem cement facility.
VMT, which currently owns the property, has proposed to reestablish industrial uses at the site through the removal of the dock and construct a modern deep-water terminal, while the Orcem component involves construction and operation of an industrial facility producing cement.
VMT/Orcem are seeking to remove several of the structures on site, and replace them with new buildings. While a handful of advocacy groups have been created in opposition to the Orcem/VMT project. One group, Friends of Old Sperry Mill, is seeking to preserve the site for mixed-use development.
City staff noted in a separate report, that VMT/Orcem have appealed the commission's March 2016 decision. The appeal is expected to be considered by the Vallejo City Council at a later date.
The city's Planning Commission will review the project during a special meeting on Feb. 27.
The Architectural Heritage and Landmarks Commission will meet at 7 p.m., Thursday, inside the Vallejo City Hall Council Chambers, 555 Santa Clara St.

City politicians will debate Monday whether or not London should bid for the 2020 International Plowing Match.
Ward 2 Coun. Bill Armstrong first raised the idea back in October and while the suggestion received lukewarm support from London city council, after a 90 minute discussion they did ask staff to investigate the potential costs and benefits.
The report says hosting the event will be costly both in terms of time and money.
It would require up to 200 city staff and 9,000 hours of work. Staff say hosting the event would require a start-up grant of $100,000, which could be lost if the event fails to turn a profit, plus discretionary funds that would, could range between $150,000 and $550,000.
READ MORE: London councillors debate plowing match bid for 90 minutes, defer to staff
Armstrong has submitted a list of 25 letters of support from the community backing his push to have London host the event in 2020.
Those writing in support of the IPM include the Covent Garden Market, the Western Fair District, Fanshawe Pioneer Village, Best Western London, Tourism London and the London International Airport.
Tourism London initially wrote a letter in support of the event, but General Manager John Winston also cautioned against it on October saying London didn't have the infrastructure.
Armstrong hopes he has council's support on Monday.

“I believe that this is a great opportunity,” he said. “It's an opportunity to showcase London in many different ways. Show the world our agricultural community, show the world our agri-industry that we have and want to develop further.”
Approximately 1,000 acres of flat, well-drained farmland would be required to host the event.
The report says the five-day event typically attracts 85,000 people but is short on details about the potential economic impact.
Staff say the Ontario Plowman's Association has done economic impact studies but “they cannot be shared at this time.”
However, Armstrong says the event would be a boost for the local economy.
“Based on a 2016 report, generated by the provincial government, the spinoffs back then were $30 million in economic activity,” he said.

The event was held in the Town of Minto in Wellington County in 2016. The Seaforth Huron Expositor reported this past March the 2016 IPM had an economic impact totalling $29 million.
London last hosted the International Plowing Match in 1928.
This year's event was held in Walton, east of Goderich in Huron County. Now in its 100th year, the IPM has become a must-attend for high-profile politicians. The leaders of all four of Ontario's political parties attended, as did Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
The strategic priorities and policy committee will discuss bidding for the event Monday at 4 p.m.
MEXICO CITY/CARACAS (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's first tour of Latin America got off to a rocky start on Friday with U.S. ally Mexico distancing itself from his suggestion that Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro could be toppled by his own military.
Tillerson ruffled feathers across the region on the eve of his five-nation tour with comments in Texas defending 19th century U.S. foreign policy in Latin America and suggesting the Venezuelan army could manage “a peaceful transition” from Maduro.
Both Maduro and his defence minister condemned the comments on Friday, and even Mexico, no friend of the Venezuelan government, was at pains to say it did not support any non-peaceful solution in the South American country that is engulfed in a political and economic crisis.
“Mexico, in no case, would back any option that implies the use of violence, internal or external, to resolve the case of Venezuela,” Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray
said at a news conference, flanked by Tillerson and Canadian counterpart Chrystia Freeland.
“It will have to be the Venezuelans themselves who find a peaceful route, a peaceful solution to this crisis,” he said.
Tillerson, in Mexico on the first leg of a trip that will also take in Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Jamaica, did not repeat his comments about military action, but reiterated a call for Maduro to reinstate a legislative assembly and hold free and fair elections.
In Venezuela, Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino accused Washington of seeking to undermine democracy in Latin America and return to the days of “imperialism,” lashing out at Tillerson during a broadcast on state television.
Padrino said Tillerson's Latin American tour was aimed at fomenting a regional “intervention” against Venezuela's socialist government.
“The armed forces radically reject such deplorable remarks that constitute a vile act of interference,” he said, flanked by military top brass, before reading a formal statement of support for Maduro.

At a political rally later in the day, Maduro said he would not be bowed by Tillerson's comments.
“We will not give in. They don't know what we are made of,” Maduro said.
CALLS FOR MILITARY ACTION
Venezuela's opposition leaders have long urged the military to take action against Maduro. Maduro claims the United States and opposition parties are part of an international right-wing conspiracy to oust him and get their hands on the OPEC nation's oil wealth.

On Thursday, Tillerson referred to the 1823 Monroe Doctrine, which is widely seen in Latin America as a justification for U.S. armed intervention in the region, saying it was “as relevant today as it was the day it was written.”
Discussing Venezuela, the top U.S. diplomat said militaries in Latin America often “handled” transitions from bad governments, but insisted he was not advocating “regime change.”
“If the kitchen gets a little too hot for him, I am sure that he's got some friends over in Cuba that could give him a nice hacienda on the beach and he could have a nice life over there,” Tillerson said, referring to 55-year-old Maduro, who has a close relationship with Cuba's communist government.
Senior military leaders have consistently stood by Maduro, whom critics accuse of turning Venezuela into a dictatorship and wrecking its economy.
But discontent among the rank-and-file, especially at their own economic penuries, is evident.
There have been some small uprisings against Maduro from within the security forces. A National Guard captain led an attack on a barracks but was later arrested. A police helicopter pilot, Oscar Perez, who lobbed grenades at government buildings, was tracked down and killed last month. [nL1N1PB0ZI]
Actress Uma Thurman has accused embattled Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of forcing himself upon her sexually and director Quentin Tarantino of making her perform a dangerous car stunt that injured her.
Thurman is quoted in The New York Times on Saturday as saying Weinstein attacked her in London. She says he pushed her down and tried to shove himself on her and expose himself.
Weinstein's representatives say he acknowledges making an “awkward pass” but denies physical assault.

Thurman says when she expressed fear about driving a possibly faulty car in Tarantino's “Kill Bill: Vol. 1” he insisted.

Tarantino hasn't responded to a request for comment.
“There are many things about the movie that are absolutely real,” says Peter Spierig, who directed Winchester with his brother Michael Spierig. “But were ghosts haunting Sarah Winchester as people said at the time? There's nothing to confirm that — or deny it, either.”
Helen Mirren plays the widowed Sarah Winchester, thought to be insane as she orders constant expansion and renovation of her bizarre Victorian mansion.
A reclusive heir to the Winchester rifle fortune, who is haunted by the angry spirits of those killed by her family's famed firearms, is at the centre of the ghost story Winchester (in theatres Friday).
Winchester was a highly discussed celebrity even before she began drastically overhauling the home that became known as the Winchester Mystery House.
There was a real Sarah Winchester. The socialite heiress made a splash when she moved to San Jose, Calif., from Connecticut in 1884 following the death of her husband, William (and their baby 15 years prior).
Here's what we know to be true:
“She was Bill Gates-rich from this famous family, so people watched her, talked about her and speculated,” says Janan Boehme, official historian at Winchester Mystery House, now a preserved tourist attraction.
Her Winchester House is a marvel in opulent oddness. The home started with eight rooms. By 1906, it was seven stories high with an estimated 90 rooms.
The movie riffs on the oft-repeated legend that Winchester had been instructed by a spiritual medium to keep building to ward off the spirits haunting the house. But there's no indication of that in Winchester's letters or those of her confidantes, Boehme says.
An alternative theory: Winchester was occupying her mind as a way of dealing with her personal grief.
“We may never know why she built like she did,” Boehme says. “But people do certainly conjecture.”
The Winchester Mystery House includes fascinating features, including a door to nowhere. Stairways go straight into a ceiling, a doorway opens to a two-story drop and there's a design preoccupation with the number 13 (closets with 13 hanger pegs, halls with 13 ceiling panels).
Possible explanations vary from an attempt to confuse haunting spirits to design miscues resulting from constant construction.
“But there's nothing definitive. This really is a perplexing house,” Boehme says.
The great earthquake rocked it. The infamous 1906 San Francisco earthquake, rather than the film's rampaging spirits, did severely damage Winchester's home, trapping her in a room. “They had to free her with a crowbar,” Boehme says.
The terrified Winchester tore down the top three damaged floors and spent more time on her nearby houseboat, but continued building out. In 1922, she died of heart failure in her bedroom at Winchester House at age 82.
Visitors still insist it's haunted. While Winchester herself never mentioned hauntings and friends denied them, speculation was rampant. Harry Houdini himself visited after Winchester's death to debunk spiritualists. But the ghost stories continue today.
Some visitors have sworn to have seen the “wheelbarrow ghost,” a kindly apparition in white overalls who apparently works on the house.
“There is a good energy here,” Boehme says. “Even if none of the ghost stories are true, Sarah Winchester was a truly fascinating person.”

“We'll destroy his career,” President Donald Trump said of a Texas legislator who has reportedly introduced legislation to curtail civil asset forfeiture — the practice of taking a person's property allegedly used in the commission of a crime — unless the individual is convicted of a crime.
Trump made his remarks, which were taken as joke, at a February 7 White House meeting with sheriffs from across the country (shown). But even if the remark was not taken seriously by the sheriffs, who laughed at the “threat,” it is clearly indicative of the president's position on the issue.
During the meeting with the sheriffs, the issue of civil asset forfeiture (CAF) was discussed at some length. Sheriff Aubrey of Jefferson County, Kentucky, raised the issue: “The other thing is asset forfeiture. People want to say we're taking money and without due process. That's not true. We take money from dope dealers.”
Trump then asked, “And you're not allowed to do it now?”
Sheriff Aubrey said it had been “curtailed a little bit,” after which Trump asked whether it was for “legal reasons” or “just political reasons?”
Aubrey answered, “They make it political and they make it — they make up stories.”
Trump told the sheriffs that he would like to “look into that.” He then said to Dana Boente, the acting attorney general, “So what do you do? So in other words, they have a huge stash of drugs. So in the old days, you take it. Now we're criticized if we take it. [Note: The criticism of CAF is not the taking of illegal drugs, but rather property which is only alleged to have been involved in the drug trade or some other alleged crime]. So who gets it? What happens to it? Tell them to keep it?”
Boente explained, “Well, we have what is called equitable sharing, where we usually share it with the local police departments for whatever portion that they worked on the case. And it was a very successful program, very popular with the law enforcement community.”
No doubt it is, since local law enforcement is able to procure through CAF cars, boats, cash, and other valuable property through this program in which local law enforcement and federal agents work together on a case.
Boente told Trump, “There's been a lot of pressure not to forfeit, in some cases.”
Trump responded, “Who would want that pressure, other than, like bad people, right?” He then told Sheriff Aubrey that he could count on his support in his efforts to continue CAF.
One participant, unnamed on the White House website, told Trump his version of what CAF means. “You shouldn't be allowed to profit from the illegal proceeds. So if you're going to sell narcotics and sell illegal drugs in our country, you also cannot profit from that. And so we seize those profits.”
Then, John Cary Bittick, the sheriff from Monroe County, Georgia, a past president of the National Sheriffs Association, chimed in: “I just want to thank you for the administration working actually on pieces of legislation and on political ideas with us. It's refreshing, and we are thoroughly enjoying it. We are currently working with Senator [Charles] Grassley on some criminal justice reform issues. And the administration has been supporting us. And asset forfeiture is a big thing.”
Following a brief back-and-forth with other participants, Sheriff Harold Eavenson of Rockwell County, Texas, brought up the CAF issue again: “Mr. President, on asset forfeiture, we got a state senator in Texas who was talking about introducing legislation to require conviction before we can receive their forfeiture.”
Trump responded, “Can you believe that?”
Sheriff Eavenson responded, “I told him that the cartel would build a monument to him in Mexico if he could get that legislation.”
It was then that Trump asked, “Who is the state senator? Want to give his name? We'll destroy his career.”
According to Politico, Trump's comment “elicited laughter from those gathered in the Roosevelt Room,” but that Trump “did not join in.” So, while the sheriffs took the comment more as a joke than an actual threat, it is unclear how seriously Trump meant it.
Since the sheriff did not offer the legislator's name, speculation has centered on two possibilities, one being Texas state Senator Juan “Chuy” Hinojosa, a Democrat who introduced CAF legislation in November. Hinojosa told the Texas Tribune that he did not think the sheriff was referring to him. He said he had never met the sheriff and had never spoken to him.
More likely, the reference was to a Republican, state Senator Konni Burton, whose district is relatively close to Rockwall County. Burton's bill, introduced in December, would require criminal conviction before forfeiture.
While it would be unusual for Trump to oppose Burton's reelection, since she is a member of his own political party, it would not be without precedent. In 1938, President Franklin Roosevelt opposed Democratic Party congressmen who had opposed his “court-packing plan” (in which FDR tried to get Congress to create six new positions on the Supreme Court, that he could then fill), but he was largely unsuccessful.
Most Americans are uninformed about CAF, but polls indicate that those Americans who have heard of it are strongly opposed. A poll taken late last year by the libertarian CATO Institute found that 84 percent of Americans oppose taking “a person's money or property that is suspected to have been involved in a drug crime before the person is convicted of a crime.”
Many in law enforcement are supportive of CAF without conviction, however. One who is not in favor of CAF before conviction is Trump's pick for the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, who has been attorney general in Oklahoma since 2011. In an interview last year with CATO, Pruitt said the only type of asset forfeiture that is legitimate is “post-conviction.”
In the interview with CATO, Pruitt offered “two egregious examples” of CAF abuse in Oklahoma. In one case, a Kansas resident traveling with a contemporary Christian band, who had raised a large amount of charity money to send to Burma, was stopped by the sheriff's office in Muskogee County for a broken taillight. Since the man was carrying $53,000 in cash, the sheriff's office presumed it was drug money. They called in a drug dog, who alerted that drugs were in the vehicle. Pruitt told CATO that the use of drug dogs “can be manipulated.”
After four hours of interrogation, the man was released. But the sheriff kept the money — under civil asset forfeiture. Eventually, after a story in the Washington Post highlighted the case, they finally returned the money. But many citizens are not so fortunate, and are expected to prove that the cash, or other property, is not drug money — in other words, prove a negative.
This is the central problem of CAF. The normal presumption of innocence, with the burden of proof upon the government, shifts to the accused, under the reasoning that it is the cash or other property that has committed the crime!
Another example Pruitt offered as an abuse that can occur with CAF was a case in Wagoner County, Oklahoma. There, the sheriff conducted a search of a vehicle and simply pocketed $10,000 he found in it.
Unlike the impression left in the discussion between Trump and the sheriffs in the Roosevelt Room, the issue is not illegal drugs being seized, but rather private property being seized — and kept — without conviction. This is, of course, a gross violation of due process of law.
It is not a small problem. In 2014, federal law-enforcement officers seized over $5 billion in assets under CAF, while burglary losses were a little less than $4 billion. This does not include private property seized independently by local law-enforcement agencies, such as police departments and sheriff's departments.
Sadly, President Trump gives every indication that he is fine with such seizures. While drugs are certainly a scourge, a person simply accused of a drug crime is entitled to due-process procedures. After all, murder, robbery, and rape are also terrible crimes, and we don't punish those individuals who are simply accused of such offenses. It is still up to the government to prove a person's guilt, beyond reasonable doubt. Just because a person is accused of a crime, whether it be murder or drug dealing, it does not mean that person is guilty of that crime.
Unfortunately, Pruitt is not going to serve as attorney general of the United States. Trump has nominated Senator Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) for that post instead. Although Sessions is good on many issues, he is a strong advocate of civil asset forfeiture. In a Senate hearing in 2015, Sessions dismissed concerns about CAF, saying that “95 percent” of forfeitures are from suspects who have “Done nothing in their lives but sell dope.”
Sessions may or may not be right on his numbers, but even if he is right, we must ask: Is he comfortable that the five percent who are innocent are being stripped of their property without due process of law?
And, is President Trump also content for five percent of Americans to lose property to CAF, even if they have committed no crime?
Let us hope that President Trump, Jeff Sessions, and the nation's sheriffs re-think this issue. And since they claim to uphold the Constitution, that includes upholding the Fifth Amendment: “No person shall be … deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.”
Oakland Athletics shortstop Marcus Semien will require surgery to repair a fracture of the scaphoid bone in his right wrist, the team announced Monday.

IPL 2017 schedule released by the BCCI
The opening and the finals will be played at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket stadium in Hyderabad.
@manishpathak187 by Manish Pathak News 15 Feb 2017, 19:10 IST
The defending champions will kick-start the proceedings
The schedule of the Indian Premier League has been announced. The first game this season would be played between defending champions Sunrisers Hyderabad and the runners-up Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 5 in Hyderabad.
The finals will also be played in Hyderabad on May 21.
The tournament will be played to spread over 47 days across 10 venues, a BCCI release said.
Indore gets a majority of the matches for Kings XI Punjab as Mohali would only play host to 4 KXIP games.
Surprisingly, Dharamsala and Raipur are the two venues which miss out in the list this time around. It has to do with the ouster of Anurag Thakur from the BCCI.
Extra Cover: IPL auction 2017: One player who can complete each IPL side
The annual cash-rich event will be played across ten venues spanning 47 days, wherein every team plays seven out of their 14 games at their home ground.
The entire schedule can be found here...
This IPL will be played at a time when the Indian team is in the midst of an extended purple patch as the Virat Kohli-led team has been like a juggernaut in this home season and the team has remained unbeaten for 19 successive Test matches.
However, the different IPL franchises go into the League with different agendas on their mind. MS Dhoni-led Rising Pune Supergiants had a forgettable season last year and would look to stamp their authority this year with different smart buys at the auction.
Kings XI Punjab, the holders of the wooden spoon have all the arsenal to bounce back after their horrendous season last year. With Murali Vijay at the helm the Punjab team would love to prove their detractors wrong this season.
As many as 351 players will go under the hammer this season and different teams would look to hold on to gun players who would fit their scheme of things perfectly. The auction is scheduled to be held on February 20 in Bangalore.
There are as many as 122 international players, including six players from Associate nations (five from Afghanistan and one from the UAE).
In her continued fight for women's reproductive rights around the world, Melinda Gates attributed her personal and professional success to birth control in an passionate essay published in Fortune magazine Tuesday.
“It's no accident that my three kids were born three years apart—or that I didn't have my first child until I'd finished graduate school and devoted a decade to my career at Microsoft,” Gates wrote in the article.
“My family, my career, my life as I know it are all the direct result of contraceptives. And now, I realize how lucky that makes me.”

The article coincides with the Gates Foundation renewed pledge to provide 120 million women around the world with access to contraceptives by 2020 – a goal set in 2012 by Family Planning 2020, a coalition of organizations, including the Gates Foundation, working to provide women in the developing world with birth control.
The Gates Foundation has been involved in the push for reproductive rights in the developing world for years. According to the New York Times, the foundation has contributed more than US$1 billion to the cause.
But, as Gates noted, the fight for reproductive rights continues to face challenges in the U.S.
“There are 225 million women in the world who do not want to get pregnant but do not have access to modern contraceptives. A recent change to U.S. global health policy will soon drive that number up even higher,” she noted.
WATCH: The Trump administration reinstated a ban on providing federal money to international groups that perform abortions or provide information on the option
Last month, U.S. President Donald Trump reinstated a “global gag rule” policy that prevents groups that offer abortion and reproductive health care services from receiving funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development — even if they don't use American aid money for those particular services. The policy also bans U.S.-funded groups around the world from discussing abortion.
Family planning advocacy groups have widely condemned the decision, warning the gag rule will spark an increase in unsafe abortions and maternal and newborn deaths.
Previous research about the gag order, conducted by the World Health Organization, has connected it to spikes in unplanned pregnancies as well as abortion rates in sub-Saharan Africa.

“Contraceptives are often a key determining factor in whether a woman is able to lift her family out of poverty. Research shows that women with access to family planning tools not only tend to have fewer children, they also tend to have higher individual and household incomes,” Gates said.
“If you care about giving children a chance at a healthy future, if you care about giving women a chance to take their families from poverty to prosperity, and if you care about giving poor countries the chance to become rich ones, then you must care about contraceptives.”
Some government bodies have already been outspoken about Trump's decision to reinstate the gag order. Denmark's development aid minister says his country would give an extra 75 million kroner (C$14 million) to organizations affected by the order.

The Dutch government has also said it wants to start an international fund to finance access to birth control, abortion and education for women in developing countries. Canada's minister for the Status of Women has also been in contact with the Netherlands to discuss the issue.
WEST SPRINGFIELD -- Conventional economic theory doesn't apply to health care and conventional logic doesn't apply to addiction.
That's part of what municipal leaders from across Western Massachusetts heard Friday when U.S. Rep. Richard E. Neal, D-Springfield, joined health care experts and psychiatrist Dr. Jennifer Michaels Friday. The group discussed health care broadly and the implications of the opioid addiction crisis at the Western Massachusetts Municipal forum organised by the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts at the Storrowton Carriage house on the grounds of the Big E.
Neal spoke of how addiction to heroin and its synthetic analogues is sapping the nation's work force, keeping people from getting training and getting to work as the economy improves.
"Since World War II, traditionally, three quarters of the adult population was working or looking for work," he said. "In the last three years its fallen to 68.3 percent. What happened?"
The Brookings Institution reported last week the results of a Princeton University study that an increase in opioid prescriptions from 1999 to 2015 could account for about 20 percent of the observed decline in men's labor force participation during that same period and 25 percent of the observed decline in women's labor force participation.
The idea is that addiction makes it difficult for users to return to the work force. And getting people off highly addictive pills and powders is a complicated process.
Michaels, medical director of The Brien Center for Mental Health and Substance Abuse in Pittsfield, said her point to the municipal leaders is that addiction is a brain disease, not a moral failing, and it is incurable.
"But it is completely treatable," she said.
Early interventions are key since many people start using with drugs as teens.
"They come to us when they are in their 20s and 30s," she said. "But their (drug) use disorder began much earlier."
Treatment, using methods clinically proven to work, is the answer, she said. But it needs to be accessible to those who seek help.
Treatment is especially needed in prisons and jails where only a quarter of those incarcerated get the addiction help they need. The risk of death by overdose is 120 percent higher for those recently freed from custody.
Neal also spoke of the need to de-stigmatize addiction. But he said law enforcement still needs to go after pushers who supply the drugs.
Speaking broadly of health care, he called for a more reasoned debate focusing on the Universal Mandate and the need for more people to buy insurance and spread out the risk.
"The problem is those who call the emergency department health care and then thumb their nose at the rest of us who pay into the system," Neal said.
Neal reminded the audience that it was former Republican President Richard Nixon who first advocated the personal mandate to buy health insurance, and the notion was later taken up by the very conservative Heritage Foundation think thank before it became Massachusetts law under GOP Gov. Mitt Romney.
A Canadian man drowned on New Year's Eve at Haad Rin beach in Thailand, according to reports.
Global Affairs confirmed to Global News that a Canadian died, but isn't releasing any other information citing privacy concerns.
“Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the Canadian who passed away in Thailand. Canadian officials have reached out to the family and are providing consular assistance during this difficult time,” spokesperson Austin Jean said in an email.
The Bangkok Post reports that 26-year-old Canadian and another woman, who's nationality isn't known, went into the water during a swimming ban due to high waves.
The woman was injured and sent to a nearby hospital.
The Post said the drowning was reported during the countdown on New Year's Eve, while there were high waves in the Gulf of Thailand.
Haad Rin beach is on the island of Koh Phangnan, in the Southern part of Thailand.
The family of former Hartlepool council leader Russell Hart have paid tribute to the ‘devoted and inspirational' man.
Mr Hart passed away this week at the age of 70.
Russell Hart
The son and grandson of a miner, he joined the Labour Party at Easington at 15, following grandfather James Bell, an Easington District Councillor who was chairman of the council between 1971 and 1972. Russell served Easington and Hartlepool Labour Parties in many capacities,” said wife Olwyn. After moving to Hartlepool, he joined the constituency Labour Party, becoming an active member of the-then Park Ward and standing as one of the Parliamentary candidates in 1989.
“From 1990, Russell represented the Rossmere Ward, becoming deputy leader to Bryan Hanson and then leader.
“He said on many occasions there was ‘no greater honour than to represent the town at regional, national and international level and having the privilege and pleasure of working alongside many dedicated, talented people, including Bryan and Gwynneth Hanson.'
“Russell was passionate about supporting councillors, whatever their political persuasion.”
Leaving politics in 2000 was a huge wrench for Russell, but he continued to seek out challenges that would make a difference to peoples' lives. Olwyn Hart
Coun Hart played a key role in the development of Hartlepool Marina and City Challenge projects; securing independence from Cleveland County Council in 1996; developing partnerships with police as a member of Cleveland Police, and control of resources as Chair of Resources and Council leader. A magistrate for more than 20 years, he rose to chairman of the bench, and was made an Honorary Alderman in 2014
“Leaving politics in 2000 was a huge wrench for Russell, but he continued to seek out challenges that would make a difference to peoples' lives,” said Olwyn.
“He became Non-Executive Director for South Durham and Tees Valley Health Authority and then Chair of Hartlepool and North Tees Trust, securing Foundation Trust Status.
“He retired due to ill health, but still followed politics in Parliament avidly, was keenly interested in what was happening with the National Health Service and still a committed party member.”
Russell is survived by Olwyn, son Russ, daughter Jeanette and partner Mike, grandchildren Harriet and William and step-grandchildren Andrew and Thomas. “Above all, Russell was very much a family man, devoted and inspirational to his loving family,” said Olwyn.
Construction halted on a Vancouver Island property near where other First Nations remains had been found

The demolition of a home in Greater Victoria has uncovered what are believed to be the remains of an ancestral burial, in an area known to have long been occupied by First Nations people in the past.
The home had been torn down to make way for new construction and in the process of clearing the site, the remains were discovered. Police were contacted, as were the B.C. Coroners Service, but it was soon discovered that the find was not a modern burial site and the situation was turned over to the Provincial Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development, who are responsible for the archaeological services provided by the government.
When remains are found, that government agency investigates the site, catalogues the find and works with the First Nations communities to ensure that the remains are dealt with in a respectful manner.
According to ministry spokesperson Jermy Uppenborn, it is a common occurrence. The ministry said that there are currently 54,000 burial places registered under the Heritage Protection Act and about 1,450 new sites are added annually.
It's no surprise then that the discovery of First Nations burial sites is nothing new for the Cadboro Bay neighbourhood.
In late 2016 Carl Foght began a major renovation on his home, situated within a hundred meters of the Killarney Road property.
“It was March when we came across human remains on the site. I'd been warned that it might happen, but I didn't really think it would be the case. It was a sort of ‘told you so' moment,” said Foght.
“When we discovered the remains, we had Stantec (engineering consultants) on site and they made sure we did everything to be respectful to the First Nations and making sure we did everything right.”
Doing “everything right” was not an easy or inexpensive proposition for Foght.
“The whole process set us back about two months. They actually sifted the soil to make certain that nothing was missed and found not only the remains but harpoons, combs, and all manner of decorative artifacts with the remains,” he said.
“It added some cost for us, for sure. We had an archaeologist on site for the whole process at $100 an hour and for the re-internment ceremony we were charged an additional $600. But it's a cost that you have to be prepared to absorb any time you do a renovation in this area.”
In the end, the remains of 13 people were found on the site, and at the request of the First Nations representatives the remains were re-interred in a different location at the far end of the same property.
“They had a ceremony to re-inter the bones and we agreed to have it done on our property out of respect for the First Nations community,” explained Foght. “We wanted to do it all the right way.”
Foght added that at no time in the entire process did he get the sense that the First Nations representatives were inclined to be anything but co-operative.
According to information provided by the Lkwungen Tung'exw First Nation, eight distinct family groups lived, fished, hunted and harvested the region's coastal lands for as many as 8,000 years. A series of temporary settlements joined larger permanent villages at McNeil Bay and Willows Beach and formed a significant presence in the area prior to the coming of European settlers.
While the provincial government has developed a map of the area in which likely archaeological sites may exist, the fact is that residents don't really know what may lie under their property until they put a spade in the ground.
“There's a fellow across the street who is planning to put in a new driveway, and I've already warned him of what might be there and how it might become more complicated for him,” said Foght.
“As a homeowner you knew there is a possibility so you prepare yourself, but of course you're not looking for it to happen.”

India remains the last nation standing—a stumbling block in China's drive for domination of the Indo-Pacific. Photo: AFP
Amid the standoff between Indian and Chinese troops in Doklam area in the Sikkim sector, national security adviser Ajit Doval's visit to China has come and gone. Nothing much has changed on the ground. Beijing continues to harangue and wage its psychological warfare, sometimes by reminding India of 1962 and sometimes by suggesting that countermeasures from Beijing would be unavoidable if the Narendra Modi government continues to ignore the Chinese warnings. Chinese officials even went to the extent of informing a visiting Indian media delegation that Bhutan has conveyed to Beijing through diplomatic channels that the area of the standoff is not its territory though, of course, no evidence for this claim was provided. Thimphu later denied these claims.
China is also provoking India by asking what New Delhi would do if it “enters” Kalapani region in Uttarakhand or at some place in Kashmir. This is the first time that the issue of Kashmir has been raked up by China at the official level. “The Indian side has also many tri-junctions. What if we use the same excuse and enter the Kalapani region between China, India and Nepal or even into the Kashmir region between India and Pakistan,” Wang Wenli, deputy director general of the boundary and ocean affairs of China's ministry of foreign affairs, said.
This comes after minister of external affairs Sushma Swaraj's assertion in Parliament a few days back that war was not a solution and India would resolve the border standoff with China through dialogue. But she also made it clear that India's reasonableness shouldn't be mistaken for weakness. “Just because we want to have friendly relations with our neighbours, they shouldn't cross the line. India always wanted smooth relations with China. But the alignment of boundaries involving India, China and Bhutan has to always be finalized in consultation with all three countries,” she said, underscoring New Delhi's resolve not to be cowed down by Beijing's relentless high-pitched campaign.
This crisis between China and India is different from other such episodes in the past but what makes it unique in recent memory is New Delhi's determination so far not to concede the standoff on China's terms. Beijing has tried everything. It has used its media to bully India; it has threatened India officially; it has used colonial era records selectively; it has tried to rally world public opinion. But India has not budged.
And that, in essence, foreshadows the future of the global order. Underlying all this petulance about boundaries and territories, behind all this façade of sovereignty, the Sino-India standoff in Doklam is about whether the future of Asia will be one with China as the dominant actor, dictating the terms of acceptable behaviour to other nations or whether the future of Asia will be a multipolar one in the real sense of the term. India has decided to stand its ground because there is far too much at stake in responding to Chinese bullying.
China talks of a multipolar world order, but in reality, it has always desired a unipolar Asia. Its assertiveness in staking its maritime territorial claims in recent years might have convinced it that there is no real opposition to it in the region and beyond. The West is too preoccupied with its own internal challenges to pose any serious problems in China's way. And the regional states are too weak to do anything about Chinese belligerence.
The Asean (Association of South-East Asian Nations) turned out to be a paper tiger when it came to the crunch. China's divide and rule policy has fractured any sense of unity in South-East Asia. A rather weak and ineffective negotiating framework for a code of conduct in the South China Sea was recently adopted by Asean under Chinese pressure, reflecting the challenges being faced by the larger Indo-Pacific at a time when the US remains distracted and lacks a clear Asia policy under Donald Trump.
And so, India remains the last nation standing, a stumbling block in China's drive for domination of the Indo-Pacific. Already, the ambitious Belt and Road Initiative has made China central to the evolving global economic order. Even when nations realize the folly of their joining this mega connectivity initiative, they see no real alternative.
New Delhi is the sole major power that has decided to publicly oppose Xi Jinping's vanity project. The other major power centres remain constrained in their policy responses to China. Japan has domestic political and legal constraints despite Shinzo Abe's proactive foreign policy. Australia's economic future is so deeply intertwined with China's that its elites are today having to debate the choice between the US and China.
The Modi government, in contrast, has been robust in its response to China's rise. It quickly realized that China remains determined to pursue a unilateral foreign policy and Indian interests will suffer if New Delhi does not make a change in its foreign policy behaviour. While a section of the Indian elites continues to believe that India can shape Chinese behaviour by its policies, policymakers have been confronting the consequences of China's growing capabilities in multiple ways. Though a tad late, New Delhi has been focusing on building its border infrastructure and has been active in trying to reach out to other like-minded powers in the region such as Japan, Australia, Indonesia and Vietnam to shape a favourable balance of power in the region.
The Doklam standoff, therefore, comes at an inflection point in India's relations with China. For India, there is only one option: standing up to China resolutely to protect its core interests. Otherwise, it will have to acquiesce in shaping a China-centric Indo-Pacific. And for most Indians, that clearly is not an option even worth thinking about.

ELK COUNTY — Law enforcement authorities are investigating a suspect after an alleged knife attack and chase.
On Saturday, deputies along with Elk County EMS and Fire and rescue responded to a 911 call of a woman with a head injury that was losing a lot of blood, according to a media release. A medical helicopter was launched.
When deputies arrived on scene they found that the victim had been taken to the hospital by personal vehicle.
Through the investigation law enforcement found that the victim's injury was a result of a stabbing. At the same time, a suspect was found driving a stolen vehicle in a neighboring County.
The suspect fled from an attempted a traffic stop and led law enforcement through four counties before he was taken into custody. Kansas Bureau of Investigation was called to assist the Elk County Sheriff's Office with the investigation. Suspect was first appeared in court on August 14th 2017 on aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.
Authorities did not release the name of the suspect.
BLOEMFONTEIN - South African opening batsmen Dean Elgar and Aiden Markram hit centuries as Bangladesh's bowlers took another pounding on the first day of the second and final Test at Mangaung Oval on Friday.
Elgar made 113 and Markram hit 143 as South Africa piled up 428 for three at the close in Bloemfontein. Hashim Amla was unbeaten on 89 and in sight of his second century of the series, while South African captain Faf du Plessis was on 62 not out. Markram's maiden century came in his second Test, eight days after he was run out for 97 in his debut innings during the first Test in Potchefstroom. It was almost an action replay of the first day of the first Test.
Bangladesh captain Mushfiqur Rahim won the toss and sent South Africa in, only for his bowlers to be put to the sword in a massive opening partnership.
The only major difference was that Bangladesh reshuffled their bowling attack, retaining only Mustafizur Rahman of their front-line bowlers. The replacements made no significant improvement on those who had played in Potchefstroom.
Although the pitch had more pace and bounce than in the previous match, it only contributed to a faster scoring rate as the ball came on to the bat better.
Elgar and Markram's partnership of 243 exceeded the 196 they put on to set up South Africa's 333-run win in the opening match. Elgar followed up his 199 in Potchefstroom with his tenth Test century. He made his runs off 152 balls, with 17 fours. When he reached 16 he became the first batsman in the world to score 1000 runs in 2017. Neither batsman gave a chance until Elgar, on 110, gloved an attempted hook off Mustafizur and wicketkeeper Liton Das leapt high and got the tips of his right glove to the ball but could not hold on.
Ironically Mustafizur was replaced by Subashis Roy and when Elgar hooked again, Mustafizur ran in from fine leg to take a fine diving catch for Bangladesh's only success before tea.
There was a brief lull after tea when Mustafizur and Roy picked up a wicket apiece and kept the scoring under control while Amla and Du Plessis were playing themselves in. It didn't last long and the pair posted a century partnership off only 111 balls.
It was a day when virtually nothing went right for Bangladesh. After a fruitless morning they went back to their dressing room to find their halal food was still on the way. The resumption of play was delayed by ten minutes to enable them to eat.

The Slippery Rock University women's basketball team hosted #13 Indiana (Pa.) University Wednesday evening at the Morrow Field House in Slippery Rock. The Rock was able to take a 16-12 lead against the nationally ranked Crimson Hawks into the second quarter but ultimately lost the game with a final score of 67-53. The loss marks SRU's fourth in a row and drops the women to .500 (8-8) in conference play. The Green and White currently sit at sixth place (10-11) in the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference (PSAC) West division. IUP improved their record to 18-2 (13-2 in conference) and sit atop the PSAC West Division.
“If this were a one-quarter game, we would have won,” Rock head coach Bobby McGraw said. “But it isn't, and we lost because we failed to execute offensively and defensively. We made it interesting in the final few minutes of the game, but it was far too late for us to really threaten IUP's lead.”
McGraw said that prior to Wednesday's contest, his team expected a challenge in IUP. The Crimson Hawks have one of the best women's basketball programs in the country, he said. McGraw said he believes that, even against a nationally ranked team, his team had the potential to win Wednesday's game.
“The score is the score, we had people that had the ability to score the basketball and they didn't,” McGraw said. “I don't know what it is, but we haven't been scoring lately and we certainly haven't been playing good defense of late.”
Sophomore Brooke Hinderliter led the way offensively for the Green and White, putting up 13 points (five for six from the free-throw line) and nine rebounds. She currently ranks 19th in the PSAC with 299 points on the season. Junior Morgan Henderson recorded 12 points, shooting two for four from the three-point line. Seniors
Sierra Fordham and Krista Pietropola combined for 20 points, 11 rebounds, and eight turnovers.
In the last four games, three of which have been against nationally ranked opponents, The Rock has scored 214 points and has allowed 272 points. The Rock currently averages 67.4 points per game, which is good for eighth in the conference.
Audrey Stapleton, a former star for the Green and White before transferring to IUP after the 2015-2016 season, led the way for the Crimson Hawks, scoring 16 points, shooting five for nine from the field.
With six games left in the season, half of which are at home, The Rock is hoping to finish strong to make a berth in the PSAC playoffs.
“We are going to come together and make the PSAC tournament,” said McGraw, confidently. “When, not if, we put a strong 40 minutes of basketball together, I would not want to play us in the postseason.”
The Rock will begin the first of those six games at home this Saturday against Seton Hill University (16-6/11-5). Tipoff is scheduled for 1 p.m.

With the confirmatory test of Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Agni-V, India claims to have joined the super exclusive club of five; US, UK, Russia, France and China. India has attained this status of super exclusive club as its sixth member, as it claimed. Nevertheless, this Indian move of missile race has not attracted any response from the super exclusive club of P-5. Upon this successful test the Indian Prime Minister, Mr NarendraModi tweeted; Successful test firing of Agni V makes every Indian very proud. It will add tremendous strength to our strategic defence. The BJP Government under Mr Modi is taking all steps, India needed to become a hegemon in the region and to attain the status of a major power at the global level.
This strategic missile has a range of 5,000 Kilometres and can carry 1,000 kg nuclear war head. The 17 meters long Agni-V missile has 50 tonnes weight, but very agile and modern weapon system. With its final operational configuration from Wheeler Island off Odisha, this ICBM can reach over to almost all major cities and towns of China (north most parts), Central Asia and Middle East. Apart from attaining overt nuclear capability in 1998, this strategic missile is another milestone, India has achieved in the bid of its major power status.
According to Indian Government announcement, “All the test parameters of the missile, which was tested for its full range, were successfully achieved. The missile splashed down near Australian waters.” Indeed, the last three test fires of Agni-V met failure, owing to minor technical faults and this final and fourth test of this ICBM was carried out after taking care of all those ‘technical tweaking required in the ballistic missile'. It took India almost two years in rectifying the faults, this missile system had earlier. According to Indian officials, “The missile's canister-launch version makes it even deadlier since it gives the armed forces requisite flexibility to swiftly transport and fire the missile from anywhere they want.”
In the conventional field, India has already stockpiled huge munitions and indeed, become top arms importers at the global level. It is madly leading the arms race and its actions have become a real challenge for almost all the regional countries; South and Southeast Asian including China. With the development of Agni-V, Indian strategic capacity has increased many folds and it is posing a real time threat to all regional countries, Pakistan and China in particular. Indian Strategic Force Command (SFC) has already inducted into its weapons inventory the missiles like; Prithvi and Dhanush. Besides, Indian SFC has also inducted; Agni-I, Agni-II and Agni-III missiles, which are specifically designed against Pakistan. Agni-IV and Agni-V would take care of any Chines offensive.
Induction of Agni-V in the inventory of Strategic Command of India is a serious blow to the strategic balance, achieved by India and Pakistan, after nuclearisation of South Asia in 1998. Compared to India, Pakistan has limited strategic depth, thus its nuclear capable missiles, the Agni series can reach over to all parts of Pakistan. Then there is an offensive posture, India has maintained throughout over the last few years.
This development (Agni-V) and Indian conventional arms race has enhanced the concerns of Pakistan many-folds. Firstly, Pakistan feels, it will be dragged into an arms race at conventional level, against its desires. This would become essential, in the context of security maximisation, as described by structural realists like Walts and Mearshemear. Then, there is no end to the security maximisation, in fact for countries like India it is power maximisation in the garb of security maximisation. This unwarranted arms race in Subcontinent would put aside the socio-economic development of the region, resultantly; the poor masses of both countries would further suffer.
Already, there are over 35% people of India and Pakistan languishing in extreme poverty and this arms race would further increase this parentage. Apart from Pakistan, the masses need to ask Modi Government, as what would be achievement of India, if it stockpiles its weapon inventory and leaves the masses in an absolute hunger and thrust.
Then, the role of major powers, particularly the superpower has been quite questionable. US was very concerned over the nuclearisation of South Asia in 1998, but became Strategic Partner of India in 2003. Since then, both countries have undergone a number of MoUs and defence pacts; the Indo-US Nuclear Deal-2008, massive US investment in India including shifting of F-16 manufacturing in India, signing of Logistic Support Agreement-2016, pushing India into Asia-Pacific and so many other pacts and agreements, signed between the superpower and India.
At the strategic level, China may be a target of India, since US desires to neutralise China through India in this part of the world, but, Pakistan faces the real challenges of Indian massive developments in the field of its conventional and strategic arsenals. Through this stockpiling and development of its missiles system, India has seriously challenged the strategic balance in South Asia. Owing to unresolved issues like Kashmir, Sir Creek and now Indian manipulation of water, the region is already susceptible to conflicts.
Addition ICBMs like Agni-V would further heighten the tension by disturbing the strategic balance in the region. Then, there is already a nuclear dimension of any future conflict in the region. Pakistan wants resolution of all outstanding issues through negotiations in a peaceful manner. The UN, US and all major power should pressurise the India for a peaceful way forward, rather arms race and the missile race.

A group of Vancouver residents took advantage of the icy road conditions on Sunday, starting an impromptu hockey game.
The ice on the road near John Oliver Secondary School, at St. George Street and East 41 Avenue, was thick enough it tempted everyone to lace up their skates and enjoy the winter weather.
Resident Joanna Wen took some video of the game and shared it with Global News.
She said if conditions remain the same then they will be back out again on Monday.

Two Alberni Valley martial arts instructors are focusing on fitness, fun and self-confidence in their teachings.
West Coast Combat Sports is a martial arts and fitness facility that specializes in kickboxing, run by partners Shay Hebert and Matt Goodwin. They met at the former Alberni District Secondary School, and although they moved to Victoria for school and work experience, they returned to their roots in Port Alberni three years ago.
“We needed to get out of the city,” Hebert joked.
They opened West Coast Combat Sports in 2016, with the recognition that there was no kickboxing gym in the Valley. The school has now been nominated for a chamber of commerce community excellence award for 2018.
“We've both been doing [martial arts] from a young age,” said Hebert. She learned taekwondo, while Goodwin focused on karate, but they both eventually got into kickboxing. They each took some time off from the competition, but a trip to Thailand in 2011 sparked their interest again.
“We thought we knew what we were doing, but we found out really quickly that we were out of shape,” said Goodwin.
The Muay Thai camps in Thailand feature two practices a day with hours of running and training at the gym, six days a week.
“You basically have time to go home, eat and have a nap, then come back and do the same thing all over again,” said Goodwin.
“That was all we did,” laughed Hebert.
The couple has gone to Thailand twice now for a combined learning and fighting tour. This is where Goodwin took on his first fight.
“It was really intense,” he said.
Goodwin was scheduled to fight for the Battlefield Fight League kickboxing title in Vancouver in January, but this was cancelled when the titleholder decided to retire from fighting.
“I trained really hard for that one, but it never happened,” he said.
Hebert explained that it's not unusual for fights to be cancelled, either due to an injury or because an opponent has some kind of mental block.
Goodwin was able to recently take on a competitive fight in Victoria on Friday, April 7. Goodwin lost the match in a decision, but said he learned a lot from the experience and will make the necessary adjustments in his next competition.
He likes kickboxing because it is a hybrid martial art. In the sport, fighters can use the styles of taekwondo, karate, muay thai or western boxing. Competitors use hand strikes or foot/leg strikes to score points.
“You can use all those different forms of martial arts within kickboxing, as long as you're following the rulesets,” explained Goodwin.
He described it as “strategic.”
“It's like a chess match,” added Hebert.
West Coast Combat Sports also has students that compete: Leslie Lauer recently won a pair of gold medals in the Tiger Blam tournament in Vancouver. She won both of her matches in the novice division, then moved up to the advanced division, winning after taking on an opponent with seven years' experience on her.
“That was really cool,” said Goodwin. “It was her first time taking a gold medal home.”
Some students are looking to take on an amateur fight, while others are simply there for the exercise or a confidence boost. Most of their students are fitness-oriented individuals, looking to have some fun, Goodwin explained.
Hebert said that some younger fighters approach them because they are being bullied. “Just getting confident in anything can help with that,” she said.
It's amazing, said Goodwin, to see the change in people over time after picking up martial arts.
“We had a lot of friends who needed this growing up,” said Goodwin. “If I had this outlet as a teenager, I might not have gotten into some of the trouble I did. We want to be there for the youth here.”
Kickboxing has a number of benefits, from exercise to confidence-building—and some people find it more engaging than a gym, said Goodwin.
“It's one of the few things that puts me in the moment,” said Goodwin. “You've got to be right here, right now.”
“Or you get punched in the face,” Hebert added with a laugh.

SYRIA-PUTIN
Russia's Putin stops at Russian military base in Syria
MOSCOW (AP) — The Tass news agency says that Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived at a Russian military air base in Syria.
Tass said that Putin's plane landed at the Hemeimeem air base in Syria's coastal province of Latakia, the heartland of Syrian President Bashar Assad's Alawite minority. The visit marks Putin's first trip to Syria and comes as Assad's forces have retaken control over most of Syria under the Russian air cover.
The air base has served as the main foothold for the air campaign Russia has waged since September 2015 in support of Assad.
TRUMP-GOP CONGRESS
Start the clock for Trump, GOP in last push on taxes, budget
WASHINGTON (AP) — Start the countdown clock on a momentous two weeks for President Donald Trump and the GOP-run Congress.
Republicans are determined to deliver the first revamp of the nation's tax code in three decades and prove they can govern after their failure to dismantle Barack Obama's health care law this past summer. Voters who will decide which party holds the majority in next year's midterms elections are watching.
Republicans are negotiating with Democrats on the contentious issue of how much the government should spend on the military and domestic agencies to avert a holiday shutdown. An extension of the program that provides low-cost health care to more than 8 million children and aid to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida need to be addressed.
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT-FEAR OF BACKLASH
Will misconduct scandals make men wary of women at work?
NEW YORK (AP) — Some men see a simple strategy for stemming sexual misconduct at work: Just avoid one-on-one interactions with women.
The idea has gained new currency after an avalanche of allegations against influential men in entertainment, media and politics this fall.
But some women, and men, worry that the same climate that's emboldening women to speak up about misconduct could backfire by making some men wary of female colleagues.
Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg recently wrote that she hoped the outcry over misconduct doesn't “have the unintended consequence of holding women back.”
To be sure, plenty of people limit contact with the opposite sex. Vice President Mike Pence has long said he doesn't have one-on-one meals with any woman except his wife, as part of prioritizing his marriage.
CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES
Firefighters brace for second week of California wildfires
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Officials say the largest, most destructive wildfire burning in Southern California is expected to grow as it enters its second week.
The Thomas Fire north of Los Angeles has burned more than 270 square miles, prompted tens of thousands of evacuations and destroyed nearly 800 structures.
The fire that started Dec. 4 is 15 percent contained. It was fanned by dry Santa Ana winds that spit embers ahead of fire lines.
Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown says the containment number will likely go down not because of a lack of progress, but because of the fire's expected growth.
The National Weather Service says gusts up to 40 mph are expected through Monday.

IRAQ-UNITED STATES
American diplomat: US looks to counter Iran in post-war Iraq
BAGHDAD (AP) — The American ambassador says that as Iraq emerges from three years of war with the Islamic State group, the United States is looking to roll back the influence of neighboring Iran in the country and help its government resolve the dispute with the Kurdish region.
U.S. Ambassador Douglas Silliman says that Washington is focused on keeping the peace and rebuilding, and sees Iran's influence as a problem.
He says “the Iranians have — to some extent — assisted the government of Iraq in defeating” IS but haven't helped with aide nor have they been “contributing to the U.N. stabilization program.”
Silliman says Washington is encouraged by recent Iraqi efforts to reach out to allies Saudi Arabia and Jordan, and hopes they will play a bigger role in Iraq going forward.

RAVENS-STEELERS
Steelers lock up AFC North with 39-38 win over Ravens
PITTSBURGH (AP) — The Pittsburgh Steelers won one for injured star Ryan Shazier — and wrapped up the AFC North in the process.
Chris Boswell made a 46-yard field goal with 42 seconds left and Pittsburgh's defense overcame a sloppy night to stop one Baltimore's last-gasp drive in the Steelers' 39-38 victory Sunday night.
The Steelers (11-2) trailed by 11 points going into the fourth quarter but capped an emotionally trying week following Shazier's spinal injury to rally for their eighth straight victory and third division title in four years.
Ben Roethlisberger threw for 506 yards and two touchdowns, becoming the first quarterback in NFL history to top 500 yards passing three times. Antonio Brown caught 11 passes for 213 yards, including two long gains in the fourth quarter that allowed the Steelers to recover after blowing an early 14-point lead. Le'Veon Bell had 125 yards of total offense and scored three touchdowns.
Baltimore's Joe Flacco threw for 269 yards passing with two touchdowns and one interception but was strip-sacked by rookie linebacker T.J. Watt on the Ravens' final snap.
Alex Collins ran for 120 yards and a touchdown for the Ravens (7-6).

HEALTH OVERHAUL-DEADLINE WEEK
Deadline week crunch for health law sign-ups under Trump
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration came in looking to dismantle Barack Obama's health care law, but the Affordable Care Act survived.
Now the administration is on the line to deliver a smooth finale to sign-up season, with a crush of customers expected this week.
Friday, Dec. 15 is the last day for procrastinators to enroll for subsidized private coverage for next year in 39 states served by the federal HealthCare.gov website. Consumer interest has remained brisk, although the Trump administration cut sign-up season in half.
A crunch could slow the website, and lead to long hold times at the federal call center.
Administration officials are saying little about their contingency plans for the final week. But HealthCare.gov has been sending out targeted emails reminding people of the deadline.
FRANCE-BABY MILK-SALMONELLA
Baby milk maker orders global recall over salmonella fears
PARIS (AP) — French baby-milk maker Lactalis has ordered a global recall of millions of products over fears of salmonella bacteria contamination.
The company, one of the largest dairy products group in the world, says it has been warned by health authorities in France that 26 infants have become sick since Dec. 1.
Spokesman company Michel Nalet told The Associated Press on Monday that the “precautionary” recall both in France and abroad affects “several million” products made since mid-February. The company said a possible source of the outbreak has been identified in a tower used to dry out the milk at a production site.
Lactalis employs 75,000 employees in 85 countries, with a turnover of 17 billion euros ($20 billion.)
The symptoms of salmonella infection include abdominal cramps, diarrhea and fever.

While animal welfare and abuse issues, particularly on large dairy operations, have been in the media spotlight and are a primary consumer concern, the majority of dairy farms emphasize animal welfare and prioritize proper animal care. After all, if the cows aren't comfortable and healthy, they aren't able to produce high-quality milk. But there are steps you can take to insure that your animal care standards are consistently being upheld.
According to Brandon Treichler, DVM, Quality Control Director for Select Milk Producers, improving animal care standards on any dairy farm requires engagement from all employees, leadership from owners and managers and consistency in all daily routines.
Animal care begins with vision and values, Treichler said during a recent Dairy Cattle Welfare Council webinar, “Fact and Fiction of Developing Practical Animal Care Programs.” Once a farm has outlined their vision and values, practices need to be put into place. Together, these three components create the dairy's culture of animal care.
“The vision and the values will drive the practices. Each day, what does animal care mean to you?” is the question to answer, he said. “Care is not an accident. There is some level of planning to make sure that animals get some basic level of care.”
Each dairy should develop its own animal care program. A program includes specific standards that need to be met. These standards reflect the vision and values of the dairy. All employees must be trained to proficiency in these animal care standards in order to meet the farm's objectives. Ongoing evaluation of employees, as well as solicitation of feedback from employees, is needed to continually improve standards of care.
“These are living programs, that are constantly evolving in the dairy,” Treichler said.
Empowering employees
It's human nature to do what is comfortable, to do things the way they've always been done, or to do what aligns with your own value system. But employees need to be empowered to embrace the dairy's animal care standards, and work according to the dairy's protocols. Dairy owners or managers need to play an active role not only in developing the animal care program, but in training employees, monitoring their progress, and insuring that the manner in which all work is done on the dairy aligns with the animal care program.
Sometimes, there are contradictions between the way things are and the way things are supposed to be. As an example, Treichler spoke of a dairy where the vision was that the cows would get into and out of the parlor on their own. In practice, however, employees were penalized if the parlor fell behind, and therefore they routinely fetched animals and herded them into the parlor.
On many dairies, employees are expected to overcome facility issues, leading to frustration and to actual practices that don't match the stated animal care program, he said. Putting people into situations where even a good employee is apt to make a bad decision isn't a good business practice.
Employee turnover can be very high in the dairy industry, and “is a risk factor for poor animal care on dairies,” Treichler said. “Put your people in position to succeed” by hiring people who are a good cultural fit for the dairy, training them to your standards, and building trust through open communications.
Employees should be trained before they start the job. They should feel welcomed, and positive feedback should be given, not only criticism. All positions on the dairy deserve the same respect. Employee feedback should be solicited and given consideration. If a mistake is made, it should be a learning opportunity. Get to know your employees personally, and lead by example if you expect them to be invested in the dairy's mission.
Standards and protocols
Standard operating procedures (SOPs) need to be written down, accessible, and utilized. Employees need to be trained to perform their jobs according to these written SOPs, and these procedures need to be followed consistently.
SOPs will reflect the vision and values of the dairy, and outline the practices that are put into place for each job on the farm. SOPs will tell employees what to do, how to do it, when to do it, where to do it, who can do it and — importantly — why to do it.
Often dairy employees aren't told why something needs to be done in a specific manner. But it's crucial that employees understand why it is important for employees to perform any particular task in a given manner. Share the reasoning behind the decisions being made, and employees are much more likely to follow the rules. When making changes, always explain why the change is necessary, Treichler emphasized.
Decision-making trees are invaluable in illustrating the step-by-step protocol that an employee should take in any given situation. Milking procedures, illness, calving, euthanasia, feeding, bedding, and every other job on the dairy should have it's own decision-making tree. If you tell employees what to do in each situation they may encounter on the job, you will give them confidence to make the correct decisions, even under difficult circumstances, Treichler said.
Likewise, treatment protocols should be written down in a step-by-step manner, and all treatments need to have one. Disease symptom recognition; what to do when illness is spotted; which drugs to administer; the dosage and duration; as well as withholding period for milk and meat will all need to be a part of the protocol. All treatments need to be precisely recorded, and the animal needs to be marked in some way so that everyone knows it is being treated. Your veterinarian should be providing input and reviewing any treatment protocols.
Training
By training employees to make decisions and to perform their jobs to your standards, animal care will improve, employee turnover will decrease, and the culture of care on your dairy will promote cow and human well-being.
Training should begin before the job starts, and employees should demonstrate the necessary job skills before being left to work independently. Training should continue with routine on-the-job observation and evaluation.
While group training meetings are often seen as the best way to educate everyone, Treichler cautions against this method. Improving employee performance is best done one-to-one. Hands-on training is always preferred to watching a video, being told what to do, or reading about it. While all of these methods can be included in the training, hands-on demonstrations tend to bring the best results.
Employees who meet certain levels of job performance can be awarded certificates indicating that they are proficient in various tasks. This keeps employees engaged, and fosters positive attitudes as employees feel appreciated.
“Labor is a massive challenge and opportunity” on the dairy, Treichler said. “Harness the power of people” and animal care and welfare will be ingrained in the culture of your dairy.

COSTA MESA, Calif. -- The Los Angeles Chargers brought in the team's biggest target in free agency this week, agreeing to terms on a two-year deal with former Miami Dolphins center Mike Pouncey, the team announced on Monday.
A source told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter that the deal is worth $15 million, including $10 million fully guaranteed.
Released by the Dolphins last week because he refused to take a pay cut, the 28-year-old Pouncey consummated a deal with the Chargers after an in-house visit on Monday.
With Pouncey signed through the 2020 season as part of a five-year contract extension with the Dolphins in 2015, Miami saved $7 million on its salary cap with his release.
A three-time Pro Bowler, Pouncey started 93 games in seven seasons with the Dolphins but played in all 16 games last season for the first time since 2012.
The Chargers could use help up front on their offensive line and have not found a long-term replacement at center since Nick Hardwick retired after the 2014 season.
Spencer Pulley started all 16 games last season in his first year as a starter, but the Vanderbilt product's performance was uneven.
With Pouncey in the fold, the Chargers have a projected starting offensive line of Russell Okung at left tackle, Dan Feeney at left guard, Pouncey at center, Forrest Lamp at right guard and Joe Barksdale at right tackle.
Known for his strength as a run-blocker, Pouncey should improve a running game that averaged 3.81 yards per carry last season, No. 26 in the NFL.
Pouncey, who was a Dolphins team captain last season, also was one of the central figures in the locker room bullying scandal involving former Dolphins offensive lineman Jonathan Martin.
NFL investigator Ted Wells' 144-page report into the incidents found that Pouncey and teammate John Jerry followed Richie Incognito's lead in bullying Martin.
Pouncey's twin brother, Maurkice, is the starting center for the Pittsburgh Steelers.
About 225 teens skipped a school-organized memorial in their Pennsylvania high school's gym Wednesday to take part in the National School Walkout against gun violence. As threatened, administrators ordered the walkouts to serve detention.
But when the first 46 teens turned up Saturday at Pennridge High School in Perkasie, Penn., north of Philadelphia, to serve their detention, a quiet memorial and protest against gun violence broke out instead, reported The Morning Call.
Students pinned the names of gun violence victims to their clothes, then left their assigned seats to silently sit in a circle with linked arms around a collection of flowers, a video posted on social media shows.

The National School Walkout encouraged high school and college students to leave class for 17 minutes March 14 to honor the lives lost in a Parkland, Fla., school shooting Feb. 14 and to demand stronger gun laws. Tens of thousands of students across the U.S. participated in the event, some with permission from their schools and some without.
Pennridge High School organized an assembly March 14 in which students sat in silence for 17 minutes while a memorial slide show played, according to The Independent. While about 800 teens took part in that event, another 225 opted to leave class for a protest against gun violence outside the school.
“Honoring the victims without trying to effect change is not good enough,” Jayson Badal, a senior at Pennridge High School, told The Morning Call. “It doesn't do them justice.”
Jacqueline Rattigan, Pennridge School District superintendent, told the publication that students would receive a Saturday detention for a first offense and two detentions for a second offense for taking part in the walkout. Five students who left campus to go to Dunkin' Donuts during the walkout will receive further punishment, she said, adding that students had been warned in advance of the consequences for leaving class.
Anna Sophie Tinneny, a senior at the high school, organized the detention protest Saturday.
“It was disappointing that our school teaches us to be like Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr., people who stood up for what they believed in. And they weren't going to let us do the same,” she told The Morning Call. Dozens of community members held protest signs outside the school Saturday while the students, who have labeled themselves the #Pennridge225, served their detention.

The shooting that killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Feb. 14 in Parkland, Fla., has prompted national protests, many organized by survivors of the shooting. A national March for Our Lives has been planned for Saturday with the main march in Washington, D.C., and satellite marches across the country.

Taking a walk outside is a tried and true mood booster and stress reliever. But a lot of us don't have the luxury of heading outdoors every time we feel sad or overwhelmed – particularly if we're at work.
That's why this is such good news: A new study from the University of California, Berkeley and BBC Earth shows that we can harness the mental health benefits of going outside and experiencing nature by simply watching wildlife videos.
UC Berkeley psychologist Dacher Keltner has long studied the psychological and physical effects of nature on humans. He teamed up with BCC Earth for the Real Happiness Project, surveying more than 7,500 people in the U.S., U.K., India, Singapore, Australia, and South Africa before and after they watched clips of nature documentary Planet Earth II. They also watched clips of news coverage and Game of Thrones for comparison.
Three of the study's findings jumped out to Keltner, he said.
First of all, “not surprisingly, you feel more awe and wonder” watching the nature clips than watching Game of Thrones or the news, he said. “Secondly, you get this overall boost in a lot of overall positive emotions”—for example, the clips made the study subjects feel happier, content and grateful afterward than the other types of videos did, Keltner said.
The research team also mapped the facial expressions of the people watching the videos. The nature videos inspired happy facial responses. The most notable response people had watching Game of Thrones and the news was fear.
Convenient, affordable stress relief
Watching a short video could be an affordable alternative to costly and time-consuming ways we try to harness happiness.
“We spend a lot of money trying to boost happiness,” he said. “We go on retreats and we go to intensive gratitude workshops, and here with a little film you get it.”
But possibly the most stunning finding was how the videos impacted young adults, he said. Pretty much everyone was positively impacted by the nature videos, but young adults got the biggest boost—especially when it came to stress reduction. That's huge, Keltner said, because “lot of young people are really stressed out.” And one-fifth of the young adult participants said they weren't getting outside regularly.
“I have two late teenage daughters and I see how stressed out they are… and we know that empirically, (but) what this study showed was the benefits of viewing Planet Earth II were bigger for young people,” he said. “That struck me thinking about this next generation (that's) super immersed in technology and social media, here's a simple way they can get some joy.”
How does watching nature videos compare to the real thing?
“Ultimately that's the tougher question,” Keltner said.
This study only compared nature videos to other types of footage, but future research could compare the effects of videos to actually being in nature.
“My hunch is its not quite as robust or enduring as those techniques,” he said. “But what is striking to me is this is stuff you can access quickly. If you're at home at night and its raining you can choose to watch it instead of disturbing news content and it does give you this burst of wonder and joy.”

Ian James Holds Off Local Star Drew Staveley To Win 4th PWC GTS Race With Team P
Posted by: newsla on Aug 14, 2017 - 06:43 AM Ian James Holds Off Local Star Drew Staveley To Win 4th PWC GTS Race With Team Panoz Racing Panoz Avezzano GT Sunday At Utah
Ian James and Drew Staveley, two of the most experienced drivers at Utah Motorsports Campus, put on a sensational two-man show Sunday in the Pirelli World Challenge GTS Round 14 50-minute feature before James drove his No. 50 Team Panoz Racing Panoz Avezzano GT to his fourth 2017 victory.
After making an excellent standing start, James held off a charging Staveley, who pressured the Paradise Valley, Ariz., resident in his No. 12 Ian Lacy Racing Ginetta G55 GT4 for the last 14 circuits of the 24-lap contest at the popular 3.048-mile, 14-turn road course southwest of Salt Lake City.
James, a former driving instructor at UMC, and Staveley, a current UMC instructor, battled within tenths of each other before Ian was able to hold his advantage at the checkered flag. It was James fourth GTS wins in the past six rounds including a double victory at Road America in June.
A few races ago, we spent half a day practicing our standing starts and it's been paying off, said James. We had a great start at Road America and here, so I managed to sneak into the lead there. It was just good racing today. We didn't have the fastest car, but sometimes if you get out front and be consistent, that's what counts. (Staveley) was right on my bumper and I couldn't make any mistakes. My last lap was my fastest lap and I gave it everything I had. It was a fun race - no contact, clean racing, this is how racing should be.
Staveley, who placed fifth in Saturdays GTS feature, tracked down James from his fifth starting position but couldnt make the pass to gain the lead. A newcomer to Pirelli World Challenge, Staveley enjoyed a spectacular racing weekend in front of friends and family in his hometown.
We got passed early and went back to fourth or fifth, said Staveley. I got to Ian (James) on the first long green run and it was exciting. We were just going as fast as we could go. We were nose-to-tail all the way to the end. I thought maybe I might be able to have something for him, at least get alongside of him on the last two corners but he drove a great race and it was all I could do to be second. I'm super happy for me and the team. This is our home track and all our wives and friends are here so this is a win for our new Pirelli World Challenge team.
Taking third Sunday in the GTS main event was 17-year-old Nate Stacy of Owasso, Okla., in the No. 14 Flying Lizard Motorsports Porsche Cayman GT4 Clubsport MR with a brilliant last corner move to nip George Kurtz by inches at the line.
I pulled off a pretty nice move on the inside of the Maserati (Jeff Courtney) and the Ginetta (Staveley) at the start and held it for a little while, said Stacy. We went three wide a few times into turn one which is generally not a great idea but we all raced clean. George (Kurtz) had the straightaway speed. He would hit the top of his motor and just barely keep him out of the reach of the Porsche in the breaks. I didn't think I would hold it for long but it was a good race.
It's definitely been a bit of a change from a big, heavy pony front-engine car (Mustang) to a mid-engine European sports car (Porsche).
Kurtz, the GTS Am point leader, finished fourth overall Sunday but won his GTS Am category for the seventh consecutive race in the No. 04 CrowdStrike/GMG McLaren 570S. The business entrepreneur made the start of the race by coming from ninth starting position to grab the overall lead in turn one.
We had the perfect start, said Kurtz. It was a monster start and we cleared four rows. I slotted in behind Ian (James) and figured out I'll just go with him and it worked out really well. We had to learn (the McLaren 570S) from the beginning of the season and we made some setup changes for today. We're lucky to run with these guys since they're all great drivers and I hope to harass them a couple more times before the end of the season. In that last turn, I got a little bit sideways and (Nate Stacy) got a run on me and it ended up within inches.
Rounding the top-five at Utah Motorsports Campus Sunday was GTS point leader Lawson Aschenbach of Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., in the No. 10 Blackdog Speed Shop Chevrolet Camaro GT4.R. Unofficially, Aschenbach leads James after 14 Rounds of GTS competition, 296-227.
Taking second in the GTS Am division at Utah was Staveleys Ian Lacy Racing teammate Frank Gannett of Steamboat Springs, Colo., in the No. 24 Ginetta G55 followed by Adam Merzon of Greenwich, Conn., in the No. 017 Case-It Racing Porsche Cayman GT4 Clubsport MR.
The Round 14 action will be televised on Wednesday, Aug. 23, on CBS Sports Network at 9 p.m. EDT.
Rounds 15 and 16 for the GTS class will take place on Sept. 2-3 at Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Tex.

PaddockTalk Perspective
Former Prime Minister Raja Pervaiz Ashraf – who served a short stint in office when Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gillani was disqualified for contempt of court – made a rare public appearance in Mardan, offering his condolences to Pakistan Peoples' Party (PPP) Senator Khanzada Khan on the demise of his brother-in-law.
Surprising as his sudden appearance in the public eye is, more surprising were the statements that he was making, at least they must be to the party leadership.
The former Prime Minister met with reporters and called for extending tenure of special military courts to root out militancy and extremism from the country.
He claimed that extending the powers of court is in the “national interest”, and considering that this is a popular opinion these days it might as well be, but coming from the mouth of a senior PPP leader, a former Prime Minister no less, these statements sound out of place.
Surely Mr Raja Pervaiz Ashraf does not need reminding that his party is defined by its opposition to military dictatorships and military over-extension of power – according to itself most of all.
The former prime minister must be aware that the PPP vociferously opposed the formation of the military courts in the parliament, and only conceded after making sure that a two-year deadline was included.
In every rally and speech, we are reminded by the PPP how it has made countless sacrifices fighting for the civilian right to rule, and here we find the former Prime Minister of that party actively arguing to keep the military in the judiciary role.
Of course, Mr Ashraf has been out of politics for a while now, but remembering the basic tenets of one's political party is not a difficult job.
After all, Mr Ashraf used to know them so well; a few short years ago when he was charged for allegedly receiving kickbacks in January 2013, he told the media that there was “no doubt the country's powerful military and Supreme Court were working together to topple the government.
”
Now that the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) is in power, the equation has changed.
Mr Ashraf spent a significant portion of his speech criticising the failures of the civilian government, and that is perhaps why his unconditional praise of the military seems so out of place.

London - World number one Rafael Nadal breezed into the Wimbledon second round Tuesday but fellow two-time champion and title favourite Petra Kvitova crashed out.
Nadal cruised to a 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 win over Israel's Dudi Sela as the Spaniard returned to action for the first time since claiming his 11th French Open title. Nadal, the Wimbledon champion in 2008 and 2010, also managed to avoid falling victim to a player ranked outside the world top 100 for what would have been the fifth time in his last six visits to the England Club.
Eight seed Kvitova, who was the bookmakers' favourite to add the 2018 title to her 2011 and 2014 victories, was stunned 6-4, 4-6, 6-0 by unheralded Belarusian Aliaksandra Sasnovich, the world number 50. Kvitova has won five titles in 2018, including the grass-court tournament at Birmingham last weekend, while amassing an WTA Tour-leading 38 match victories.
Number four Sloane Stephens and fifth seeded Elina Svitolina were eliminated on Monday. France's Caroline Garcia, seeded six, was also beaten Tuesday, going down 7-6 (7/2), 6-3 to Switzerland's Belinda Bencic. There was also similar carnage in the men's top 10. After sixth seed Grigor Dimitrov was sent packing on Monday, it was the turn of Roland Garros runner-up Dominic Thiem and Belgium's David Goffin to pack their bags. Austrian seventh seed Thiem retired with a back injury against Cypriot veteran Marcos Baghdatis, trailing 6-4, 7-5, 2-0. Goffin, the 10th seed, slumped to a 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 loss to Australia's Matthew Ebden. Argentine fifth seed Juan Martin del Potro made it nine first round wins in nine appearances at the tournament, easing past Germany's Peter Gojowczyk 6-3, 6-4, 6-3.
Del Potro, who made the semi-finals in 2013, next faces Feliciano Lopez of Spain who on Tuesday set a record of playing 66 consecutive Grand Slams when he eased past Federico Delbonis of Argentina 6-3, 6-4, 6-2. Left-handed Lopez made his debut at the majors at the 2001 French Open.
On Tuesday, the 36-year-old broke the record for straight Slams which was previously held by Roger Federer. "When I was about to break the record, I thought, wow, I'm going to beat Federer at something!" joked the 70th-ranked Lopez who has lost all 13 matches he has played against Federer in his career.
German fourth seed Alexander Zverev beat world number 748 James Duckworth of Australia 7-5, 6-2, 6-0. World number one Simona Halep started her challenge for a first Wimbledon title with a 6-2, 6-4 win over Japan's Kurumi Nara. Halep has arrived at the England Club on a high after finally winning her maiden Grand Slam crown at the French Open last month. She will face China's Zheng Saisai in the second round.
Spain's Garbine Muguruza opened her title defence with a 6-2, 7-5 win over British wild card Naomi Broady. Third seed Muguruza, 24, next faces Belgium's Alison Van Uytvanck. Australia's Nick Kyrgios, who famously stunned Nadal at the tournament in 2014, marked his 50th match at the majors with a 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (7/4), 6-7 (5/7), 6-3 win over Denis Istomin of Uzbekistan.
Kyrgios, seeded 15, hammered down 42 aces and unleashed 78 winners.
Eugenie Bouchard, the runner-up in 2014 before her career went into a tailspin, reached the second round with a 6-0, 4-6, 6-3 victory over British wild card Gabriella Taylor. Bouchard, now ranked 188 in the world, will face fellow former Wimbledon junior champion Ashleigh Barty for a spot in the last 32. Later Tuesday, former champions Novak Djokovic and Maria Sharapova begin their Wimbledon campaigns.
Three-time winner Djokovic starts against Tennys Sandgren of the United States, returning to the tournament which ended in an injury-enforced quarter-final withdrawal 12 months ago.
Sharapova, the 2004 Wimbledon champion and five-time major winner, returns to the tournament for the first time since 2015. The former world number one missed the 2016 event as she served a doping ban and was injured last year when she was planning to appear in the qualifying event. Sharapova, seeded 24, starts against fellow Russian Vitalia Diatchenko, ranked at 132 and who came through qualifying.
BENGALURU: In a political gamble close to the assembly polls, the Siddaramaiah government decided on Monday to declare Lingayats as a religious minority and include the Veerashaivas who follow Basavanna as a group within the community.The move is expected to have a huge impact on the assembly polls. Some analysts say it may make or mar the electoral prospects of the ruling Congress , given that Lingayats can influence the outcome in nearly 100 seats in the 224-member assembly. The community makes up 17% of the state's population. BJP had vociferously opposed the move on the grounds that it would split society further and introduce more cleavages in the social-religious fabric.Lingayats have traditionally supported BJP, especially in northern Karnataka; so this move is seen by most as a bid by Congress to split BJP's Lingayat vote base. Monday's decision comes amid threats from Veerashaiva seers, led by the panchacharyas (five powerful seers), against granting religious minority status to Lingayats alone.The Veerashaivas are a sub-sect of Lingayats and ardent followers of Lord Shiva. Basavanna, a 12th century social reformer, founded Lingayatism. The Veerashaivas preceded Basavanna.Some had threatened to campaign against Congress in the polls. To pacify this section, the cabinet decided to include Veerashaiva-Lingayats as a group within the Lingayat community. “The cabinet decided to grant minority status to Veerashaivas, who consider Basavanna dharma guru (religious head), believe in vachanas (verses) as sacred text and wear Ishta Linga (symbolic representation of a formless god). They will also be considered Lingayats,” law minister TB Jayachandra said, quoting the recommendation of a seven-member panel headed by Justice Nagamohan Das (Retd).The cabinet is set to ratify an official notification to this effect at its next meeting, possibly next week. It will, then, recommend to the Centre that the community be granted religious minority status. While Lingayats — who trace their origin to 12th-century social reformer Basavanna — have been demanding recognition as a separate religion and not be identified as Hindus, Veerashaivas had opposed it on the ground that Veerashaivas and Lingayats are one and the same.Lingayats said while both communities worship Shiva, Veerashaivas follow the Vedas and the caste system, which was rejected by Basava. In accepting the Lingayat demand, the government made it clear the Veerashaivas are a sub-sect of Lingayats.
Last week, Wrestling Inc. ran a story which suggested that The Undertaker and Shawn Michaels will appear on the January 9 edition of Monday Night Raw, despite the fact that neither of them were being advertised for the show on WWE's live events page. But, just a short time later, the Wrestling Observer Newsletter confirmed that both WWE legends will appear next Monday night, and they were both added to the live events page shortly thereafter. Back in mid-November, The Undertaker returned to SmackDown. It was the first time that we had seen The Deadman since his match with Shane McMahon at WrestleMania 32, and before he appeared, there was a rumor going around that he was actually retired. But, he decided to come back for what could be one last run, which will undoubtedly begin with an appearance in the Royal Rumble match. When The Undertaker returned to WWE television, he made it quite clear that he was going to be a part of the blue brand, which has caused many to wonder why his next appearance will be on Raw instead of on SmackDown. Of course, we won't know exactly why he's returning to WWE's Monday night show until we see his segment, but Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter has a theory as to why the company is bringing him back next Monday night. [Image by WWE] “[The Undertaker] is such a big star that he can be on either show when it's important for ratings. The January 9 show is going head to head with the college football championship, which usually does 25 million viewers. So, you need something big, and this thing about carefully defined Raw and SmackDown, and no one can be on both shows stuff — that goes out the window when you're going head to head with a game like that.” The question now is, what will The Undertaker do when he returns to Monday Night Raw next week? Well, according to Cageside Seats, he's returning to announce that he'll be a part of the 2017 Royal Rumble match. It's been many years since The Undertaker appeared in WWE's annual 30-man match. But, with the show being in The Deadman's home state of Texas, WWE needed him to be on the card. Originally, many believed that he was going to challenge AJ Styles for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship on the show, but, if that was the plan at one point, things changed, and Styles will now defend against John Cena. As of right now, The Undertaker is the favorite to win the 2017 Royal Rumble, and then he'll go on to challenge John Cena, who will presumably defeat AJ Styles on January 29, for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 33. [Image by WWE] It's been 10 years since the Royal Rumble has taken place in San Antonio, Texas, and the last time the event took place there, The Undertaker entered the Rumble at number 30, and won the match. He then went on to challenge and defeat Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 23. According to Cageside Seats, WrestleMania 33 will feature The Undertaker's retirement match. Does that mean that he'll lose to John Cena, or, whoever his opponent turns out to be, on April 2? Not necessarily, as WWE could, and probably should have him retire as the WWE World Heavyweight Champion. It'll be interesting to see what WWE has planned for The Undertaker going forward, and what they'll do with him on the January 9 Raw show. Will he show up just to announce that he'll be a part of the 2017 Royal Rumble? Or will he do something more than that? We'll have to wait and see! [Featured Image by WWE]

Some of the world's most interesting cars have the greatest stories behind them. The Dodge Daytona and the Plymouth Superbird are no different. At their core, they were built to shame Ford and Chevrolet in NASCAR, but Dodge was so adamant to ensure the car's success that it went through great engineering measures. Like, bringing on an individual from Chrysler's missile division to engineer the car.
Yes, Chrysler had a missile division, as Donut Media recalled in its latest episode of "Up to Speed." Chrysler built ballistic missiles designed by Nazi scientists that the United States brought back following the end of World War II. You can dive deeper into the program, called Operation Paperclip, on your own. Back to the Dodge Daytona.
The rocket scientist's name was John Pointer and he helped Dodge engineers and designers create the pointy, streamlined Daytona. The massive wing stuck the Daytona to the track and provided immense grip, and the fender scoops secretly relieved air pressure that built up under the car to provide even more grip. It also helps the Dodge Daytona was incredibly fast, as in, the first NASCAR to break 200 mph kind of fast.
Then came the Plymouth Superbird, which underwent a few exterior modifications to make it a slightly more attractive machine to sell. The nose was resculpted and the wing moved up further on the trunk, and argubaly, it does look better. However, it was about 3 mph slower than the Dodge Daytona on the track, which made a big difference on race day.
Still, none other than Richard Petty returned to race for Plymouth in the 1970 NASCAR season and decimated with the slightly slower car. In fact, the Superbird and Daytona won 33 out of 48 races in the 1970 season. NASCAR eventually introduced regulations to curb engine displacement for aero cars like the Superbird and Daytona, which effectively killed both cars in one swoop. Still, to this day, both represent something pretty special: a true street-legal race car.
NEW YORK -- Quite a rally for Rumor -- a commanding comeback for German shepherds, too.
Rumor was crowned America's top dog Tuesday night when, a year after a near miss on the very same green carpet, she came out of retirement to win best in show at the Westminster Kennel Club.
Cheered loudly all around the ring by a packed crowd at Madison Square Garden, she's just the second German shepherd champion at the event that began in 1877.
"Unbelievable," handler and co-owner Kent Boyles said.
In a year that's seen lots of late, startling twists in sports -- think Patriots, Cubs and Cavaliers -- Rumor pulled something of a shocker. She'd been at home in Wisconsin for months, a house pet headed toward having puppies, when she suddenly jumped back into the show ring in January.
Some 2,800 dogs were entered in the 141st Westminster canine competition. Rumor, named after an Adele song, took home the prize as best in show. AP Photo/Frank Franklin II
Boyles is a fan of the Packers and star quarterback Aaron Rodgers. Seeing a pet go from the couch to this top prize, heck, that's a dog world Hail Mary.
The 5-year-old Rumor beat out a Norwegian elkhound, a Pekingese, a miniature poodle, an Irish setter, a boxer and a Norwich terrier in the final ring. The Irish setter called Adrian finished second.
"The German shepherd standard talks about quality and nobility," judge Thomas Bradley III said. "When you recognize it, it hits you at home, and that's what it really is. She is just magnificent."
Rumor is named for the hit song "Rumor Has It" by Adele, a champion herself after sweeping the major categories at the Grammy Awards on Sunday.
This was the 104th career win for Rumor, and earlier in the day, Boyles said that this would definitely, for real, be her last major show.
"She's going to be relaxing for a while," Boyles said after the win, but ultimately, there are "puppies in her future."
Clearly the crowd favorite, Rumor came out flying into the best-of-seven final ring to fans whistling and calling her name.
Rumor raised up for a well-deserved treat right after the win. Moments later, as Boyles did post-show interviews, Rumor spotted him and ran toward the man who guided her to victory.
Rumor joined the fittingly named Manhattan in 1987 as the only German shepherds to go best in show at the Garden.
There were nearly 2,800 dogs entered in the 141st Westminster canine competition, spread across the 202 eligible breeds and varieties.
The moment any German shepherd steps into the ring at the Garden, the crowd goes crazy.
New Yorkers just love 'em.
Some say it's because rooting for a German shepherd is the same as putting on an NYPD or FDNY hat, standing up for a dog that stood tall at a time of the city's greatest need.
"My sentiments, exactly," Boyles said.
While German shepherds hadn't won a lot here, many of them were on the green carpet of the center ring in 2002 when Westminster honored search and rescue dogs for their tireless work at the World Trade Center and Pentagon following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The solemn tribute is considered by many the most cherished memory ever at Westminster.
"They're loyal, dependable dogs that you can count on," Boyles said.
Rumor nearly won Westminster last year. She came to town as the nation's No. 1 show dog with more than 100 overall ribbons but was beaten in a surprise by a German shorthaired pointer named CJ.
In fact, when the judge began to announce his champion pick with "German sh...," Boyles took a step forward, anticipating the prize.
"I was thinking," Boyles said.
That was supposed to be Rumor's last show, and she was set to head home with Boyles to Edgerton, Wisconsin, to be a house pet and have puppies. She didn't conceive and late in the year, Boyles thought twice about Rumor's retirement.
"She liked to show and was in good shape, so we thought, why not?" he said.
Rumor went back on the circuit in January for 10 shows. She won the herding group Monday night at the Garden, beating top show favorite Preston the puli.
She topped that with the ultimate win at America's most prestigious dog show, rewarding the faith German shepherd fans always show in them.
"It's a recognizable dog, people have liked them for a long, long time," WKC President Sean McCarthy said earlier. "I think it goes back to Rin Tin Tin."
Kinder Morgan Canada plans to restart construction on the Trans Mountain pipeline in August.
But to do that, it needs cash that doesn't come from its own coffers, since the company halted spending on the project in April and will sell it to the federal government within the coming months.
READ MORE: Trans Mountain outlines construction plans for next 6 months in Alberta, B.C.
How much cash exactly?
Up to $1 billion, according to an official from the Department of Finance, and it will not need to be repaid by the company.
Instead, the money will be made available in a fund backstopped by Export Development Canada that the company can draw from as it encounters costs from restarting work on the project.
Here's what you need to know about how that $1 billion breaks down, what it will be spent on, and how it will likely be repaid.
How does this actually work?
On May 29, Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced the federal government would spend $4.5 billion to buy all of Kinder Morgan Canada's Trans Mountain-related assets.
That includes the existing pipeline, the management team attached to the expansion project, and the Burnaby terminal at the end of the pipeline's route.
WATCH BELOW: Morneau talks about when and how they would sell Trans Mountain pipeline
Along with that, his department also said the government had reached an agreement with Kinder Morgan to restart construction on the project this summer.
“The Government of Canada will guarantee financing for the 2018 summer construction season, through a loan guarantee from Export Development Canada,” read briefing materials provided by journalists at the announcement.
“This guarantee will ensure that construction work on the project is restarted without delay.”

What that means is Kinder Morgan did not want to have to pay for any further work on a project it is walking away from.
But the government has faced criticism that continued delays will cost construction jobs this summer for workers who were expected to have jobs in Alberta and B.C. as the project broke ground.
A loan guarantee means Kinder Morgan can restart work without having to pay for that work itself.
However, the details of exactly how much would be provided through that loan guarantee had not previously been made clear.
Who is paying for this?
To make the money available to Kinder Morgan, the government is setting up what's known as a construction credit facility.
Such facilities are commonplace with construction projects, said Richard Masson, CEO of the Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission and former vice-president for risk management at Nexen, because it limits risk to the company doing the work.
“It's essentially a way to take away the risks from Kinder for doing work this summer that the federal government wants to see done to keep the pipeline on track,” he said.

Normally, the company doing the work would provide the backstop for the credit facility.
If the project could not be completed, it would then repay the costs it withdrew from the facility itself.

But the Trans Mountain expansion is different — Kinder Morgan has thrown up its hands and said it is no longer willing to invest more money in the project.
Having Export Development Canada backstops the loan guarantee for the credit facility is “a little bit abnormal,” Masson said, and shows Kinder Morgan wasn't willing to take the risk itself.
The structure and amount, however, are not out of the ordinary for the industry, he said.

“A construction credit facility would be a very common thing. What that means is there'd be a syndicate of banks, probably three to five, maybe seven banks in this billion-dollar facility. Most of them already have relations with Kinder Morgan — they're all the big Canadian banks, typically,” he said.
Masson said once the money is borrowed from the facility, a bond can be issued into the market by the government.
“They'll use the proceeds of that to pay down the construction facility,” he said. “Then they'll keep drawing on the construction facility again until they get to the billion dollars.”
Masson said while he worked at Nexen, the company used the same approach to finance construction of its Sturgeon refinery in Edmonton.
The construction facility for that project was $3.5 billion.
“It's the most flexible way to get the cash you need and then periodically, you finance that either by issuing bonds or the federal government just puts direct money into it,” he said.
What will happen next?
According to the filings made by Kinder Morgan Canada with the National Energy Board on Tuesday, work on the expansion will begin in Alberta in August.
Work in the North Thompson region of British Columbia will start in late September.
It will not only be manual labour that the company can draw from the construction facility to fund, though.
“The 2018 work plan includes a variety of activities required to construct the Expansion Project, including the work to acquire needed permits, finalize aspects of design, complete construction contracts, and clear land as needed,” the finance official said.
All of those things, Masson noted, are part of the usual range of activities considered in the construction phase of a project.
As well, once the government buys the pipeline — or finds another buyer — the construction facility will likely remain in place until the work is completed.
“Trans Mountain Pipeline L.P. entered into a credit agreement for the EDC-guaranteed lending facility on June 14, 2018,” the official said.
“Construction lending facilities are typically drawn down as required by work plans.”
Kinder Morgan's original timeline for the project aimed to complete construction by the end of 2020.
Despite the kerfuffle, Masson said the plans submitted to the National Energy Board appear to suggest things remain on track.
The Scorpions led 36-30 after 11 races but then the Witches turned the meeting on its head by reeling off two heat maximums and a heat advantage to turn that six-point deficit into a four-point win.
It was the manner of the defeat that angered Godfrey the most, especially after they had taken a morale-boosting victory at Workington the previous weekend.
“I am not happy,” he told the Telegraph. “I am relaxed about it but not happy.
“You see them win away from home but then they can't win in front of their own supporters. There are some riders constantly letting us down.
“It is getting to the point where I am thinking of throwing in the white towel but I don't want to dwell on that.
“It is incomprehendable how we can win away but not at home. All I want to do is win at home and we can't even do that.
“We will regroup, battle on and see what next week brings but we should be winning our home meetings.”
The turning point came in heat 12 when Lewis Kerr and Tero Aarnio came up against Cameron Heeps and Conor Mountain.
Looking at the line up, you would have expected a shared heat at the very least but the Ipswich riders gated and the Scorpions duo were not able to land a blow.
“Midway through we looked comfortable and I thought we would hang on to it,” Godfrey continued.
“The surprise result was the 1-5 with Lewis Kerr and Tero Aarnio against Cameron Heeps and Conor Mountain.
“No disrespect to Conor Mountain but he should not be beating our riders round our track no matter what. The writing was on the wall from then.
“The track produced some passing but it was them passing us round the outside once again.
“I can't say it enough about opposition riders passing us round the outside – that is not how it is supposed to be.
“Danny King was amazing and he rode the track like it should be ridden. I wish I could afford Danny King because he was sublime.”
Residents of a Hartlepool care home marked Dementia Awareness Week with a series of inspiring events and activities.
Queens Meadow Care Home, in Stockton Road, brought in an entertainer, arranged trips and completed a community walk as part of the week-long initiative.
A dementia dance was held at The Borough Hall where residents also took part in sporting activities and enjoyed a tasty meal.
Resident Maureen Jones, who was one of those who attended the dance, said: “It was absolutely fantastic. I loved having a dance.”
Entertainer Gilly performed songs from the 1950s and 60s at the home and a Move a Memory Mile Walk took place at Ward Jackson Park, organised by the Tees Dementia Collective and Hartlepool Borough Council.
The residents also painted forget-me-not flowers to decorate the home's tearoom ahead of a coffee morning with their relatives to round-off the week.
A celebration meal was also held at the Travellers Rest.
Activities coordinator Debbie Wilkes said: “The residents' smiles say it all about how much they've enjoyed the activities during Dementia Awareness Week.
“It has been a fantastic and inspiring week for everyone.”
A raffle was also held during with prizes including a home-made cake and fruit basket.

A victorious Indian team after their series victory against Sri Lanka More
After Mahendra Singh Dhoni bid adieu to Test Cricket in December 2014, Virat Kohli took over the leadership role. While there were no doubts about his credentials with the willow, there were speculations regarding the manner in which he would embrace the captain's role.
It's almost been three years and Kohli is yet to lose a Test series. In 29 games, the Indian team boasts of a win percentage of 64.29 with 18 victories under the captaincy of the swashbuckling batsman from New Delhi.
In our article, we have figured out five of his best wins as the skipper of the Indian Test team
#5 India vs Sri Lanka- August 2015 - Colombo
India didn't have the greatest of starts in the Test series against Sri Lanka, when their batting collapsed while chasing a modest target in the fourth innings of the first test.
Kohli was pretty new to Test leadership and the road forward in the series was an opportunity for him to manifest his mettle and temperament.
He did it in style and guided India to a rampaging victory by a staggering margin of 278 runs in the second Test at Colombo. After setting the Lankans a target of 412 runs, India shot them out for 134 runs to draw level in the series.
Although the Indian skipper failed in the second innings, he compiled a breezy knock of 78 runs from 107 balls that included eight classical boundaries and a monstrous six.
​
#4 India vs South Africa- December 2015- New Delhi
South Africa was beaten comprehensively by India More
India, with a couple of wins in the first three Tests of the series, had already taken an unassailable lead in the series. The fourth and final Test at New Delhi was a mere formality. Nevertheless, it fetched Virat Kohli's men with their most comprehensive victory of the series by 337 runs.
South Africa tried their hearts out to defy India the victory, but the Men in Blue were too good to be perturbed. Ajinkya Rahane notched up a couple of centuries on the back of which India posted decent scores in both the innings.
South Africa were outclassed - and cheaply on both occasions, and India claimed the series 3-0. Virat Kohli scored 42 runs and 88 runs respectively, which helped India put runs on the board.

#3 India vs Australia - March 2017- Bengaluru

Let's allow Caroline Framke of Vox to kick this off for us, with a succinct reminder about our favorite drunken aunt of an awards show: Globes gonna Globe.
Based on its placement in the run-up to the Oscars, as well as its often entertaining (read: open bar) awards ceremony, the Globes often get treated as a weather vane for what's to come. It's easy to understand why: something wins big in the Musical or Comedy category before the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has finished submitting its nominations, and all of a sudden it's got momentum. It's already racking up prizes! Winners have given charming, perhaps slightly tipsy speeches! A moderate hit becomes a bigger one! On the flip side, maybe a heralded film in a crowded field gets shut out, and there are whispers of a snub. Thinkpieces are written — Why Are We Ignoring That Movie? Suddenly, voting for one of several great films becomes something of a righteous act. And, of course, there's a possibility of backlash or boredom. Life comes at you fast, even if you're a movie star.
With all that, is it any wonder that the Globes feel bigger and more significant each year? What all that buzz and press hides, however, is that this is a mercurial group with a small voting base who are consistent in only one respect: they're all over the place. That's how you get previous wins for Gina Rodriguez and Rachel Bloom followed by radio silence, or plenty of love for Call Me by Your Name, though none in the categories of Screenplay or Director. It makes for an interesting list with some unexpected (and often welcome) names — looking at you, SMILF! — but also with loads of seemingly inexplicable snubs. That's the Globes. That, and loads of alcohol.
So, here we are, and though you likely have a number of complaints about this roster — we sure do — it sure as hell isn't a boring lineup. What follows are our sometimes disgruntled, sometimes delighted picks for who should win and our totally baseless predictions for who will. Consider them our personal shots in the dark, but I wouldn't put any money down. After all, Globes gonna Globe. We'll be watching, drinks in hand, on January 7th.

But yeah, this one goes to the Pixar movie, both because it's a Pixar movie and because Coco is one of the studio's best outings in recent years.

Before you start tearing your hair out (as we did) over the exclusion of probable Oscar nominees like Call Me by Your Name, Get Out, and The Emoji Movie, take a deep breath and note the omission of either ‘original' or ‘adapted' above. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association doesn't distinguish between the two categories, so this category is always a little odd. Lady Bird's thoughtful, compassionate coming-of-age story should snatch a win here, but we're guessing the widespread love for Guillermo Del Toro's Cold War fish man romance will sweep it to victory here, as well. –Allison Shoemaker

Our pick (and the Globes, we think) will go to the two composers doing really radical stuff: we love Zimmer blurring the lines between score and sound design in Dunkirk, but the haunting, unsettling strings and piano of Jonny Greenwood's work on Phantom Thread gets the pick from us (mostly because we expect some There Will Be Blood shenanigans will happen due to the heavy use of existing classical music in the film). –Clint Worthington

To say the least, it's a bit unusual to see a nomination for Plummer, given that a) nobody's really seen All the Money in the World as of this writing, and b) it's a performance shot under the gun in just a few days' time. But hey, if his Spacey-supplanting work is good enough for the HFPA, it'll hopefully be good enough for the rest of us. Anyway, for all of the great performances in this category, the day and probably most of the upcoming awards season will belong to Dafoe's humane portrayal of a motel owner forced to walk the line between empathizing with his embattled residents and doing his job. –Dominick Suzanne-Mayer

Octavia Spencer, The Shape of Water
Who Should Win: Laurie Metcalf
Who Will Win: Allison Janney
Globes voters will be particularly hard-pressed to pick between fierce, protective mamas in Metcalf and Janney, but the rest of the field is fairly solid. Spencer's performance is fantastic, but suffers from the rest of the ensemble being just as impeccable, and Chau does fine work in Downsizing, but struggles to overcome the script's suspect racial politics (and the character's pidgin English). Personally, we think Metcalf's work in Lady Bird is revelatory and deserves recognition, but it's possible that Janney's brio in the showier film of the two might pull her through. –Clint Worthington

As we get another day closer to July 1 — Cannabis Day — the issues surrounding legalized marijuana continue to smoke away.
One of the things hopeful retailers are trying to deal with is branding and marketing.
Ottawa wants something akin to plain packaging with limited graphics and colors. Producers don't like that.
We've already heard from the experts that black market pot is good quality at a reasonable price, and the legal sellers say if there is nothing to differentiate between legal and not, it's a race to the bottom with competition based only on price.
The government side is that they don't want to see a promotion that appeals to youth or shows some famous person toking up.
They want TV ads only during shows where mostly adults would be expected to be watching.
There will, of course, be warnings on the packages.
Just exactly what these pot packages will look like is yet to be decided and the government is open to your thoughts until January 20.
Let me know how you think the pleasure and packaging and prohibitions and pot parity can be balanced.

Exclusive Ten days after Google lost a Right To Be Forgotten judgment in London's High Court, one of the search results the judge ordered the search giant to delete was still online – until The Register asked Mountain View what it was doing there.
The result in question came up when the real name of NT2, the businessman who successfully sued Google under the Data Protection Act 1998 for misuse of private information, was entered into Google Search.
The search showed a snippet of, and a link to, a news story from the early part of this century written at the time that NT2 was found guilty of a criminal offence (conspiracy to intercept communications) while he was running "a controversial business that was the subject of public opposition over its practices".
We are banned from telling you who NT2 is, or giving any more details about either his business or his conviction, by a court-imposed reporting restriction order.
Test searches carried out by The Register using a variety of device types, operating systems (Windows, iOS, Android), browsers (Firefox, Chrome and Safari) and connection methods (wired/Wi-Fi/4G) all returned the same result – until late last night.
The Register has confirmed with the High Court that the delisting order was made against Google on Friday 13 April, the same day that the judgment was handed down by trial judge Mr Justice Warby. We understand that the terms of the order gave Google seven days to comply and told it to remove the offending result from display to searchers in the UK, the EU or the European Free Trade Area.
Other Google search results linking to news reports from the time of NT2's conviction have since begun appearing prominently on searches for the businessman's name.
On the face of it, this put Google into direct conflict with the High Court. Not doing something set out in a court judgment or order is normally regarded as contempt of court, a serious matter that can lead to fines – or even prison time for individuals. Immediately going ahead and doing the thing ordered by the court (in this case deleting the search result) is normally enough to "purge the contempt", in the legal jargon.
Google strenuously denied yesterday that the offending search result (known to El Reg through the terms of the reporting restriction order) was wrongly displayed, telling us that it had complied with the order – but then Google quietly deleted it overnight without saying a word. The advertising technology company has repeatedly declined to comment on the record.
We have also asked law firm Carter-Ruck, NT2's solicitors, to comment. They politely declined. ®

RSA USA Representative Michael McCaul (R-TX), head of the US House Committee on Homeland Security, seemed a tad off-message today at the RSA USA security conference.
He told an audience in San Francisco this morning that his committee had examined proposals to demand mandatory backdoors in encryption products and software to help crimefighters snoop on people – and rejected the idea outright. It was not in American interests to weaken security we all depend on, he said.
“I believe creating backdoors into our platforms would be a huge mistake,” the Republican warned. “It would put our personal data at risk and provide the perfect platform for intrusion.”
These views are somewhat at odds with President Donald Trump, who has said technology companies should be backdooring their products to help the Feds and police. FBI director James “adult conversation” Comey won't be amused by McCaul's conclusions, either.
There is a problem with criminals “going dark” using encryption, McCaul accepted, so he and others are trying to put together an official commission to investigate the best way forward, using the finest minds in the security industry and government.
McCaul also clashed with official policy by saying that the US needs more skilled immigrants if it is to secure its online borders. America's doors “must stay open,” he said, and while the H-1B system needs to be “streamlined,” we need to recruit the top talent to the US's side.
That said, America needs to make sure it's nurturing its own talent. The government cybersecurity scholarship scheme was bearing fruit, he said, and he was also working on raising salaries for government IT staff so that the state isn't losing talent to private industry.
McCaul said there was “no doubt in my mind” that Russians hackers tried to influence the last election, and that his committee had been briefed on the matter. He said he was “disappointed” in the reaction of both political sides of Congress to the hacking, saying that there was a worrying lack of enthusiasm for action.
“We had the information to stop the 9/11 attacks but didn't connect the dots, and now we're in the same place on cyber,” he said. “We're fighting 21st century threats with 20th century technology and a 19th century bureaucracy.”
The US must reserve the right to strike back when hacked, he said, particularly where such incursions were an attempt to disrupt the democratic process. That was a “red line” that mustn't be crossed, he opined. ®
Rural crime claims have risen by more than a fifth in the first half of the year, a new report has suggested.
Despite a slight drop in the cost of such crime to just under £40million last year, early claims statistics show a sharp increase in the first half of 2017, NFU Mutual said.
Releasing its annual report on rural crime across the four regions of the UK for last year, the insurer described farmyards being turned into fortresses to ward off "brazen" thieves.
It said farmers have taken high-tech steps including using infra-red surveillance and installing tracking devices on their tractors.
The apparent rise in the first half of 2017 compared to the same period last year is "deeply worrying", Tim Price of NFU Mutual said.
England bore the brunt of the 2016 crime cost at just under £34million, while the cost to Northern Ireland was £2.5million, Scotland £1.6million, and Wales £1.3million.
North East England was the worst-affected area last year, the report said, with such crime costing more than £7million - an increase of almost 9% on 2015.
Lincolnshire came top for the worst-affected county at £2,499,521, while Lancashire experienced a 40% drop in theft costs since 2015.
Tools and quads were the most targeted items, with the cost of thefts of the latter rising to £2million last year, the report said.
Livestock theft cost an estimated £2.2million last year, falling everywhere apart from Wales, it added.
Mr Price, NFU Mutual Rural Affairs Specialist, said: "While the fall in rural theft in 2016 is welcome news, the sharp rise in the first half of 2017 is deeply worrying.
"Countryside criminals are becoming more brazen and farmers are now having to continually increase security and adopt new ways of protecting their equipment.
"In some parts of the country, farmers are having to turn their farmyards into fortresses to protect themselves from repeated thieves who are targeting quads, tractors and power tools."
He added that partnerships between police, farmers and rural organisations had helped tackle rural crime.

BURNABY, B.C. – A look at some key developments from Day Seven of the B.C. election campaign for each of the parties:
NDP:
— Leader John Horgan promised at a campaign stop in Burnaby to build urgent-care centres to address the province's family doctor shortage and ease pressure on walk-in clinics and emergency rooms.
— The centres would be open evenings and weekends and use a team-based approach, meaning patients would access the care provider that fits their needs, whether it's a doctor, nurse practitioner, counsellor or dietician.
— But the promise didn't include a proposed number of centres or a cost estimate, and Horgan would only say a NDP government would shift priorities to make room in the existing health budget.
— He criticized the B.C. Liberals' “GP for Me” program, saying Leader Christy Clark promised more doctors, then “finally gave up two years ago when they knew they weren't going to meet their targets.”
READ MORE: A quick sketch of B.C. NDP Leader John Horgan
LIBERALS:
— Christy Clark campaigned in Campbell River, highlighting her government's record in helping business and said they have a plan to phase out provincial sales tax on electricity, saving businesses $160 million a year.
— Clark said the B.C. Liberal government has a successful economic record on Vancouver Island, which is typically a NDP stronghold.
— She said the unemployment rate on the north island is half of what it was under the last NDP government before the Liberals came to power in 2001.
— Naomi Yamamoto, the Liberal candidate for North Vancouver-Lonsdale, posted on social media that one of her signs had been defaced with a spray-painted swastika. The NDP candidate in the riding has also posted a photo of her sign with a red swastika painted on it. Candidates on all sides condemned the graffiti.
GREENS:
— Leader Andrew Weaver unveiled his party's democratic reform platform, which includes switching to a proportional representation electoral system.
— Weaver promised to: establish a public watchdog to oversee government advertising and communications; block cabinet ministers from engaging in partisan fundraising; ban corporate, union and out-of-province donations; and place limits on individual contributions.
READ MORE: A quick sketch of B.C. Green Leader Andrew Weaver
— He reminded voters that his party banned corporate and union donations in September, while the Liberals and NDP still allow them. The New Democrats have promised to ban them if elected while the Liberals would convene a panel to review campaign financing.
— Weaver said the Greens would also establish a provincial budget officer to provide independent analysis to the legislature on the state of the province's finances, the government's estimates and economic trends.
ISLAMABAD, June 15 (APP): The Advisor to the Prime Minister on foreign
Affairs, Sartaj Aziz, Thursday expressed sympathies and condolences over the loss of over 130 precious lives and damage to the infrastructure due to recent landslide in hilly areas of Bangladesh.
According to the foreign office, Mr. Aziz in a letter to the foreign
Minister of Bangladesh, Abdul Hassan Mahmood Ali, MP said, “I am deeply saddened by the loss of more than 130 precious human lives and damage to infrastructure due to the recent landslides triggered by torrential rains in the hilly areas of Bangladesh. On the behalf of the people and the government of Pakistan and on my own behalf, I convey my deepest condolences to the families of the victims and pray for the early recovery of those who sustained injuries in this calamity.”
He said, “Our prayers are with you and the fraternal people of
Bangladesh. Please accept the heartfelt condolences and sympathies of the
Government and the People of Pakistan on this tragic incident.”
Alberta MLA Derek Fildebrandt is once again under fire, this time, for allegedly “double-dipping” meal expenses.
According to records that came to light Monday, the United Conservative Party MLA claimed reimbursement for both restaurant expenses and a daily meal allowance – or per diem – for the same meals on multiple occasions.
Public records show on April 28, Fildebrandt claimed per diem for lunch and dinner. He also submitted a receipt for Pita Pit for $35 as well as a receipt for Montana's Cookhouse for $136.
Then, on April 29, Fildebrandt claimed per diem for breakfast, lunch and dinner. He also submitted a receipt for Fruitatas Health Foods for $17.
Scroll down to view the meal expense claims.
Alberta Party leader Greg Clark said he found nine incidents of dual claims in Fildebrandt's expenses, which are posted online and publicly available.
“MLAs, when they're away from their home constituency — usually up in Edmonton at the legislature — are allowed to claim a day rate for meals of about $39 a day, which seems like a reasonable amount. That's instead of claiming every single meal receipt. The administration of that is a lot less than processing every meal receipt,” Clark said.
“What it appears Mr. Fildebrandt has done is claim both his day rate but also claimed meal expenses for specific meetings he would have, perhaps with constituents or a staff meeting. The concern is that he may be double-dipping on meals like he was with his apartment.”

Last week, news broke that Fildebrandt was renting out his taxpayer-funded Edmonton apartment on Airbnb.
He later apologized and promised to give the money back to the province. He also took a leave of absence as the UCP's finance critic.

Clark said he looked at a few other MLA expenses — of all parties — and only found a few one-time instances of double claiming.
“That's why I'm calling for an audit of all MLA living expenses and meal expenses: to make sure that this isn't something that's widespread.
“What's so frustrating for me is that the vast majority of MLAs that I know are honest and decent and doing it for the right reasons, maybe even claiming less than they're entitled to in many cases.”
READ MORE: Derek Fildebrandt Airbnb scandal reaction: Greg Clark says Albertans are ‘right to be upset'
In a statement issued Monday night, UCP interim leader Nathan Cooper said: “These expense claims are concerning and appear to be part of a larger pattern of behaviour that is unacceptable for a member of the United Conservative Party caucus.
“We will be working with the Legislative Assembly Office and the Members' Services Committee to ensure these expense claims are rectified.
“We will continue to review UCP caucus expenses to ensure that our MLAs are held to the highest standard.”
According to the Legislative Assembly Office, once MLA expenses are posted online, they have been paid out.
The office said the speaker will be reviewing the nine alleged incidents of double claims.
The office pointed out the receipts do not necessarily indicate the meal was for that MLA. For instance, someone else in the MLA's office could have eaten it.
“Unless there are concerns raised, the per diem claims and the receipts are reviewed for compliancy separately,” said spokesperson Alex McCuaig.
McCuaig said claiming a restaurant expense and a per diem for the same meal would violate Member Services Committee Order 7.3, which says: “Expenses claimed under subsections (1) and (2) shall not include any expenses for which the Member is eligible to be reimbursed in respect of the travel under any other provision of the Members' Services Committee Orders.”

The Thames Valley District School Board (TVDSB) is facing pressure to install defibrillators, as the debate returns Tuesday to a public board of trustees meeting.
The electronic devices, known as automated external defibrillators, or AEDs, are used to treat life-threatening heart conditions before paramedics arrive. Only a handful of schools across the city are equipped with the life-saving device.
“Comparing that to the rest of the province, in my opinion, we're out of step,” said Jake Skinner, TVDSB trustee, who's pushing for the installation of the devices. “I think this is a big gap because it involves safety. I think it's something we need to address immediately.”
READ MORE: TVDSB defends lengthy process to accept defibrillator donation
Skinner is asking the board Tuesday to install defibrillators in all schools across the city. He's hoping the discussion will stretch into the board's next budget in June, recommending that funding for the medical device be included.
The decision on whether to install AEDs in London schools looms over one of southwestern Ontario's largest school boards nearly two years after a child died playing soccer near a public school west of Woodstock.
The death sparked a debate after a student who witnessed the tragedy took action to try to install a defibrillator at his school.
“We provide first aid kits to schools. Schools are equipped with fire extinguishers. How often do we have fires in schools? That's not an everyday occurrence but we're protecting ourselves,” said Skinner. “The fact is people are dying from cardiac arrest.”

The issue returned to the spotlight in February, when the Thames Valley board agreed to install a defibrillator at West Nissouri Public School after refusing to do so for two previous proposals.
The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada recommends that Canadians have widespread access to AEDs, while Ontario's education ministry is leaving the decision up to individual boards to equip schools with the devices.
Elgin Country city council voted unanimously last month in favour of a resolution by the Municipality of Thames Centre to recommend every school install AEDs.

It's one thing to take on a starring role in any TV series — it's quite another when that series is written by “Gilmore Girls” creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. A standout for her work in “House of Cards” and “Manhattan,” Rachel Brosnahan time travels back to the '50s for her turn as housewife-turned-standup in Amazon's “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” — a performance which just earned her a Golden Globe nomination.
Why did you want to play Miriam “Midge” Maisel?
There were a lot of reasons. I really love period pieces. I think history is often told by men about men, so it was exciting for me to see a woman at the center of a period piece. Midge is also unwaveringly confident. I have never played a role like that. I don't come across a lot of women like that in scripts. Trying my hand at standup was exciting to me. And I was really excited to work with a female creator, and that female creator being the brilliant woman that is Amy. I could go on.
Were you intimidated by the thought of doing standup?
Yes, very, very much. I had never really done comedy, let alone standup — and man, I don't know how those guys do it. It's one of the bravest things I can possibly imagine. I will never be that brave. Getting up in front of an audience like we do on our show has given me a taste of it — and those guys were paid to laugh at my jokes! So I had it a little bit easier.

How did you prepare for the role? Did you do any standup yourself?
Absolutely not! I would be so traumatized if I did my own stand up I would never be able to do it. If you play a doctor on TV, you probably shouldn't try performing surgery. But I did a lot for research about standup comedians of that time. I looked at a woman named Jean Powell, who is arguably one of the first female comedians. Joan Rivers. Phyllis Diller. The whole megillah. And Amy was a great resource for me as well. She's one of the funniest women I've ever met.
Her scripts are famously long and detailed — how did you learn that patter?
Definitely not like anything else I've ever worked on! It's just even more words than you think possible to speak. And faster than you can imagine your mouth can move. It's tough. They're about 15 pages longer than normal hour-longs. And on a show with a woman who already talks a lot, that's intense. I slept very little. I drank a lot of coffee. And I spent all my downtime memorizing. But once you get into the rhythm, it takes an episode or two to find Midge's voice and Amy's voice at the same time.
I think there should be a support group for women who've starred in Amy's shows.
I agree! Lauren Graham can lead us. She's the OG. I reached out to her before I started work on the pilot just to ask her if she had any advice. We've been trying to get coffee ever since, but we're on opposite coasts. I'd just love to pick her brain.
Where does Midge's abundant confidence come from?
To some degree she came out of the womb that way. I also think she's a little bit naïve. Her worldview is very narrow. She's led a very privileged life and that has helped. I also think she's somebody who does have a vision and doesn't know any other way but to keep going forward and execute it. With a little bit of luck and a lot of perseverance, she has achieved everything she set out to do. In the pilot she says at 6 she wanted to be a Russian literature major and at 12 she found her signature haircut. And at 13 she decided she was going to go to Bryn Mawr. She was going to get married and have kids. And she did all of that, exactly how she wanted to. But obviously that's a challenge when everything she's ever known and understood and falls apart. That's where the naïve confidence helps her. She doesn't know any way but forward so she keeps pushing through.
The show also pays deep homage to Midge's Judaism. Are you ready to convert at this point?
I grew up well versed in Jewish culture. A lot of it was familiar to me. I grew up on the north shore of Chicago, and I don't think I had a friend that wasn't Jewish. I spent more time in a temple than any other house of worship. I've been to about 150 bar and bat mitzvahs. And so this felt familiar to me in a way lovely way. I have so much love and admiration for the community, the culture, and I love that this show is unabashedly Jewish. There's some real inside humor in here. There's a really extended joke in one of the later episodes about a mezuzah that I was on the floor about. It's hilarious.
AGP help sought in MPs posting as govt company directors
The Lahore High Court on Friday asked Advocate General Punjab to assist the court on petitions challenging establishment of public sector companies and appointment of members of Punjab Assembly as directors. Advocate Sheraz Zaka had moved the court stating that MPAs cannot be appointed as directors of public sector companies. He pointed out that Lahore Waste Management Company, Punjab SAAF Pani Company, Lahore Transport Company and Lahore Parking company had been established in violation of law. He further said recruitment of employees was continued with Punjab Saaf Pani Company which should also be stayed as the entire company was under question. Advocate Baleegh-ur-Rehman and Advocate Khurram Chughtai represented the companies and opposed the writ petitions saying that the same matter was already being heard by another court. They questioned maintainability of the petitions. Justice Shahid Karim heard the matter and observed that this issue would be decided once for all that whether duplication of resources can be allowed when there was already a local government. The Judge said that the matter was of great significance and it would be heard on day-to-day basis from Oct 16, the next date of hearing. –Staff Reporter

After years of debate, Calgary city council voted Monday to change the application process for secondary suites.
“This takes out a number of steps in the process,” Mayor Naheed Nenshi said. “It takes the decision away from council and puts it in the hands of administration where it should have been in the first place.”
It was previously reported that 20 per cent of council's time last year was spent hearing secondary suite applications.
READ MORE: Councillor Jyoti Gondek suggests secondary suite reform could be on its way
On Monday, councillors voted 10-5 on a motion to move the process to a development permit situation.
People would apply and have to meet a set of criteria to be approved. It's not blanket rezoning that will allow suites everywhere and there will be an avenue for people to appeal based on planning reasons.

“The big day will come when the bylaw passes,” Nenshi said. “However, council has made an extraordinarily important step today. In an overwhelming majority, council said: ‘Let's fix this. Let's fix this so that we can get rid the illegal suites. Let's fix this so that the tenants have a little tiny modicum of dignity and safety in their lives.' I am so happy we've gotten to this point.”
Shane Keating's proposal to reinstate a fee for making an application was hotly debated but passed in the end. The cost per application is expected to be less than $500.

During budget talks two weeks ago, council was told each application costs the city $5,000 in lost revenue. However, that cost involved having applications processed as a land-use application, which then involved the Calgary Planning Commission and city council.
The creation of a secondary suite registry was also approved.
Administration will now prepare a bylaw with the changes and it's expected to be back in front of council in a couple of months.

Two of Benton's mainstay businesses have now joined together.
Tire Town, founded in 1964, recently hired three employees of Whitfield Tire, a company founded in 1966.
Don and Vickie Whitfield operated their business for many years, but have since closed to become a part of Tire Town, joining their good friends, Chester and Vickie Harris, in serving the people of Saline County.
“We are now employing Don Whitfield as our new service manager over the shop and two of the ASE certified Whitfield mechanics,” Vickie Harris said.
With the changes come a lot of additions for Tire Town.
Previously, the company specialized in strictly tire operations, but now will offer much more.
According to Harris, the company is adding oil changing services, electrical system repair, drive train repair, engine performances, air conditioning and heating repair and other services.
“Because of our customers' requests and demands, it is really important that we expand our mechanic shop at this time,” Harris said. “People want us to be a one-stop-shop. They want to come in and maybe wait a little bit and get a brake job, or new tires or an oil change, all while they are here.
“Before, we did not have air conditioning work and we are going to have that. We have been in the tire area before, but now we have the space and the equipment to expand.”
For the time being, while all of the new amenities will be available at 1921 Military Road, Tire Town also will offer truck service at 2506 Edison Ave. in Benton, accommodating customers of big rigs, tractors, campers and other vehicles requiring heavy machinery.
“We are going to expand soon and begin doing passenger tires here, too,” Harris said. “We have a lot of customers stop that are going to Little Rock that have a flat and things out there.”
The location of Whitfield Tire on Congo Road will no longer be used and has since been sold.

Miami Gardens, Fla. — The Miami Dolphins wore their perfect season uniforms, and for at least one game in 2017, they looked the part.
Tom Brady was intercepted twice by Xavien Howard and held without a third-down conversion Monday night, and Miami snapped the New England Patriots' eight-game winning streak with a surprising 27-20 victory.
The Dolphins (6-7) were 11-point underdogs at home, but they kept the Patriots (10-3) from clinching their ninth consecutive AFC East title — at least for another week.
“It was a bad night,” Brady said. “We've had a lot of good nights this year. This was a bad night.”
Brady went 24 for 43 for 233 yards and one touchdown. Miami sacked him twice and hit him five times, and held the Patriots to 25 yards rushing. New England was 0 for 11 on third down.
“Our focus every game is to hit the quarterback as hard as we can and make him uncomfortable,” defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh said. “I think we did a pretty good job of it.”
The Dolphins' Jay Cutler threw for 263 yards and three scores, including two to Jarvis Landry. Kenyan Drake had 114 yards rushing and 79 receiving.
A Brady touchdown pass cut the deficit to 10 points with 13 minutes left, but the Patriots' next three possessions netted 5 yards. After a New England field goal, Miami sealed the victory by recovering an onside kick with 53 seconds to go.
“This gives us a boost,” Cutler said. “Winning is what keeps you in this game. The locker room after a game, there's nothing like it.”
The Dolphins wore their 1972 uniforms, and for the first time in four prime-time appearances this season, they rose to the occasion. Miami tried to turn the game into a laugher in the third quarter when Landry caught a touchdown pass and then set the ball down in the end zone and pumped it repeatedly — a reference to the Patriots' Deflategate scandal.
“It's all about taking the air out of the ball,” Landry said.
Coach Adam Gase beat New England for the first time in four tries. His team snapped the Patriots' 14-game road winning streak, second-best ever behind San Francisco's 18 in a row from 1988-90.
Gase threw a lot of wrinkles at the Patriots early, with tight end MarQueis Gray and receivers Landry and Jakeem Grant taking turns lining up in the backfield.
“We used a lot of guys,” Cutler said. “We were mixing it up. Adam was dialing it up well.”
Cutler spun out of the grasp of blitzing safety Jordan Richards to throw a completion that kept Miami's first touchdown drive going.
The 5-foot-7 Grant made a leaping catch against Malcolm Butler his first career touchdown reception, a 25-yarder.
Meanwhile, the Patriots sputtered without tight end Rob Gronkowski, who served a one-game suspension for a late hit to the head of an opponent.
“We got beat in all three areas of the game,” coach Bill Belichick said.

Charlotte, N.C. — Justin Thomas remembers hearing the roar before he ever saw the shot.
He had access to the clubhouse at Valhalla in 2000 as the 7-year-old son of a PGA professional, and the thunder from the gallery reached his ears before the TV showed Tiger Woods making the most important putt of his career at that PGA Championship.
Thomas was barely big enough to dream of playing against the best that day. Now his name is on the same Wanamaker Trophy.
Thomas closed with a 3-under 68 on Sunday at Quail Hollow to emerge from the shadow of Jordan Spieth, his longtime friend, and capture his first major that belonged as much to him as the two generations of PGA professional that came before him.
“As a kid growing up, you want to win all the majors. You want to win any major,” Thomas said after his two-shot victory. “For me, the PGA definitely had a special place in my heart, and maybe a special drive. It's just a great win for the family, and it's a moment we'll never forget — all of us.”
On this day, the cheers were for him.
They gave him chills when his 8-foot birdie putt teetered on the edge of the 10th hole for 12 seconds before it finally dropped, when he chipped in from 40 feet on the 13th hole to seize control Sunday, and when he fired a 7-iron from 221 yards over the water to a peninsula green that all but sealed the victory.
PGA CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL RESULTS
Even more special than the trophy was seeing his father, Mike Thomas, walk toward with arms wide to wrap his only son in his arms. Thomas is the longtime pro at Harmony Landing outside Louisville, Kentucky and a former board member of the PGA of America. His father, Paul Thomas, is a 60-year PGA pro and the first one the 24-year-old Thomas called.
The week began with Spieth's quest for a career Grand Slam. He was at the 18th green late Sunday afternoon, but only so he could celebrate the moment with Thomas, close friends since they were 14.
“So awesome, dude,” Spieth told him.
Thomas was every bit of that.
With five players still in the mix on the back nine, Thomas surged ahead by chipping in for birdie and holding his nerve down the stretch as his challengers eventually faded, one after another.
Hideki Matsuyama, bidding to become the first player from Japan to win a major, recovered from back-to-back bogeys with birdies on the 14th and 15th holes to get within one shot. But the championship turned on the 16th hole.
Thomas faced a 6-foot par putt to stay at 8 under. Matsuyama caught a good lie over the green and chipped to 5 feet. Thomas wasted no time over the putt and drilled it in the center of cup. Matsuyama missed and was two shots behind.
“The last major of the year, and I was in contention,” said Matsuyama, a runner-up at the U.S. Open. “All I can do is try harder next time.”
Thomas sealed it with that 7-iron on the 17th that was so pure that he let the club twirl through his hands as he watched it clear the water and roll out to 15 feet. The birdie putt curled in and his lead was up to three going to the 18th. A final bogey only affected the score.
Thomas finished at 8-under 276 for his fourth victory of the year.
“I can't put it into words,” Thomas said about his PGA of America heritage. “I wish my grandpa could be here for it. It's so special to get it done. I'm glad we have a trophy now.”
Kevin Kisner was the last one who had a chance to catch him. But he three-putted from 100 feet on the 16th for bogey, couldn't birdie the 17th from long range and hit his second shot into the water and finished with a double bogey. Kisner, the 54-hole leader, played the final three holes in 6 over on the weekend. He closed with a 74.
“That's not going to be fun to look at,” he said of his weekend finish over the brutal closing stretch at Quail Hollow. “I thought I had to get to 10 (under) starting the day to win, and that was about right. I had every opportunity. I just didn't finish it off.”
Matsuyama also hit into the water on No. 18 and made bogey for a 72 to finish three back.
Louis Oosthuizen (70), Patrick Reed (67) and Francesco Molinari (67) tied for second, though none had a chance to win playing the 18th. Oosthuizen holed a 50-foot birdie putt on the 18th that made him a runner-up in all four majors.
For Reed, it was his first top 10 in a major.
Thomas began his move with a 35-foot birdie putt on No. 9, and then caught two breaks on the par-5 10th. His tee shot sailed left into a tree and bounced out into the fairway. Then, his 8-foot birdie putt hung on the left edge of the cup until gravity finally took over. The rule allows a player reasonable time to get to the cup, so it dropped well within the 10-second limit.
Thomas gets referred to endlessly as Spieth's best friend because Spieth, who is 3 months younger, has done so much so quickly. Their friendship dates to France when they represented the U.S. in the Evian Junior Masters. Thomas won that 36-hole event.
Ten years later, they have won consecutive majors and head into the FedEx Cup playoffs battling for PGA Tour player of the year.
Thomas won both Hawaii events at the start of the year, shooting a 59 in the Sony Open and setting the 72-hole record on the PGA Tour. He said then his goals were high. And how are they now?
“Let you know when the year's over,” he said.

One West Island woman says she cancelled her child's party at the popular trampoline park in Kirkland after she was told she had to check the box on a waiver that would allow iSaute to use photographs of the children in her care for promotional purposes. Global's Felicia Parrillo explains.
A cornerback might also be in play considering 2016 first-round pick Artie Burns appeared to take a step back in his second season.
Regardless, the Steelers are almost certain to use their top pick on the defensive side of the ball for the seventh time in eight years, as tends to happen when you give up 45 points to Jacksonville .
"I think that the group we have coming back, most of those players, are either in their prime or they are on the rise," Colbert said.
"I do believe that group has a chance to get better. Does that mean we won't add to it? If we don't change the roster we had in 2017, what reason would we think there would be any difference in the results? So, we have to be ready to be better than we were last year."
Some things to look for as Pittsburgh tries to maintain its Super Bowl window a little longer.
BELL'S FUTURE
Depending on when you ask him, Bell might hold out a week or two during the regular season.
Or he might not.
He might stay in Pittsburgh the rest of his career.
Or he might not.
Either way the All-Pro is almost certainly going to wait until late August at the earliest to sign his franchise tender if he and the Steelers can't work things out.
Pittsburgh could tip its hand about its plans at the position by taking a back in the early rounds. The Steelers used a third-round pick on James Conner last spring, but his rookie year was cut short by injury.
AIR APPARENT?
Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger went from waffling about his future to telling teammates he can go three more years. The two-time Super Bowl winner turned 36 in March and now gets to see what he can do with Randy Fichtner as the offensive co-ordinator following Todd Haley's departure.
Still, Roethlisberger isn't going to play forever. The Steelers met with high-level quarterbacks in the run-up to the draft. They haven't taken a quarterback before the fourth round since tabbing Roethlisberger with the 11th overall pick in 2004.
If they do it this time — Lamar Jackson anybody? — it would provide them time to groom the pick as Roethlisberger's eventual successor, though it's more likely they wait at least one more season.
HITS, MISSES AND BARGAINS
The Steelers are as adept as any team in the league in turning late-round picks into success stories (see Brown, Antonio). Their record in the early rounds, however, is spotty. For every Vince Williams — taken in the sixth round in 2013 who is now a starter at inside linebacker — there is a Senquez Golson.
Pittsburgh selected the cornerback in the second round in 2015. He missed all of 2015 and 2016 because of injury and then was among the final cuts in 2017.

BEIJING (Reuters) - A series of Chinese military drills near Taiwan were designed to send a clear message to the self-ruled island and China will take further steps if Taiwan independence forces persist in doing as they please, a government spokesman said on Wednesday.

Over the past year or so, China has ramped up military drills around democratic Taiwan, including flying bombers and other military aircraft around the island. Last week China drilled in the sensitive Taiwan Strait.
China claims Taiwan as its sacred territory, and its hostility towards the island has grown since the 2016 election as president of Tsai Ing-wen from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party.
China has been issuing increasingly strident calls for Taiwan to toe the line, even as Tsai has pledged to maintain the status quo and keep the peace.
Speaking at a regular news briefing, Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, said the message the People's Liberation Army was sending with its exercises was “extremely clear”.
“We have the resolute will, full confidence and sufficient ability to foil any form of Taiwan independence separatist plots and moves and to defend the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Ma said.
“If Taiwan independence forces continue to do as they please, we will take further steps,” he added, without giving details.
The military's drills are aimed at protecting peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and the interests of people on both sides of it, Ma said.
Amid the growing tension with China, Taiwan's defence ministry said on Tuesday it will simulate repelling an invading force, emergency repairs of a major air base and using civilian-operated drones as part of military exercises starting next week.
BERLIN—Confirming the market appeal of France's Cedric Klapisch after his “The Spanish Apartment” trilogy, his latest film, drama comedy “Back to Burgundy,” will have been sold significantly across the world by the end of the Berlin Festival.
More than 20 territories have already been secured, more will be closed in the next few days.
“Back to Burgundy's” powerful rollout comes as a promo of “Gauguin,” starring “Black Swan's” Vincent Cassel, on which the Cohen Media Group has U.S. rights, was presented to buyers at Berlin. Directed by Edouard Deluc (“Welcome to Argentina”), and penned by Deluc, Etienne Comar,(“Django”), Tomas Lilti (“Irreplaceable”) and Sarah Kaminsky (“Raid: Special Unit”), “Gauguin's” first major territory deals look set to go down in the next few days.
Written by Klapisch and regular co-scribe Santiago Amigorena and screened to buyers at Berlin's European Film Market, “Back to Burgundy” turns on long-gone brother Jean who returns home to France's Burgundy as he and his siblings inherit their family vineyard. Saving it, they discover their roots.
Klapisch's comedy drama stars three young French actors who have burst into the scene in the last decade to awards and significant roles: Pio Marmaï (“The First Day of the Rest of Your Life,” “Living on Love Alone”), Ana Girardot (“Next Time I'll Aim for the Heart”) and François Civil (“Elles”).
Studiocanal itself will distribute “Back To Burgundy” in its home territories of France, Germany, U.K. and Australia/New Zealand, a practice on its key foreign-language titles.
Spain (Avalon), Benelux (Cineart) and the Middle East (Salim Rania) were licensed at Berlin.
Poland, Canada and Italy will close by the end of the Festival, said Anne Cherel, Studiocanal SVP, international film sales.
Produced by Bruno Levy for Klapisch's Ce Qui Me Meut label, “Back to Burgundy” has also secured distribution in Japan with Kino Films, a frequent Studiocanal client, South Korean arthouse distributor-exhibitor T-cast, Taiwan (Movie Cloud), Singapore (Shaw) and Indonesia.
French films can be a hard sell in South East Asia. A “prestige mainstream title,” however, “Back to Burgundy” is “quintessentially French, about wine, family, and roots. It is what people love about France, and reveals the strong relationships between the vineyard workers and the wine itself,” said Cherel.
Pre-sales also took in Switzerland's Frenetic, Spentzos in Greece, Portugal's Lusomundo, Cinecolombia and Mexico's Cinemas Nueva Era. Further buyers are the Czech Republic's Cinemart, Acme for the Baltics, Lev in Israel and Brazil's Esfera Filmes.
“‘Back to Burgundy” was bought by big distributors. It was perceived as a broad commercial French film also because Cedric Klapisch is well-known after the success of ‘Spanish Apartment,' ‘Russian Dolls' and ‘Chinese Puzzle,'” Cherel said.
Shot over the four seasons, “Back to Burgundy” is also a film about natural cycles, whether generational renewal in a family or those of a vineyard. To establish change throughout the year, Klapisch hired a photographer to take a picture of a tree every day at 3 pm for one year. How the three siblings change is the heart of the film.
Wed, June 14: 42 year old Jeffrey Williamson was charged with voyeurism Wednesday by Calgary Police in connection to the ‘Canada Creep' Twitter account. A Calgary woman spoke out against Williamson saying she was disgusted that her images were posted on the account without her knowledge. Gary Bobrovitz reports.
Interoperability and certification outfit the Wi-Fi Alliance has taken on quite a challenge: getting the home-building industry to do WiFi right.
The organisation on Wednesday published a Home Design standard it hopes will see builders create homes that are free of WiFi dead spots and ready for the expected increase in connected devices around the home.
The standard offers seven templates that describe how many access points a new home is likely to require and where they should go.
The suggestions are pleasingly detailed: certification WFA1006D (PDF) specifies a Brocade access point, calls for it to link to another over CAT6a cabling and explains the spectrum that should be used for spatial streams. The designs also call for builders to “maintain less than 50 percent channel utilization with fewer than 35 devices per channel at time of installation to allow for future growth.” Which seems pretty far-sighted.
The designs are designed as guidance for those building new homes. The rest of us will have to make do with WiFI range extenders, cables behind sofas and other kludges. ®

Hardik Pandya credits MS Dhoni for keeping a cool head
The Baroda all-rounder blazed away to a 86-ball century at Kandy
by Sabyasachi Chowdhury News 14 Aug 2017, 10:40 IST
Hardik Pandya after his maiden Test century
What's the Story?
Selecting Hardik Pandya for the Test series was a huge gamble on part of the India selectors as he didn't have an impressive first-class record. However the decision paid dividends as he came out all guns blazing to first register a 86-ball century against Sri Lanka in Kandy.
In a recent interaction with the media, the swashbuckling all-rounder from Baroda spoke about Mahendra Singh Dhoni and how he has helped Pandya keep his cool during the ton.
“(It was the) first time in my life I have not had the 90s butterflies. I don't remember previous centuries, but I used to have butterflies in my stomach from what I can remember. I have said when I bat I am in a different zone. I don't think about my personal scores and achievements. It has helped me. One thing I learned from Mahi bhai is that you always put your team ahead, see the scoreboard and play accordingly. That has helped me throughout," ­Pandya said.
He also talked regarding the way he approached the 26-run over of left-arm spinner Malinda Pushpakumara. “Honestly, I didn't want to go all out in that over, but I don't know what happened. Maybe I was connecting pretty well, and scored 26 runs. It obviously feels good. I saw the scoreboard and I was batting on 80, and I was like, wow! Then I felt I was in the zone, I don't usually look at the scoreboard, I don't want to know what's happening around. I just focus on how I can help the innings progress.”- the Mumbai Indians' batsman added.
In case you didn't know…
Hardik Pandya carted the Lankan bowlers around, and blazed away to a breezy knock of 108 runs in 96 balls that included eight boundaries and seven monstrous sixes.
Pandya also had an impressive run with the bat in his debut Test when he notched up his maiden half-century in Test match cricket at Galle.
The details…
Pandya's knock also drew praises from former Indian cricketers, with Chief Selector MSK Prasad comparing him with the legendary Kapil Dev.
Pandya replied by saying that he would be delighted if he went to achieve even 10% of the Haryana Hurricane's accomplishments throughout his career.
What's next?
India is currently in a commanding position to wrap the Test series up by a margin of 3-0. Sri Lanka will have to bat out of their skins to make India bat again.
However, Pandya has batted well enough to come in the radar of the Indian selectors during India's upcoming assignments in Test cricket.
Author's Take
Though it is Test cricket, Pandya's fearless approach with the bat can turn out to be an asset for India, going forward in the format.
However, Pandya still has a long way to go in the longest format of the sport. In alien conditions like that of England, South Africa and Australia, Pandya will have to come good in order to cement his place as a genuine Test all-rounder for India.
Re: It's past time to protect the precariat, April 15
It's past time to protect the precariat, April 15
The Star has performed a valuable public service through its editorial by highlighting the recent studies from Generation Squeeze and the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, documenting an additional social justification for legislative action to update employment and labour legislation to address the new normal of contingent jobs in the labour market. Not only does the status quo facilitate growing economic and social inequality, but we now learn that the gig economy has the added cost to society of inhibiting family formation.
Faith Leaders across the province have recognized the harm caused to both workers and society at large by the denial of fairness in the workplace to part-time, temporary, casual and agency workers. That's why more than 125 clergy from a wide range of faith communities in Ontario have endorsed the Campaign for $15 and Fairness. We are ending the Jewish holiday of Passover, which has become the template for pursuit of justice for workers everywhere. It is therefore appropriate to call on the provincial government to release the Final Report of the Changing Workplace Review and to immediately table legislation to implement changes to the Employment Standards Act and the Labour Relations Act.
Precarious workers should not have to wait until after the next election to see these changes implemented. The maxim “Justice delayed is justice denied” is applicable to this issue. In the words of the prominent Rabbinic Sage Hillel, “If not now, when?”
RALEIGH, N.C. >> North Carolina State wasnt supposed to even be in this position, entering February with several marquee wins and in the discussion for an NCAA Tournament bid. Yet first-year coach Kevin Keatts isnt talking about the possibility of his program getting back there after its two-year absence.
Were not a mature enough team for me to look ahead, Keatts said in an interview with The Associated Press. We have to really stay in the moment with these guys. . Im not one of those guys wholl put up the standings on the board and say, Heres where we are. Because I think with this particular bunch, I think if you do that it can spook em.
N.C. State (15-7, 5-4 Atlantic Coast Conference) was picked to finish 12th in the league. But the Wolfpack upset then-No. 2 Arizona in the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament in November, beat another No. 2 in Duke to start January, beat current No. 20 Clemson at home and won last weekend at then-No. 10 North Carolina .
Those four Quadrant 1 wins  the selection committee has moved to a four-tiered system to evaluate quality of victories  are strong headliners to the Wolfpacks resume.

But theres still work to do. N.C. State sits at No. 64 in Fridays RPI rankings because 11 wins came against Quadrant 3 and 4 opponents. In addition, the nonconference schedule wasnt strong (ranked 269th) and there were losses to UNC Greensboro (110th in the RPI) and Northern Iowa (140th).
Baylor graduate transfer Allerik Freeman referenced the goal of getting to the NCAAs after the UNC win without being asked, but Keatts is talking about the steps immediately in front of his team.
He wants them focused on continuing to refine their fullcourt-pressure style. He also wants them to take advantage of their conditioning work, which can help them wear down opponents and cut down on their own fatigue-driven mistakes late in games such as a missed boxout or a blown defensive assignment.
Eventually I want these guys to be able to compete for 40 minutes, Keatts said. I think weve had times in games where we were 20, 25, 30 and even 35 minutes. But I want them to play selfless basketball and to play for N.C. State. I feel like if they do that then everybody will get some credit for doing it, not just one or two people.
And that just might be good enough to get the Wolfpack in on Selection Sunday.
ON THE RISE
Alabama: The Crimson Tide (14-8, 5-4 Southeastern Conference) and high-scoring freshman Collin Sexton had won five of six  including upsets of ranked Auburn and Oklahoma teams  before Wednesdays loss to Missouri . Alabama ranks 40th in the RPI.
Kansas State: The Wildcats (16-6, 5-4 Big 12) have regrouped from a bumpy early-January stretch by winning four of five. They sit at No. 66 in the RPI and have games with No. 15 West Virginia (Saturday) and No. 10 Texas Tech looming as opportunities to help their resumes.
Middle Tennessee: The Blue Raiders (17-5, 9-1 Conference USA) have lost just once since a Christmas Day loss to Miami and are 21st in the RPI.
New Mexico State: The good news is the Aggies (19-3, 6-0 Western Athletic Conference) have won eight straight and have a December win against Miami (No. 20 in RPI). But they have little room for error; there isnt much on the schedule to significantly boost their RPI (47th) while 14 of their wins have come against Quadrant 3 and 4 opponents.
FADING HOPES
Marquette: The Golden Eagles (13-9, 4-6 Big East) have lost three straight and five of seven, missing resume-helping chances against top-ranked Villanova (twice) and No. 6 Xavier in that stretch.
Maryland: The Terrapins (15-9, 4-7 Big Ten) have lost three straight and five of six. They also have a 1-7 record against Quadrant 1 opponents.
Notre Dame: Mike Breys Fighting Irish (13-9, 3-6 ACC) are just trying to stay afloat with preseason Associated Press All-American Bonzie Colson  who is roughly halfway through a projected eight-week recovery from a broken left foot  and senior point guard Matt Farrell missing time with injuries. But theyve lost six straight entering Saturdays trip to N.C. State.
Utah: The Utes (13-8, 5-5 Pac-12) had a rough January by losing five of eight. Theyre just 1-6 against Quadrant 1 teams, though they upset Arizona State last week.
NEW DELHI: 2000, 2008, 2012 and now 2018. India pulled off a sensational eight-wicket win over Australia in the big final of the ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup to become the only side in history to lift the coveted title for a record fourth time. A clinical bowling performance by India saw them restrict Australia to 216, a total that Prithvi Shaw and his men gunned down comfortably in the end - with 67 balls remaining - to etch their name in history books.The platform for the big win was laid by, first, the bowlers, who staged a terrific comeback to remove the last six Australian wickets for just 33 runs, and later by opener Manjot Kalra, who struck a 101-ball century to lead India to victory. Kalra got vital partnerships going with each batsman he batted with - 71 with Shaw, 60 with Shubman Gill and an unbeaten 89 with Harvik Desai and formed the fulcrum around which the chase revolved.Considering the kind of form India's batting was in, getting 217 was never going to be much of a hassle, and that's exactly how things panned out. Kalra and Shaw provided India a brisk start, putting on 71 inside 12 overs despite a slight intervention due to rain. Even as play resumed, the openers went about scoring at over six and saw through the first period. Shaw spanked thunderous back-to-back cover drives for four that brought up India's fifty in quick time.Shaw's short but solid knock of 29 ended when he played down the wrong line to Will Sutherland and was bowled. But there was nothing stopping Kalra, who inflicted a brutal carnage on Australia. Once he tonked Zak Evans for a six off a free hit, the left-hander looked in complete control of his innings. He brought up his fifty off 47 balls. The impact of his knock can be gauged by the fact that his partners - Shaw and Gill seemed content playing second fiddle. He played shots all round the ground and smoked three colossal sixes during his knock.The Australian bowlers were made to sweat. Although they were extremely neat in the outfield, the bowling just didn't look near about threatening to dislodge the Indian batting. Gill was outdone by a smart piece of work from Param Uppal, to whom he danced down the wicket and got bowled for 31- his first score of under 50 in the tournament. But Desai (unbeaten on 47) showed no nerves, and along with Kalra took India over the line with a four towards extra cover, shortly after Manjot had reached his century.Rahul Dravid, who coached this side to World Cup glory, said: "Really proud of the boys and the effort they put in. Proud of the effort they put in and couldn't be happier for them. Hopefully it's a memory they cherish for a long, long time, but hopefully not the lasting memory and they have many more great moments and bigger things in future. I don't want to mention names but everyone in the support staff has put in a great effort. We do the best for the kids."Earlier, in overcast conditions, Australia showed no hesitation in opting to bat first. The openers creamed their way to 32 in five overs with Jack Edwards and Max Bryant collecting boundaries frequently between them. The breakthrough was provided by Ishan Porel, once again getting into the thick of things and removing both openers in a span of four overs. Skipper Jason Sangha signalled his arrival with a boundary but struggled to rotate strike since. He went hard after a ball outside off and slashed it for Desai, who had dropped a chance earlier, to take a fabulous catch.At 59/3, India were on top. With spinners Shiva Singh and Abhishek Sharma operating in tandem and runs not easy to come by, the Australian innings showed character through Jonathan Merlo and Uppal as both batsmen began collecting boundaries at ease. The Indian bowlers were equally guilty of bowling too short, something that Merlo and Uppal dealt extremely well by rocking back onto the backfoot and sending the ball crashing towards the point boundary. The 50-run partnership was brought up off 68 deliveries and was beginning to look threatening.The promising stand was broken by Anukul Roy. Uppal, having battled hard for 34, trying to flick one to the on-side offered a leading edge and a return catch to the left-armer. Another partnership blossomed for Australia with Nathan McSweeney supporting Merlo well for 49 runs, until the batsman offered India a second caught and bowled. With five down, Merlo remained the key for Australia but Shaw rotated his bowlers so well that the boundaries dried up and Australia banked heavily on rotating strikes.India kept delivering telling blows and that mounted the pressure on Merlo, who finally perished for 76, lofting a reverse sweep for Shiva to take the catch in the deep and make Anukul the joint highest wicket-taker in the tournament. Baxter Holt was run out thanks to a beautiful piece of work in the field by Shiva and then Desai, Nagarkoti and Mavi returned to wipe out the tail.
AUGUST 14, 2017 — The Reliance Defence shipyard in Pipavav, India, last month launched two Naval Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs) built under classification of the Indian Register of Shipping (IRClass).
These vessels, named INS Shachi and INS Shruti, are the first two vessels in a five-vessel series being built in accordance to IRClass' "Rules and Regulations for Construction and Classification of Naval Ships." These rules, were jointly developed by the Indian Navy and IRClass.
In addition classification services, IRClass is also carrying out various analyses and assessments on the ships in support of assigning special notations like Direct Strength Assessment, Fatigue Design Assessment, Integrated Platform Management Systems and Integrated Bridge Systems as well as the CLEAN AIR notation, which is intended to prevent air pollution due to emission of ozone-depleting substances, nitrogen oxide and emissions contributing to global warming.
Cdr K. K. Dhawan (IN Retd.), Head of Defence Division at IRClass said: "This significant development marks a milestone in the Indian defense sector's initiative to become self-reliant. IRClass has worked closely with the Indian Navy as well as with the shipyard to ensure the successful launching of these two vessels."
A man and a woman are facing 198 total charges after a Red Deer RCMP investigation.
Police conducted search warrants at a storage locker in north Red Deer on Nov. 5 and at a home on Nov. 22. It resulted in the seizure of 29 firearms, including three shotguns, four crossbows, ammunition and stolen property, including dirt bikes, identity documents and electronics.

Police said the firearms were stored in a hockey bag, sleeping bag, a ski bag and gun cases. Investigators believe eight of the guns were stolen.
“In these two search warrants, we took 29 illegal guns out of the hands of criminals, that's significant,” Red Deer RCMP Superintendent Ken Foster said.
“We broke up an organized network that relies on regular property crime activity for their livelihood. Guns are used by drug traffickers and feed into the cycle of criminality and violence that accompany the drug trade.”
Police said the two dirt bikes seized were also stolen, while an investigation into the other property found in the search warrants.

Andrew Scott Charpentier, 25, faces 100 charges in connection to the two search warrants.
He appeared in court Dec. 5 and is scheduled to appear in court again on Tuesday.
Kelsey Pearl Trope, 25, faces 98 charges. She's scheduled to appear in court Tuesday on one of the search warrants and Dec. 19 on the second warrant.
Foster said both Trope and Charpentier are well known to police.

Red Deer Mayor Tara Veer said the city is experiencing a dynamic to local crime that it has never experienced; in particular, residents are frustrated with the high number of property theft.
“When you see that as a result of two prolific offenders there were 198 charges laid and you see the seizure of the illegal weapons that are the result of two individuals, I think it speaks to the magnitude of what our community is faced with,” Veer said.
Red Deer RCMP said the investigation was part of a larger strategy to arrest and charge prolific offenders.

MANY Kashmiris would think of 2016 as one of the worst years ever for the valley. Even otherwise, in a place that has been in a constant state of turmoil for much of its political history, it's hard to be optimistic. And when there are no civilian killings in uprisings, we have to contend with other uncomfortable developments including natural disasters. It's hard to point out which year was the worst for Kashmir. Some people may treat the entire conflict phase as an ongoing nightmare, but going through history books one finds that our pre-1947 past was no better if not worse.
Furthermore, different people from different age groups and hence experiences will have different choices for their ‘worst year ever'. For hundreds of Kashmiris, especially the victim families, 2016 would undoubtedly qualify to be the worst year of their lives. It was indeed a year of grief, but many more people may recall much more mournful years than 2016 since there is no dearth of tragic events in our past.
Pertinently, it's not just Kashmir where people are angry at 2016. Even Americans do not seem to be happy. Though Kashmiris have enough reasons to call 2016 a bad year, it's curious to know that several top American media outlets are debating whether 2016 can be termed as the ‘worst year ever' for their country. While exploring whether 2016 was indeed annus horribilis (a year of disaster or misfortune), Charles Nevin of ‘New York Times' comments, “…people in every age find reason to believe that their best times are behind them, and all that remains is decline and despair.”
Similarly, in his ‘Washington Post' piece, economist and media critic, Max Roser argues against the dubbing of 2016 as the ‘worst year' while pointing to the tendency among Americans to “almost always think that the year coming to a close is the worst”. He sees the problem partly with media's preoccupation with bad news, saying that negative subjects are almost always being highlighted. He also relates it to human psychology that pays more attention to threats than to positive changes.
Writing in ‘The New Yorker', Jia Tolentino also refers to the human tendency to recall bad events more vividly than good ones. Tolentino finds fault with Internet and the news delivered through social media.
“Everything feels too intimate, too aggressive; the interfaces that were intended to cheerfully connect us to the world have instead spawned fear and alienation.” Tolentino points out, the word “worst” invites even more depressing comparisons. In Kashmir's case, we may also conjure memories of worse years than 2016.
Historian Ramachandra Guha explored the question whether 2008 was the worst year experienced by India in his essay for Outlook magazine's special year-ender issue (12 January 2009). Pointing to the difficulty of arriving at any conclusion, Guha wrote, “I prefer not to pick one year above (or below) the rest is that, in such a choice, bias and prejudice must always play some part. The Indian for whom secularism is the most important binding value of the Republic will tend to think of 1992 (Babri Masjid demolition) and 2002 (Gujarat riots) as being the worst of all years.
The Indian motivated by a dislike of the Nehru-Gandhis might instead choose 1962 or 1975. The admirer of Mahatma Gandhi might cast his vote for the year in which the greatest of all Indians was murdered. Indian citizens of the Sikh faith may have the darkest memories of 1984.”
While dealing with the question of the ‘worst year', we must also remember that the things would still have been bad in the valley in 2016 even if Burhan had not been killed, troopers would not have used indiscriminate force and separatists would not have called for relentless shutdowns. There would still have been concerns about PDP's alliance with BJP and the latter's Hindutva agenda. Kashmiris would still have been facing human rights violations and struggling for civic rights.Many less visible sufferings and tragedies would have still persisted even without the dramatic events of 2016.
Kashmir has had a share of many bad years and some disastrous ones toowhich will all be remembered for wrong reasons. In such a situation, Kashmir looks a fitting case for hopelessness. But even if hope seems to have become more and more elusive, it resides silently in our hearts and minds. Even if we concede that it was the worst year, hope tells us that there areless than 24 hours left of the agonizing 2016.

Factory staff were evacuated after a busy Peterborough road was forced to shut due to a gas leak.
The road was shut between the roundabout joining with Shrewsbury Avenue heading towards Whirlpool UK.
Gas leak after RTC at Morley Way, Woodston EMN-170610-132505009
Police were called at 11.55am today (Friday, October 6) to the junction of Maxwell Road and Morley Way.
A spokesman for Cadent, which connects customers to the gas network, said: “We were called at 11.52am. A third party had damaged a gas service pipe (not a gas main, a service pipe supplies a property - in this case a business).
“We arrived at 12.07pm and are currently working to fix it.”
A Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: At 11.46am on Friday (October 6) crews were called to reports of a gas leak on Morley Way in Peterborough.
The emergency services at Morley Way
“Crews from Stanground, Dogsthorpe and a water carrier from Ramsey attended the incident.
“Firefighters arrived to find a gas leak at the front of a building, which had been safely evacuated before they arrived. The road was closed and a 50 metre cordon was put in place, with premises within the cordon being evacuated as a precaution.
“Engineers from National Grid identified the source of the leak and made the area safe.
“The crews returned to their stations by 2pm.”

OTTAWA— A cosier, more modest Fourth of July party than usual is scheduled for the U.S. ambassador's residence in Ottawa tonight — and the decision by some to steer clear will make it even smaller than planned. In past years, the annual Independence Day bash has been the talk of the town, with a guest list that grew to include more than 4,000 people under former ambassador and Barack Obama appointee Bruce Heyman.

Under successor Kelly Craft, however — named to the post by U.S. President Donald Trump — the guest list has been trimmed to an estimated 1,000 people. The start time was also pushed back to make it more cocktail party than picnic, said Sarah Goldfeder, a principal at Earnscliffe in Ottawa and former special assistant to two U.S. ambassadors. While some in the Ottawa social circuit bemoan having been left out this year, some who made the cut say they plan to stay away out of principle.

Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson, federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and interim Ontario Liberal leader John Fraser are among those giving the event a pass, citing trade tensions and ongoing concerns with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. “Given the current political climate, I don't think it would be appropriate,” Fraser said in an emailed statement. “I wish all of my American friends a happy Fourth of July.” Read more: Trump has us thinking Canada First on July 1st Opinion | Time to boycott vacations to the U.S.
Fraser, an Ottawa-area member of the Ontario legislature, doesn't usually go to the party anyway, a spokesman said. But Jim Watson does, and sent his regrets this year, saying he's unhappy about the “constant attacks on our country.”

A spokesman for Singh said the NDP leader was invited, but won't be attending as a show of protest against U.S. policies on trade and immigration. “While he will not be attending the July 4th celebrations, Mr. Singh knows that it will take more than symbolic gestures to successfully pressure the Trump administration,” James Smith said in an email. Goldfeder said she doesn't think the boycotts will impact the feel of the party at all. “There are a handful of people who have decided to make this a comment on the Canada-U.S. relationship and that's fair,” she said. “They're all in good, safe places to make that comment, but it's for their purposes. I don't think anyone realistically has an expectation that that's something the U.S. administration — especially this one — would be all that impressed by.” Communications staff at the U.S. embassy have not yet responded to a request for comment about the party or the boycott. In Ireland, where several Irish MPs have made a show of boycotting the Fourth of July party in Dublin, the senior U.S. official at the embassy there suggested such a move was counterproductive. “Everybody has the right to express themselves and how they do it, but I'm a firm believer in dialogue,” said Reece Smyth, the deputy chief of the U.S. mission in Dublin, which hasn't had an ambassador since Trump took office in January 2017. “Even when we disagree, I think the dialogue needs to continue as that is the only way we can come to an agreement,” Smyth told the Irish Times newspaper. Ottawa-area MP Andrew Leslie, the government's parliamentary secretary for U.S.-Canada relations, is scheduled to attend. And Conservative defence critic James Bezan is flying back to Ottawa specifically for the party. “It's our chance to go and celebrate Independence Day with the Americans and demonstrate we're friends,” said Bezan. “Members of families sometimes have difficulties, and we have to find a way to work through this.”

PanARMENIAN.Net - Armenians showed to the world a great model of soft power and today they are demonstrating unity in remembering the victims of the first Genocide of 20th century, Armenian midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan said in a Facebook post on Tuesday, April 24.
On Tuesday, Armenians worldwide are commemorating the 103rd anniversary of the Genocide which began in the Ottoman Empire in 1915 and continued until 1923. Some three dozen countries, hundreds of local government bodies and international organizations have so far recognized the killings of 1.5 million Armenians in the Ottoman Empire as Genocide. Turkey denies to this day.
"It is time to internationally recognize this crime against humanity and to empower modern society's commitment to prevent the repetition of such atrocities," the Arsenal playmaker said.
"Our gratitude to a dozen of countries that have recognized the Armenian Genocide."
(Reuters) - Most Android phones will have to wait until 2019 to duplicate the 3D sensing feature behind Apple's Face ID security, three major parts producers have told Reuters, handicapping Samsung and others on a technology that is set to be worth billions in revenue over the next few years.

The development of new features for the estimated 1.5 billion smart phones shipped annually has been at the heart of the battle for global market share over the past decade, with Apple, bolstered by its huge R&D budget, often leading.
When the iPhone 5S launched with a fingerprint-sensing home button in September 2013, for example, it took its biggest rival Samsung until just April of the next year to deliver its own in the Galaxy S5, with others following soon after.
The 3D sensing technology is expected to enhance the next generation of phones, enabling accurate facial recognition as well as secure biometrics for payments, gesture sensing, and immersive shopping and gaming experiences.
Tech research house Gartner predicts that by 2021, 40 percent of smartphones will be equipped with 3D cameras, which can also be used for so-called augmented reality, or AR, in which digital objects cling tightly to images of the real world.
“This kind of functionality is going to be very important for AR,” said Gartner analyst Jon Erensen. “I think that is something where you don't want to get left behind.”
According to parts manufacturers Viavi Solutions Inc, Finisar Corp and Ams AG, bottlenecks on key parts will mean mass adoption of 3D sensing will not happen until next year, disappointing earlier expectations.
That means that China's Huawei, Xiaomi and others could be a total of almost two years behind Apple, which launched Face ID with its iPhone X anniversary phone last September.
In particular, Android producers are struggling to source vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers, or VCSELs, a core part of Apple's Face ID hardware.
“It is going to take them a lot of time, the Android-based customers, to secure capacity throughout the whole supply chain,” said Bill Ong, senior director of investor relations from Viavi, seen as the only major supplier of optical filters needed for the 3D sensing modules.
“We may have a potential introduction of a second handset maker into 3D sensing at the end of this calendar year. (But) the volumes would be very low. In 2019 you clearly will see at least two or more Android-based phones,” he added.
Ong declined to name the company that might launch an Android phone with 3D face recognition this year but said that Viavi was in talks with all the major smart phone makers to supply the filters.
Some Android phones with 3D sensing capabilities have hit the market in small numbers, such as the Asus ZenFone AR released last year, but those models didn't use the sensors for facial recognition like the iPhone X does.
Apple, Huawei and Xiaomi all declined to comment, as did Samsung, whose current phones use a standard camera for facial recognition.
FIREPOWER
Apple's effort to get ahead with the technology is the latest evidence of an aggressive approach by the Cupertino-based company to making the most of the technological advances its financial firepower can deliver.
The iPhone maker's $390 million deal in December to secure supplies from VCSEL-maker Finisar was one such move. Another is Apple's discussions with major cobalt producers to nail down supplies for lithium-ion rechargeable batteries that power its mobile phones.
“Apple is always very focused on its supply chain,” says Gartner's Erensen. “When it comes to new technologies like this and implementing them to new phones, it's one of the ways that Apple can really can be aggressive, differentiate and take advantage of the position they have in the market.”
Several sector analysts say their channel checks show Apple was initially sourcing VCSELs chiefly from California-based Lumentum and that bottlenecks in production there last year also spurred the $390 million deal with Finisar.
Lumentum, which declined to comment, is ramping up additional manufacturing capacity for VCSELs and edge-emitting lasers for the first half of fiscal 2019, according to the company's earnings call.
It will also be helped by the purchase this week of another optical components producer Oclaro Inc. Finisar too, expects to expand in 2019.
All of that, however, still leaves the major Android producers searching for their own supplies of VCSELs.
Craig Thompson, vice president of new markets at Finisar, says interest in the technology is universal across the sector.
“Each customer has their own adoption timeline and rollout plan, which we can't discuss, but we expect the market opportunity for VCSEL technology to increase substantially in 2019,” he says.
Another producer, Austria-based Ams, also expects to have VCSEL chips widely available next year and says it has won a large deal with one phone maker.
“As part of a combined external and internal VCSEL supply chain where an external volume production supply chain is available to us, we are currently building internal VCSEL production capacity in Singapore,” Moritz Gmeiner, head of investor relations for AMS, told Reuters.
“I expect this capacity to be available for mass production next year.”
Leeds United's horror run continued against Cardiff City as they had yet another player sent-off and conceded four goals for the second home game in a row.
The Whites were forced to play the whole of the second half with a man down once again with Gaetano Berardi this time red carded for two bookable offence in the eyes of referee Graham Scott, who recently made headlines with his poor handling of a recent Chelsea cup match.
His performance was a big talking point again as he missed an off the ball challenge by Sol Bamba on Pontus Jansson that led to the United defender being stretchered off. Moments later Scott then booked Berardi for a strong challenge when he appeared to win the ball and later in the half a second foul by the Leeds full-back brought his early bath.
Leeds fans were also unhappy with the official after he denied their side a penalty after Ezgjan Alioski and they made their feelings know at half-time as the official walked off.
It was not the referee's fault that Leeds struggled defensively in the first half, however, and they went in three down at the break.
The players showed great spirit in the second half and raised hopes of a Millwall-style comeback when benefiting from a Bamba own goal, but as much as they tried their 10 men could not pull off a footballing miracle.
Cardiff, with their side of giants, were obviously going to be a big threat from set pieces and long throw-ins and they had plenty of them early on, winning the first header almost every time.
The visitors went ahead in the ninth minute when Callum Paterson headed home at the far post after Matthew Pennington had failed to clear a corner.
Leeds could have levelled two minutes later with Pierre-Michel Lasogga seeing a well struck 25-yard shot tipped onto the post by Cardiff keeper Neil Etheridge.
Lasogga was guilty of a glaring miss in the 24th minute as he seemed certain to score only to head the ball onto the crossbar from inside the six-yard box. The ball then fell to Alioski, but with the goal gaping he was not quick enough to react and saw his shot deflected wide.
The big talking point followed Jansson's injury after an off the ball incident with former United defender Bamba, but Leeds were still making the running at this stage and Lasogga put substitute Stuart Dallas in only for the Northern Irishman's shot to be too weak and easily saved by Etheridge.
The game changed towards the end of the half, though, with Cardiff going two up as Pennington was turned too easily by Paterson and from his low cross Junior Hoilett sneaked in to score with makeshift centre-back Berardi seemingly leaving the ball to go out.
Berardi's sending off followed in injury-time and from the free-kick that he gave away after going to ground the visitors netted again, centre-half Michael Morrison being left free to head home Hoilett's delivery.
Leeds did make a spirited start to the second half when Dallas's low cross was turned into his own goal by Bamba.
For all their improved play with a back three system and wings backs Dallas and Alioski doing well the Whites did not manage a shot on goal until Alioski sent a 25-yarder over in the 86th minute.
Cardiff were held at bay, however, and had few chances to load the box with set pieces with new midfielder Adam Forshaw doing a decent job as another makeshift defender. But they did put the icing on their cake in the 89th minute with a fourth goal as Anthony Pilkington was left with a tap-in from a low cross.
United head coach Thomas Christiansen was understandably down after the game.
He said: “It was a very bad day. We didn't come into the game in a good way and went a goal down early.
“When we were 1-0 down we created two good opportunities, one very clear, and were unable to score.
“After we got the injury to Pontus, the only player we have over 1m 80, in the team, it was difficult to defend against the height they had and the physical way they play with getting crosses and long throw ins.
On the cost of the defeat in terms of losing two players to injury and suspension, Christiansen added: “I don't believe Pontus will be ready for the next game after his injury.
“We know Berardi goes in 100 per cent when he tackles, but when you have been booked you have to be careful going to ground. You have to be 100 per cent sure you are going to win the ball.
“You have to have intelligence. Of course, they should have it after what's been happening, but with the emotion it's difficult. It's up to the players on the pitch. It's difficult to show them how not to take a red card because I cannot be in their mind.”

If anyone understands why Tom Brady is a great NFL quarterback, its Jim Miller.
The former Waterford Kettering High School, Michigan State and NFL QB was Bradys backup with a Super Bowl championship edition of the Patriots in 2004.
Every day, Miller was on the practice field and in the meeting rooms with Brady.
As much as possible, Miller saw up close the extraordinary preparation that has made Brady arguably the greatest QB ever, and perhaps the top football player of all time.

Sunday, Brady will attempt to take another step toward sealing his legend in Super Bowl LII vs. the Eagles.
Hes a special individual, Miller said. Its starts with his love of football. Every part of the process, he enjoys. His mental toughness is exceptional. The bigger the challenge, the more he rises to it.
To most, those are cliches. Not with Tom Brady. Its reality.
Miller remembers a game during the 2004 season. The entire week, Brady was sick with a severe case of the flu.
His temperature was 103 and he couldnt keep any food down, Miller said. There were literally beads of sweat on his forehead while he's putting on his gear for the game. I could even believe he was going to try to play. Then he went out and played the game of his life. Its the type of thing everybody with the Patriots feeds on, and its been that way year after year.
No detail is too small for Brady.
Itd be a typical Wednesday practice and there was always a fundamental hed ask me to look at, Miller said. One week, it might be footwork, the next his release.
Tom also has a vision of the field like no one else I have ever been around. He can literally see all 21 other players on both sides of the ball, and react instantly to how they are reacting after the snap. Its why he is so cool in the pocket. He can sense whether they can get to him or not, or how to just step out of trouble. Its amazing.
Millers NFL career spanned from 1996-2004. It was highlighted by leading the Bears to a 13-3 record and the playoffs in 2001.
Hes stayed close to football as a drive time host on SiriusXM Radios NFL channel, and as an analyst for Bears.
He was working the sidelines for the radio broadcast of the AFC Championship Game when the 40-year-old Brady worked more of his magic, leading a dramatic comeback win over the Jaguars.
He talked to Brady afterward.
He wants to play until hes 45, Miller said. I wouldnt doubt him. You want to know what it was like to be around him every day as his backup? Incredible. You understand his success is no mistake because of his work ethic and dedication to football.
Tom Brady is special. But its no coincidence.
His greatness, like his work ethic, is relentless.
Still, talking about firsts is a dangerous thing. “I'm totally open to being utterly and completely surprised by somebody finding something published — God only knows where, maybe in Australia or something — by someone born in Canada,” Clarke laughs. But he might be hard pressed.
“I'm trying to locate origins, and locate roots and push back against the idea that there really isn't any Black writing in Canada that anybody should care about until Austin Clarke publishes his first novel in 1964,” explains Clarke in an interview.
They were chosen by George Elliott Clarke, currently the parliamentary poet laureate and formerly the city of Toronto's poet laureate, to form Locating Home: The First African-Canadian Novel and Verse Collections (Tightrope Books).
It's a look at the origins of Black Canadian literature and includes just three works: a short novel titled Clarence and Corinne; or, God's Way, by Amelia Etta Hall Johnson and published in 1890; The Album of a Heart, a collection of poetry by R. Nathaniel Dett, published in 1911; and Citadel, a small volume of poetry published in 1967, by Anna Minerva Henderson.
“This has always been a problem in terms of Black author texts especially, because . . . it was the only way for that author to get his or her work into print at a time when unspoken racism and hierarchical beliefs . . . (had) the effect of sidelining, marginalizing, Black writers.”
Part of the reason is the work would “most likely have been self-published (so) it really couldn't really be trusted to be considered as serious literature.”
At some point in our history, English or French Canadians would have been recognized and included in anthologies and bibliographies put together by people who were “for the most part European, for the most part Caucasian” and who would not have thought to include a Black writer even if they knew the writing was there.
While Black writers were beginning to be published by more mainstream publishers in the 1960s, Henderson self-published her poetry chapbook in 1967. That seems astonishingly recent. But, “Yes, she was the first Black woman to publish a collection of poetry in Canada,” Clarke says.
And her story couldn't be more Canadian. She was born and raised in New Brunswick and was well educated: she “apparently earned the third-highest grade in the Dominion of Canada for the civil service examination” in the early part of the 20th century. She was hired to work as a secretary in the ministry of mines and resources on the back of that — and because, Clarke says, “she could, as the saying goes, pass for white.”
She began publishing her poetry in the 1930s, in little magazines, appearing alongside some of the century's great Canadian poets: E.J. Pratt, Earle Birney, “the founders of Canadian modernist poetry,” says Clarke.
But it wasn't until 1947, “the year she likely retired,” that she started working on her first book of poetry which was finally printed in 1967. “It's only 31 pages, her little chapbook of poetry, Citadel, which she self-published at the ripe old age of 80, for crying out loud,” muses Clarke.
Another barrier was that, in earlier days, creative writing wasn't being widely pursued.
“There was considerably more output in terms of writers who were concerned with history, who were concerned with politics, concerned with theology, and so these pamphlets and booklets and occasional books did come out and began being issued in the late 18th century. But creative writing took a much longer time to develop mainly because folks were first engaged with struggle against slavery, and so whoever was able to publish . . . was going to be very fervent about the need for abolition of slavery.”
Somewhat ironically, Johnson and Dett, who were much earlier, were published by more traditional publishers in the United States.
Part of the reason is that “(t)here was no Canadian audience. It has a lot to do with the relative illiteracy of many Black settlers, ex-slaves who would not have had as much opportunity to be educated and were basically struggling to survive in an environment that could be inclement in terms of climate (and where) their engagement in the economy would essentially have been as agricultural workers, help and low-paid, unskilled labour, outdoor work, indoor work as maids,” Clarke points out.
So, for the educated Dett and Johnson, the United States was the place to go. “Eventually they decided to make the trek to the United States, as did many other African Canadian literate persons or intellectuals who did manage by hook or by crook to be educated here.” There was a much larger Black presence in the U.S. and, more importantly, there were universities and publishers who would publish works by Black authors.
Even so, it's hard to tell that some of these works were written by Black writers. Their Blackness was veiled — and there are good reasons for this. Her novel was published in 1880 by The American Baptist Society, and they felt it would be a hard sell if readers knew the author was Black. So they published the book with illustrations — of white characters. Despite that, Clarke says, “the use of the language and the descriptions that she gives, of the reality of her characters, I think can more or less be easily understood as looking through an African-American context post slavery.”
Issues such as: how to attain literacy, alcoholism and worker exploitation, says Clarke.
Take this line from Johnson's Clarence and Corinne; or God's Way: “Corinne was devotedly fond of her brother, whom she considered a miracle of wisdom; and indeed the lad did have a fund of information about things in general, acquired after the manner usual to observant boys. To this was added an ardent desire to possess and education.”
“She gives us a description of a home which has been ruined by the father's alcoholism and the domestic abuse of his wife and family. But here is this Christian middle-class Black woman who is writing a novel that is meant to say there is a way out: Get yourself some education, avoid the bottle and follow Christ.”
Dett, whose volume of poetry was published more than 20 years later, in 1911, but still in the United States, was a schoolteacher and very erudite.
His poems were of their time, but in a European tradition: “There'd be no Pleasure were there no Pain; / E'en Sunshine would pall were there no Rain:” for example. Except, almost jarringly, for one titled “Pappy”: “When I was a pickaninny / Many years ago, I 'members how my mammy used ter call me.”
He was writing, Clarke points out, in an era when “plantation poems” were very popular. In particular, Dett would have been familiar with a poet named Paul Laurence Dunbar, who was famous for writing such poems. “A lot of white writers in particular were taken with his portrait of a more or less amiable enslavement,” Clarke says. “Because that was the standard, so to speak, that white readers and critics had established for Black poets at the time.”
But Dett, despite “Pappy,” referenced Italian, wrote odes and his poetry embraced a much wider tradition and his own erudition. Not writing you'd immediately think was subversive, but it was.
“By deliberately working against the plantation tradition, he is saying that Black poets are also simply writing whatever they choose as opposed to being stuck in a tradition that's being defined by white scholars,” Clarke says, point out that as a Black writer, “you don't have to focus on Black culture or Black heritage if you don't want to. In his own way he's a pioneer.”
These first books written by Black Canadians — or Black Canucks, as Clarke teasingly calls them in his introduction — might not be as good in a literary sense as later books, including those written by Black authors in the 1970s and later. But, he points out, someone had to begin the process.
“They were blazing a trail for the rest of us who have come along since, who have faced better conditions. Who have the possibility of somewhat more support, somewhat less racism and were able to publish book after book, and . . . now be seen as being part of the national literary imaginary.”

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada laid down a tough line ahead of talks on modernizing NAFTA on Monday, suggesting it could walk away if the United States pushed to remove a key dispute-settlement mechanism in the trade deal.
Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, outlining Canada's goals, said she was "very optimistic" the negotiations would be a success. NAFTA members Canada, Mexico and the United States hold their first session in Washington on Wednesday.
Canada opposes Washington's plan to scrap the so-called Chapter 19 dispute settlement mechanism, under which binational panels made binding decisions on complaints about illegal subsidies and dumping. The United States has frequently lost such cases.
"Canada will uphold and preserve the elements in NAFTA that Canadians deem key to our national interest – including a process to ensure anti-dumping and countervailing duties are only applied fairly when truly warranted," Freeland said in a speech at the University of Ottawa.
Noting that Canada had withdrawn its chief negotiator from 1987 talks on a bilateral trade treaty with the United States over the same issue, Freeland said "our government will be equally resolute." She did not elaborate.
Trade among Canada, Mexico and the United States has quadrupled since the North American Free Trade Agreement came into effect in 1994, surpassing $1 trillion in 2015. But U.S. President Donald Trump regularly calls the treaty a disaster and has threatened to walk away from it unless major changes are made, citing U.S. job losses and a trade deficit with Mexico.

Canada, like Mexico, sends the majority of its exports to the United States and would be hurt by U.S. protectionist moves.
The United States runs a slight surplus in trade of goods and services with Canada, which has mounted a major outreach campaign over the last year to persuade U.S. business leaders and politicians that NAFTA is a success.

"American partners have been listening," Freeland said. "Today, they understand ... that our relationship, the greatest economic partnership in the world, is balanced and mutually beneficial."
Freeland also said Canada would protect its system of tariffs and quotas that keep domestic dairy prices high and imports low. U.S. dairy farmers strongly dislike the system and want it dismantled.
Freeland, who predicted moments of drama during the talks, said NAFTA also needed to be updated to take into account massive advances in technology.
Canada also wants tougher labor safeguards and stronger environmental provisions "to ensure no NAFTA country weakens environmental protection to attract investment," she said.
The intersection of Bremner Boulevard and Spadina Avenue is busy at the best of times, but with the closure of the York-Bay-Yonge exit ramp from Gardiner Expressway it's about to get even busier. As Erica Vella reports, some people living in the area say they're concerned for their safety.
Cold, cold, cold this last week. Now it is getting wet. Just love Oklahoma and its sneaky way of keeping us all confused. We are that way to start with, just saying! We didn't have very many people come in this week, guess it was too cold. I don't blame you, but we did get a lot done. We have started painting the inside of our store. The hardest part is moving things to get to the walls. It is going to be great and hopefully will get it done by Old Settlers week.

The first candidate has announced his run for the office of Saline County Prosecuting Attorney.
Chris Walton, chief public defender for the county, announced today that he would be seeking the post following current prosecutor Ken Casady's announcement to not seek re-election in the May 2018 election.
Walton previously worked as a deputy prosecuting attorney in Casady's office.
“My passion for fighting crime began almost 30 years ago when my brother was the victim of a violent crime in Little Rock," Walton said. "The dedication and commitment to justice demonstrated by the law enforcement officers and prosecutor assigned to handle my brother's case left a lasting influence on me. I knew then that I was called to public service. I wanted to be able to have that kind of positive impact on people's lives.”
Walton served in the capacity of deputy prosecutor in Saline County for more than a decade, handling cases ranging from capital murder and other violent crimes to complex drug cases.
“As prosecuting attorney, I promise that I will work hard to send dangerous criminals to prison and give victims a voice," Walton said. "It is the responsibility of the prosecuting attorney to ensure that victims are informed and have a voice in the justice system,”
While serving as deputy prosecutor, Walton said local judges recommended him to state officials to serve as chief public defender. He was appointed to the position in 2015.
Prior to his service as deputy prosecutor, Walton advocated on behalf of neglected children and adults of the state.
Walton and his wife, Kathryn, have two teenage daughters. He is an active member of his church and coaches his girls' soccer teams. He received his undergraduate and graduate degrees from the UA-Little Rock.
IT IS a Yorkshire industry not much older than this year's Beaujolais nouveau, yet it dates all the way back to the Romans.
The production of wine in a region better known for its beer has been one of the most surprising rural developments of recent years, and with the announcement today of a competition to uncork England's best red, white and rosé, its bouquet was smelling fresher than ever.

A million vines are due to be planted in England and Wales this year and more than 5,000 acres are now under vine, with forecasts that the current annual output of five million bottles will double within five years.
Only a few of the nation's 500 vineyards are in Yorkshire, but the effects of climate warming and hardier strains of vine have blown away the north-south divide that used to separate the hop from the grape.
John Fletcher, runs Ryedale Vineyards in Westow, near Malton, which bills itself as the most northerly commercial wine producer in Britain.
He said: “Until recently, there were very few vineyards north of Watford, but now you can find them as far up as Cumbria.”
TV wine expert Oz Clarke tries a glass of red wine in front of Harewood House, as part of the Harewood Food and Drink Festival in 2003.
Mr Fletcher said even the French had started to buy up wine growing territory in the UK, to oversee the production of the increasingly popular English Chardonnay fizz.
The broadcaster Oz Clarke, one of those behind the inaugural UK Wine Awards, agreed the stigma once attached to the domestic product appeared finally to have fermented into a grudging admiration.
He said: “The French finally admit they like our wines. New York decides that English bubbles are the next big cool wine ‘thing', and we are planting a million new vines in our nation this year.”
The French investment has taken place so far in the milder south, although Mr Fletcher claimed that the Yorkshire climate was no longer a barrier to vine growing.
“One hazard is wet weather but as the climate improves, we can assume that we can grow wine again like we did in Roman times,” he said.
The Romans were fond of their plonk, but none of it was likely to have been of awards calibre.
“It wasn't good wine but it did have alcohol in it and it was preferable to drink dirty water,” Mr Fletcher said.
“At least it had fermented so it was sterilised.”
The reputation established by the Romans persisted until the 20th century revival – and even now, the country's producers are concerned that quaffers do not know the difference between English and “British” wine – the latter being produced here from cheap, imported grape juice.
“No other country in the world would allow English and British to be confused,” said Chris Spakouskas, whose Yorkshire Heart wine is mis en bouteille at Nun Monkton, near York.
“The big difference is the price. British wine is always cheap, and we do suffer from it. People are always telling me they can buy Country Manor for three quid and asking why we're charging £10.”
He is planting 4,000 vines in North Yorkshire this year, which will take three to four years to bear fruit.
He said: “The nearest vineyard to us is 30 miles away, and there is nothing similar in our growing conditions, our soil, our microclimate.”
Rapid growth of vineyards
Britain's wine industry has seen a rapid growth in recent years that has dispelled myths that the nation's vineyards could not compete with their rivals around the world.
The acreage planted with grape vines has grown by 135 per cent, and since 2000 acreage has nearly tripled – making wine production one of the fastest growing agricultural sectors in the UK.
This year's vine planting will yield another two million bottles of mainly sparkling wine, adding an estimated £50m to the industry
The new vines will fill an estimated 625 acres – the equivalent of planting up the whole of London's Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens combined.

Q Fleetwood made the play-offs last season but are lower mid-table so far. Any reason for the turnaround?
I feel last season when we made the play offs it was a new manager with new tactics.
He got to the players and brought in who he wanted and that's why we achieved so much last season.
However, with Charlton, Blackburn and Wigan and more great teams in League One it's always hard to compete.
The lack of experience we've had has been costing us games whereas last season we could see out a 1-0 away win. This season it's been a lot harder to do so.
Q Do you think you over-achieved last season?
We did very well last season and mostly because of the management team and the amazing facilities we have to train at so in a way we did overachieve.
However, we're a small club so a mid-table finish was always my hope and then we got to the play-offs I was very shocked.
We had very experienced players such as Conor McLaughlin, David Ball and Cian Bolger and losing Conor and David was a massive blow this season.
Q What is the mood around how Fleetwood have done so far this season?
The mood around Fleetwood is a good one.
We got to the third round of the FA Cup and forced a replay over Leicester. We should have won at home but unfortunately our journey ended at Leicester in the 2-0 loss. However, every Fleetwood fan including myself was very proud!
There is a good mood around the club as I feel we won't go down. We need about five more wins for safety and I feel we have five winnable fixtures coming up!
Q Are you worried about getting dragged into a relegation battle?
I was worried after the Gillingham game just before Christmas when we lost 2-0 at home and hadn't won in eight.
Then we got three wins in four against relegation rivals so I felt more relaxed.
However, we are back in it now because it's a six-point difference but there are a lot of teams down there at the moment.
We were always going to find it tough against two in-form teams in Gillingham, who were unbeaten in eight, and Blackburn, who were unbeaten in the last 15 games.
Q What have you made of the January transfer window. Are you happy with the players brought in and the ones that have departed?
I am delighted at this transfer window because we have brought in what we needed.
Experience was always needed and we have brought in a quality goal scorer in Paddy Madden and Toumani Diagouraga who are very well known in league football.
They will not only add vital experience but they are very gifted footballers and will add talent.
We also brought Kevin O'Connor in who looked very decent at left back.
We let Amari'i Bell go who wanted to leave, so we cashed in on him while we could and got £300,000 for him. He was a decent player and will miss him taking on players.
Devante Cole was unhappy and wanted to leave in the summer. He was left out on Saturday and has now gone to Wigan.
Q The big signing from a Scunthorpe point of view was Paddy Madden. How has he done since coming in?
Paddy has done brilliant since coming in with two goals and one assist in two starts and 25 minutes as a substitute.
I love the way he always gives 100 per cent and will run at defences and is a striker that scores goals.
He's got us a goal at Southend witch turned out to be the winner and a poachers goal at Gillingham but unfortunately it wasn't enough, but he's looking very impressive
Q You also have Toumani Diagouraga who was on trial with Scunthorpe earlier in the season. How is he playing?
Toumani Diagouraga is doing very well and is a good partner in midfield for Kyle Dempsey.
He adds experience and knows how to get out of League One. He got a goal at Southend which was a very cool and composed finish.
He's very good at getting the ball on the floor and passing. He looks very promising.
Q To complete a trio of former Scunthorpe players – how has Bobby Grant been doing?
Bobby Grant has been injured for the last two months and was massively missed.
He is another player who adds a lot of experience, playing for Accrington, Shrewsbury, Blackpool, Scunthorpe, Fleetwood and Rochdale making over 200 career appearances.
He is back training now and coming on as a substitute so hopefully we will see Bobby back starting in the next month.
Q Where will Saturday's game be won and lost?
I think the game will be won and lost by who gets the first goal.
We're very good when we score first and then can settle and get the second and the third to see off teams.
However, when we normally go 1-0 down our heads go down a bit and we find it difficult to get back into the game.
Fleetwood have not been brilliant at home as we have more pressure so Scunthorpe could take advantage of that.
2018 car sales pitch ... And this is where Amazon will store your parcels
Amid worries about social network and ad-related privacy invasions, Amazon is asking for invitations into people's homes and cars.
Expanding its Amazon Key service – by which delivery people can be granted access to the smart-locked homes of Amazon Prime members to drop off packages – the e-commerce behemoth has introduced Amazon Key In-Car, a way to have parcels dumped the trunk of a car. The car-as-mailbox service is initially available to Prime subscribers in 37 cities around the US.
About seven million car owners form the potential pool of prospects: The trunk-drop service requires Amazon Prime customers to use the Amazon Key app and to link their Amazon account with their connected car service – presently limited to 2015 or newer Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet or GMC vehicles with OnStar accounts or 2015 or newer Volvos with Volvo On Call accounts.
There are a few other caveats.
Packages that don't fit in the trunk may be squeezed in vehicle cabins, Amazon says, evidently oblivious that doing so invites smash-and-grab theft in many urban areas.
Also, cars must be parked in "an open, street-level, and publicly accessible area" within two blocks of the designated delivery address.
The service thus has potential for customers in suburbia who don't want to let delivery personnel into their homes but don't mind having their nearby cars serve as dropboxes and potentially having their windows smashed in.
For densely populated cities like San Francisco or New York City, where the idea of downtown street parking is laughable, Amazon customers would do better to have their packages delivered to their work addresses.
In 2015, Amazon, Audi and DHL conducted a pilot test in Munich, Germany, offering parcel delivery to car trunks.
Praise Bezos
Amazon offers a glowing review from a purported beta customer, identified only as "Scott L." from Miami, Florida, presumably to protect his privacy. The cherry-picked tester praises the easy set up of Amazon Key In-Car and voices appreciation for having another option for convenient delivery.
"I can't wait to check my car's trunk to see what's delivered next!" he gushes.
The idea that an Amazon customer might be surprised by products showing up in his car suggests either a drunken One-Click rampage, unauthorized orders, short-term memory loss or hacking.
Knock, knock? Oh, no one there? No problem, Amazon will let itself in via your IoT smart lock READ MORE
The last possibility appears somewhat plausible, because security researchers at least twice have shown how Amazon Key can be subverted.
MG, a security researcher who found a flaw in Amazon Key, told The Register that Amazon Key In-Car doesn't add a lot of security risk to the service.
Via Twitter message, he said, "In general, any of the security implications seem to have already been present with OnStar and the car manufacturer. The Amazon connection seems to hook in through those existing pathways. Unlike the Amazon Key (for in-home delivery), there is no hardware being added from Amazon."
MG suggested the potential risks arise from behavior outside Amazon's platform, such as inviting break-ins. "Cars are broken into around here if you leave a charger cable visible," he said, and wondered whether fewer packages will be stolen from trunks than from doorsteps.
Amazon however insists its service is safe, noting that it has a system in place to ensure vehicles get locked before delivery people can move away. The system also automatically relocks vehicles left unlocked after a certain period of time.
But if theft or car damage occur, aggrieved customers can always file an Amazon Key Happiness Guarantee claim in the hope of getting the e-commerce giant to make things right. ®

MS Dhoni will have his task cut out when he takes the field against Sri Lanka
​
What's the story?
Indian selector MSK Prasad made an interesting statement about former skipper MS Dhoni by conceding that the wicketkeeper-batsman is not an automatic choice when it comes to selection.
Talking to the media in Sri Lanka a day after the squad for the ODI and the T20I series was announced, Prasad admitted that he wants to see how Dhoni plays in the next few matches before taking a call on him and drew comparisons between the World Cup winning captain and Tennis great Andre Agassi.
"Agassi's real career only started after the age of 30. He went on to win many titles. Dhoni is not an automatic choice, but let's see how he goes," MSK Prasad.
Extra cover: Yuvraj Singh rested, not dropped for Sri Lanka, says Chairman of selectors
He also pointed out that Rishabh Pant is one of the players to watch out for in the build up to the 2019 World Cup and the selectors want him to give more chances in the T20s first and figure out his progress, something they did successfully with Hardik Pandya.
"Rishabh Pant is one of the players to watch out for. He didn't have a great South Africa tour. We are looking to give him more chances in the T20 format. Just like Hardik Pandya, we will start with the T20 format and then figure out Pant's progress," Prasad added.
In case you didn't know...
MS Dhoni has been picked in the 15-member Indian squad that will take on Sri Lanka in the ODI and the one-off T20 that will begin on August 20 at the Rangiri Dambulla stadium in Dambulla.
The squad also features the likes of Manish Pandey, Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul, Jasprit Bumrah and Yuzi Chahal coming back into the squad while the likes of Dinesh Karthik, Yuvraj Singh, Rishabh Pant, R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Umesh Yadav and Mohammad Shami have been rested.
Details
Dhoni has been struggling to get going over the last few matches and there were some calls for his retirement from the format to give chances for youngsters ahead of the 2019 World Cup.
Prasad also stated that Yuvraj Singh was not dropped but was rested from the team and there will be a new fitness parameter in place to choose who all are eligible to represent India in the future. A player who fails to pass the fitness will not be included irrespective of his status in the team.
He also gave away that KL Rahul will bat at number 4 and there are a bunch of 22-24 players who will be given a brief run in the build up to the World Cup.

Video
Author's Take
It is good to see a national selector elaborating every single decision of a team selection and giving valid reasons for why a player has been picked or dropped.
By mentioning about Dhoni's selection, he has sent out a strong message to Dhoni himself and others who are competing against him for a place in the team.
Now, the onus is on Dhoni to prove why his he deserves a spot in the team in the series against Sri Lanka and if he fails, the fans should be prepared to see their beloved player out of the team.

Of the four games with blown two-goal leads Monday night, which was the most damaging?
The Predators dashed the Blackhawks playoff hopes in a big way. Frederick Breedon/Getty Images
Craig Custance: Both the Calgary Flames and Chicago Blackhawks are now in trouble, down 3-0 after Monday night's losses, and both teams had high playoff hopes. The Flames are early enough in their development curve where every one of these losses is a lesson. At least that's a silver lining. For the Blackhawks, it's just pure disappointment. A shot at another Stanley Cup is nearly gone.
Pierre LeBrun: It certainly feels like the end for both Chicago and Calgary. The Flames even chased John Gibson from the net, but then saw the Ducks rally back for the 5-4 win. Given Calgary's dismal record in Anaheim, I don't see how they could win the next four games. If there's a team that you can believe has the 0-3 miracle in them, it's the Blackhawks, given their pedigree -- but not only did the Predators come back from two goals down Monday night, they completely owned overtime. I picked the Preds back in September to make it to the Stanley Cup finals. They finally look like that team after an inconsistent regular season.
Editor's Picks Better believe in the Leafs' kids now This thing just got serious. The Toronto Maple Leafs won for the second straight time in overtime and all of a sudden are in the driver's seat against the heavily favored Washington Capitals.
Ryan's OT goal gives Senators series lead Bobby Ryan's power-play goal in OT came after the Ottawa Senators blew a three-goal lead, and the Senators' win put the Boston Bruins down 2-1 in the first-round series.

Scott Burnside: Have to say that when the Blackhawks went up 2-0 in the second period on Patrick Kane's power-play goal, I was thinking history was about to repeat itself for Nashville, which has had the Blackhawks on the ropes the previous two times they've met in the playoffs but couldn't match Chicago's depth and will to win. But talk about redefining your character by coming back with two third-period goals and the OT winner to go up 3-0 in the series. So, if I was wrong about Nashville, does that mean I was wrong about Chicago, the top team in the Western Conference? Apparently. Chicago is cooked.
Rob Vollman: Psychologically, Calgary's loss has to be the most devastating, unquestionably. But statistically, Chicago's was probably the loss that stings most, because the Blackhawks' chances of winning the series dropped by the greatest extent Monday night. With a win, they were still very much in this series, but now their odds are near zero. The Ottawa Senators got their win back in overtime, the Washington Capitals are still very much in their series with the Toronto Maple Leafs even with its loss, and Calgary's chances of winning its series were quite modest to begin with.
MILAN – A lone Italian gunman wounded six African immigrants in a two-hour drive-by shooting spree Saturday in a small Italian city where just days earlier a Nigerian man was arrested in the gruesome killing of a teenager, officials said.
The shooting suspect was identified as Luca Traini, a 28-year-old Italian with no previous record. Traini had run as a candidate for the anti-migrant Northern League party in a local election last year in the city of Corridonia. He did not win.
A video posted by the newspaper il Resto di Carlino showed a man with an Italian flag draped over his shoulders being arrested by armed Carabinieri officers in the city centre, near where he apparently fled his car on foot. Italian news reports said the man did a Fascist salute as he was arrested, but no salute was visible in the video.
The shooting spree came days after the slaying of 18-year-old Pamela Mastropietro and amid a heated electoral campaign in Italy where anti-foreigner sentiment has become a key theme as Italy continues to struggle the migrant arrivals.
The head of the rebranded League, Matteo Salvini, has capitalized on the killing in campaign appearances, and is pledging to deport 150,000 migrants in his first year in office if his party wins control of parliament and he is named premier.
Macerata Mayor Romano Carancini confirmed that six foreigners, all black, were wounded in the shooting spree, one with life-threatening injuries.
“They were all colour, this is obviously a grave fact. As was grave what happened to Pamela. The closeness of the two events makes you imagine there could be a connection,” he said.
The teen's dismembered remains were found Wednesday in two suitcases two days after she walked away from a drug rehab community. A judge on Saturday confirmed the arrest of the main suspect, identified as 29-year-old Innocent Oseghale.
The Italian news agency ANSA reported that the black car used in Saturday's shooting spree had been seen in the area where the woman's body was found and also near where the suspect lived. A video posted by il Resto di Carlino showed what appeared to be a body on the ground on a shopping street.
Police had warned residents to stay inside while the shootings were ongoing. Authorities halted public transport and said students must be kept inside schools, which are open on Saturdays.
Italians vote in a general election on March 4 to elect a new government.
Salvini's League, which dropped the “northern” from its name in a bid for a national following, has joined a centre-right coalition with Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia and Giorgia Meloni's much smaller Brothers of Italy. They are running against Matteo Renzi's much-splintered Democratic Party and the populist 5-Star Movement.
Construction Contract Award on Hold Pending Legal Matter
The Henry Supervisors had planned to award the construction contract for the new jail and law center at their meeting this morning. However, that decision was tabled until the next meeting on Thursday. Auditor Shelly Barber said it was due to pend litigation by Prochaska and Associates against the Board of Supervisors, the project manager John Hansen and Midwest Construction Consultants. According to court records the suit was filed March 5. At 9:30 this morning the supervisors were advised by legal counsel to table any action on selecting a contractor for the project. Prochaska was hired to prior to the jail referendum vote to among other services, provide a jail needs assessment, design options for renovating or building new and assist with providing information and developing bond referendum campaign materials so the public could vote on the referendum. After the bond passed Prochaska submitted a bid for architectural services but did not get the job. Prochaska claims there were agreement letters and that John Hansen knew of these and knew of the work Prochaska intended to perform in the design, proposal and build stages. Prochaska seems to believe Hansen “cast an unfavorable and false light” on their proposal. Prochaska also claims the supervisors were in breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. And…Prochaska also claims certain documents they requested were not provided there by violating the open meetings law. It looks like Prochaska is asking for restitution totaling over $400,000 and a hold on any further work.

McLaren Senna – the New Ultimate Series
McLaren Automotive have introduced their new flagship track-oriented road-legal Ultimate Series car, christened ‘Senna'.
“You commit yourself to such a level where there is no compromise. You give everything you have; everything, absolutely everything.”
– Ayrton Senna
That's how McLaren decided to begin their description of their new Ultimate Series car, earlier codenamed ‘P15'. The Senna is a tribute to famed Brazilian racing legend Ayrton Senna, who drove for the McLaren Formula 1 team, winning three world titles in 1988, '90 and '91, and clinching the runner-up spot in 1989. After his fatal accident in 1994, Senna went down in history as one of the greatest racers ever, with many believing he was the greatest ever. While there was a British movie documentary ‘Senna' released in 2010, it's what the Brits have done now that's of even more importance.
An all-new Monocage III carbon-fibre chassis construct, carbon-fibre panels, race-derived suspension and components, driver-focussed layout, and road-legal but track-oriented characteristics make the Senna, the new Ultimate Series McLaren supercar, one of the most exciting new cars we've seen this year. Styling looks like an evolution of the 720S, with a lot more attitude, but that's what it's about. The Senna aims to break new ground in handling and driver engagement and it's got the equipment to back it all.
For starters, with every panel made from carbon-fibre, the Senna weighs in at just 1,198 kg, without any fluids. The M840TR 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 engine sits in the middle at the rear. It develops 800 PS and 800 Nm. A seven-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox drives the rear wheels, and the active aerodynamics manage downforce to allow for maximum efficiency and cornering speed. With its 668 PS/tonne, it should be breathtakingly quick and extremely fast. Although, McLaren aren't claiming any performance figures. Looking at what they've done, it's akin to what Pagani did with the Zonda Revolucion. We'll just have to wait for someone to take it to the Nürburgring and break the 6:47 barrier, then?
The structure, components, and advanced electronics all working together in perfect harmony is what it's about. The key word McLaren use is ‘connection'. It promises to connect to the drive like no other car and deliver true performance to the limit of the driver's ability, to borrow from what Andy Palmer (Vehicle Line Director, McLaren Ultimate Series) had to say. The RaceActive Chassis Control II (RCC II) hydraulic suspension works with the active front and rear aero and rigid Monocage III chassis for an intensive track experience. Yes, it is road-legal, but only just. McLaren have admitted to the compromise of ride quality on the road in order to provide that sort of experience on track.
RCC II is a double-wishbone suspension system that also features hydraulically interconnected dampers and a hydraulic replacement for conventional mechanical anti-roll bars. It further develops the variable stiffness and ride height technology first seen in the hydraulic system in the P1. The adaptive dampers are interconnected hydraulically, both left to right and front to back, with two valves per damper to independently adjust for compression and rebound. The stiffness is separately controlled using a kinetic roll system, or K-damper. The continuously variable RCC II system also adds a Race mode, making for a lower ride height, lower centre of gravity, and significantly stiffer suspension. Other dynamic parameters may be adjusted using the Active Dynamics Panel located on the centre console to select Comfort, Sport or Track modes or via a separate switch in a roof-mounted panel to access Race mode.
The Senna gets high-performance carbon-ceramic brakes and bespoke Pirelli P-Zero Trofeo R rubber mounted on only one wheel option: an ultra-lightweight alloy wheel with centre-locking wheel-nuts. The Senna is the third model to be introduced under the McLaren Track22 business plan. Only 500 of these hand-built cars will be made, each going for £750,000 (Rs 6.4 crore), all of which are already spoken for. The Senna will make its début at the Geneva Motor Show in March.

CALANGUTE
Close on the heels of the Betalbatim gang rape case involving three tourists, 11 tourists from Pune, Maharashtra have been arrested by the Calangute police for assaulting a minor boy after outraging the modesty of his minor sister.
The ugly incident occurred on Tuesday at the Baga beach in Calangute. The victims are tourists from north India.
According to complaint lodged with the police by the father of the victims, the family had come down to Goa and were enjoying themselves at the Baga beach when the incident took place. The parents were at a shack while the two minor siblings were walking along the beach when some 11 persons started clicking pictures of the girl, aged 16.
The complaint further states when the victim's brother questioned the persons on their misbehaviour with his sister, the group of tourists started assaulting the minor boy with fist blows and slaps.
Acting swiftly on the complaint, the Calangute police arrested the 11 tourists and a case has been registered against them under Sections 143, 147, 323, 354 R/w 149 of the Indian Penal

(Reuters) - Everton manager Sam Allardyce believes Arsenal are defensively weak and their tendency to commit players going forward will leave counter-attacking opportunities for his team when they visit the Emirates Stadium on Saturday.
Arsene Wenger's Arsenal have failed to keep a clean sheet in their last seven Premier League matches and were punished for some glaring defensive errors in a 3-1 defeat by Swansea City on Tuesday.
“I always felt defensively they are weak,” Allardyce told a news conference on Friday.
”If we break out with some qualities forward passes, then create some good counter-attacking opportunities.
”Swansea managed to get a result against them but the Emirates is a different kettle of fish. It's about nullifying the strengths of Arsenal.
“Arsenal's attacking force is something you have to manage. Even though they haven't scored as many goals this year as they have in recent years at this stage of the season.”
Theo Walcott is one of the Everton players Allardyce could use on the break, with the forward set to play against Arsenal for the first time since leaving the club last month.
The 28-year-old England international has made a good start at his new club, contributing an assist in Everton's 1-1 draw against West Bromwich Albion before scoring twice in a 2-1 victory over Leicester City on Wednesday.
Allardyce expects Walcott to improve further and build a partnership with fullback Seamus Coleman, who made a return to the starting lineup against Leicester following 10 months out of action following a double leg break.
“Theo has seen a lot of Seamus and Seamus has seen a lot of Theo over the years. From a distance they know each other's games very well,” the manager said.
“He's (Theo) got an opportunity to be a key player at Everton now. He played 30-plus games last season and scored 19 goals. Hopefully, he can have as good a performance at the Emirates as he did Wednesday night.”
SIALKOT - Iranian Ambassador in Pakistan Mehdi Honardoost has stressed a need for making an all-out effort to strengthen bilateral trade relations.
He was addressing a meeting of the Sialkot exporters held at Sialkot Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) after visiting several leading industrial units in Sialkot.

Presenting his welcome address, SCCI President Zahid Latif Malik said that both Iran and Pakistan are brotherly Islamic countries sharing religious, cultural and socio-political heritage, as we have common views on most of the global issues.
He said that both the countries are eager to expand bilateral cooperation in diverse fields to benefit from each other's expertise to make progress. “We understand that both the countries have agreed to set up a mechanism to ensure implementation of existing agreements, aimed at substantial increase of two-way trade. So far, Pakistan and Iran have not been able to build their relationship on an economic footing as indicated by discouraging trade figures. “I may stress here for need to take immediate and drastic steps to increase bilateral trade,” the SCCI President. The SCCI president suggested the regular exchange of the mutual trade delegations besides encouraging holding the single country trade exhibitions.

Warriors deny they've made decision on White House visit
Fake news alert: unverified sources have been reporting since Tuesday night's big win that the Golden State Warriors have unanimously decided to decline an invite to the White House. but. The organization says that is simply not true.

The reigning champs addressed the speculation, saying they “will make those decisions when and if necessary.”

AUGUST 14, 2017 — Mystery solved: Canada's Horizon Maritime Services has emerged as the buyer of the Marin Teknikk MT 6015 design offshore multipurpose vessel whose sale was recently announced by Norwegian shipbuilder Kleven (see earlier story). The vessel (Kleven yard number 379) was originally ordered by a Malaysian owner who was unable to come up with the financing.
Now, after being christened Atlantic Star in Norway, the subsea intervention and offshore field support vessel has arrived in Newfoundland & Labrador where she is to start work immediately in the waters east of the province.
St. John's and Halifax-based Horizon Maritime says the next generation environmentally-friendly Horizon Star offers reduced fuel consumption and exhaust emissions, along with high-speed, low-sound, reduced vibration levels and state of the art safety and performance capabilities.
Horizon Maritime Vice President of Business Development, Graham Curren, said the company bought the vessel to provide more flexibility and capacity than is available in the Canadian offshore.
The Horizon Star is simply "the most versatile, capable, modern vessel in the market," he said.
The capabilities and capacity of the Horizon Star are impressive. It is equipped with a helicopter pad, a crane with capacity to reach 3,000-m depths and handle massive equipment, and has a moon pool that permits the launch of subsea equipment from beneath the vessel, avoiding the tumultuous ocean surface.
The Horizon Star has accommodations for 60 people, two high-speed rescue vessels, an iceberg and emergency towing winch, oil spill recovery certification and the best available firefighting equipment.
Formed in 2015, Horizon Maritime has previously crewed and operated vessels for other owners. The acquisition of the Horizon Star marks the next stagein the company growth and expansion plan.
As Maame Biney laces up her skates for one of her last practices before heading to the Winter Olympics, her mind drifts to her upcoming 18th birthday -- and the prospect of her first cell phone.
"Dad says he's going to get me one," she says, her permagrin on full display.
Rocking a jacket from the World Junior Short Track Speed Skating Championships in Austria, where his daughter snared bronze in the 500-meter, Kweku Biney leans against the protective padding surrounding the rink. Montell Jordan plays over the loudspeakers.
A single father, Kweku Biney has long been there for his daughter -- from the time she landed at Dulles after leaving her native Ghana at age 5 till now, as she makes final preparations for the PyeongChang Games. On February 10, when she becomes the first African-American woman to represent the United States in Olympic speed skating, he'll be there, too.
"Right, daddy?" Maame asks, fixed on the phone.
"Somehow," he says, his voice barely audible over the drone of a Zamboni polishing the long track at the Utah Olympic Oval.
Maame -- pronounced "MAH-may" -- spins toward her fellow skaters, which include three-fifths of the men's Olympic short-track team. "You all just heard that!"
They needle their teammate. Heard what? They didn't hear anything. She tries to pull a reporter into her camp. Surely, someone heard it!
Kweku Biney's smile widens.
"Did I say that? No one heard it," he says, laughing.
As Maame continues her preparations, strapping on her helmet and an "E.T." glove with carbon-fiber bulbs at the tips of each finger, her father confides in the reporter.
"Phones get them in trouble, but she's mature," he says. "Eighteen, you know?"
'A Maame laugh ... settles everyone down'
With power that belies her youth, Maame is America's best hope for a medal in the 500 meters. She also qualified for the 1,500, but her specialty is the shorter race. Maame jumps off the line like a sprinter, scrambling for the critical inside position. The E.T. glove gives her just enough leverage to glide through the turns, her shoulder maybe 2 feet from the ground.
It doesn't take long to finish four-and-a-half laps of 111.111 meters each. If you're watching, go to the bathroom at your own risk.
Coach Anthony Barthell, who's known Maame since she was 11, said she was a "powerful little girl," oozing natural talent. Taller and stronger than her peers, she's like no one he's ever coached, he said, but she still has plenty of work to do on her technique -- that "push" skaters used to propel themselves to speeds of around 30 mph.
At trials in December, she won the finals by more than a half second, an eternity in speed skating. Her time of 43.161 is just over eight-tenths of a second off the world record set by British skater Elise Christie in 2016. At 18, Maame has ample time to close that gap. She beat her own personal best five or six times last year alone, Barthell said.
She has "maybe one or two more Olympics in her, possibly three," the coach told CNN.
Yet Maame's greatest contribution to Team USA isn't necessarily her athleticism. It may be her smile. We're not talking some impish simper, oh no. We're talking a toothy, 1,000-watt grin that blooms across most of her lower face.
Her positivity is boundless. Late last year, a Belgian skater's 17½-inch blade snapped, flew into her face and ripped into her lip and chin, requiring stitches. But Maame didn't dwell on that. She took to Instagram. "Who won? You guys should see the blade," she posted.
"I love having people smile and laugh because if you're smiling and laughing, then that means you're happy, and being happy ... is the best present you can ever give to anyone every single day, so I love doing that," she told CNN, a faint white battle scar on her chin.
Her hearty belly laugh, which resonates throughout the cavernous Olympic Oval, even over the Zamboni, plays into Barthell's practices.
"A Maame laugh, that just settles everyone down," he said after a recent practice. "If I see that she's tired and the morale's starting to go down -- the team, the chemistry's just a little low, the atmosphere's a little low for me -- I'll go up and crack a joke because I know it could be a horrible joke, but she's going to be the one that laughs and everyone else starts recovering a little easier."
Her demeanor hasn't changed much since she was an 11-year-old, said Barthell, who was named the US short track coach in 2016.
"I just remember her sitting there smiling and laughing and whenever I went to shake her hand, she just busted out laughing. That was my first impression of her, that she's just a happy-go-lucky kid, and she's still the same," he said. "If she's having a bad day, you can't really tell."
Maame said that at her high school in Reston, Virginia, where she calls home, she was known for "getting in trouble for laughing a lot." She said this while giggling.
That's been less of an issue her senior year. Since summer, she's been living with a host family while training for the 500 and 1,500 in Kearns, Utah, at a speed skating facility built for the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics. Though her father asked her to take a hiatus from school for the Olympics, she insisted on graduating with her friends.
She attends English and history classes, the final credits she needs for graduation, via videoconference. At competitions, she watches recordings of the classes. She does homework between training sessions and regularly emails her teachers at South Lakes High School.
"She's an A and B student. If she studies hard, she can make all As, but practice..." her father said, nodding toward the ice rink. "She's got to be a kid, too, sometimes, so I give her a pass."
From Accra to Reston
To say Maame's path to speed skating excellence was circuitous or unlikely is to sell it short.
Kweku Biney, 59, left Accra, Ghana, in the 1980s, hitchhiking north through the Sahara Desert and eventually landing in Alicante, Spain -- almost 2,300 miles away as the crow flies.
He bopped around Europe for a while -- to Sweden, Denmark, Norway and France -- before flying to the States in 1984 and settling in Hyattsville, Maryland.
Now separated, Kweku had two kids with his wife: Maame and her little brother, Nana Kojo, 15, who still lives in Accra. Maame visited her dad for the first time in 2005. It didn't begin well.
As Kweku drove her from the airport to his home in Wheaton, Maryland, Maame began bawling. She wanted to go home.
He explained that she couldn't just get back on the plane: "I have to make certain things happen before you can do that."
She stopped crying and Kweku continued driving, only to stop 3 miles down the road to console her again. Then again on the Beltway. And again at home. He decided not to get out of the car and instead drove her to Wheaton Plaza Mall (now Westfield Wheaton).
"The first store we went into was JCPenney. This girl saw how big the store is. She was just running all over. 'Daddy, I like this one. No, no, daddy, I don't like this one. I like that thing over there,'" he recounted. "I just folded my arms, stood up and just watched her just run back and forth. She got tired and I just went and bought her a few things. She stopped crying, and that was it.
"The following day, this girl told me, 'Daddy, I'm not going back to Ghana.'"
Kweku Biney was making the commute to a government healthcare contractor in Reston, the same company that employs him today. He and Maame moved into a coworkers' basement to be closer to work and school, before finding an apartment in town.
'Let her go try speed skating'
About three months after Maame's introduction to an American mall, Kweku was driving near SkateQuest in Reston, where he saw a sign: "Learn to skate."
"Maame, do you want to try this?"
"What's that, daddy?"
"You know, just glide on the ice, move on the ice."
Maame responded with a blank look. Kweku didn't know much about skating, either. Soccer had always been his sport. But his daughter gave her dad a simple answer: "Yes."
"I don't think she really understood what I'm saying because she had never seen ice before," Kweku said. "I was really scared because I thought she was going to fall and then break her head open because where we are from, there's no ice. The only thing icy there is the cold beer."
Maame instantly fell in love with skating and "did it with ease," Kweku said. It wasn't long before an instructor told Kweku that Maame wasn't cut out for figure skating. She was too fast.
"Just let her go try speed skating," the instructor said.
The switch meant years of getting up before dawn on Saturdays. Kweku didn't appreciate his daughter's dedication to the sport until that third Saturday. He was bushed and didn't want to get up.
"She was 5 years old. She said, 'Daddy, it's Saturday morning. We have to go!' and I was like, 'Oh man, I thought she was going to be sleeping.' She wasn't. She woke me up. And then we went, and I said, 'OK.' I didn't miss any time anymore," the proud papa said. "She's been running away with this thing ever since."
There were times Kweku went hungry to make sure she ate. Pricey skates, lessons and equipment meant he was never able to put away much in savings.
"I came to America with nothing, so when I die, I'm not going to take anything with me, so hey, just spend it on her," he said.
Kweku thanks God for guiding him past that SkateQuest sign in 2005, and he thanks the United States for making Maame's story possible.
"Only in America, nowhere else," he said.
Asked how he feels about the political climate surrounding immigration, considering his immigrant daughter is set to proudly wear the red, white and blue in PyeongChang, he bristled. He doesn't want Maame to be a pawn in anyone's politics. They both love America. That's all you need to know.
"I told her to never get into politics. It's a dirty business," he said. "Sports, school, God -- that's it. No politics."
'Just normal Maame'
Ask Maame about her aspirations and, as nonchalantly as some high schoolers might speak of being a doctor one day, she'll say she wants to be a chemical engineer, world speed skating champion and Olympic gold medalist. No big deal.
"I really have an interest in making things explode, and I guess my dad, he told me a few years ago that he was into chemistry when he was a little kid, so I guess chemistry runs in the family," she said.
When she takes the ice later this month, she'll not only set precedent for African-American women, but she'll be one of only four foreign-born US Olympians, the second-ever African-born US Olympian and the second African-American speedskater on a US Olympics team. Her pal, Shani Davis, who's competing in his fifth Winter Olympics, was the first.
"It's a huge thing," she said, but she isn't hung up on the racial aspect of her accomplishments.
"I have friends who accept me and who don't think of me as being an African-American," she said. "They just think of me as being normal Maame or being human."
To any youngsters her achievements might inspire, no matter their race, she has a message: "Go out there, find an ice arena or ice rink, and just skate and try it out. ... You never know. You could be the next Olympian, which is an awesome thing to be."
'It was a graceful fall'
Maame realizes she wouldn't be among the world's fastest speed skaters without her dad. She speaks to her mother in Ghana about once a week, but Kweku plays both roles here at home. It can be tough, especially at her age, she said.
"I like guys, and my dad, I'm always going to be his little girl, and I think it's a really awkward situation when you're like, 'Hey daddy, I like this guy. What do you think and stuff?' It's really hard to talk to him about it because he's like," she breaks into her best Kweku impression. "'No, you're going to get married when you're 50 years old.' All right, dad. OK. I see how it is."
But Kweku isn't one of these win-at-all-costs fathers. He wants only what's best for her and would prefer she worries about guys when she's done with school and skating, she said.
The day before she won the 500 at the Olympic trials, Maame had what she felt was a poor run in the 1,500. Where others might rejoice at finishing third and qualifying for an Olympic event, Maame has a tendency to get down on herself and worry that people won't like her unless she skates well, she said.
Kweku knew what to say.
"No matter what happens tomorrow, whether you get last or whether you get first, just know that I love you not because you're a speed skater but because you're Maame and you're my daughter," he told her.
She went on to win the trials before falling onto her rump while pumping her fists in celebration.
"It was a graceful fall," her dad said, beaming.
Biney giddily recounted the moment. "I was like, 'I made the team. Holy cow, I made the team! (Squeal!)' And then I cheered so hard that I fell."
The graceful tumble and her post-race interview charmed everyone who saw them. Despite her maturity and speed, it felt like she might never relinquish her youth.
On the Wednesday before leaving for PyeongChang, Maame attended a short practice before hitting the stationary bike. It was a recovery day, and she was looking forward to some rare downtime. Kweku reminded her she had dinner plans with her host family that evening. She has no driver's license, so he made sure she had transportation lined up.
She was headed to Park City to see a friend, she told him. Both of their birthdays are coming up, so they'd agreed to pay for each other's ticket, she said, laughing at the absurdity of it. They'll grab grab a bubble tea -- taro with vanilla for Maame -- before catching the 4 o'clock showing of "Jumanji."
Typical afternoon for a couple of kids.

Mercedes-Benz has new ideas for the compact-luxury car class, and the 2018 A-Class is the first indication. On Friday, the luxury brand unveiled the new A-Class hatchback with a sleeker design, and an interior fitted with the brand's new MBUX infotainment system.
The A-Class has grown up, and it's safe to say the S-Class took the compact hatch under its wing. The exterior design is far from dramatic, but the handsome shape flows well with more streamlined head and taillights and simple body surfacing. Mercedes-Benz extended the wheelbase to create a longer profile and widened the wheel arches 3 inches to emphasize a more athletic look overall.
The real story is the interior. The 2018 A-Class ushers in MBUX, or Mercedes-Benz User Experience. The new infotainment system features an array of screens that will be available in three versions: two 7.0-inch displays, one 7.0-inch and one 10.25-inch display, or two 10.25-inch displays. The first screen acts mostly as a virtual gauge cluster, while the second display handles other typical infotainment features.

The draw of MBUX is its artificial intelligence system. Drivers will be able to say things such as "Hey Mercedes, I'm too hot," and the A-Class will bump the climate control down to cool the cabin off. Or, drivers can tell the system they're hungry, and MBUX will pull up restaurant options complete with Yelp reviews. In our first test, the system worked incredibly well in a clear and concise manner.
Aside from the infotainment system, the cabin has also grown with more shoulder, elbow and headroom. The rear hatch also boasts an extra cubic foot of space over the previous A-Class hatch. Mercedes-Benz also highlighted the optional, and more luxurious, touches including features such as climate-controlled massaging seats, a suite of active safety features, and LED performance headlights. LED daytime driving lamps are standard.
Moving under the hood, the A-Class will offer three inline-4 engines overseas: two gasoline-powered and one diesel-powered engine. The A200 and A250 variants will feature either a 1.4-liter or 2.0-liter inline-4 engine, good for 163 horsepower and 224 horsepower. The diesel will remain exclusive to the A180d, which displaces 1.5 liters and provides 116 hp, but 260 pound-feet of torque. Either a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission or 6-speed manual will handle shifting duties.

Mercedes-Benz will offer all-wheel drive on some models, as well as an active damping suspension.
The United States won't get the A-Class hatchback, but the A-Class sedan will make the journey overseas. The A-Class' new platform will also underpin a slew of other cars: a GLA crossover SUV, CLA sedan, CLA shooting brake, GLB rugged SUV, and EQA electric car.
MADRID — Three movies by key Latin American production houses – Martin Desalvo's “Unidad XV: La Fuga,” José Manuel “Che” Sandoval's “Dry Martina” and Neto Villalobos' “Cascos Indomables” – will be unveiled in rough-cut at this year's SANFIC-Santiago Intl. Film Festival which kicks off Aug. 20 in Santiago de Chile with Santiago Mitre's “The Summit,” starring Ricardo Darin.
They will be joined by another five titles at SANFIC's 2017 Latin American Work in Progress, which runs Aug. 26-30. Now in its sixth year, the section has grown in status as a first-look showcase for titles which go on to screen at other pix-in-post sections and eventually big festival berths in the upcoming year. Alejandro Fernandez Almendras' “To Kill a Man,” which won 2013's SANFIC Latin American Work in Progress and went on to become a 2014 Sundance Grand Jury Prize winner, is one case in point. The competition allots $3,000 cash prizes to winners. As valuable, Sundance senior programer Shari Frilot will tutor participants on the international festival circuit. One title chosen from the competition will be screened at late November's Ventana Sur at a branded SANFIC event.
Argentina's Magma Cine, one of Latin America's clearest exponent of auteur genre (“Blood Appears,” “El Ardor,” “Second Death”), will present “Unidad XV: La Fuga,” a historical prison break thriller with political point. Set in 1957, and inspired by real events, it tracks four Peronist politicians' desperate break out of a Patagonian desert penitentiary. Either they get to and cross the Andes or die. Desalvo's “El día trajo la oscuridad” won the best director at the 2014 Austin Fantastic Festival.
“Our challenge is to generate a political historical film that is relevant, modern and reflects an original creative voice,” said producer Juan Pablo Gugliotta, at Argentina's Magma Cine. He added that “Unidad XIV” “connects perfectly with the political moment that our country – and indeed our whole region – is experiencing.”
Otherwise, the six features which will be screened in rough-cut at SANFIC's WIP, paint a picture of a confused and suffering contemporary world where characters are afflicted by trauma, unemployment and visceral frustration, adopting desperate measures to get by. Rare and winding, the road to happiness is also unexpected.
Forastero, producer of Sebastian Silva's Golden Globe-nominated “The Maid” and Dominga Sotomayor's Rotterdam Tiger winner “Thursday Through Sunday,” teams with Rizoma, a driving force of the New Argentine Cinema (“Giant,” “The Custodian”) on “Dry Martina.” A dramedy, like his first features, it questions the crisis in modern sentiments as characters cling to outmoded or inappropriate gender models, while unable to accept or appreciate their circumstances, Here, Antonella Costa (“The Wind,” “Today and Tomorrow”) plays a 35-year-old Argentine singer who is dumped, loses her voice and becomes frigid – until she meets Chilean Carlos, who turns her on. But “the real root of her problems is affection, not sex,” Sandoval says, and a potential new family their solution.
Lead-produced by Karina Avellán and Marcelo Quesada at Costa Rica's Pacífica Grey, and co-produced by Dominga Sotomayor and Omar Zúñiga at Chile's Cinestación, “Cascos Indomables” (Untamed Helmets) boasts director Neto Villalobos' hallmark bathos: a two-second clip recalls the opening credit scene of Marlon Brando's “The Wild One,” but with his biker crew replaced by Costa Rican bike messengers on clapped-out machines.
“Untamed Helmets” weighs in as a comedic, but loving tribute to friendship and the streets of Costa Rican capital San Juan, where it was shot. That is framed in a coming of age tale of Mancha who, when a massive layoff at his messenger company threatens to end his neb-adolescent lifestyle, has to decide whether to step up as a leader of the sacked workers, or take his life to another next stage, joining his girlfriend on a small island. Starring newcomer Arturo Pardo and theater actress Daniela Mora, “Untamed Helmets” was developed at a Cannes Festival Cinéfondation Résidence.
Directed by Sofia Paloma Gomez and Camilo Becerra and set up at Chile's La Jauria Comunicaciones, “Trastornos de sueño” (“Dreaming Disorders”) turns on Joel who, having been laid off, is forced to live with his mother and grandmother, an Alzheimer sufferer, in the cramped family flat. “Dreaming Disorders” is a dysfunctional family portrait capturing “the anguish felt when people have not been able to construct their own life projects,” Gomez and Becerra have said.
Another pan-Latin America co-production – between Venezuela and Chile – “Atacama” marks the second feature of Enrique Bencomo, after 2014's debut “Pipí Mil Pupú Dos Lucas.” It narrates three stories – involving a miner, an astronomer at the Alma radio-telescope site, and a big-city dweller – against the background of the Atacama Desert, which Bencomo has attempted to transform into a fourth main character in the movie.
Of documentaries, Marcel Beltrán's “El Desaparecido de Kafka” is a portrait of legendary Cuban shutterbug Fernando Lopez Junque, better known as Chinolope. Once a famed photographer of the famous, working in New York and Cuba, he now lives in a humble Havana barrio and feels at 85 that his work is no longer respected: He's a shadow of his former self, like the anti-hero of Kafka's novel, he argues.
SANFIC's Latin American WIP also features two boxing documentaries. A record of dedication – the subject's, the director's – “El Guru” was shot over five years. Set up at Chile's Hay que Hacerlo Producciones and directed and produced by Rory Barrientos Llamas, it tracks Carlos Ruiz, a salmon industry factory worker, as he prepares for over a year for a fight which, if he wins, would allow him to complete for the national title and make him remembered in his hometown.
Directed by Fernando Lopez Escrivá, “La Bonita” profiles Argentina's Daniela “La Bonita” Bermudez, the latest from a humble family of boxers who battles to make a name for herself in boxing. Winning is the only chance for her family to rise above the poverty line and would satisfy the frustrated dreams of her father, her manager and trainer. Remarkably, she wins four world titles. Dreams come true, sometimes.
Woeful Hartlepool United missed the chance to move four points clear of the relegation zone after they lost 2-1 to bottom-of-the-league Leyton Orient.
Rhys Oates had given Pools an early lead at Brisbane Road, but Orient – who would have been relegated if Pools had won – responded with two first half goals through Victor Adeboyejo and Tristan Abrahams. To compound matters, Liam Donnelly was sent off in the closing minutes for squaring up to the referee.
Only Newport County's 6-1 hammering at Plymouth Argyle keeps Pools out of the bottom two although they go into Saturday's penultimate home game against Barnet just a point and position above the Welsh club.
Carl Magnay started his first game for Pools since injuring his knee in September, while the Orient fielded eight youth team players.
Despite starting the brightest of the teams, Liam Kelly and Victor Adeboyejo both testing goalkeeper Joe Fryer, Pools took the lead on eight minutes.
A long ball from deep fooled Teddy Mezague and with several defenders around him, Oates kept his composure and patience and slotted beyond Sam Sargeant from close range.
Ten minutes later, though, and the hosts levelled. Michael Clark turned Donnelly with ease on the right and he squared for Adeboyejo who toed the ball past Fryer.
Lewis Alessandra squandered a chance from 10 yards for the visitors after being played in by Padraig Amond on 22 minutes, while the Orient kept coming, pressing a dispirited pool back and exploiting space between the hapless Scott Harrison and Donnelly with frequent long balls.
Adeboyejo missed two efforts in quick succession, but on 35 minutes Terry Abraham hit a thunderous shot from 18 yards into the roof of the net.
Nathan Thomas's low curling shot was held by Sargeant, before Henry Ochieng tried his luck for the Orient with a rasping effort from 25 yards.
Half time: Leyton Orient 2-1 Hartlepool United.
Pools were the better side after the break, inspired by Michael Woods who replaced the anonymous Nicky Deverdics.
Thomas had a looping header from distance drift wide, while Nicky Featherstone dragged a shot from a corner even further wider of the goalpost.
Fryer was counted on to deny Abrahams a second with a great save to keep out the striker.
Shortly after having his own attempt blocked, Thomas delivered a wonderful cross but the ball zipped past Oates face and Amond was unable to make connection at the far post.
On 90 minutes Oates missed a chance to level when he fluffed a chance five yards from goal.
Seconds later, Donnelly chased after the referee Dean Whitestone, got carded, and then squared up face-to-face with the official before receiving a second yellow in a display of total embarrassment to round off a dreadful day for Pools in London.
Full time: Leyton Orient 2-1 Hartlepool United.

Disney unveiled footage Tuesday from its upcoming “Solo: A Star Wars Story,” with a key scene between Alden Ehrenreich's young Han Solo and Donald Glover's Lando Calrissian.
The clip, shown to theater owners at CinemaCon in Las Vegas, showed the first encounter between the duo at a rundown and dingy cantina on a snowy planet with an array of other characters, including a creature with more than a dozen eyes. Emilia Clarke's Qi'ra character explains to Solo that Calrissian won his ship playing a card game, prompting Solo to promise that he'll beat him — and then proceeding to do so.
The footage ended with both men wagering their spaceships and Calrissian warning, “You might want to quit while you're ahead.”
The name of the ship was not unveiled, but in “Star Wars” lore, the original owner of the Millennium Falcon was Calrissian, and Solo won the ship from him in a card game.
The scene has a bit of the look and feel of the memorable cantina in 1977's original “Star Wars,” set in the city of Mos Eisley on Tatooine as the haunt of freight pilots and other dangerous characters of various alien races. It was also the setting where Harrison Ford's Han Solo first meets Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker.
Tuesday's footage also evoked a big laugh by showing an early encounter between Solo and the Wookie co-pilot Chewbacca. “You're 190?” Solo asks.
Disney made no mention during the presentation of the fact that Ehrenreich recently told Esquire that he's signed up to appear in two more movies.
Ron Howard directed “Solo: A Star Wars Story” — the second spinoff “Star Wars” movie after 2016's “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.” Howard replaced the team of Phil Lord and Chris Miller a year ago. “Solo” opens May 25.
Disney also showed off a new trailer for “Ant-Man and the Wasp” and screened the beginning sequence from Pixar's “Incredibles 2” during its presentation. The “Ant-Man” sequel opens July 6; “Incredibles 2” launches June 15.

Victoria Pendleton has announced that she and husband Scott Gardner are separating.
The Olympic gold medal-winning cyclist and former Strictly Come Dancing contestant broke the news on social media, telling fans they'd tried hard to make their five year marriage work.
In a statement last night, 37-year-old Victoria wrote: "After 10 years together I am very sad to say that Scott and I have grown apart.
"Despite our best efforts in trying to make our marriage work, we have come to the decision to go our separate ways. It has been an extremely difficult time and a tough decision to make.
"We want to look ahead to the future and stay positive. We would both gratefully appreciate our privacy being respected as we navigate what is a deeply personal time for us."

Victoria tied the know with sports scientist Scott in 2013.
The pair were introduced when Scott became a coach for Team GB cycling an and Victoria spent years hiding their relationship from their teammates.
It was deemed unprofessional for two members of the same team to be romantically involved and Scott left the coaching role in 2008, after Victoria said their relationship caused tension among team-mates.

After retiring from cycling, Victoria retrained as an amateur jockey.
She spoke of her ambitions during an interview with the Evening Standard in 2016, and said she had considered freezing her eggs to have children later.
"I do see myself having children at some point, I suppose, but I keep getting involved with stuff that I enjoy doing,” she said.
"Scott and I are both so ambitious with what we want to do with our lives at the moment that kids aren't in the picture now.
“I haven't thought too much about freezing my eggs before, but who knows? It's quite a good idea and I wouldn't rule it out,” she added.

In May this year Victoria attempted an ill-fated climb up Mount Everest alongside TV presenter Ben Fogle.
After declaring it had been the 'maddest thing on her bucket list,' was forced to pull out of the challenge after suffering oxygen deprivation at 21,000 ft.
Speaking to the Radio Times as she recovered in UK, Victoria revealed she was suffering from depression after being left 'psychologically and physiologically' damaged.
"It's really put me through the wringer, and that has been harder than any disappointment about not making it up to the summit. It's like I've taken a real battering. I've never felt so overwhelmed with illness," she said.
BEIJING (Reuters) - China will “absolutely not” fire the first shot in a trade war with the United States and will not be the first to levy tariffs, its finance ministry said on Wednesday.

A person with knowledge of the plan earlier told Reuters China's threatened tariffs on $34 billion of U.S. goods would take effect from the beginning of the day on Friday. Given the 12-hour time difference, that would have put its implementation ahead of Washington's. Other media carried similar reports.
But the ministry issued a brief clarification in response.
“The Chinese government's position has been stated many times. We absolutely will not fire the first shot, and will not implement tariff measures ahead of the United States doing so,” it said, without elaborating.
Washington has said it would implement tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports on July 6, and Beijing has vowed to retaliate in kind on the same day.
Earlier, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China was ready to act, though he did not confirm the start date for Chinese tariffs.
“China has already made preparations,” Lu told a daily news briefing.
“As long as the United States issues a so-called tariff list, China will take necessary measures to firmly protect its legitimate interests,” he added, without elaborating.
China's yuan rose sharply against the dollar on Wednesday, a day after the central bank assured markets it would keep the currency stable amid growing worries about trade friction, although stocks fell.
Chinese state media on Wednesday kept up a steady drum beat of criticism of the United States.
The official China Daily said the United States was intentionally trying to prevent China from developing to keep it from challenging the former's role in the global economic order.
“The U.S. has maintained hegemony in the military and financial fields for many decades. Now it is pursuing economic hegemony,” the English-language newspaper said in an editorial.
“It has frequently waged wars against other sovereign countries and made use of the dominant influence of the U.S. dollar in the international markets to fleece other countries. Now it is attempting to resort to an all-out trade and economic war to hold back China's normal development.”
Widely-read tabloid the Global Times, published by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily, said the increasingly likely trade war would bring chaos to the world.
“Counterstrike is major economies' first reaction to Washington's trade war,” it said in its editorial.
“It's hard to predict where these moves will lead the world, but Washington will unavoidably pay heavy prices for its attempts to change the whole world to its economic tributary.”
U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to escalate the trade conflict with tariffs on as much as $400 billion in Chinese goods if Beijing retaliates against the U.S. tariffs set to take effect on Friday.
Chinese currency and stock markets have been jittery ahead of Friday's tariff implementation.
More than half of aspiring first-time buyers are feeling positive about their chances of getting on the property ladder soon, a survey has found.
The biggest proportion of people surveyed, at 40.1%, described themselves as hopeful when asked about their ability to achieve their goal soon, while a further 16.9% said they were feeling confident - making a total of 57% who felt positive overall.
But the research, from conveyancing services provider My Home Move, also found more than a quarter (26.3%) of would-be first-time buyers felt unsure about their chances of getting on the property ladder.
A further one in 10 (10.1%) felt their hopes were unrealistic - while one in 16 (6.1%) said they felt "depressed" when asked about their prospects of owning their own home.
Some would-be property buyers are are also pinning their hopes on the "bank of mum and dad" to wholly fund their deposit.
Some 6.2% of people surveyed believed their parents would gift them enough money for a deposit, meaning they could apply for a mortgage without the need for further savings or support through a government scheme.
People surveyed in London were the most likely to be expecting to receive a gifted deposit that would be enough to secure them a mortgage, with 15.7% of people there believing this, compared with just 6.8% of aspiring homeowners in Yorkshire and Humberside.
Nearly three quarters (72%) of aspiring first-time buyers said they were saving for their deposits themselves.
The survey of 1,000 aspiring first-time buyers also found that, when they were growing up, people tended to say they had expected to be aged around 25 to 30 when they achieved the milestone of owning their own property.
Recent figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) show the average first-time buyer taking out a mortgage in February was 30 years old.
Doug Crawford, chief executive of My Home Move, said: "Of those we surveyed, over a quarter expected to be homeowners by the time they hit their mid-20s, but unfortunately the reality is very different."
He said the findings suggest there is a "missed generation" of would-be first-time buyers - aged in their 30s, 40s and beyond - who are still struggling to get on the property ladder.
Here are the percentages of would-be first-time buyers in regions across the UK who are hoping to be gifted a deposit without the need for additional savings, according to My Home Move:
:: London, 15.7%
:: East Midlands, 7.6%
:: East Anglia, 15.6%
:: North East, 9.4%
:: North West, 7.8%
:: South East, 10.2%
:: South West, 7.9%
:: Wales, 10%
:: West Midlands, 12%
:: Yorkshire and Humberside, 6.8%
:: Northern Ireland, 10.7%
:: Scotland, 8%
NEW YORK (AP)  A man has been convicted in one of the nation's most haunting missing-child cases, nearly 38 years after 6-year-old Etan Patz (AY'-tahn PAYTS') disappeared in New York City.
Jurors delivered their verdict Tuesday in Pedro Hernandez' retrial. Another jury deliberated for 18 days before deadlocking in 2015.
This time, jurors deliberated over nine days before finding the 56-year-old guilty of murder during a kidnapping in a case that shaped both parenting and law enforcement in the United States.
Hernandez was a convenience store clerk in Etan's neighborhood when the first-grader disappeared in May 1979. Hernandez confessed, but his lawyers say his admissions were the false imaginings of a mentally ill man.

Restaurants Canada-wide will be offering the deal
What can 67 cents buy you? On Wednesday, Aug. 16, it's a whole lot at McDonald's.
In celebration of its 50th year in Canada, the chain is offering 67-cent hamburgers at locations nation-wide.
McDonald's opened its first location in Canada right in Richmond, B.C. before spreading out across the country.
“It's amazing to think that a single B.C. location that started in 1967 has grown to over 1,400 restaurants across Canada,” said McDonald's Canada CEO John Betts. “We're excited about our future and continuing to share special moments, like today, with Canadians from coast to coast.”
Customers can snag up to three 67-cent hamburgers at all participating McDonald's locations Wednesday from 11 a.m.-7 p.m.
ISLAMABAD, Aug 14 (APP): Prime Minister, Shahid Khaqan
Abbasi has said Quaid-e-Azam envisioned Pakistan as a modern
democratic entity which faced myriad challenges.
He said the Pakistan Muslim League-N government,
notwithstanding the confronting difficulties has made the
realization of Quaid's dream as its abiding mission.
He said the independence that nation achieved seventy
years ago was an outcome of the unparalleled sacrifices made
by its ancestors. Millions of Muslims rendered sacrifices for
their future as well as for the future of their posterity.
“Today we are treading the path of prosperity and
progress in a peaceful and dignified country because of those
sacrifices. We are greatly indebted to our ancestors for their
sacrifices and we can repay that debt only by making Pakistan
a free and independent country,” the prime minister said in a
message on 70th Independence Day.
He said “We may belong to different tribes, fraternities
and ethnicities; we may be working in different spheres of
national life; our political vision and thinking can be
different and our economic vision may have different
perspectives but ascendancy of national interests and
invincible defence are common objectives of the entire nation,
for which we have to make collective endeavours.”
The prime minister said the recent transition of power
through a democratic process was quintessential of the
accelerated strengthening of democratic values in the country.
“We have to strengthen and reinforce the state
institutions so that they can play their prescribed role
within the limits of law and the constitution,” he added.
The prime minister said only a strong economy could
ensure strong defence. A moderate society guaranteed stability
of the state where people enjoyed all fundamental rights and
national resources were equitably and judicious distributed.
He further said that Pakistan desired positive and
constructive relations with all the countries of the world,
especially with its neighbours on the basis of sovereign
equality.
The people of South Asia have suffered enormously in the
last fifty years due to the festering conflicts. Until and
unless those conflicts were resolved amicably the people of
the region could not achieve prosperity and progress, he added.
He said the government invariably made efforts to
initiate the process of meaningful dialogue and adoption of
peaceful means to resolve the issues, but unfortunately the
expansionist designs of India remained main hurdle in this
regard.
He said it was incumbent upon the international
community to play its role in the resolution of the regional
conflicts, particularly the Kashmir dispute in conformity with
the UN Resolutions on the subject with a view to ensuring
durable peace in the region.
The prime minister said terrorism was the biggest
challenge confronting the world in the twenty first century.
Pakistan has rendered unparalleled sacrifices in the
fight against this menace as well as for the world peace.
“Our armed forces, law enforcing agencies and the people
have written imperishable stories of sacrifices in this
regard,” he added.
He said now, the time had come for the international
community not only to acknowledge those sacrifices by rising
above their interests in the region, but also to fully support
Pakistan in taking the fight against terrorism to its logical
conclusion.
The prime minister further noted that the younger
generation of Pakistan was endowed with exceptional talent and
has a burning desire for advancement.
They are making admirable contribution in the fields of
information technology, engineering, medical and management
all over the world in a distinct manner.
“My government has a vision of accelerating the pace of
development and prosperity in Pakistan so that all those
professionals can return to contribute to this national
effort,” he added.
He assured that tomorrow's Pakistan would secure the
implementation of guiding principles of rule of law and
ascendancy of merit.
On the 70th independence day of the country, the
prime minister made a solemn pledge that they would not relent
until the achievement of those objectives.
A Calgary man who killed his father more than 14 years ago is getting some new freedoms.
Shawn Trusty stabbed his father to death in their Fonda Drive S.E. home in September 2003, then set the house on fire.
Court heard the former basketball star from Mount Royal University, known then as Mount Royal College, was certified under the Mental Health Act and was on a weekend pass from the psychiatric facility.
He had purchased an airline ticket to another city, but when his father confronted him about it, he stabbed him repeatedly.
After setting the fire, he stole his father's car, drove to the airport and boarded the flight he had booked, but was later arrested trying to cross the border.
Trusty was eventually found guilty of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for 10 years.
Last May, the Parole Board of Canada called it “premature and unrealistic” for Trusty to get unescorted temporary absences from jail.

The concern was that the majority of time would have been spent with his family, despite the severity and target of his crime.
In a January hearing, the board agreed to an altered request, with a multi-stage approach to the releases. They are more aimed at personal development.
“You are now assessed as highly-motivated and your level of accountability and reintegration potential have increased to medium,” the board said in a decision obtained by Global News.
“With respect to the unescorted temporary absences plan, you said you agree with the plan for a gradual exposure to the community beginning with 24-hour passes,” the board continued. “You plan to meet the staff at the parole office, bring your mother to the halfway house and get some exposure to the halfway house where you want to live until you get full parole.”
The board also heard about recent psychological assessments and other tests to get more insight into Trusty's state of mind.
“You emphasized you were angry at your life when you killed your father, but have not been angry at your family,” the decision read.
The panel did have some reservations, like it did in the past, about Trusty's insights into his crimes.
“While in therapy, you have expressed a desire to stop taking your medication once in the community,” the board said. “Your insight into the link between your mental health and your violence appears to be limited.”
The passes have been approved for six months, and will begin at 24 hours for two months and will eventually increase to 48 hours and 72 hours, before they are reviewed again by the board.
Two people are dead following a crash in B.C.'s southern interior on Saturday morning.
A collision near Yahk, B.C., located about 65 kilometres south of Cranbrook, closed Highway 3/95 in both directions.
RCMP Cpl. Ryan Bacica said the crash occurred when a tractor-trailer “lost control on the ice, jackknifed and collided head-on with a pickup truck towing a horse trailer, which was travelling eastbound.”
The drivers of both vehicles died in the crash. The horses in the trailers did not survive.
The passenger from the pickup truck is in critical condition in hospital.
Paramedics were called to the scene just after 8 a.m. and have now cleared the scene.
The road is expected to re-open at 6 p.m. Saturday.
It was the version of Todd Gurley the Rams' faithful knew they'd see again. The version that flashed brilliantly in St. Louis before dimming amid a challenging sophomore campaign.
Gurley's on-field renaissance for a resurgent Los Angeles Rams team was one of the most remarkable feats of the 2017 season -- a spectacular performance worthy of Gurley being named NFL Offensive Player of the Year by the Associated Press at NFL Honors on Saturday. Gurley secured 37 of 50 votes, beating out Pittsburgh Steelers WR Antonio Brown (8), New England Patriots QB Tom Brady (4) and Houston Texans WR DeAndre Hopkins (1).
Gurley's memorable campaign played a decisive role in helping the Rams reach the playoffs for the first time since 2004. The third-year back churned out a league-best 2,093 scrimmage yards (accounting for 35 percent of team's offensive output) and finished second in league rushing with 1,305 yards. He became only the third player in NFL history to tally 2,000 scrimmage yards, 10 rushing TDs and six receiving TDs -- a feat replicated only by Hall of Famers Marshall Faulk and O.J. Simpson. His 19 total touchdowns were the most by a Rams player since Faulk's 21 in 2000.
In addition, Gurley had 788 receiving yards -- a big chunk of which came in a truly spectacular late-season showing against the Tennessee Titans (158 receiving, 118 rushing). His 152-yard, four-touchdown output against the Seattle Seahawks in a Week 15 cemented his offensive player of the year credentials. Over his final four games of the regular season, Gurley had 440 rushing yards and five touchdowns along with 22 catches for 302 receiving yards and three touchdowns en route to NFC Offensive Player of the Month honors.
The sustained excellence Gurley produced over the course of helping the Rams take their first divisional title since the Kurt Warner-Faulk era was a byproduct of the 23-year-old's superb natural talent coupled with Sean McVay's offense. In the midst of a frustrating 2016 season, Gurley famously described the Rams as running a "middle school offense." Under McVay, both Gurley and quarterback Jared Goff transformed into two of the NFL's most potent offensive weapons.
"Coach McVay he's just such an offensive-minded coach," Gurley said this week on FOX Sports. "And just, you know, how he changed the whole offense around. You know, obviously last year we were, you know, last in offense and this year we were number one."
For his part, McVay knew what he inherited when he took over the Rams' coaching job last year. He told reporters at the Annual League Meeting in March, he was confident Gurley was "going to be a great back year-in and year-out."
It can't be understated how much Gurley's emergence from his second-season slump not only helped push the Rams to an 11-5 record, but also established the franchise as a force to be reckoned with among the NFC's elite. If Gurley gets close to matching his 2017 output next season, a more experienced, balanced Rams offense could truly live up to its new "Greatest Show on Surf" moniker.
After dropping his debut mixtape, My Moment, back in April, Tee Grizzley has already been hard at work on his first proper album, Activated. Today, Detroit rapper is previewing the release with the dizzy, scorching “Win”.
A song chronicling the Grizzley's ascent in the rap game, “Win” finds him taking pride being the first person in his family making “legal bread.” “Without me my family wouldn't have food,” he spits during the song's piano-led chorus, “Anybody going ‘gainst me gonna lose.” Listen to it below.
If you weren't rooting for him already, you will be now.
Fredericton police say a three-month pilot project to test body cameras on officers was a success — and the next step is to test the technology for a full year.
Deputy police Chief Martin Gaudet says the cameras are another tool to help the force in its investigations and in increasing public trust.
WATCH: Fredericton police start body camera pilot project
He says the six officers who took part in the initial pilot gave the cameras a satisfaction rating of over 80 per cent and the next test will be aimed at getting a better sense of the cost for video storage.
Gaudet says the force has earmarked $7,000 in its 2018 budget for six body-mounted cameras and storage.

According to details, New Town police arrested 11 persons involved in one-wheeling while Civil Line police held seven one-wheelers.

He said no one would be allowed to violate rule of law.

In support of a decision by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) to force the government to enact a raft of electoral and local government reforms, our Catholic bishops drafted a pastoral letter that was read in various parishes over the last weekend.
The letter calls on all good Catholics to stage a demonstration on 13 December over the apparent foot-dragging by government to pass into law a myriad of recommendations by the Malawi Law Commission.
I will not bore you with the detail of the Commission's proposals, suffice it to say that the matters are so important that my Vice President, Saulos Chilima, felt compelled to read out the instruction from the bishops to go out and peaceably demonstrate.
I know I am making mischief here, but the Vice President did read a letter that clearly spells out dissatisfaction with the manner in which the administration that he serves has handled important legal reforms.
Although I do not agree with some of the proposals from the Law Commission and the basis for the choices put forward, I think it is entirely right that citizens do demand that the government accounts for the failure to take any steps to enact the recommendations made by our Law Commission. The Commission is one of the pillars of this democracy and its mandate is intended to make our laws and institutions more effective and more accountable to the people.
The framers of our Constitution correctly realised that our basic laws would need continuous reform as we seek that ever more accountable democracy. Consequently, the idea that recommendations from the Law Commission can be ignored or pushed aside, without consequence should be challenged. So whether or not you agree with the recommendations by the Law Commission, (or indeed whether or not you have read the proposals), the fact is that an accountable government should never ignore the recommendations of the Law Commission and should faithfully present those to our representatives so that they can debate and where appropriate adopt the proposed measures.
If you are Catholic, well, the bishops have spoken. Grab your rosary on 13 December and join a march to remind our political elite that we expect them to carry out their constitutional mandate at all times, not just when it is convenient for them. If you are not Catholic, join your brothers and sisters on this march and insist that government tables these bills before our elected representatives so that they may discuss them, and if possible, adopt appropriate changes.
If you are not impressed by the importance of electoral and local government reform or have not yet formed an opinion on whether the recommendations made are suitable or not, well there is a raft of other reasons for which you should join your brothers and sisters on 13 December.
For example, the government is yet to address the issue of abuse of resources from parastatal organisations, perhaps in the hope that Malawians will soon forget. We should not allow a ruling party to perpetuate this abusive behaviour, and all those who have been complicit in this, must be made accountable.
If this issue makes you angry; then grab a banner or design a placard and join your brothers and sisters on 13 December.
If you are incensed that some government bigshot would spend 64 million Kwacha on furniture and bypass normal procurement procedures whilst our hospitals cannot afford medicines, then design a placard and join your brothers and sisters on 13 December.
If you are annoyed by never ending power cuts and the platitudes from government relating to investment in the energy sector and photo-op board meetings that deliver no results, then grab a banner or design a placard and join your brothers and sisters on 13 December.
If you are concerned by the lack of a grand vision for key sectors of our lives including the economy, education, health and others, then grab your neighbour, design a placard together and join your brothers and sisters on 13 December.
If you are livid about the rates of maternal mortality, perennial food shortages, dodgy procurement deals and an almost permanent lack of medicines in the hospitals; then do not sit at home on 13 December.
Let us remind our political elite who owns this place.
Do something on 13 December. March for something. March for a more accountable democracy.

Got my shoes customized by the one and only @kickstradomis best in the business!! 🔥🔥🙏🏼 #Family pic.twitter.com/gdUXrMbkgw — Lauri Markkanen (@MarkkanenLauri) February 1, 2018
It should be no suprise that many famous and pro atheletes are fans of the Dragon Ball series such as the Green Bay Packers star Mike Daniels. Earlier this week, the Chicago Bulls star Lauri Markkanen went to Twitter to show off some of his new custom Dragon Ball Z X Nike kicks, and they are sick! Check out the images of the kicks in his tweet down below!Now just because Lauri Markkanen likes to watch Dragon Ball, doesn't make him an average athlete. In this current NBA season, Lauri took the NBA record as the 'Fastest player to reach 100 career 3-pointers' and he achieved that in a mere 41 games!What are your thoughts on the kicks? Do you think that Nike should have done a collab with Dragon Ball instead of the Adidas collaboration? What other characters do you think should get shoes like these? Let us know your thoughts in the comments down below and as always, stay tuned for more news!
ISLAMABAD-Board of Investment (BoI) has identified 41 sites for the establishment of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and the government will offer lucrative incentives to the investors in these zones, which includes duty and tax exemption on import of machinery and 5-year tax holiday.
BoI has identified 41 sites for the establishment of SEZs in consultation with all the four provincial governments including governments of AJ&K, GB and FATA Secretariat. While briefing the National Assembly Standing Committee on Planning, Development and Reform, the BoI additional secretary said that seven SEZs have already been approved. The meeting was presided over by MNA Abdul Majeed Khan Khanan Khail.
The committee was also briefed by the additional secretary and Ministry of Water & Power on the terms and conditions of financing of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) energy projects and tariff structure. The committee urged the quarters concerned to take special care of the environmental implications whenever initiating any energy projects under the CPEC.
Omer Rasool said that eight energy projects are near financial closure and 10,000MW energy will be inducted to the system which will help the eradication of load shedding. The BOI additional secretary comprehensively briefed the committee over the development and management of Industrial Park under CPEC-Incentives given to local and foreigner investors in SEZs.
While giving briefing on the incentives given to local and foreign investors in these SEZs, he informed that there is no difference between incentives given to local and foreign investors in these zones.
The incentives are as follows; one time exemption from duty and taxes on import of plant and machinery for developers and enterprises, 5-year tax holiday on income accruable in relation to the development and operation of the SEZ for the developer and 10-year tax holiday for enterprises on income accruable in relation to the production/operations started by June 30, 2020 and thereafter 5-year tax holiday for enterprises would be admissible.
After detailed briefing by the BoI, the committee recommended that vocational and technical training centers should also be established in the SEZs for imparting technical training to the local workers in order to make them able to get jobs in the industries.
The committee chairman asked the BoI official that what kind of industries will be installed in the Sindh special zones and what will be the procedure, upon which the additional secretary responded that it will be engineering industries. While there is no request from China for the establishment of Industrial park, he added. Replying another query, that who will control the management of Industrial Zones, the BOI official replied that a committee will be constituted to decide about this and other issues.
The committee chairman asked the Ministry of Planning to ensure that the industries in the industrial zones should be environmental friendly and make no pollution. Planning Additional Secretary Zafar Hassan said that in this regard the guideline will be provided by the Ministry of Climate Change. MNA Iftikhar said that the way you have focused on the security of CPEC, by allocation a percentage for the purpose, similar decisions should be taken for the environment protection. The Ministry of Water and Power additional secretary said that the CPEC energy projects are in IPP mode and out of 16 energy projects under CPEC there is no government investment.
He said that the energy projects are not being incorporated randomly under CPEC umbrella, there is proper survey for the purpose which takes one year. On November 8, 2014, energy Cooperation Framework was signed in China where it was decided to install 16,000MW under CPEC. There are 13 articles of the framework, he added. Private Power Infrastructure Board (PPIB) and National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) do vet the power projects before the installation and decide about the course of action, he added.
Solar and coal was the first target under CPEC while wind energy was also part of the corridor project, Omer said. Alternative Energy Board is overseeing the solar and wind power projects, he added. About the decision to remove Gaddani power project from the CPEC umbrella, he informed that there were ten projects in Gaddani, since china was not ready for investment therefore it was taken out from the corridor umbrella. The project was put on back burner in December 2016 and now it will be included in the second or third phase of CPEC, he added.
Similarly Sukki Kinari hydropower project is 870MW and it will come online in 2019 with an estimated tariff of 8.50 US cents per unit, he added. A total of 300MW solar electricity is under execution and 200MW will be added to the national grid in 2017 while 100MW will be inducted in 2018, he added.
He said wind is clean energy but is expensive as the tariff of solar and wind is 14.15 cents and 13 cents respectively while in India it is five cents. “As per our target around 10,000MW electricity from alternate energy will be added to the national grid,” Omer added.
The rates of the Engro 660MW power plant per unit are 8.50 cents. It is very important project where 51 percent share holding belongs to the government of Sindh. The first 330MW coal power of Engro will come online by December 2017. Seven coal projects with capacity of 8,000MW will be installed, he added.
It was also informed that Sahiwal coal project will be completed in June 2017, while Port Qasim will be completed by December 2017. Both the HUBCO power projects will be completed by 2019 and the provincial government of Balochistan has provided their 3 percent share in the project.
The imported coal is coming from Australia, Indonesia and Africa. The Coal director informed that local coal is cheaper than the imported one and it is better to use the local coal in energy generation. The committee also constituted a four member sub-committee with Ch Jaffar Iqbal as convener and Qaiser Jamal, Sher Akber Khan and Malik Ibrar Ahmad as its members, The committee Terms of Reference (TORs) included; to look into the matter of unnecessary delay in completion of Northern Bypass Peshawar; and the issue of Water Distribution Network for Rawalpindi Cantonment Board/Chaklala Cantonment Board (CCB) based on Khanpur Dam water source (phase-III), Rawalpindi.
It's safe to say that we had a blast last year at our Tel Aviv meetup. To nobody's surprise, we're holding a TechCrunch Meetup + Pitch-Off again in June. Save the date as June 28, 2017 is going to be a great time for the tech community in Tel Aviv.
What do we have in store exactly? Let's be honest, TechCrunch doesn't come often enough to Israel. So we're going to use this opportunity to bring the entire tech ecosystem together.
During the Pitch-Off, a dozen local startups will all compete and pitch for 60 seconds in front of judges. Those local VCs and TechCrunch editors will then ask some tough questions.
At the end of the night, we'll crown the winners. We'll give them the opportunity to come to the big show — TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin in December 2017. I'm sure you can't wait to apply for the pitch-off competition. Stay tuned as the applications will open in May.
But that's not all. We'll also have a few interviews and panels. Last year, we talked with Shimon Peres as well as some of the best and brightest tech executives in Israel.
In addition to all of that, we'll buy you drinks so that you can chat with your past, present and future friends in the tech community. I also can't wait to grab a beer with all of you.
So there you have it, we think there are some great things happening in the Israeli tech ecosystem. That's why a TechCrunch team is coming to meet you (and also because the food is amazing).

After some bitterly cold days to end 2016, Calgarians are finding themselves locked in a deep-freeze once again.
Another blast of Arctic air is hanging over the Prairies and is expected to remain in place for at least a week.
Average temperatures in Calgary normally range between -3 C to -15 C for the start of January. Forecast models are suggesting it will not get above -7 C this week with overnight temperatures as low as -22 C.
This is coming on the heels of snowfall warnings for much of southern Alberta and treacherous road conditions within the city of Calgary on Jan. 2.

Dreaming of a white Christmas
Calgary was one of many cities who recorded an official white Christmas in 2016. Environment Canada defines a white Christmas as the presence of two or more centimetres of snow on the ground at 7 a.m. EST. Dec. 25.
Not only did Calgary have a white Christmas this past year, it also had a “Perfect Christmas,” with two or more centimetres on the ground and snow in the air sometime on Christmas Day.
Going one step further, Calgary appears to have received a record amount of snowfall on Dec. 23 and Dec. 24, according to Environment Canada's historical data.
Calgary recorded 8.2 cm of snow at the airport on Dec. 23 and 5.6 cm of snow on Dec. 24.
Chilly December
The final month of 2016 certainly had some unusually cold weather.
READ MORE: It has not been this cold in Calgary in almost 1,000 days
According to the monthly mean temperature, or average temperature, this past December was the ninth coldest in 40 years. The mean temperature for the month was -10.3 C with it only ever getting above freezing 10 days out of 31.
Even with stretches of cold weather that seemed to never end, this December was practically balmy compared to the same month in 1983 when the mean temperature was -17.1 C.
That December had 14 days where it did not get above -15 C, and only about 29 hours all month where it was above 0 C.

TEHRAN - President Hassan Rouhani said that the Iranian nation has never bowed and will never bow to US pressures, official IRNA news agency reported on Tuesday.
Rouhani, who was talking to the Iranians living in Switzerland, urged them to express their support and sympathy to their countrymen all over the world.
"The farther we get from each other, the more plots the enemy will hatch. Our duty is to make efforts for the development and more welfare of the Iran nation," Rouhani was quoted as saying.
He pointed to the US withdrawal from the Iranian 2015 nuclear deal, saying that the deal was inked based on the interests of Iran and the world.
Rouhani said that Iran's logic has not changed by the exit of "an irrational party" which seeks to put pressures on the Iranian nation.
"The Americans have claimed that they want to completely block Iranian oil exports. They do not know what this means because it would be meaningless that Iran cannot export its oil while others in the region can," he said.
"Do this if you can and see its consequences," the Iranian president warned Washington against the sanction move.
Last week, the US State Department announced that the United States has been pushing its allies to stop oil imports from Iran by Nov. 4.
US President, Donald Trump has asked Saudi Arabia to increase its oil exports to compensate the shortage in the market demands in case Iran's crude exports drop. Iran's Petroleum Ministry has said that is prepared for the worst-case scenarios in case the US pressures take effect.
The foreign ministers of Iran and five world powers still party to the 2015 nuclear deal will meet in Vienna on Friday for talks on the troubled accord, Tehran and Moscow said.
The top diplomats of Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia will join Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in the Austrian capital, Iran's official IRNA news agency reported, for their first talks together on the deal since Washington pulled out earlier this year.
During the meeting the ministers will discuss an "incentive package" the European Union is offering to try to persuade Iran to stay in the agreement, IRNA reported.
The meeting will seek "solutions to preserve the Iran nuclear deal after the illegal US action to withdraw," it said. In Moscow, deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov told Russian news agencies that the meeting aimed to "prevent the disintegration" of the accord and to "protect the interests of economic actors".
"We should send a message to Washington showing how much the position of countries participating in the deal differs from the stance of (US President) Donald Trump," he said. The announcement of Friday's meeting came with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in Europe to rally support for the deal. Rouhani, accompanied by Zarif, was in Switzerland on Tuesday and due to head on Wednesday to Vienna, where the accord was signed in 2015. Trump unilaterally pulled out of the agreement two months ago, to the ire of the other signatories which along with the European Union have continued to back the accord. Iran has warned it is ready to resume uranium enrichment to 20 percent - above the level permitted in the deal - "within days" if the agreement falls apart.
Swiss call for nuclear deal
with Iran to be preserved
Swiss President Alain Berset on Tuesday urged all sides not to endanger the nuclear agreement between global powers and Iran, after meeting his Tehran counterpart, Hassan Rouhani.
Talks between Rouhani and the Swiss government focused on stabilizing the nuclear deal following the withdrawal of the United States, it said in a statement.
Switzerland pledged to work to preserve the flow of humanitarian goods to Iran, despite any resumption of US sanctions, while urging Tehran to recognize Israel's right to exist.
For his first workout with the Lakers, Lonzo Ball came to the team's practice facility in El Segundo. The second one won't be there. Ball's second workout has been scheduled for Friday at an undisclosed location, said a source who was not authorized to speak publicly.
The Lakers brass is planning to spend several hours with Ball on Friday.
The Lakers have also conducted two workouts with Kansas forward Josh Jackson — one in Sacramento, where he has been training, and one at the Lakers' facility on Tuesday.
Jackson and Ball have emerged as the two most likely candidates for the Lakers' second overall pick.
Team officials will use the information they gather for next Thursday's draft. The Lakers have the second overall pick in the draft and the 28th pick. For the 28th pick, they've been conducting group workouts for the last several weeks. The players in contention for the second pick have seen the Lakers individually.
The Lakers had Kentucky point guard De'Aaron Fox in on Tuesday and will have Washington point guard Markelle Fultz in on Thursday.
Fultz is widely expected to be drafted first overall by the Boston Celtics.

American Heart Association in a recent research reveals that omega-3 fatty acid dietary supplements might not help to lower the risk of heart problems in people suffering from heart diseases for a long period of time and are at a high risk.
Experts state that two servings of fish a week is more helpful than taking omega-3 fatty acid supplements.
Previous research claimed omega-3 to be helpful in lowering the risk of heart attacks, fats in the blood and artery clogging. In the current study, however, the positive effects of omega-3 dietary supplements preventing heart diseases have been ruled out.
For the current study, researchers studied the data of 77,917 participants aged 64 years on average with a history of heart diseases or health problems like diabetes. Most of the participants were randomly given omega-3 fatty acid supplements or a placebo or a dummy pill for one year and were monitored thoroughly for an average of 4.4 years.
2,695 people (3.5 percent) died from heart disease, 2,276 (2.9 percent) suffered nonfatal heart attacks, 1,713 (2.2 percent) had strokes while 6,603 (8.5 percent) had to undergo surgery to reopen the clogged arteries. JAMA Cardiology reports that the outcomes were same whether or not people took omega-3 fatty acid supplements.
Senior study author Robert Clarke, a public health researcher at the University Of Oxford, UK states that the results showed no beneficiary effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplements for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Also, results do not support the current guidelines of the American Heart Association that supports the fact that patients with prior heart diseases can be cured by taking omega-3 fatty acid supplements.
The trials had different doses and combinations of two omega-3s: EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid). People took the supplements for one to six years. One of the drawbacks of the study was the randomized trials and lack of data on the smoking habits and cancer history which can definitely be the cause of developing heart disease or death.
Carl Lavie, medical director of the cardiac rehabilitation programme and preventive cardiology, John Ochsner Heart and Vascular Institute, University of Queensland School of Medicine in New Orleans, Louisiana said that although there is not much evidence suggesting the fact that omega-3 supplements can prevent heart diseases, patients still find it to be a better option as they are inexpensive and does not have side effects. People taking omega-3 supplements for a long time should not stop as it has other health benefits beyond just preventing heart risks.
"In addition to maintaining a healthy body weight, habitually engaging in physical activity, and not smoking, consumers should regularly eat fatty fish as part of a well-balanced diet or supplement their diets with a high-quality omega-3 supplement," said Dominik Alexander, researcher at the EpidStat Institute, Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Oh Bloodline. Season 1 was such a fantastic binge watch because of its murderous framing device. Season 2 then abandoned having that flash-forward setup and also lost its most compelling character, so it languished as the leads worried about the cover-up to their dark deeds. The finale of that season also added another dark deed, one that pretty much solidifies the Rayburns as bad people, even though Coach Taylor assured us in Season 1 that they only “did a bad thing.”
Netflix has now released the first trailer for the final season of the show, which I will absolutely watch because of the gorgeous scenery and fantastic acting talent, no matter what happens with the story. From the brief (and very dark, literally) trailer, it looks like it's not John (Kyle Chandler) who will be the one to save himself, along with siblings Meg (Linda Cardellini) and Kevin (Norbert Leo Butz) from the slammer, but that it will be mom Sally (Sissy Spacek) who must come to the rescue once she learns the truth.
Check out the new trailer below:
Though the show is really ending because it became too expensive to film in Florida once the state dropped their tax incentive program last year (and the authenticity of the setting is essential to Bloodline), the show feels like it's one that needed a fairly early natural conclusion (as Season 2 proved). There's so much rich character drama here that it felt like a hugely missed opportunity to not dive deeper into that, especially when Andrea Riseborough‘s Evangeline showed up. Danny's (Ben Mendelsohn) death would still, obviously, have haunted everything those characters did, with the search for truth simmering in the background, but watching everyone fret for an entire season and then commit yet another murder that will need to be covered up, well … that's asking for a lot of patience from viewers.
Thanks to the new trailer though we also know that the show, which will run for 10 episodes this season, will premiere May 26th (so that it can provide me with the vacation to the Keys that I cannot afford). Hopefully we'll get more hints of where the show is heading in this final season soon, but in the meantime, let us know in the comments what you hope happens in these final episodes.
Champagne brand Charles Heidsieck will launch its 'Maverick Encounters' events series, which aims to celebrate the brand's heritage and founder.
The 'Maverick Encounters' celebrate individuals who share the qualities of the brand's founder, Charles-Camille Heidsieck. Those qulaitities include pushing boundaries, going against the grain and thriving in the face of adversity.
Charles Hiedsieck will host a series of refined events, kicking off on 22 June, which will feature elements of food, fashion craft, tech and art. The first 'Encounter' will focus on the industrial and highly skilled knife producer Blenheim Forge, giving guests a hands-on experience in knife craft at the blacksmith's forge location in London.
Guests will be able to enjoy food prepared by a chef using their razor-sharp knives, followed by a Champagne masterclass hosted in the forge. There will also be private tour of the Blenheim Forge workshop.
More: Yesterday, it was announced that Krug Champagne will launch a luxury festival in Hampshire this summer. Laurent-Perrier is staging a series of exclusive masterclasses at Taste of London this week.

The race is on for companies to present their driverless cars to the public, but recent collisions involving autonomous vehicles developed by Uber Technologies Inc. and Tesla Inc. have led consumers to questions whether these vehicles can alleviate traffic issues and increase safety. A new study published in Risk Analysis examined the question “How safe is safe enough for self-driving vehicles (SDVs)?”
To answer this question, researchers employed an expressed-preference approach – a method that has not previously been employed in this setting – to determine the socially acceptable risk of SDVs. The results showed that the public will not accept this new technology unless it is shown to be safer, approximately four to five times as safe as human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Despite the conveniences SDVs would bring to individuals, such as the ability to watch a movie, read a book, sleep or surf the internet, the public will be much less likely to accept, or even tolerate, SDVs if they have the same risk level as human driving. As suggested by previous studies, an individual increases his or her demand for safety when that safety is entrusted to an external factor, such as an automated vehicle.
One of the major motivations behind the development of SDVs is to improve road safety. Human error is believed to cause 94 percent of all traffic crashes in the U.S., and 75 percent in the U.K. While SDVs have the potential to significantly reduce these types of crashes, they also introduce several new road risks, including accidents caused by cyber-attacks. Creating perfectly safe SDVs is both technologically and economically infeasible, but policies can require that the risk of having them on the road be as low as technically achievable.
The study was conducted by Peng Liu and Run Yang, Tianjin University, and Zhigang Xu, of Chang'an University. The survey was distributed to a convenience sample of residents in Tianjin, China. Of the 499 respondents, half were randomly assigned to complete a version of the survey for HDVs, while the other half completed an SDV version. Risk frequencies were expressed as one fatality per a certain number of vehicle-kilometers traveled and as one fatality per a certain number of population, respectively. Respondents were asked to accept or reject each traffic risk scenario at one of four levels: never accept, hard to accept, easy to accept and fully accept.
The results show that the respondents believe that SDVs should be four to five times as safe as HDVs. Current global traffic fatal risk is estimated at 17.4 per 100,000, which is 350 times greater than the frequency accepted by 50 percent of the respondents for SDVs. This implies that respondents expect SDVs to improve safety by two orders of magnitude against the current traffic risk.
Based on the results, the researchers propose the following requirements for SDVs based on the tolerability of risk in industrial safety (a concept developed in the health and safety field) in which risks are distinguished by three criteria: unacceptable, tolerable and broadly acceptable. SDVs that are less safe than human drivers would be set as the unacceptable risk criterion. The tolerable risk is that SDVs be four to five times as safe, meaning they should be able to reduce 75-80 percent of current traffic fatalities. The broadly acceptable risk criterion for SDVs is set as two orders of magnitude lower than current global traffic risk, indicating a hundredfold improvement over current traffic risks, or the same order of magnitude experienced in public transportation modes, such as rail and commercial aviation.
“Our results and method may help government authorities to establish clear safety requirements for regulating SDVs and also help SDV manufacturers find consumers' expectations for SDVs that must be met,” states Liu, Ph.D., assistant professor of industrial engineering.

We are still broken by the Humboldt Broncos bus crash, which stole life's potential from 16 young and strong players, coaches and team support staff.
Then, on Monday, we were faced with the heart-wrenching scenes of carnage along Toronto's Yonge Street, as a man in a white van gobbled up lives while careering down the sidewalk.
LISTEN: In times of need, Canadians come together
People were out enjoying the sunshine on one of the first real days of spring in Toronto. Among the crowd were 10 innocent people, who couldn't have imagined it would be their last day in the sun, and 14 others, who couldn't have known that later that day, they'd be lying injured in hospital, some of them fighting for another chance to feel the sun's warmth.
In both instances, we are left asking, how did this happen? We are asking, why? But those answers take time.

(Reuters) - Computer maker Dell Technologies Inc said on Friday it was considering a public offering of common stock or a combination with business software maker VMware Inc, its publicly held subsidiary.
Dell, the world's largest privately held technology company, is under pressure to boost profitability after its debt-laden acquisition of data storage provider EMC Corp for $67 billion in 2016 failed to meet financial targets, hurt by intensifying price competition.
Combining with VMware would provide access to VMWare's $11.6 billion in cash, helping Dell trim its $52.5 billion debt pile. Last month's U.S. tax reform made servicing that debt more expensive due to caps on deducting interest expense.
The combination would also make Dell a publicly listed company, offering a path for private equity firm Silver Lake to begin selling down its 18 percent stake if it chooses to. Silver Lake helped bankroll Dell CEO Michael Dell in taking the company private in 2013 in a $24.9 billion leveraged buyout.
A lockup provision prevents Dell from buying out the stake in VMware it does not already own until September. Any merger agreed before then would have to be structured as an acquisition of Dell by VMware: a so-called reverse merger.
“We view a reverse merger of Dell by its majority-owned subsidiary, VMware, as potentially the most beneficial alternative for Dell and Silver Lake,” Wells Fargo Securities LLC analysts wrote in a research note.
A combination of Dell and VMware would place them under the same management and help them co-ordinate strategy. Dell's hardware and VMWare's software offerings could potentially be marketed in one suite of products.
“As part of our ongoing multi-year strategic planning, Dell Technologies is evaluating a number of potential business opportunities,” founder Michael Dell said in a blog post. “We do this from a position of strength, with a desire to grow Dell Technologies and its businesses even faster and thrive in the very dynamic IT marketplace.”
Reuters reported on Thursday that Dell planned to announce a review of a possible reverse merger with VMware, as well as other options, including an IPO or asset sales. Sources told Reuters VMware was likely to form a special committee to consider a combination with Dell.
Dell added on Friday that nothing had been decided and the company might end up continuing to operate under its current structure.
“The board of directors follows sound corporate governance practices, and will continue to do so in connection with any potential transaction involving our controlling stockholders,” VMware's lead director Paul Sagan said in a company statement.
Shares in VMware, which is 82 percent-owned by Dell, fell 2.4 percent on Friday to close at $122.72. Dell's tracking stock, which Dell issued to finance the EMC deal and which tracks the value of VMware's business, was up a little less than 1 percent at $70.90.
CHALLENGING PC MARKET
Dell has faced fierce competition in the storage market, with prices pressured by cloud-based rivals such as Amazon.com Inc's AWS and Microsoft Corp's Azure. Dell's infrastructure chief, former EMC executive David Goulden, departed last fall, and the company has been working to reorganize storage operations.
Michael Dell helped shape the personal computer market when he founded Dell in 1984 as a University pre-med freshman with $1,000 in savings. But growing popularity of smart phones and tablets has squeezed the PC market, which shrank by 0.2 percent in 2017, according to International Data Corporation.
Dell's servers have been a bright spot, helping total net revenue grow to $56.7 billion in the nine months to Nov. 3, from $41.6 billion a year earlier. Yet operating expenses soared from $10 billion to $17.3 billion and Dell's operating loss widened to $3 billion from $1.6 billion a year ago.
Dell has been considering a sale or initial public offering (IPO) of one of its fast-growing divisions, Pivotal Software Inc, sources have said.
Dell, whose technology portfolio spans servers, displays, workstations and gaming PCs, also has a security unit, RSA, and a cloud platform called Boomi.
Kashmiris on both sides of the Line of Control and across the world are observing India's Independence Day, Tuesday (August 15), as Black Day, reported Radio Pakistan.
Its aim is to convey the message to international community that India has usurped Kashmiris' inalienable right to self-determination by the dint of force.
The day will be marked by a complete strike in occupied Kashmir, call for which has been jointly given by the resistance leadership, comprising Syed Ali Gilani, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Muhammad Yasin Malik.
Meanwhile, protest rallies and demonstrations will be held throughout Azad Jammu and Kashmir to mark India's Independence Day as Black Day.
Black flags will be hoisted on buildings throughout Occupied Kashmir.
In Muzaffarabad, a big protest demonstration will be held at Central Press club.
AJK Prime Minster Raja Farooq Haider Khan, leaders and representatives of various political, social and religious organizations will speech on the occasion.
NEW YORK (AP) — Roseanne Barr is partly blaming Ambien for the tweet that led to her show's cancellation, but the maker of the insomnia drug quickly retorted that “racism is not a known side effect.”
People of all races, religions and nationalities work at Sanofi every day to improve the lives of people around the world. While all pharmaceutical treatments have side effects, racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication. — Sanofi US (@SanofiUS) May 30, 2018
Hours after ABC axed her show for her offensive tweet about former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett — and quickly breaking a promise to stay off Twitter — the comedian was back on the social media platform.
She urged people not to defend her and said of her Jarrett tweet that she was “ambien tweeting” at 2 a.m.
That led to the response on Twitter by the drugmaker Sanofi.
Are TV stars — or, at any rate, people who have appeared on television — more reliable magnets for digital audiences than internet-native creators?
Kin Community was founded in 2011 as a specialized YouTube multichannel network aimed at young female audiences, aggregating content from creators like Rosanna Pansino (of Nerdy Nummies), Hannah Hart (MyHarto), Jenn Im (Clothes Encounters), and Lauren Riihimaki (LaurDIY).
Now the L.A.-based entertainment company is shifting gears: Kin is focused on producing its own programming geared around recognizable “mainstream” talent from TV, de-emphasizing its original mini-MCN approach.
The change in strategy is based on the success Kin has found from Tia Mowry's “Quick Fix,” which launched last fall as a weekly show offering up tips and life hacks for moms. The show from Mowry, best known for her starring role in '90s sitcom “Sister, Sister,” built a viewership that has outstripped many cable TV shows — and Kin CEO Michael Wayne is doubling down on the model.
Kin's new “Neighborhood” strategy, in addition Tia Mowry, includes channels from others familiar to TV viewers. The company recently launched All Things Adrienne, featuring Adrienne Houghton, former Cheetah Girl and co-host of daytime talk show “The Real” and “Showtime at the Apollo.” Additional channels are coming from Derek Hough, a six-time winner of ABC's “Dancing with the Stars,” and couple Nick and Vanessa Lachey, who also resonate with Kin's key female demo.

“What we started to realize toward the end of last year was, digital influencers and traditional celebrities are converging — Tia Mowry is as influential as anyone in this space,” Wayne said. “The talent we're now working with are well known online and they're engaged online, but they have mainstream appeal. We are creating high-quality content that rivals what you see on TV.”
Kin has several other channels in development with purportedly mainstream talent and plans to roll out as many as 20 over the next 18 months.
Wayne said Kin will continue to work with internet creators but the focus is squarely on the company's own content productions. “We were never in the same space as [large-scale MCNs like] Maker or Fullscreen,” he said. “We've never had more than 100 creators we've worked with.” It's worth noting Hannah Hart recently left the Kin network and is now affiliated with Studio71.
The data Kin saw from Mowry's “Quick Fix” convinced Wayne to zero in on the approach. For example, during the week of Jan. 8-14, 2018, “Quick Fix” drew 2.1 million total unique viewers among women 18-34, per research that Kin commissioned from Nielsen. That topped unscripted cable shows including E!'s “Keeping Up with the Kardashians,” VH1's “Love and Hip Hop,” Bravo's “Real Housewives of Atlanta” and Food Network's “Chopped.”
Building on Mowry's show, the Kin “Neighborhood” model will be geared around what Wayne described as premium lifestyle channels hosted by mainstream personalities. “We saw the need to build a brand-safe, family-friendly neighborhood on the big digital platforms,” he said, likening YouTube and Facebook to the “mega-cities” of the internet.
Mowry, for her part, said her experience hosting “Quick Fix” has “gone over and beyond my expectations.”
“I'm having loads and loads of fun,” she said. “As an actor, you're putting yourself in someone else's brand. You are not necessarily being who you are. I am now able to do that with my own content, and feed that to my audience.”
Why does Mowry — who already had millions of social-media followers before launching “Quick Fix” — need to work with a company like Kin, instead of doing it on her own? She praised Kin and Wayne's expertise in the digital space to grow audience reach. “I've been approached by other companies but I like Kin's holistic approach,” Mowry said. “I feel like Kin Community shares my values.”
Like “Quick Fix,” Kin will distribute its original programming across Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Amazon Prime. The talent-driven channels will have weekly premiere dates set, mimicking TV's programming blocks.
“All Things Adrienne” debuted last month. On her channel, Houghton shares tips and tricks on all things beauty, fashion, home decor, entertaining, and more. According to Kin, “All Things Adrienne” is on a similar trajectory as “Quick Fix,” attracting more than 400,000 followers in the first four weeks since its launch.
Coming up next: “Life in Motion with Derek Hough,” a new series in which he'll show viewers “how to infuse energy into every aspect of their lives.” The daytime-TV-style format will include his wellness tips, nutritional insights, fun fitness fads, and family memories with his four sisters.

In the latest installment of the ongoing saga of Russia-based cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab and the U.S. government, the company has a new date with Congress. Rescheduling a hearing originally set for last week, the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology has set a new hearing for October 25, Reuters reports.
News of the rescheduled hearing comes a day after the company was linked to successful Russian efforts to hack the NSA, though the Kaspersky software in question could have itself been hacked through a vulnerability.
Kaspersky Lab founder Eugene Kaspersky was expected to appear in the previous hearing, and it sounds like he'll probably plan on being there in late October to defend his company in his own words.
“I look forward to hearing from the committee and having the opportunity to address their concerns directly,” Kaspersky said in a statement to TechCrunch.

BLOOMINGTON, Minn. -- The Philadelphia Eagles got a key member back Friday, as starting defensive tackle Tim Jernigan returned to the practice field after being sidelined since late last week with an illness.
Jernigan is one of several players and coaches that has been battling a bug.
"I'm getting over it right now. It's like a cold, dude. I don't know. The whole team has it, though," said linebacker Mychal Kendricks on Thursday, who clarified that he didn't mean that literally everyone on the team is sick.
Cornerback Ronald Darby missed Thursday's media session with an illness but has practiced in full all week. Running back Jay Ajayi (ankle), defensive tackle Fletcher Cox (calf) and linebacker Dannell Ellerbe (hamstring) were also full participants.
The Eagles kept to their normal practice schedule this week and on Friday focused on red zone and short-yardage situations. The padless session lasted about an hour and a half. Coach Doug Pederson opted not to have his players in pads this week, wanting to keep them fresh this late in the year.
Afterward, Pederson stood near midfield, surrounded by his players, coaches and front office executives, and delivered a lengthy speech, according to the pool report.
"Play loose, have fun, enjoy the moment," he said, relaying his message. "These opportunities, as you know, don't come around every year. Also, make sure just to reflect on this season, reflect on the journey that got us here. But just play for one another, have fun and enjoy it."
Pederson's friend and former teammate, Brett Favre, is scheduled to speak with his players Saturday morning at the team hotel. That will be followed by a half-hour walkthrough at U.S. Bank Stadium, the site of Super Bowl LII. Preparations are nearly complete.

LAHORE - President Mamnoon Hussain has said that despite all odds, Pakistan is moving towards progress which shows its God-gifted immense potential and abilities.
He was addressing the LCCI Ambassadors' Dinner 2018. The LCCI President Malik Tahir Javaid, Vice President Zeshan Khalil, Ambassador of Turkmenistan to Pakistan and Dean of Diplomatic Corps Atajan Movlamov also spoke on the occasion. Ambassadors & representatives of over 50 countries and high government officials attended this prestigious ceremony.
The president said that the economy of Pakistan is reviving and it is well on the way to record persistently better economic growth rate with every passing year. For example, the GDP growth for 2017-18 reached 5.79 percent as compared to 5.37 percent in 2016-17.
He said that the optimal and long term economic growth is only possible when all the sectors of economy supplement each other. At present, agriculture, industry and services sectors are showing improvement.
“We are marketing Pakistan in an aggressive manner at international level. The geo-political location of Pakistan has added a lot of value to its standing and it is all set to become trade and energy corridor”, the president said and added that business community is the economic force for the country and its role is significant in economic uplift of the country.
While expressing his views about the main objective of the event, he said that that heads of foreign missions are not just diplomats, in fact, they are the bridge for maintaining and developing contacts between respective governments and people across the borders.
LCCI President Malik Tahir Javaid drew the attention of the diplomats towards decision taken by Financial Action Task Force for placing Pakistan on ‘Grey List' that has shocked the whole nation.
He said that Pakistan has paid heavy price in terms of human lives and economic regression due to playing leading and active role in war against terror. Our forces are still engaged in curbing all the elements which are directly or indirectly involved in terrorism.
Malik Tahir expected that government will soon come up with an action plan for taking necessary measures to implement the FATF's anti-money laundering and terrorist-financing regulations. It is the need of the hour to plug all the deficiencies while being fully compliant to international conventions. He appealed to all the friendly countries of Pakistan to support in this connection.
The LCCI president said that Pakistan's economy has emerged as one of the best performing economies in the region. Government is bent towards reviving agricultural growth in Pakistan. There is significant untapped potential for growth and employment creation associated with diversification towards high-value agriculture. Pakistan has proven comparative advantage in certain horticultural and livestock products in global and regional export markets. There is a huge potential to narrow yield gaps and improve enabling environment for post-harvest value-addition and agro-processing.
He said that we are undergoing industrial revolution where the existing and future technologies are becoming embedded in societies and humans beings. The new technologies are impacting all disciplines of our life. It is the right time to invest in the future of Pakistan and LCCI is the right forum for paving the way of innovation and skill development.
Malik Tahir said Pakistan is located in close proximity to high growth potential economies in the Arabian Gulf and Central Asian Republics. The neighbouring countries are taking keen interest in investing in Pakistan which is all set to become a regional trade and energy corridor.
He said that Pakistan is an attractive destination for Halal food, basmati rice, fisheries, marbles, pharmaceuticals, home appliances and light engineering products especially auto industry due to its phenomenal growth on account of following the intensive deletion plan. It is high time for Pakistan's economy to get a boost not by getting aids from foreign countries but by securing sufficient share in global economy through initiating joint ventures.
Besides, Pakistan offers a wide spectrum of tourism ranging from religious to historical places and ancient civilizations to modern architecture. The landscape of Pakistan has everything one can wish to see – mountains, valleys, rivers, seaside, deserts and open fields etc. Our culture is so rich and has so many diversities that make Pakistan stand out among the top tourist destinations around the globe.
The LCCI president said that relation building is an imperative part of our agenda this evening. Lahore Chamber is known as an important destination of the appointed ambassadors in Pakistan. This institution has always tried to play a vital role in establishing trade ties with other countries. Holding of this dinner is a step ahead of the same agenda.
He requested the friends of Pakistan from the international diplomatic community to project a soft and real image of Pakistan in their countries. He also requested the international media to portray a positive image of Pakistan.
“We firmly believe that trade is key to continuous economic growth and improvement in the standards of living. Support of diplomats is required to achieve our international trade ambitions. It is needless to mention that the role of heads of foreign missions will be of key importance in this regard. We look forward towards friends of Pakistan to get to the stage where we can achieve win-win situation. For that purpose, we have to exchange trade delegations on regular basis and allow our businessmen to freely interact with each other. The idea of holding single country exhibitions on reciprocal basis can create awareness about our respective strong areas. I have to emphasize that liberalized visa regime can greatly contribute to achieve these objectives”, Malik Tahir concluded.
BEIJING - China will further tighten controls on individuals' foreign currency purchases to try to curb massive capital flight from the country as the yuan falls sharply against the dollar.
Individuals wishing to convert yuan to foreign currencies will now have to provide more detailed information to their bank, including an explanation of the funds concerned in addition to their identity papers, said the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE). Each year individuals can convert up to the equivalent of $50,000, a maximum sum that will not change, it said on its website.
The tighter controls are aimed at preventing attempts to circumvent this quota. The idea is to "combat illegal transactions, money-laundering and clandestine banks", the agency said, vowing to multiply random checks and toughen its sanctions.
Banks must verify the authenticity of the information provided. In addition, from July, financial institutions will have to report to the central bank any international transfer exceeding 200,000 yuan ($28,800), in order to fight laundering, the central bank announced Friday.
The tighter controls are part of an array of measures taken by the Communist government to curb huge capital outflows. The equivalent of about one trillion dollars was transferred out of China in 2015 and another $690 billion in the first ten months of 2016, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates.
Slower growth in China, the weakness of the yuan and the recent rise in US interest rates are encouraging savers to invest their money in other currencies. The yuan is at its lowest in eight years against the dollar and the outflows are putting further pressure on the currency. Authorities are trying to support it by buying yuan, drawing on China's foreign exchange reserves which fell by nearly $70 billion in November.
Foxconn invests $8b in China LCD plant
Taiwan tech-giant Foxconn plans to build an $8.8-billion factory in China, state media said, amid reports its billionaire boss is cooling off on future US investments.
Foxconn, a major Apple supplier, will spend the vast sum on an industrial complex in the sprawling southern city of Guangzhou. The factory will make large-screen liquid crystal displays (LCD), the firm said at an event in the Chinese city on Friday. It will be operational by 2019.
"We have in China a government that knows how to be efficient and supports new technology," said Foxconn president Terry Gou in an interview with China's 21st Century Business. "As to whether we'll invest in the US in the future I've no idea. As a matter of fact, the new administration isn't in office and its new policies aren't in place," Gou added.
Foxconn employs around a million workers at its factories across China and has operations in more than 10 countries. In the US, it has a plant in Virginia for packaging and engineering which employs over 400 people.
Earlier this month Foxconn confirmed it was in talks over a new US investment, while Japanese telecoms giant SoftBank shares soared after President-elect Donald Trump unveiled a $50 billion deal with the two firms.
Trump announced the agreement -- which he said would bring 50,000 jobs -- in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York. Gou said he would only divulge details after discussions with relevant US authorities, but made no mention of it during the factory announcement Friday. The Guangzhou plant will be jointly run by Foxconn and Japan electronics firm Sharp, which Foxconn has a 66 percent stake in.

The stage is set for Nick Kyrgios to step up for Australia after Germany grabbed a 2-1 lead in their Davis Cup first round tie in Brisbane, team captain Lleyton Hewitt says.
World No.14 Kyrgios and rookie Alex de Minaur must win their reverse singles rubbers on Sunday for Australia to qualify for April's quarterfinals after Matthew Ebden and John Peers lost the crucial doubles clash in five sets on Saturday.
The visitors sprung a late change, replacing Peter Gojowczyk with Jan-Lennard Struff but it was doubles partner Tim Puetz who proved the difference in the 6-4 6-7 (1-7) 6-2 6-7 (4-7) 6-4 win at Pat Rafter Arena.

Germany team captain Michael Kohlmann revealed he was convinced Kyrgios would play doubles and admitted to breathing easier when the Australian No.1 was officially omitted on Saturday.
While Kyrgios didn't appear in the doubles, Hewitt warned the dual grand slam quarterfinalist was ready to make his presence felt on Sunday.
In what Hewitt predicted would be a five-set clash, the tie will go on the line when Kyrgios takes on world No.5 Alex Zverev in Sunday's opening reverse singles rubber.
If Kyrgios is triumphant, 18-year-old debutant de Minaur will then need to step up and seal the tie against power-serving world No.58 Struff - ranked 81 spots higher than the plucky Australian.
"They are two of the young, talented players on the tour - it's going to be a great match over five sets," Hewitt said of Kyrgios' much anticipated clash with German star Zverev.
"I am glad I have got Nick on my side.
"He has played so well for me in the past - hopefully he can go out there and do it again.
"We are a long way from beaten, that's for sure."

Former world No.1 Hewitt had hinted that he may play on Saturday but resisted the temptation, pairing Ebden with world No.4 doubles specialist Peers.
Kohlmann revealed he expected Kyrgios to be the man injected into the doubles after the Australian No.1 needed barely 90 minutes to brush aside Struff in straight sets in Friday's singles.
"When I heard Australia didn't make a change I had a very good feeling," he said.
"I thought Nick was playing for sure. He played one hour 30 minutes yesterday - I don't even know if he was sweating."
Ebden and Peers looked to have justified Hewitt's selection, showing tremendous fight to come back from two sets to one down and force the Germans to scramble.
But it was 30-year-old journeyman Puetz - in just his second Cup tie - who stood tall, thrashing forehand winner after winner as Germany prevailed in a rubber lasting almost four hours.
Ebden admitted they had been "quietly surprised" by Puetz, a lowly No.144 in the doubles rankings who only made his Cup debut last year.
Sri Lanka win toss and decide to bowl in second test
by Reuters News 02 Jan 2017, 13:52 IST
CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews won the toss and decided to bowl at the start of the second test at Newlands on Monday, hoping to make early inroads under cloudy conditions and on a quick wicket.
The wicket has more grass cover than usual at the iconic Cape Town venue and has been prepared to assist South Africa's three-man seam attack as the hosts seek to win a second successive test and wrap up the three-match series.
But their batsmen will now have to weather what is expected to be a difficult first session on Monday.
The home side is unchanged from the team that beat Sri Lanka by 206 runs in the Boxing Day test at St George's Park in Port Elizabeth.
Sri Lanka dropped Kusal Perera and brought in Upul Tharanga to bat at number three.
Bowler Dushmantha Chameera, who made his test comeback after a seven-month injury lay-off in Port Elizabeth, was also dropped in favour of Lahiru Kumara, the teenage bowler who made his test debut against Zimbabwe in October.
The weather is expected to warm-up considerably later on Monday and will be hot over the five days, according to forecasts.

Alabama University State President Dr. Quinton T. Ross, Jr. announced Donald Hill-Eley as the Interim Head Football Coach for the Hornets, after former coach Brian Jenkins was relieved of his duties Friday.
This is Eley's third season with the Hornets. He joined the program in 2015 and has served as the Associate Head Coach/Special Teams Coordinator.
“I would like to thank Dr. Ross and Alabama State University for entrusting me with the football program during these tough times,” Eley said. “I look forward to the opportunity of leading these young men at this point in their lives.”
Eley's resume includes coaching professionally in the Canadian Football League. He spent two seasons with the Baltimore Stallions as the receivers coach and then more two seasons with the Toronto Argonauts as a guest coach. Eley went to three straight Grey Cup championships in his coaching tenure in the CFL.
Following his time in the CFL, Eley coached four seasons as offensive coordinator and pro liaison at Hampton, helping them win an HBCU National Championship, two Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference titles and the 1999 Heritage Bowl.
Eley then moved on to Morgan State, where he spent his first season as offensive coordinator and then 12 more seasons as head coach. In 2002, Eley was named MEAC Coach of the Year, his first year in the role. Eley ranks third all-time in wins at Morgan State, with 59 total wins.
“I am extremely impressed with the wealth of experience Coach Eley has brought to our athletics program as associate head coach,” Ross said. “His knowledge of Hornets football will be of great benefit as we continue to support our student athletes and the university's football program.”
Eley takes over his role as Interim Head Coach immediately.
KUWAIT (Reuters) - Kuwait's oil minister Essam al-Marzouq said on Sunday that OPEC and other oil producers will study before June the possibility of an exit strategy from the global oil supply-cut agreement.

“There are still meetings every couple of months for the ministerial monitoring committee, and there will be a study formed for the possibility of an exit strategy... before June,” he told reporters.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers led by Russia have agreed to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018 as they try to clear a global oil glut while signalling a possible early exit from the deal if the market overheats.
OPEC meets next in June, while the next meeting for the ministerial monitoring committee, known as the JMMC, is due to be held in January in Oman.

Russia, which this year reduced production significantly with OPEC for the first time, has been pushing for a clear message on how to exit the cuts so the market doesn't flip into a deficit too soon, prices don't rally too fast and rival U.S. shale firms don't boost output further.
Moscow needs much lower oil prices to balance its budget than OPEC's leader Saudi Arabia, which is preparing a stock market listing for national energy champion Aramco next year and would hence benefit from pricier crude.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Wednesday that it was too early to talk about a possible exit from the global deal to cut oil production, and the eventual withdrawal from the agreement should be gradual.
Novak said the process of exiting the deal may take between three and six months, depending on how the global oil market has recovered by then, and on the scale of oil demand.
Under the current deal the producers are cutting supply by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd).
A female motorist who caused the death of a child while driving her car has walked free from court.
Zoe Bennison pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to causing the death by careless driving of nine-year-old Ethan Owens in Marina Way, Hartlepool on February 27.
Ethan suffered injuries to his head, pelvis, and spine.
He was treated in James Cook Hospital in Middlesbrough for eight days, before doctors took the decision to turn off his life support machine.
Bennison, 26, of Hylton Close, Hartlepool, was sentenced to nine months in prison, suspended for 18 months by Judge Howard Crowson at Teesside Crown Court today.
She was also banned from driving for two years.
Matthew Jordan Carrier (Photo: Facebook)
Howell — A Michigan man charged with second-degree murder for a vehicle crash that left five people dead says he wants the victims' families to know he's sorry.
Matthew Jordan Carrier, 21, was arraigned last month on a 19-count felony complaint. The charges also include operating a vehicle while intoxicated causing death and driving on a suspended license causing death, the Livingston Daily Press & Argus reported .
Carrier recalled consuming large amounts of alcohol at a party the night of May 9, and decided to drive because he felt he was less drunk than his friend. Police said he struck another car while driving. He said he remembers starting the car, but doesn't remember much after that, including the crash.
“I don't want people to think I'm a bad person,” he said. “But I don't think I'm a particularly good one. I don't think I'm a good friend either. I was trying to be a good friend that night.”
Carrier said he learned his blood-alcohol content that night was 0.18. The legal limit is 0.08.
Passengers in the vehicle Carrier drove were killed, as were those in the other car. The victims include Justin Andrew-Humberto Henderson, 18; Preston Tyler Wetzel, 24; Candice Lynn Dunn, 35; Linda K. Hurley, 69; and Jerome Joseph Tortomasi, 73. Henderson was the owner of the car Carrier was driving.
“I never meant to do what I did to those people,” Carrier said Friday. “I can't imagine how they feel. I know how I feel and I feel terrible. I would love to take it all back but I can't.”
Carrier said “it would be fair” if he went to prison.
“I could have found a different way for us to get home,” he said.
He's jailed without bond and returns to court Aug. 23.

A Liberal MP accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a bar in Halifax says that the accusation is the result of mistaken identity.
Francis Drouin, MP for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, was in town to attend the 2018 National Liberal Convention.
In a statement released on Tuesday afternoon, Drouin, 34, says he arrived at an establishment in downtown Halifax at approximately 2:00 a.m.
Halifax Regional Police have confirmed to Global News that the bar in question is the Halifax Alehouse, a popular pub located on Brunswick Street, and is only a block from the Nova Centre, the convention centre that hosted the 2018 National Liberal Convention.

Drouin says that at the Alehouse, his party approached the bar to buy a round of drinks.
“While I was standing facing the bar, with my credit card in hand, I heard what I believed to be a woman's voice coming from another area of the establishment behind me, yelling that her buttocks had been grabbed,” Drouin said in his statement.
“Her comments were clearly not directed towards me.”
Drouin says he turned around and yelled “Get that man out of here” to draw attention to the incident before turning back to the bar to pay for his drinks.
The 34-year-old says he and the rest of his party moved to another area of the establishment.
“Several minutes later, while standing with a group of people, I was approached by a woman with a cellphone in hand, who mistakenly attempted to connect me with the alleged incident. We told her that she was mistaken,” Drouin writes in his statement.
He then says his party left the bar.
On Saturday, he says he proactively informed the Prime Minister's Office and the office of the Liberal Party Whip of the alleged incident.
“The police have been gathering multiple witness statements and I have been cooperating fully. As I have already said, I believe that it is important for individuals to have a safe environment to come forward and be supported. I am confident that the facts of the issue will lead to a clear outcome,” Drouin said.
Const. Carol McIsaac, a spokesperson for the police department, said on Monday that police will not identify the victim or any suspects, but added that no charges have been laid.
WATCH: Alleged sexual assault by Liberal MP being investigated by Halifax Regional Police
The alleged incident occurred on the weekend when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, along with many other high-ranking Liberal party members, attended a seminar on sexual violence prevention titled “From MeToo to never again: creating safe work environments.”
The 34-year-old has been described as a rising star in the Liberal party and moderated a panel at the convention on Saturday with Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay.
McIsaac is asking anyone who has information about the incident or who may have seen anything to contact police.
Their investigation continues.

Arnold Schwarzenegger is arguing that U.S. President Donald Trump's rejection of the Paris climate accord doesn't matter, because companies, scientists and other governments can “pick up the slack” to reduce global emissions.
READ MORE: Arnold Schwarzenegger has a message for Donald Trump and white supremacists
The Hollywood star and former California governor took a spin on a Parisian electric bike Monday as part of events leading up to an international climate summit Tuesday hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron.
Schwarzenegger said “Donald Trump pulled Donald Trump out of the Paris agreement,” but many in the private sector, cities and state governments, engineers and universities remain committed to fighting climate change.

A prominent environmental campaigner, Schwarzenegger acknowledged that many people “don't understand what global warming or climate change really means,” and urged environmental activists to focus on efforts to fight pollution instead because of its health risks.
ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey and the United States agreed on a three-step plan for withdrawing the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia from Syria's Manbij, Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency said on Wednesday.
The report comes as differences over Syria policy and Washington's decision in December to move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem have strained ties between the NATO allies.
Turkey is outraged by U.S. support for the YPG militia, considering them a terrorist organisation. Ankara has threatened to push its offensive in northern Syria's Afrin region further east to Manbij.
Manbij is a potential flashpoint. The Syrian government, Kurdish militants, Syrian rebel groups, Turkey, and the United States all have a military presence in northern Syria.
On Wednesday, Anadolu said Ankara and Washington had reached a technical agreement on a three-step plan for the withdrawal of the YPG from Manbij, a move Turkey has long sought from the United States.
Under the terms of the plan to be finalised during a visit by Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu to Washington on June 4, the YPG will withdraw from Manbij 30 days after the deal is signed, Anadolu said, quoting sources who attended meetings at which the decisions were made.
Turkish and U.S. military forces will start joint supervision in Manbij 45 days after the agreement is signed and a local administration will be formed 60 days after June 4, Anadolu said.
Earlier on Wednesday, Cavusoglu told broadcaster AHaber that a timetable for the Manbij plans could be set during talks with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington, and that it could be implemented before the end of the summer.
Cavusoglu was also quoted by media on his return flight from Germany saying that, if finalised, the plan for Manbij could be applied throughout northern Syria.
However, a local Manbij official later told Reuters that Cavusoglu's assertions that U.S. and Turkish forces would temporarily control the region were “premature” and lacked credibility.
Relations between Ankara and Washington have hit a low-point due to factors such as the sentencing this month in New York of a former Turkish state bank executive to 32 months in prison for taking part in an Iran sanctions-busting scheme, a case Turkey has called a political attack.
DEFENCE PROCUREMENT
Turkey has also caused unease in Washington with its decision to buy S-400 surface-to-air missiles from Russia and drew criticism over its detention of a U.S. Christian pastor, Andrew Brunson, on terrorism charges.
Brunson faces up to 35 years in prison on charges of links to the network Ankara blames for a 2016 coup attempt. The pastor denied the charges in a Turkish court this month.
A U.S. Senate committee last week passed its version of a $716 billion defence policy bill, including a measure to prevent Turkey from buying Lockheed Martin F-35 jets, citing Brunson and the Russian missile deal.
Cavusoglu, however, said that if the United States blocked Turkey from buying the jets, Ankara would go elsewhere to meet its needs, adding that it was unlikely Washington would be able to back out of the deal.
Turkey has plans to buy more than 100 of the F-35 jets and the Pentagon last year awarded Lockheed $3.7 billion in an interim payment for the production of 50 of the aircraft earmarked for non-U.S. customers, including Ankara.
Jarrett Stidham is officially Auburn's next starting quarterback.
The school made the announcement on Monday, ending weeks of speculation that the former Baylor quarterback was the frontrunner to start at the position ahead of last year's starter Sean White.
Auburn coach Gus Malzahn tweeted the news: "The team is excited for Jarrett and ready for the season!"
Just told team @Jarrett_Stidham will be the starting QB. The team is excited for Jarrett and ready for the season!#WarEagle | #OurTime — Coach Gus Malzahn (@CoachGusMalzahn) August 14, 2017
The announcement comes on the heels of Auburn's second scrimmage on Saturday.
White tweeted that he was "all in," despite not winning the starting job.
All in!! WarEagle — Sean White (@SeanWhiteAU) August 14, 2017
Stidham started three games as a true freshman at Baylor in 2015, completing 75 of 109 passes for 1,265 yards, 12 touchdowns and two interceptions. After the firing of coach Art Briles, Stidham announced that he was leaving the program. He attended a junior college but didn't play football last season before signing with Auburn.
The 6-foot-3, 214-pound sophomore has the accuracy and mobility to be a good fit in Malzahn's system. He earned A-Day Offensive MVP this spring in his first showcase in front of Auburn fans, completing 16 of 20 passes for 267 yards.
Auburn opens the season on Sept. 2 against Georgia Southern before traveling to defending national champion Clemson in Week 2.
In George Bernard Shaw's enigmatic social commentary Pygmalion, Alfred Doolittle – a cockney dustman deeply scornful of middle class morality and his society's notions of deserving and undeserving poor – sells his daughter Eliza to Professor Higgins for five quid.
An undeserving poor man, Doolittle expounds, has as much right to go on a drunken binge as does a deserving poor man. Furthermore, if they will give him some money, he will promise to spend it all on a drunken binge immediately and will thus be broke and ready for work on Monday morning.
The originality of this idea, and the audacity and impudence with which it is put forward, cause Higgins and Pickering to yield to his request, and they even offer him £10. But Doolittle refuses because it would involve him in responsibilities; he can't drink up 10 quid in the weekend, but he can drink up five.
Unfortunately for him, however, he is next seen after his persuasive rhetoric has dumped him into considerable riches and precisely the responsibilities he most abhores.
Doolittle was always going to be a survivor, but it's a question that society hasn't yet reconciled.
Egalitarian New Zealand – with the echoes of Edward Gibbon Wakefield's pioneer blueprint for housing and individual dignity – did pretty well with it through most of the 20th century. But you cannot say that now, least of all if you've recently walked down Queen Street with visible destitution in the doorways and a vast hinterland of houses that working citizens can no longer afford.
I'm for a universal basic income and it may be an idea whose time has come, given global concerns about the effects of artificial intelligence on workforces and the abilities of the current system to safeguard meaningful wealth redistribution to sustain populations through catastrophic change.
Usefully, it is firing the imagination of both radical leftists – John McDonnell and Bernie Sanders – and Silicon Valley plutocrats such as Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk.
As far as countries go, no one is going big with it yet, although Finland, which was well into a trial of handing just such a payment out to a sample of 2000 citizens and monitoring their outcomes, has – to global disappointment – pulled the plug early on the experiment.
But not before Guardian columnist Aditya Chakrabortty tracked down several of the country's participants and came up with some remarkable stories, including that of Juha Järvinen.
“Ask Järvinen what difference money for nothing has made to his life, and you are marched over to his workshop,” the columnist reported before Christmas. “Inside is film-making equipment, a blackboard on which is scrawled plans for an artists' version of Airbnb, and an entire little room where he makes shaman drums that sell for up to €900. All this while helping to bring up six children. All those free euros have driven him to work harder than ever.
“None of this would have been possible before he received UBI. Until this year, Järvinen was on dole money; the Finnish equivalent of the jobcentre was always on his case about job applications and training,” Chakrabortty wrote, the “humiliating” system giving him barely enough to feed himself, while refusing him even a glimmer of a hope of fulfilment.
“Ideas flow out of Järvinen as easily as water from a tap, yet he could exercise none of his initiative for fear of arousing bureaucratic scrutiny.”
Our collective narratives around inequality and poverty are interesting. Depending on your political and ideological worldviews, you can see poverty as the product of personal moral failure (skivers vs strivers) or, as their counterparts did in Finland, that poverty is no more than a lack of money.
With the Finnish trial now ended, Andreas Kluth, a correspondent for The Economist from 1997 to 2017; now editor-in-chief of Handelsblatt Global, the digital, English-language edition of the influential German business paper, is calling on other countries, including Germany, to experiment with the concept.
Polarising as it is for people on both left and right, he says, “the UBI is attractive because it promises to eradicate poverty and thus stabilise democracy.
“That is huge. Classical liberals like me also like the idea because – this point is often misunderstood – a UBI would not complement, but completely replace, the existing welfare state,” Kluth says.
“All social-security bureaucracies and other leviathans would go. The UBI thus promises a radical simplification, and limitation, of the state.”
The transition from the old welfare state to a UBI “would be fiendishly complex” and the biggest question would be how human nature would respond to guaranteed income, he adds. However, it was not a given that, if people were to stop working, societies would collapse.
Science fiction might suggest that it could just as easily unleash whole realms of new creativity, learning and adaption – and we could become kinder. • Liz Waters
B.C. Liberal leadership candidate Todd Stone's campaign has disclosed that it has cancelled membership applications from 1,349 people after being questioned by party officials about the lack of email addresses.
“Last Friday, our senior campaign team was contacted by the party about a situation involving missing email addresses on a group of pending membership applications submitted by our campaign – mainly from prospective members whose first language is not English,” Stone campaign chair Peter Fassbender said in a statement Friday.
With voting underway since Thursday and being completed at 5 p.m. the Stone campaign agreed not to let the applications be activated to vote.
“Upon being informed of the situation, Todd immediately requested a full investigation to determine exactly what had transpired,” Fassbender said. “Upon conclusion of that, Todd and our senior team presented those findings to the party rules committee including a recommendation that the membership applications in question – 1,349 in total – not be included in this voting process to ensure the integrity of the result.
“The party agreed with the recommendation and the individuals in question will not be able to cast a ballot because of their incomplete application.”
2. We have handled all issues with membership applications rapidly, strictly, and by the book. We informed each campaign of their number of forms not accepted, and the reasons for those decisions. #bclib18 #bcpoli — Emile Scheffel (@Emile_BC) February 2, 2018
B.C. Liberal Party executive director Emile Scheffel said the party's inspection of new memberships included checking email addresses. He issued a statement Friday that does not clarify if other campaigns had similar issues.
“In any case where the party was not satisfied that an email address was the applicant's own as required by the rules, those applications were not accepted,” Scheffel said. “Based on that process, we are confident that only those membership applications that have met all of the party's criteria for membership, including those applications submitted by the Todd Stone campaign, have been accepted.”

BUFFALO, N.Y. — The NHL suspended Buffalo Sabres forward Johan Larsson two games for cross-checking Florida Panthers forward Vincent Trocheck in the face.
The league's department of player safety issued the ruling after conducting a hearing with Larsson on Friday, a day after Buffalo's 4-2 loss to the Panthers. Larsson was already facing a one-game suspension after being issued a 10-minute match penalty and 5-minute cross-checking major for his hit to Trocheck with 35 seconds left in the game.
The hit occurred after Trocheck and Sabres defenceman Jake McCabe got their sticks up during a skirmish at the Panthers blue line. Larsson skated toward Trocheck and cross-checked him.
In its ruling, the NHL noted Larsson's stick initially hit Trocheck high on the left shoulder before riding up to connect with the player's cheek. The league, however, noted players are responsible for their sticks.
"When a player attempts to intentionally use his stick to deliver a blow to an opponent, he cannot necessarily be excused of all responsibility when the blow lands in an unintended place," the league ruled.
Following the game, Larsson said he merely "pushed him a little bit and the ref came and grabbed me."
The fifth-year player will lose close to $15,900 in salary and miss Buffalo's home games against St. Louis on Saturday and Anaheim on Tuesday.
Emotions boiled over between the Sabres and Panthers shortly after Florida's Colton Sceviour closed the scoring with 2:24 remaining. Officials issued a total of 56 minutes in penalties to six players, including Larsson, over the final 2:01.

BOSTON (AP) — Bonzie Colson scored 20 points, Matt Farrell had 19 and No. 25 Notre Dame overcame a 13-point first-half deficit for an 84-76 victory over Boston College on Tuesday night, sending the Eagles to their 10th straight loss.
V.J. Beachem had 16 points and Steve Vasturia added 15 for the Fighting Irish (20-7, 9-5 Atlantic Coast Conference). It is coach Mike Brey's 13th time winning at least 20 games with Notre Dame.
Ky Bowman led Boston College (9-18, 2-12) with 29 points and Mo Jeffers had 12.
BC had sliced it to 78-76 on Bowman's two free throws with just under a minute to play, but Beachem grabbed an offensive rebound and was fouled on the ensuing possession. He hit both free throws with 24.1 seconds to play.
The Fighting Irish trailed by 10 points early in the second half before outscoring BC 21-3 over a 4:50 span.
Consecutive 3s from Farrell 29 seconds apart tied it at 59 before Colson's putback jam on their next possession gave them their first lead of the game with just under 13 minutes to play.
The Eagles had led by 13 points and posted a season-high for a first half with 49 points to open a 10-point lead at intermission. They shot 58.6 percent (17 of 29) and also went 9 for 10 from the free throw line.
BIG PICTURE
Notre Dame: The Fighting Irish need to take advantage of a softer portion of their schedule — with games coming up against North Carolina State, Georgia Tech and another with BC to have a chance to make a run to the top of the ACC.
Boston College: Like a number of games this season, the Eagles showed spunk but couldn't close out a win. With leading scorer Jerome Robinson (19.4) struggling down the stretch, they really looked challenged offensively. He finished with 11 points on 3-of-12 shooting.
POLL IMPLICATIONS
Notre Dame: The Irish climbed back into the poll this week after being out for one week. A loss to BC and some weaker opponents coming up would have made it very hard to get back in the next few weeks.
FAMILY HISTORY
Colson's dad — also Bonzie — was an assistant at BC under Al Skinner for nine years.
NUMBER CHANGE
BC forward Conar Tava wore No. 30 instead of his usual No. 2 for the second half after playing the final few minutes of the first with a large tear down the left side.
UP NEXT
Notre Dame: At NC State on Saturday.
Boston College: At No. 17 Florida State on Monday. The Eagles are 0-6 on the road in league play.

Lift your head and look around - across the room, out the window, beyond the door. What do you see?
A world that holds few dangers. Oh, there are knives and terrorists and burglars, but there's no smallpox for you. No polio. No putrid throat, no plague, and no terrifying bacteria who could claim your life after just a little scratch on the finger.
That's true of the entire developed world, at a cost. But if you're a Briton you're doubly blessed, because you get all that with one of the cheapest healthcare systems in the world. For a mere £2,069 a head we get inoculations, dental checks, midwives, cancer screening, AIDS drugs, brain scans, stitches, splints, blood tests, statins, and someone to put our faith in.
And most of us realise that, which is why a survey has found that most of us would happily pay more to make the National Health Service better still.
While our politicians persist in the belief the majority of us want to die sooner for less, 73% of us say we'd pay £1 a week more to raise £2.75billion. More than half would pay double that, a third would raise £13.75bn with a fiver a week, and 63% say they'd happily pay another 1% of income tax.
It's the 22% who think £52 a year is too much who worry me, and what worries me still more are the 5% who officially don't know. We all know someone like that, don't we? Someone who reads the headlines but not between the lines, dips in and out, had to wait in a telephone queue for an appointment at midwinter and thinks the whole thing's a mess.
So for the illumination of those struggling in the darkness of believing the NHS is out to get them, and the reassurance of the rest, this is why paying more for it is a great idea.

According to independent health charity The King's Fund, we spent 6.3% of our GDP on health care in 2000. Then PM Tony Blair vowed to match European levels of spending, which at the time was 8.5%.
By 2009 we were spending 8.9% of our GDP on the NHS, but although we had narrowed the gap EU nations were spending more too, at 10.1%.
Then the financial crash happened, the Tory-led Coalition took power, and we began 8 years of austerity. Austerity was not just about paying off our debts - it was about spending less day-to-day, which means that while our GDP is predicted to increase by 15.2% by 2021, our overall contribution to the NHS is expected to be just 6.6% of GDP.
That's 6.6% - barely more than we were spending 18 years ago, even though since the turn of century we have developed crises in obesity, dementia and waiting times.
If you adjust those percentages to take into account the differences between how we and EU countries fund our healthcare, OECD data shows the UK is the 13th lowest spender on health out of 15 EU countries.
But that's not a clear indication of how little we currently pay to the NHS. Since 2010 when the Tories came to power overall health spending in the UK has fallen by an average of £12 a head - despite all the claims Cameron, Osborne, Hammond, May and That Dratted Hunt have made about giving us more, they are spending less on each of us.
In Scotland, which spent more per head to start with, costs have fallen by £51 a head, and perhaps some of the NHS problems in Wales can be explained by the fact they've cut things by £125 per person and that nation now spends less on health than every other part of the UK.
And in the USA, whose private insurance model is so often held up by Tories as one way of "relieving pressure" on the NHS, they spend 3 times as much per head and have one of the lowest life expectancies in the developed world. A hip replacement that costs £5,620 in the UK is £28,000 in the USA; a broken leg that sets us back £1,100 here would be £2,461 there; and a £5,000 birth with complications in the UK would cost you north of £20,000 across the pond.
Medical negligence is the third biggest killer in the US. Here, it's barely on the charts - deaths due to medical complications and surgical care are 55th in the league table after lightning, poisons and wasps. WASPS.
We pay very little for our NHS. And, many would argue, you get what you pay for.
We are paying the same as we did two decades ago, and just as we did then we're queueing more. It takes longer to start cancer treatment, it's harder to find a mental health bed, it takes ages when you're well again to find a doctor who can sign you off to be discharged. Oh, and our doctors are 13 times more likely to be sued for negligence that barely registers on the global scale of medical cock-ups.
There aren't enough nurses, midwives or GPs. We've made it harder and more expensive to be all three, asked pharmacists to pick up the slack and then axed their training bursaries so we can expect to have less of them, too. We listen to the talk of fewer appointments, fewer A&Es, misdiagnoses and paying through the nose for cheap medicines we could all buy down the supermarket, like today's story in The Times that the NHS paid £1,500 for a £2 bottle of skin cream.
Even though that transaction can't be fully confirmed, even though it was described as "moisturiser" when it seems to be a bespoke concoction for a rare skin complaint, and even though it's linked to private corporate suppliers who've replaced pharmacists who used to mix such things cheaply and now don't because they're busy seeing patients who the GP can't, it's just another scandal to add to the others. Somehow we slowly absorb the lie that the NHS itself is to blame, that the ideal is at fault because after all we pay so MUCH.
And who promotes that lie? Who implies, infers and insinuates on the airwaves and in the newspapers that the NHS is dead, dying, futile, spendthrift, profligate, or likely to kill you?
It's not the poor, who rely upon it. It's not those with long-term problems, or anyone who's recently had a baby. It's not the disabled, the elderly, the terminally-ill, or someone who's just had their pipes checked in a routine screen that found something wrong.
It's the people who think they will never be anyone in the previous paragraph. The wealthy, the healthy, the thick.
It's those who campaigned hard for Brexit for the same reason they think the Tories are wet and the NHS is a socialist experiment - the ones whose actions and public utterances never once reference what may be best for others, who resent their higher taxes because they have to share the NHS with plebs. Those who is a foghorn their way through life "telling it like it is" without at any point wondering what "it" is like for everyone else.

The glory of the NHS is that even when such poor examples of humanity are in need they still get help. When Nigel Farage's plane fell out of the sky, when Paul Nuttall finally seeks help for that mythomania, when Jeremy Hunt took his children to A&E because he didn't want to wait for a GP appointment he has personally ensured they'd have to wait longer for.
Of course the NHS spends too much on cheap medicines - that's what happens when you cut the managers out of a bureaucracy that needs checks on the paperwork as much as doctors on the front line. Of course there are mistakes - that's what happens when you make staff do 12-hour shifts with no breaks day after day.
And of course there are always idiots who forget they were vaccinated against a dozen diseases, that their mother could have died in childbirth, that their father should have had a heart attack a decade ago, that their siblings wouldn't have made it or that childhood broken leg, without the NHS, would have crippled them for life and condemned them to penury.
Speaking for myself, the NHS has saved me a thousand times over. My birth, my childhood, head injuries, stitches, brain scans, epilepsy, my daughter's birth, my parents' statins and screenings. I paid £8 for a prescription yesterday, and did so gladly because I got it for free while I was pregnant, and because I'm alive and so are all my loved ones.
The winter crisis doesn't have to happen every year. The lies and slurs and belittling of the greatest thing this country ever did for itself, and showed the rest of the world, do not have to stick. They're marching on Downing Street tomorrow but wherever you are, stop what you're doing, look around you, and count the ways the NHS has helped you.
And realise that £1 a week is the very least you could do, and only those sickened by selfishness would refuse.

THE entire country rose in condemnation over the brutal rape and murder of a seven year old Eve's daughter and apathy if not collusion of the corrupt police force in this gory incident, bringing shame upon the entire nation which is supposed to be an Islamic Republic. While the hunt for the serial killer and rapist was on, several incidents all over the country triggered demand from all quarters including the child's parents and Parliamentary Resolutions to publically hang or stone the beastly culprits to death in order to make an example of them and satisfy the aggrieved families. One expected Parliament to speedily enact legislation to remove any legal hindrance, and make it happen post-haste according to Quranic injunctions.
Ironically instead, with nearly a month lapsed since apprehending this slur on humanity, all one sees day in and day out, is the media house profiting from the tragedy with almost daily needless exposure of the victim's photographs further agonizing the traumatized father running from pillar to post for justice besides the so-called ‘breaking news' over TV channels about the various confessional accounts by the criminal. But it beats all logic why no one has bothered to get around the relatives of the criminal, his facilitators or accomplices by grilling him for the relevant information which was elementary to busting the gang. Even if the Shahid Masood story was a hoax, it would be very naive to believe that the sexually berated swine had been acting on his own and without support.
When the criminal was apprehended after a fortnight's manhunt, the Chief Minister of Punjab chose to stage a Press Conference to credit the corrupt Police Force rather than admonishing them over their criminal apathy and negligence in the first instance. But it was sad the other day to hear the Chief Justice of Pakistan bound by the Country's Colonial Laws, obliquely conveying that much as it would be his personal wish also, the criminal may not be publically hanged due to prevalent laws. This clearly suggests that the Parliamentarians are not pushed to enact Laws authorizing deterrent punishment in accordance with the Quran and Sunnah, which exposes the hypocrisy of the much touted man-made Constitution which otherwise claims that no Laws repugnant to Quranic injunctions shall be framed.
The Islamic Republic of Pakistan which is today Islamic only in name, has come to this pass because of inroads allowed to be made in its social fabric by forces inimical to Islam fashioning themselves as liberals in the name of ‘Ijtehaad' to start with, but actually aiming to neutralize the spirit of tolerance, compassion and justice epitomized by the great Faith which makes no distinction of caste, color or creed. Nothing is more secular in the true sense of the word than Islam but the intrusion seeks to demonize the wholesomely crafted Muslim Society by providence through the last of his Messengers. If you sift past human history through the pages of the Quran, you will find many such attempts by sets of satanic protagonists ultimately decimated on God's command, with the remains of such societies serving as chastening examples for mankind even today.
Those who claim scholarship of the Quran must take the blame for failing to enlighten the younger Pakistani generations in their impressionable years and inspire them to adopt its teachings. Is it not tragic that despite continuing attempts by the Zionists to distort and discredit the Islamic polity more and more people across the world are embracing Islam, but back home Pakistan is being made to sink into the depth of human degradation in the name of fundamental rights, women's empowerment and freedom of expression and conduct, with the so-called emancipated modernist lot in the society including the media thriving upon news of elopement and romancing with broken marriages becoming the norm, and making the female body an exhibition piece for the public through ads and catwalks.
The Pakistani media which one expects to serve as a beacon of light and pathfinder for the impressionable generations, is seen trampling all norms of dignity and talking about catering to public taste without filtering the undesirable, whereas even the West from where modern media emanates, places Parental Guidance (PG) restriction for different age groups. The social media has added to the disaster with a free-for-all proliferation of promiscuous and pornographic material accessible to all homes and age groups without let or hindrance.
What good does one expect of a dysfunctional polity where handsome young Naqibullah, a father of three darling kids from the fast normalizing Waziristan Agency is gunned down in a fake encounter in Karachi and the authorities are unable even to arrest the main accused SSP Rao Anwaar who makes a mockery of the State Agencies while continuing to communicate to the press via whatsapp; where despite passage of over a year the apprehended killers of Mishaal in Peshawar University are still to be brought to justice and Asma's assassin at large; where the Principal of a College is shot dead by a misdirected student reacting to advice against attending political protests; where young Intezar is killed by plain-clothed sleuths of a police officer on the roadside in the heart of the Capital town, while reportedly driving in the company of a girl dissuading him from another female sought by the officer; where countless underage Zainabs are molested, raped and killed and law enforcement remains paralyzed.
I have no doubt in my mind that most crimes are committed with the connivance or protection of the Police in Pakistan. It indeed is the responsibility of the parents to guard, educate, caution and protect their wards in the Society which is increasingly exposed to street crimes and moral decadence, but the State machinery; particularly its Police Force will have to pull up its socks and ensure safety of life, honour and property of its people, as it cannot hedge behind the excuse that it was a worldwide phenomenon.

A Toronto police officer is being praised around the world for successfully de-escalating the scene of a deadly van attack Monday — without shooting.
Const. Ken Lam carried out the arrest of 25-year-old suspect Alek Minassian after he allegedly ran over a crowd of pedestrians on a stretch of Yonge Street. Videos captured from the scene show an intense exchange between the two, with Minassian threatening the officer with an unidentified object.

“Kill me,” the suspect yells.
“No, get down,” the officer replies.
When the suspect said, “I have a gun in my pocket,” the officer responded: “I don't care. Get down.”
Lam was able to restrain him within minutes.

The exchange was quickly praised around the world, and within Canada.
Toronto Police chief Mark Saunders acknowledged that officer's efforts in a press conference Tuesday afternoon, attributing much of the actions to training.
“Our training, at the police college as well, speaks to de-escalation. More people will be dealing with de-escalation than pulling out their firearms in most police agencies in Toronto,” he explained. “It is a focal point of our training piece.”
Saunders explained that there is no “cookie cuter” response for dealing with such situations, and officers are told to evaluate their actions based on proximity to a suspect and the threat of violence.
Toronto Police Association Mark McCormack told Global News that the incident was “a good piece of police work.”
He said officers are required to attend a three-day in-service training program — a program that talks about de-escalation and training free from “biased policing.”
“They discuss and look at real-time scenarios, they talk to people that are mental health professionals, professionals that deal with people in crisis.”

Marc Parent, former police chief of the Montreal Police Service and CEO of Commissionaires Quebec, said officers are also trained to determine “appropriate level” of force for a given situation. He called Lam's work “remarkable.”
“We are supposed to use the appropriate force in answer to the threat that we're facing,” Parent said. “It's my analysis that [the officer] realized that there was no real direct threat to him, so this is why he used a good level of force — he de-escalated to the stick instead of the gun.”
Officers also practice virtual scenarios in a high-stress environment where their actions can be evaluated and they can receive feedback, Parent explained.

“With scenarios, feedback, coaching, training all comes together so your skills are getting better,” he said.
But training can only go so far — both Parent and McCormack emphasized the officer's experience played a role in the matter.
“With a high level of stress — with the tunnel vision effect — if you do not practice this kind of scenarios it's really hard to have an appropriate intervention,” Parent explained.
McCormac said Toronto officers deal with millions of calls a year for people in crisis.
“This notion that we shoot first and ask questions later is really not true,” he explained. “In 2016 we had 1166 use of force reports in regards to firearms, and only seven incidents involving armed persons where our officers used their firearms – so that's less than 0.5 per cent.”
Monday's outcome is very different from what happened on a Toronto street five years ago.
READ MORE: These are the victims of the Toronto van attack
Sammy Yatim was armed with a pocket knife and holed up in a streetcar when Toronto police constable James Furcillo fired nine bullets at the teenager. Yatim died and Forcillo was convicted of attempted murder.
That incident put police training under more scrutiny.
Critics said there needed to be more focus on “de-escalation” techniques, especially in cases where mental illness could be a factor.
From that incident stemmed the Iacobucci report, which, among other points, called for switching the in-service training from two days to three – as Toronto police have done, McCormack said.
Lee Township house fire under investigation
The cause of a Saturday house fire is being investigated by the Midland County Sheriff's Office.
The fire was at a West Prairie Road home in Lee Township, Lee Township Fire Chief Daryl Amrozowicz said. Homer and Midland township firefighters also responded to the fire, along with sheriff's deputies.
Sheriff's Capt. Tray Thomas said the home was not insured and a sheriff's office fire investigator, along with other officials, were working to determine the cause of the fire.
Further details were not available as the investigation continues.
Warp Films is set to produce a feature adaptation of hit West End musical “Everybody's Talking About Jamie,” the independent British production company has confirmed. It marks the first musical from the Sheffield-based Warp, whose recent productions include Idris Elba's directorial debut, “Yardie,” which saw its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January, and Jeremy Dyson and Andy Nyman's horror anthology, “Ghost Stories.”
The musical, which was nominated for five awards at this year's Olivier Awards, including the best new musical, is based on the true story of Jamie Campbell, which came to public attention in a BBC documentary, “Jamie: Drag Queen at 16,” in 2011. The coming-of-age tale tells the story of an openly gay teenager, living on a council estate in Sheffield, England, who is nervous about revealing his ambitions to be a drag queen to classmates at school. But with the support of friends and his mother, he overcomes prejudice and bullying to step out of the darkness and into the spotlight.
Developed in conjunction with Film4, the film version of “Everybody's Talking About Jamie” will be made by the original creative team behind the stage version. Director Jonathan Butterell will make his feature debut on the project, with writers Dan Gillespie Sells and Tom MacRae also aboard. Warp's joint-CEOs, Mark Herbert and Peter Carlton, are producing.

Herbert told Variety that they first became aware of the Sheffield-set musical when it debuted at Sheffield's The Crucible theater for a three-week run in February of last year. “Suddenly, everybody was talking about ‘Everybody's Talking About Jamie,'” Herbert said. “It has an enormous amount of heart and a really positive message. I said to Peter, ‘We've got to do this,' and within two weeks, we had sat down with Jonathan and Dan to discuss it.”
Warp has been working closely with all three key creatives for the past year, prior to its transfer to London, to perfect the adaptation. “A film is a very different structure to a stage production,” Herbert said, pointing to the stage show's two-act structure as one hurdle. “We've been concentrating on getting the script right, to retain the energy and heart.”
Herbert said the film is expected to shoot from late spring of 2019 on location in Sheffield and in studio facilities.
Warp has a strong history supporting debut directors, having worked on the first feature projects of filmmakers including Paul King (“Bunny and the Bull”), Chris Morris (“Four Lions”), Richard Ayoade (“Submarine”), Yann Demange (“'71”), Paddy Considine (“Tyrannosaur”) and, most recently, Elba. The company is arguably best known for its long collaboration with Shane Meadows, including producing Meadow's 2006 film “This Is England” and its three spinoff TV series. The company is currently working with Meadows on four-part drama “The Virtues” for Channel 4, which is due to air next year.
“Everybody's Talking About Jamie” made its debut at The Crucible in Sheffield in February 2017 before transferring to London's West End in November. In January it was announced that the West End run at the Apollo Theatre had been extended six months to October 2018, having originally been booked through April.

2018 TRAVELER'S CHAMPIONSHIP.
BACKGROUNDER —
Chef Frederic Kieffer comes to West Hartford via Paris, New York City, and Southport, CT. Having grown up in the countryside west of Paris, Frederic Kieffer spent his summers working in local restaurants where he discovered a true passion for cooking. His career began in the kitchen of Tentation Caterers in New York City, running the culinary arm of The Museum of Natural History in Manhattan. After working in New York City's Water's Edge and Man Ray Restaurant, Chef Kieffer had the opportunity to open l'escale at the Delamar Greenwich Harbor Hotel, as well as Gaia restaurant also in Greenwich. Under his guidance both restaurants received an “Excellent” rating from the New York Times.
In 2011, he became Executive Chef and Partner of Artisan, a true farm-to-table concept to dining, where he continued to promote sustainable agriculture through seasonally inspired menus. Artisan received a “Don't Miss” rating in January 2012 by The New York Times and Three Stars from Connecticut Magazine.
With the third Artisan location at the Delamar Hotel in West Hartford, Chef Kieffer is once again bringing his talents to the kitchen and into the community, establishing reciprocal relationships with local farms and specialty purveyors, affording those in the Greater Hartford area, and those traveling to the dining destination of West Hartford, an opportunity to experience the freshest of ingredients crafted in his signature seasonal style.
You wake up in the morning — what's the driving passion?
To make today a better day then the prior one. If i can make a small change every new day it will eventually be meaningful. It is not limited to personal changes or work related changes, it is both as they are intertwined.
What traits separate extraordinary chefs from ordinary ones?
Passion, passion, passion
Your biggest pet peeve when working is what?
There are a few but these two are the big ones. Respect, one must have respect for the food itself in order to attempt to do something with it. If I see food not being treated and/or handled properly it really irritates me. Then, you need to taste your work, the spoon is your sharpest tool. It needs to be used over and over and over and you must have one with you at all times, period.
What was the defining moment for you when starting your career?
The moment — I realized it pretty early — in the cooking world the more you know the more you realize that you know very little, I had to be in it for the long run, there was and still is no other way.
Curious to know – when you are eating at a restaurant of whatever type — what's the first thing that draws your attention?
The staff knowledge of the product food and drinks. If the front house staff knows the menus and can clearly take the guest through the nuances of the menus, you can be sure that there is a real Chef, Sommelier and Restauranteur behind them. This establishment should be considered as a serious one regardless of the type of food, sophistication and level of service.
How would you assess the quality of food most Americans are eating today and what elements should people try to include on a daily basis?
We are on the right path. For a long period of time, we have failed — as a society — to truthfully consider the side effects of mass produced food, or ready to eat food and all the artificial ingredients added along the way. Whether during the growing phase or the production phase. More of us now are more aware of who we are is what we eat. Fibers and vegetables proteins should be something that we should try to include more often in our diet.
The annual PGA TOUR stop in Hartford bring many people to the area — what's the significance of the event to the broader community?
We are new to the Hartford area but having experienced the proximity of such events in the past it usually has a very positive effect. We get exposed to a much larger audience, it is the best way for communities outside of the big metropolitan areas to get on the map.
How do you see the food industry evolving in the years ahead?
I think the “less is more” motto will grow even stronger. We are choosing quality over quantity. We are being more sensitive to the seasonality and availability of our food. we are taking a few steps back and that is good.
Is there a specific bucket list restaurant you wish to visit in the near future?
There is no bucket large enough for that list, the world is full of restaurants where hundred year old traditions get passed on for the new generations to enjoy. Anthony Bourdain is and will be deeply missed by many.
Best advice you ever received — what was it and who from?
There are two advices I would offer that are still very present in my mind to this day. They were both told by a vice-president and a General Manager of a company I was working for at that time. First, it is not most important to have a great idea but be able to recognize one. Second piece of advice: One of the greatest things about life is that today is always a great day to start.
Middleton Grange is going green.
The shopping centre's ‘Grow Your Own' campaign is designed to get local families passionate about healthy eating.
We hope we will encourage more people into the garden as well as taking the time to consider what they're actually eating. Mark Rycraft
From 11am until 3pm today and tomorrow, the centre will be welcoming shoppers to visit its specially-created indoor allotment where there will be a variety of different vegetables and fruit on display.
Throughout the event, customers will be encouraged by dedicated Middleton Grange gardeners to take part in a variety of gardening games, including a healthy eating trail hunt around the centre, where participants will look for hidden food facts and items of fresh fruit and vegetables.
Children who take part will also receive their very own Grow Your Own kit, which will include a selection of seeds as well as basic tools to help get them started at home.
And its spades at the ready for participants, who will be able to dig deep to win some top prizes, with several golden tipped carrots waiting to be unearthed.
Centre manager Mark Rycraft, Middleton Grange Shopping Centre manager, said: “We hope we will encourage more people into the garden as well as taking the time to consider what they're actually eating. Our Growth Your Own kits will also provide a fun yet educational way for little ones to learn the process of how these essential food groups go from the soil to our plates.”

Washington — The Trump administration intends to roll back the centerpiece of former President Barack Obama's efforts to slow global warming, seeking to ease restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants.
In a plan expected to be made public in coming days, the Environmental Protection Agency declared the Obama-era rule exceeded federal law by setting emissions standards that power plants could not reasonably meet. The Associated Press obtained a copy of the 43-page document, which underscored the administration's bid to revive the struggling coal industry.
The EPA's new proposal would make good on President Donald Trump's campaign pledge to unravel Obama's efforts to curb global warming and follows Trump's promise to pull the United States out of the landmark Paris climate agreement. Nearly 200 countries have committed to combat global warming by reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.
The EPA won't prescribe an immediate replacement to the plan, but will seek public comment on whether to curb climate-warming emissions from coal and natural gas power plants.
A spokeswoman for EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt declined to comment Friday on the authenticity of the leaked document but said the Obama administration “pushed the bounds of their authority so far” that the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay to prevent the Clean Power Plan from taking effect.
“Any replacement rule that the Trump administration proposes will be done carefully and properly within the confines of the law,” EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman said.
The Obama administration's cost-benefits analysis of the Clean Power Plan was “highly uncertain” in multiple areas, Bowman said, vowing that the Trump administration will present a range of scenarios to the public “in a robust, open and transparent way.”
Obama's plan was designed to cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The rule dictated specific emission targets for states based on power-plant emissions and gave officials broad latitude to decide how to achieve reductions.
The Supreme Court put the plan on hold last year following a legal challenge by industry and coal-friendly states.
Even so, the plan has been a factor in a wave of retirements of coal-fired plants, which also are being squeezed by lower costs for natural gas and renewable power and state mandates promoting energy conservation.
Repealing the Clean Power Plan without a timeline or a commitment to propose a rule to reduce carbon pollution “isn't a step forward, it's a wholesale retreat from EPA's legal, scientific and moral obligation to address the threats of climate change,'” said former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy.
While the Supreme Court has concluded that EPA is obligated to regulate greenhouse gases, “this administration has no intention of following the law,” said McCarthy, who led the EPA when the Clean Power Plan was completed. “They are denying it just as they are denying the science. They're using stall tactics to defer action, ignoring the courts and the demands of the American people.”
Industry groups cheered the planned repeal, saying it would reverse regulatory overreach by Obama and McCarthy.
“The Clean Power Plan represented an unlawful attempt to transform the nation's power grid … and raise costs on American consumers,” said Hal Quinn, president and CEO of the National Mining Association.
The Obama-era plan would have sharply reduced the number of coal-fired plants, making the grid more vulnerable to reliability concerns and increasing costs with “trivial environmental benefits,” Quinn said.
The new plan will save an estimated 240 million tons of annual coal production and safeguard more than 27,000 mining jobs and almost 100,000 additional jobs throughout the supply chain, he said.
In the leaked document, the Trump administration argues that repealing the Clean Power Plan could spare an estimated $33 billion in compliance costs in 2030, arguing that the Obama administration overstated the rule's potential health benefits.
Previously, the EPA had estimated that by 2030 the Clean Power Plan would prevent 90,000 asthma attacks and up to 3,600 premature deaths a year.
The leaked document casts doubts on those numbers and says the EPA plans to perform updated modeling and analysis of health benefits and other impacts of the rule.
Liz Perera, climate policy director for the Sierra Club, said repealing the Clean Power Plan “is about one thing and one thing only: helping corporate polluters profit.”
The plan was first reported by Bloomberg News.

A judge's recommendation that former state Sen. Ronald Calderon be considered for early release from prison over a corruption case drew criticism Monday from one state legislator, while a federal prosecutor downplayed the action.
The possibility of early release for Calderon, sentenced in a bribery case, drew outrage from Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia (D-Bell Gardens), whose district overlapped with Calderon's.
“Former California Sen. Ron Calderon needs to be kept in prison,” she said in a statement. “It's bad enough that he walked away with a mere 42 month sentence when his crimes dictated 396 years. Granting his request for early release — after only serving seven months in a white-collar facility — is an added insult to my community and a void of justice in our democracy.”
Assistant U.S. Atty. Mack E. Jenkins, who leads the public corruption division of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles, called the defense motion that led to the judge's recommendation “redundant.” He explained that the Bureau of Prisons would routinely evaluate an inmate for transfer to a halfway house before the last year of his sentence.
“Mr. Calderon will not receive any preferential treatment," he said.

Former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci pulled no punches when asked about U.S. President Donald Trump's chief strategist during an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert Monday night.
Scaramucci was asked by his host if Steve Bannon was one of the “leakers” in the White House.
“Well, I've said that,” Scaramucci said. “Listen, I've been pretty open about that.”
He also said he believes Trump should dump Bannon.
“If it was up to me, he would be gone,” he said of Bannon, before adding: “but it's not up to me.”

Scaramucci was fired on July 31 after just 10 days on the job after an infamous article in the New Yorker in which he ripped Bannon and former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus.
Priebus was shown the door just days before Scaramucci. “The Mooch” was asked by Colbert if he was brought on board the Trump Administration to help get rid of Priebus and former White House press secretary Sean Spicer.

“Hmm,” Scaramucci replies. “I don't want to say it that way.”
He added: “Obviously there was no love lost there.”
Scaramucci also gave an idea of what life is like inside Trump's White House.
“It's a tough place,” he responded. “There was a lot of infighting.”
Scaramucci labeled himself to be an “honest guy” but said it wasn't a trait shared by many White House staffers.

“What they do is they go behind people's backs and they leak things to the press and they say nasty things about each other to try to destabilize them or to try to influence the president's judgement of them.”
The former executive said that while he never expected to be out of the Trump Administration so quickly, he never believed he would last long in the job either.
“When you take a job like that, you know your expiration date is coming,” he explained. “I didn't think I was going to last too long but I thought I was going to last longer than a carton of milk.”

Football fans are planning to turn this year's FA Cup final into an emotional tribute to England star Ray Wilkins.
The match between Chelsea and Manchester United features the two sides Wilkins, who died earlier this month at the age of 61, played for most.
He wore the No 8 shirt for both clubs and supporters will sing “There's only one Ray Wilkins” in the eighth minute of the Final.
Before the match at Wembley both clubs are also planning a series of tributes.
Tim Rolls from the Chelsea Supporters Trust said: Ray Wilkins was an inspiring player and captain for Chelsea, taking the role at the unbelievably young age of eighteen.

“Given he also starred for Manchester United, after Chelsea were forced to sell him for financial reasons, a joint tribute at the FA Cup Final seems a great idea and entirely fitting.”
ChelseaBecky tweeted: “Let's make the @EmiratesFACup final Ray day. On the 8th minute, we all sing there's only one Ray Wilkins. He played a number 8 at @ChelseaFC @ManUtd and for @England What better way to show our respect than the whole ground singing his name at @wembleystadium.”

The Mirror revealed how the former England captain and popular TV pundit had suffered a heart attack.
He died several days later in hospital.
There will be an invitation only memorial service at a church near Chelsea's Stamford Bridge stadium next week.
After Hurricane David the Catholic Nuns worked in the resettlement of people to the area now known as Silver Lake. The area was first named Fatima with the pilgrimage statue of Fatima positioned close by. Families were well settled to begin a new life. Two long houses, each accommodating about five families were therefore erected under the guidance of the Catholic Nuns.
The name was then unceremoniously called “Fly City” due to the rubbish Dump within close proximity of the community. The name Silver Lake came about as a result of the pool created from the flow of the Roseau River at the back of the community where many of the children enjoyed their past times in play and swimming. At that point where the river hits the bank towards the bend, there creates a pool (lake) and during the full moon the light glitters in silver onto the water pool (lake) hence the name now “Silver Lake”. How creative.
All in all, the children of Silver lake are cheerful, the people are fighters, the parents are loving and like every other family, these parents want the best for their children, their families and their community. They have been left alone to do their own thing, abandoned by this Labour Government. I know so and as an employed worker, I worked in this community. There are hardworking residents of Silver Lake who have and continue to undertake numerous quality community programmes for parents and children.
“Based on the facts, the evidence that we got, the fire actually started through an electrical short circuit,” Riviere said”(DNO Dec. 30th 2016), an official of one of our emergency services.
And, the community of Silver Lake are labelled and referred to as “A Hostile environment?”. This is a distasteful and unprofessional statement. Apologies needed.
The plight of the people of Silver Lake abandoned by this Labour Party government is outrageous, insulting and discriminatory and to some extent deliberate, because they do not shout out “We love our PM”. The living conditions have deteriorated due to neglect over the past ten years, and if any reputable environmental agency is asked to visit and conduct a health & safety inspection/audit of Silver Lake, the immediate recommendation would be to close down Silver Lake and relocate its residents until this unsanitary condition and risk of life to all is addressed. It therefore means that this sitting government have no knowledge of Health & Safety standards, let alone social-economic development, let alone apply it.
We professionals continue to by-passed by this government. We lack the necessary financial & other resources as we observe numerous handouts dished out by Skerrit despicable scouts to those who cry “I Love my PM”. This Skerro handout mendicancy is not an investment but an insult on poor people where all government institutions are compromised, and Prime Minister Skerrit and his fly by-night scouts are guilty of this atrocity. One hardly ever hear of an opinion from the Minister of Social Affairs comment and advocate forcefully on child abuse, on the extent of poverty, on our declining villages, on struggling mothers, on dysfunctional homes and on the weak and abandoned Local Authorities who lack the working structures and resources to function as an effective independent local government authority. Skerrit and his acolytes have taken over this role at their whims and fancies. “We therefore see, daily the application of a vehement Autocratic Leader in operation”. These so-called good citizens are the architect of a social& economic slavery. This act of deviousness is not sustainable but painful.
It is only during a disaster this government quickly run playing their obvious politics pretending that they are so sincere parading the community with potential candidate to run for the labour party. They do not act in the interest of the poor and vulnerable people. Before this incident the PM and Labour party had no strategy. Due to their guilt, they want now to be seen walking into Silver Lake, as this unfortunate disaster gave Skerrit this opportunity to again prey on the pain and discomfort of these vulnerable people for votes and to buy their loyalty to create the disgusting phrase, “We love our PM”. How devious and insulting!
The Health and safety environment of Silver Lake has been deplorable for years waiting on a disaster to happen. The Public Latrine has been non-operational and thus creates a serious health hazard for the children even after the last election because according to the Silver Lake residents, the then Parliamentary Representative failed to keep up with his promise to pay the electricity and water bills. The people disposed of their waste beyond the toilet overlooking the Roseau River. If functional now, it was done recently.
It is imperative to note that in response to a 999 emergency call there has to be an automatic implemented and well-co-ordinated response team that all the Rescue &emergency agencies (Fire, Ambulance-First Aid & Police) are there together. That is the “Response Team”. Did this happen?
This fire at Silver Lake has been a disaster waiting to happen having ignored by Skerrit`s government in the past ten years. The Ministry of Community Development/Local Government has been weak with an obvious lack of leadership with the necessary resources and fortitude to openly advocate for these communities. Silver Lake community is very condensed and close knitted and if this fire had taken place in the early morning while the community is asleep it is likely that there would have been loss of life.
Silver Lake has great potential and the people there are very ambitious and determined to improve the quality of their lives. There are currently genuine efforts made by Silver Lake resident advocates and community workers to improve the quality of life of the Silver Lake people.I have been there, I know them.
However, Political opportunists disguised as caring for the poor and vulnerable continue to take advantage of this incident and parade the community not to elevate their quality of life but to gain votes at any political cost. These so-called “Political Good Citizens” representing this Corrupt and questionable Labour government are the architects of economic and social poverty, blind to the processes of social and economic development, have no respect for the decency of poor people who are exposed to a filthy living environment for years living in inhumane environment. More resources are given to the sale of passports than to our struggling families. This passport scheme has more agents employed than our own Welfare Services. That's where the focus is. We Dominicans are of no value and importance to this corrupt Labour Party government.
Now these political opportunists walk down the hill to offer more patronising handouts and unhealthy lunch packs in guilt to the squalor and poverty they have created. It is another form of dependency disguised in pretext that “We Care”. You fool the people sometimes; you will not fool all the people all time. Our poor, rural, urban, villages and communities are suffering and sinking more into poverty. I have been to these communities and I feel their pain.
Finally, a three-storey concrete apartment was constructed about three years ago and the Silver Lake people protested that they were not party to who qualifies to reside in this apartment.
This Labour government does not consult, they insult.

Benton junior guard Carson Cates had his second consecutive 18-point effort with five 3-pointers and the Panthers picked up their second consecutive win on Saturday night in Jonesboro, defeating the Blytheville Chickasaws 49-36 to improve to 6-1 on the season.
“We got a big win over a very talented Blytheville team,” Benton Coach Dexter Hendrix said. “Very well-coached. A great win in a great atmosphere in Jonesboro. I'm really pleased with our guys. We played really well.”
It was a slobber-knocker to start as the two teams combined for 36 points in the first with it being an 18-18 tie after one. But, the Panthers ratcheted up the defense, allowing just two points in the second quarter while taking a 23-20 lead at the half, and would allow just 18 points the final three quarters to the Chickasaws (4-3).
“I think we did a great job defensively of keeping them out of transition,” Hendrix said. “Offensively, our guys had a chance to transition and we did a good job of taking care of the basketball. We played really well defensively and tried to build a wall to keep them out of the paint. They're such good drivers and I'm really proud of our guys executing defensively.”
The Panthers play next on Tuesday when they travel to Bryant to play their rival Hornets in the Saline County Shootout.
Women's group UltraViolet will demand that Fox News fire long-time network anchor Bill O'Reilly at a protest planned for this week in New York outside Fox headquarters, the group announced on Monday.
On Tuesday, April 18th, Ultraviolet will lead the protest with survivors of sexual assault demanding that the network fire O'Reilly in light of recent sexual harassment allegations. The group will also deliver a petition they say has been signed by more than 140,000 people calling for the network to fire O'Reilly. In addition, the group has commissioned a plane to fly around Manhattan with a banner reading “FOX: #DROPOREILLY, THE SEXUAL PREDATOR.”
“Fox News has a problem with sexual assault – and it's bigger than just Bill O'Reilly,” said Shaunna Thomas, co-founder of UltraViolet. “For years, Fox News executives have provided cover for Bill O'Reilly's systematic harassment and abuse of other Fox New's employees – making it hard to take their promises to investigate such crimes seriously. Fox News needs to prove to the public – and its advertisers – that the era of covering up sexual assault is over. That means – firing Bill O'Reilly immediately and conducting a comprehensive and independent investigation into sexual abuse at the network – firing anyone involved in, or complicit in covering up, those crimes.”
O'Reilly has been under fire since a New York Times report surfaced stating that five women had received payments coming to about $13 a million in exchange for agreeing not to pursue litigation or speak about accusations related to sexual harassment or inappropriate behavior by O'Reilly. O'Reilly in a statement said his fame had made him a target, but that no complaint about him had ever been made through Fox's human-resources hotline.
A large number of advertisers have announced their decision to suspend their ties with “The O'Reilly Factor,” including Jenny Craig, GlaxoSmithKline, Mitsubishi Motors, BMW and Ainsworth Pet Nutrition, who have all moved ads slated to run during “Factor” to other Fox News programs. Last week, O'Reilly announced that he was taking a vacation, but that it had been planned long before the recent controversy. He is expected to return to the air on April 24.
The drama is still unfolding with the Bachelor in Paradise after the show was shut down last week for what they are calling “sexual misconduct” between two contestants, DeMario Jackson and Corrine Olympios, both who have appeared on the Bachelor and Bachelorette.
TMZ caught up with DeMario yesterday as he was leaving Caffe Primo in West Hollywood:
While he might not have said anything to TMZ's camera's, TMZ is reporting that DeMario wants Warner Brothers to release the tape of him and Corrine in the pool so he can clear his name.
He's reportedly lawyer-ed up, and according to sources on set, Corrine was lucid and he did nothing wrong.
Others say Corrine was limp and could barely stand, much less focus.
TMZ also reporting that multiple people who have seen the footage say the encounter appears completely consensual and DeMario is in no way the aggressor.
Reports this morning say Bachelor in Paradise will not be resuming this summer.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Monday will order his top trade adviser to determine whether to investigate Chinese trade practices that force U.S. firms operating in China to turn over intellectual property, senior administration officials said on Saturday.
The move, which could eventually lead to steep tariffs on Chinese goods, comes at a time when Trump has asked China to do more to crack down on North Korea's nuclear missile program as he threatens possible military action against Pyongyang.
Trump has said he would be more amenable to going easy on Beijing if it were more aggressive in reining in North Korea.
An administration official, however, insisted diplomacy over North Korea and the potential trade probe were "totally unrelated," saying the trade action was not a pressure tactic.
"These are two different things," the official said, speaking to reporters on a conference call.
Trump will direct U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to determine if an investigation is warranted of "any of China's laws, policies, practices or actions that may be unreasonable or discriminatory, and that may be harming American intellectual property, innovation and technology," the official said.
"China's unfair trade practices and industrial policies, including forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft, harm the U.S. economy and workers," a second official said. "The action being taken on Monday is a reflection of the president's firm commitment to addressing this problem in a firm way."
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer took issue with that assessment.
"President Trump's pattern continues: Tough talk on China, but weaker action than anyone could ever imagine," he said in a statement. "To make an announcement that they're going to decide whether to have an investigation on China's well-documented theft of our intellectual property is another signal to China that it is O.K. to keep stealing."
Any investigation that may be launched could take as long as a year to conclude, a third official said. He said it would be premature to speculate on actions that could eventually be taken against China, and added that the issue could be resolved through "negotiated agreement."
Trump, who will interrupt a 17-day working vacation to make a day trip to Washington for the trade announcement, had been expected to seek a so-called Section 301 investigation earlier this month, but an announcement was postponed as the White House pressed for China's cooperation on North Korea.
While China joined in a unanimous U.N. Security Council decision to tighten economic sanctions on Pyongyang, Trump has kept up pressure on Beijing to do more.
"We lose hundreds of billions of dollars a year on trade with China. They know how I feel," he told reporters on Thursday. "If China helps us, I feel a lot different toward trade."
Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by telephone on Friday and reiterated their mutual commitment to denuclearize the Korean peninsula, the White House said in a statement. It was unclear whether the issue of trade came up.
Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, a popular trade tool in the 1980s that has been rarely used in the past decade, allows the president to unilaterally impose tariffs or other trade restrictions to protect U.S. industries from "unfair trade practices" of foreign countries.
The process can bypass World Trade Organization procedures for adjudicating grievances. Though widely used worldwide, the WTO process is viewed unfavorably by the Trump administration.
"We're at the beginning of this process and no firm decisions have been made as to how that is going to work in terms of whether we would pursue WTO action or action outside the WTO," the first administration official said.
In addition to the United States, the European Union, Japan, Germany and Canada have all expressed concern about Chinese theft of intellectual property. The technology sector has been especially hard-hit in intellectual property disputes.
An ATM theft from a Shellbrook, Sask., gas station has RCMP looking for two suspects.
It happened at the Tempo Gas Station in the early morning hours of June 30.
Two thieves were caught on security footage using a truck to smash open the door. One suspect then tied a strap around the ATM before they truck was used to remove the machine from inside.

“To be honest, I've never seen anything like it,” said Kerby Tang, the owner of the gas station .
“Kind of resembles something you'd see out of a Hollywood movie with the damage and the carnage.”
The ATM demolished everything in its path.
“From all the fixtures, to the coffee island, to the front door,” Tang told Global News. “The north wall has been dislodged to the tune of a foot to 14 inches.”
The store remains open, but not for long. Tang said they were originally planning on closing this week to renovate and expand the business.
“This definitely puts a dark cloud over it for my last couple days of operations,” Tang said.
Any information about the suspects is still unknown, including their gender, but the truck was believed to have been stolen from the Shellbrook Ford dealership; it was later recovered along with an empty ATM.
Despite the robbery, Tang is warning other business owners to be sure to lock up their stores to possibly prevent a robbery of this nature in the future.
“Take nothing for granted, because this is probably a worse case scenario for an operation like this.”
Source: Parly to summon RBZ bosses over forex – NewsDay Zimbabwe June 14, 2017
THE parliamentary portfolio committee on Finance and Economic Development will summon central bank officials responsible for handling foreign currency amid allegations of misappropriation of the foreign exchange.
BY TATIRA ZWINOIRA
The allegations, which surfaced when Finance permanent secretary Willard Manungo and central bank governor John Mangudya appeared before the committee on Monday, came at a time when the economy has been experiencing foreign currency shortage. The monetary authorities attribute the cash shortage to a mismatch between exports and imports.
Harare East legislator Terrence Mukupe asked Mangudya whether he would allow the committee to summon some of his officials for a public hearing to question them based on information they had.
However, committee chairperson David Chapfika said they did not need Mangudya's permission as the RBZ fell under the committee's purview.
“So then we will call these senior officials at the RBZ [Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe] to come for a public hearing and ask them whether they are doing that [misappropriating cash] and if they are, we will look into that,” Mukupe said.
Prior to that statement, Mukupe had expressed doubt on whether Zimbabweans had faith in some of the RBZ officials.
“When we hear of things that some of your officials are doing it is up to us to hold you accountable and look into them,” he said.
The legislator had questioned whether Mangudya was conducting regular lifestyle audits to make sure that his officials were not misappropriating funds.
However, Mangudya neither confirmed nor denied whether any lifestyle audits were done on his subordinates, but reiterated his confidence in his team.
“If any of the officials are doing such acts [abusing their positions] then please bring it to my attention and they will be looked into,” he said.
This comes as the central bank recorded $2,4 billion in foreign currency that has arrived into the country between January and May 31 this year from mainly exports and diaspora remittances.
Of the foreign currency received during that period, RBZ retained about 30% with Mangudya highlighting they could account for that portion of the funds and not the 70% kept by banks.
“On our books there should be enough cash circulating in the economy, but we are finding that is not the case due to market indiscipline,” he said.

You may think a Vagina Shop (VS) is a new adult store but that is far from the truth.
The VS is actually an educational initiative to provide female students with a safe and relaxed environment. It aims to educate them on the importance of feminine hygiene and to showcase a range of feminine hygiene products.
The idea, a collaboration between Adcock Ingram and GynaGuard, came about when they realised that many young women feel uncomfortable requesting information for intimate feminine matters.
Dr Tebatso Tebeila, a medical doctor at Adcock Ingram, says that feminine hygiene has been limited to focusing on periods and sex education. But the Vagina Shop seeks to change this by focusing on ensuring how to achieve optimum vaginal pH, using products designed for every day, and not using generic soap for vaginal health care.
"The vagina is paramount to a woman's femininity. It requires good care to allow a woman to feel good about herself," Tebeila says. "It is also important to avert genital infections and other complications that can result from lack of care.
The Coast Guard's Marine Safety Unit in Morgan City is in for some changes, but not the kind of changes some feared, the unit's outgoing commander said.
Cmdr. Heather R. Mattern will become the first woman to lead the Morgan City unit during a change of command ceremony at 11 a.m. Thursday at the Morgan City Municipal Auditorium.
Mattern will succeed Capt. Blake Welborn, who will become the commander of the Coast Guard's Houma facility. Welborn said he will continue as captain of the port for the Morgan City area with responsibility for maintaining smooth and safe operations on the waterways. Welborn will also assume that role in Houma.
Rumors saying the Morgan City facility would be merged with the Coast Guard operation in Houma began making the email rounds last week. Welborn appeared at Monday's Port of Morgan City meeting and said the Coast Guard is staying in Morgan City.
The possibility that the Coast Guard would move out of Morgan City to Houma was especially touchy after the recent closure of PHI Inc.'s Amelia facility, which was consolidated with PHI's Houma operation.
But “the Coast Guard is not moving out of Morgan City,” Welborn said at Monday's port meeting.
“That is as far from the truth as can be.”
In an interview, Welborn said some personnel changes between the two Coast Guard facilities may happen later.
But Morgan City's Coast Guard operation will continue to perform functions such as hazardous spill response and law enforcement with its two-craft small boat unit, Welborn said.
Mattern is currently stationed in New York City. Her promotion to commander was approved during the 2015-16 Congress.
In 2011 at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, Mattern wrote a thesis titled “Laser Peening for Mitigation of Stress Corrosion Cracking at Welds in Marine Aluminum.”
An online search turned up articles in which Mattern, as a Coast Guard officer, was involved in events for senior citizens and kids at a children's shelter.

NEW DELHI: From new education policy to the Rohith Vemula suicide incident to key changes in No Detention Policy and a much-talked about change of guard at the helm, HRD ministry remained in news in 2016.
A mid-year reshuffle saw Smriti Irani handing over charge of the ministry to Prakash Javadekar to become Minister of Textiles.
Barely had the year begun, when the biggest of the several huge controversies that hit the HRD ministry – over the suicide of scholar Rohith Vemula in Hyderabad University occurred.
And as the year ended, the ministry readied a series of 12 steps for universities to follow, to ensure such incidents don't happen again.
After Vemula's suicide, Opposition parties gunned for the removal of Irani. Vemula's family said he was a Dalit and the incident gave the Opposition ammunition to attack the Centre in Parliament.
The ministry on its part appointed a judicial commission under retired judge A K Roopanwal, who in his report gave a clean chit to the various functionaries including Irani, while recommending a series of preventive steps.
The report also had its share of controversy as it said that Vemula's Dalit status could not be established.
Another premier institution, Jawaharlal Nehru University, also saw much turmoil after a controversial protest by a group of students. NIT Srinagar too had remained shut for several days after a clash between local and outstation students over a cricket match.
Many of the controversies were a result of campus-related issues, but Irani's combativeness on the social media too turned into headlines.
In one instance she took offence to Bihar Education Minister Ashok Chaudhary addressing her as “dear” while in another she fought with Congress leader Priyanka Chaturvedi, who had put a post about her security.
In another much-talked about social media post, which she signed off as “Aunty National” – an apparent reference to a newspaper's headline about her, Irani talked about her career and challenges, stressed on the need to speak out one's mind and hit out at “intellectuals” who called her “illiterate”.
Irani also rebuffed former Cabinet Secretary T S R Subramanian, when he sought that a report on New Education Policy (NEP) prepared by a panel which he headed be made public.
Irani refused to put the report in public domain immediately saying it will not become the “legacy of one individual who seeks a headline”.

If Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is willing to go to the wall to save the Trans Mountain pipeline and get oil to Canada's west coast, federal Conservatives say he should be equally willing to do the same to revive a pipeline that would have brought oil to Canada's east coast.
And at least one Liberal backbencher is echoing that sentiment.
READ MORE: Over 800 businesses slam Trudeau government's purchase of Trans Mountain pipeline project
A day after Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced the federal government has made a $4.5-billion offer to buy Trans Mountain from Kinder Morgan and will build the expansion to the pipeline itself in order to overcome political opposition in B.C., Conservative Deputy Leader Lisa Raitt questioned Wednesday why Trudeau wasn't putting up the same fight to save Energy East.
“Will the Prime Minister promise to enter into negotiations to provide the same level of certainty for Energy East?” she asked.
Energy East, which would have converted a natural gas pipeline to oil and extended it all the way to New Brunswick, was cancelled last fall when TransCanada decided conditions had changed, including new federal regulations and lower oil prices.
The Conservatives were not alone in their thinking. Saint John, N.B., Mayor Don Darling also took to Twitter to wonder “where was this support for Energy East.”
For his part, Trudeau rejected the idea, accusing the Conservatives of raising “old news” because they were embarrassed that they couldn't get pipelines built when they were in government. However the questions raise a possible vulnerability for the Liberals in Atlantic Canada, a region where the party won all 32 seats in the last election.
New Brunswick Liberal MP Wayne Long said that while he's thrilled with the Trans Mountain decision, he'd like Trudeau to take another look at Energy East.
“I'm simply asking my government to take a look at TransCanada, Energy East, and see if maybe the parties of TransCanada, our government could get together and find a way to revisit, reboot, restart a process that could lead to Energy East coming to Saint John, New Brunswick, my riding,” he said.
In a speech to the Calgary Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday, Morneau warned that the Kinder Morgan deal does not set a new precedent for other projects.
“What I would say is that this decision today was exceptional. We are in a situation where we're putting forth a decision to make something happen in an exceptional way for a project that, let's acknowledge, is pretty unique.”
Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer vowed to make reviving Energy East a campaign issue and said he wouldn't put $4.5 billion on the table to get it done.
“I believe the Liberals would like people to believe (buying) was the only way to get the pipeline built but I think more and more Canadians are realizing that the fact that it's being nationalized is a result of other things that could have been avoided if this government had made different decisions,” Scheer said.

If the government had reinforced federal authority for pipelines through the courts and in legislation as soon as B.C. NDP Leader John Horgan became premier last year, Scheer said that would have prevented Horgan from introducing the uncertainty that ultimately led to Kinder Morgan's nervousness that the project would never come to fruition. Instead, he said Trudeau did nothing to fast-track any constitutional references and never introduced legislation to “entrench and enshrine federal jurisdiction.”
Horgan's court reference – to see if B.C. has the constitutional authority to pass a regulation to limit flows of diluted bitumen in the new pipeline pending additional scientific research on how to clean it up a potential spill – spooked Kinder Morgan investors. The Constitution gives Ottawa jurisdiction over pipelines and many legal experts believe Horgan's regulation won't pass judicial scrutiny, but the company nevertheless halted non-essential spending on the project in early April and demanded Ottawa prove there was certainty to move forward by the end of this month.

Morneau said this week the only way to provide 100 per cent certainty was for Ottawa to buy the pipeline, build the expansion itself and then sell the whole thing back to the private sector when it made financial sense later. He said federal ownership will shield the project from B.C. political hijinks.
However Toronto energy lawyer Ian Blue said ownership doesn't change the fact that the Constitution clearly gives authority for pipelines to Ottawa and the Supreme Court has upheld the law to prevent provinces from doing anything that would “neutralize its essential function.”
In other words, Horgan's regulation would be unconstitutional no matter who owns the pipeline, said Blue.
The biggest question now, he said, is what Trudeau will do about the expected crush of protests. Thus far the government has only said it will respect the democratic right to protest.
More than 200 protesters – including NDP MP Kennedy Stewart and Green Party Leader Elizabeth May – have already been arrested for violating a court-ordered injunction to stay a certain distance away from Kinder Morgan's marine terminal in Burnaby, B.C. Many more protests are expected as anger at the government's pipeline purchase exploded this week.
NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said he has not instructed any other MPs in his caucus about how to participate in protests and said he understands the frustration and anger of people who felt the Trudeau government promised to protect the environment, not build more pipelines.
“I'm absolutely not condemning it,” he said. “I'm saying I understand that people use non-violent civil disobedience. People use protests as a way to express their frustration and I understand that.”

With 10 games remaining, the team is auditioning numerous players in different roles trying to see what they have internally. Ryan Nugent-Hopkins has been moved to the left wing spot on the Oilers' top line next to Connor McDavid. There's been a lot of debate as the season has gone on, and plenty was made out of general manager Peter Chiarelli's comments back in February.
Chiarelli admitted that having $27 million tied up in three centers (McDavid, RNH, and Leon Draisaitl) might not make sense. That opened up more speculation that Chiarelli is shopping RNH. However, one part that's been overlooked is Chiarelli stating that doesn't mean he's going to trade a center.
Chiarelli said he didn't have an answer (at the time) about moving RNH to the wing, but he had played there in the past. During his junior days with the WHL's Red Deer Rebels, and most recently at the 2016 World Cup of Hockey with Team North America, RNH did play some wing. Since returning from injury on March 3, RNH has played five of those eight games at left wing.

RNH has registered three goals and five points in five games with McDavid. Now let's not get ahead of ourselves, it's a small, but encouraging sample size. The trade rumors and speculation will continue well into the offseason. But the Oilers would have another case of sellers remorse if they were to trade RNH this summer.
Oilers Can Move Nugent-Hopkins to LW Permanently
Edmonton's center depth is an organizational strength. The Oilers can manage without RNH playing center, and having him permanently fixated on the wing. Next season's center depth may likely be McDavid, Leon Draisiatl, Ryan Strome, and Jujhar Khaira. McDavid and Draisaitl have both proven they can drive their own lines.
EARLY PROJECTIONS OILERS 2018-19 FORWARD DEPTH 1 LW Ryan Nugent-Hopkins 1 C Connor McDavid 1 RW Kailer Yamamoto 2 LW Milan Lucic 2 C Leon Draisiatl 2 RW Jesse Puljujarvi 3 LW Pontus Aberg 3 C Ryan Strome 3 RW Anton Slepyshev 4 LW Drake Caggiula 4 C Jujhar Khaira 4 RW Zack Kassian
As much as they like playing together, for the betterment of the team's depth, they should play on separate lines while five-on-five. Todd McLellan has already adopted an idea from Pittsburgh Penguins' head coach Mike Sullivan. Sullivan deploys his two biggest stars, Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin, on separate lines, and reunites them for the power play.
McLellan is using the same strategy with McDavid and Draisaitl right now. Ryan Strome has found some comfort as the Oilers third-line center. Although he's been pointless in his last six games, Strome has been playing some of the most responsible hockey of the season over the past month. Jujhar Khaira has asserted himself well this year and was part of the reason Mark Letestu became expendable.
From a depth perspective, there's always going to be concern about stealing from Peter to pay Paul. However, that's not the case here. If this is the plan heading into 2018-19, the Oilers should be sufficient at center.
Thoughts on the Hoffman-for-RNH Rumours
There's one name that constantly comes up when talking about Edmonton's search for McDavid's winger. Ottawa Senators forward Mike Hoffman has had his name in the rumor mill all season. The 28-year-old has two seasons remaining at $5.187 million and should finish the year with 25 goals and 58 points in 82 games if he stays healthy. If RNH played a full season, like Hoffman, his numbers would be 31 goals and 59 points.
A lot of folks talk about a one for one deal (a Chiarelli special for Oiler fans), with both RNH and Hoffman trading places. It's one scenario that might work for both sides. Hoffman fits a need for speed and scoring in Edmonton's lineup, and RNH fits a need for a centerman for Ottawa.
This season, however, Hoffman's also been shooting below his career average shooting percentage. There's some reason to think that if Hoffman's numbers improved to his usual shooting percentage he would've been on pace for 29 goals this year. The caveat is that Hoffman is an unrestricted free agent in two years while RNH doesn't become eligible for free agency for three seasons.

Although the Oilers would save $813,000 in cap space by doing this one for one deal, Hoffman is closer to the end of his prime years. RNH is still only 24-years-old, so Edmonton can still get another six years of his prime. In reality, RNH likely hasn't even hit his peak years yet. Knowing all that, do you still make that one-for-one trade?
Oilers Would Likely Lose Any RNH Trade
Edmonton got undervalued in their returns for Taylor Hall and Jordan Eberle. The deals haven't looked great, and now Chiarelli knows there's a lot of pressure to make any RNH deal a home run. Edmonton can't lose another player of this caliber for the returns they got for Hall and Eberle.
The only way the Oilers and Chiarelli win an RNH deal is if the package were to bring back a No. 1 defenseman or a top-line goal scorer for McDavid. To sell this to the fan base, Chiarelli needs to make a move that's seen as a clear upgrade, and not a lateral or step backward. When you think about what RNH brings to the table, are there any clear options out there that are an upgrade?
RNH brings speed and solid two-way play to the table. He's still very young, so believe it or not, even when he was playing with Hall and Eberle, the Oilers still haven't seen all RNH has to offer offensively. He was still in the infancy of his NHL career. RNH hasn't had any real consistent scoring wingers this season, so this year he's having could be better than it is.
Trading Nugent-Hopkins Would Be Regrettable
If you watch back on a few of the games with RNH playing alongside McDavid you'll notice a few things. For one, RNH can flat-out skate, there are not a lot of those guys around the league that can keep up with McDavid. He's also got an astute hockey mind, you rarely see him out of position, and offensively he always finds time and space. Another aspect that helps McDavid is that RNH covers defensively for McDavid.
This allows the Oilers' phenom to take more chances offensively knowing he's not going to burn his team with an odd-man rush coming back the other way. Like Chiarelli said, it likely doesn't look great anymore to have three centers tied up in $27 million. But $27 million tied up in your three best players all playing in your top six? That doesn't look too bad.

As far as the rest of Edmonton's top six goes, Kailer Yamamoto has been on a tear in junior and looks like a lock for the Oilers next year. Jesse Puljujarvi is improving, and he could end up in a top-six role next season (open for debate still). If both pan out, the Oilers top six might not look too bad next season. Either way, the Oilers shouldn't trade RNH. It's too short-sighted, there's too much untapped potential, and the Oilers have been burned for making crass decisions in the past.
Do you agree or disagree? Let me know your thoughts in the comment section below. Would you trade RNH if you were in Edmonton's GM chair? If so, for whom?

Châteauguay police are seeking the public's help to find a 51-year-old woman who has been missing since May 1.
They set up a command post Wednesday in the parking lot of the Saint-Jean-Baptiste-Marie-Vianney church in the community in case anyone with information wants to come forward.
“They can also call the police station if they have any information,” police spokesperson Const. Marine Denis told Global News.
“We also want her to contact us just to let us know if she's OK.”
According to police, Elsa Maria Vargas Valerin was last seen at her home in Châteauguay .
Before she went missing, she had been pet sitting for a friend.
When the friend went to pick up her animals, she found the front door open and signs Valerin had left the dogs alone for days.

“She was the one who called the police,” explained roommate Diana Becerra who was out of the country for work at the time.
It surprises her that the dogs were found alone.
“[It's] very strange because she's not like that,” she said.
“She's very responsible. She's a very gentle person, she's an animal lover and she would never leave the dogs for two or three days alone like it seems.”
Police say they believe Valerin left her home voluntarily, based on what they found at the house and what witnesses have told them.
“She told a friend that she wanted to leave,” Denis said, “but she didn't say where she wanted to go or when she planned to leave, and the friend didn't ask any more questions.”

Denis says there's been no activity on Valerin's phone or her bank and credit cards.

HARTFORD, CT — Concerned about the break-up between the General Assembly and its nonprofit operator for 19 years, two Democratic lawmakers want to make sure the Connecticut Network doesn't turn into a state-run television station that restricts editorial control.
Modeled after C-SPAN the network was created to provide gavel-to-gavel coverage of the legislature and the executive and judicial branches. However, over the years the nonprofit that ran the network expanded its coverage to include programming to help bring context to the sometimes weighty public policy issues. It even sought to expand its coverage through a 40 cent per month fee on cable subscribers.
It was at that point the relationship began to sour and the additional programming hosted by veteran broadcast journalist Diane Smith came to an end.
Sen. Beth Bye, D-West Hartford, and Rep. Bob Godfrey, D-Danbury, who held an information forum Monday, are still looking for answers about how the General Assembly should best handle the operation of the Connecticut Network, CT-N.
Last fall, the Connecticut Public Affairs Network (CPAN) and the Office of Legislative Management weren't able to come to terms on a new contract, at the same time as legislators cut funding for the network.
Since then, CPAN has ceased operating the network and the Office of Legislative Management has taken over and hired 14 people to operate and produce the coverage. The staff doesn't have health benefits, vacation time, or even overtime, but they were hired back at their same pay level.
There hasn't been a hugely noticeable difference in the coverage.
“We cover all three branches of government,” Eric Connery, facilities administrator for the Office of Legislative Management, said Monday.
The editorial decisions for the network are being made by those 14 staff members and not Legislative Management staff, who report to the legislative leaders of all four caucuses.
While there was initially concerns about editorial control and how that might impact the coverage decisions of the network, Pat Sheehan, chairman of the CPAN board of directors, said “I think they're doing a terrific job with what they're covering.”
He said these are former CPAN staff members and they are professionals, but “they're doing it within the constraints that are out there.”
Those constraints include what can't be covered.
“The most powerful thing that's part of the editorial process is what you don't cover,” Sheehan said Monday during the informational hearing.
He said they're not covering the political party conventions or any politics anymore. They're not doing any programming, like the weekly Capitol Report roundup, to explain what's happening. Legislative leaders have said budget constraints required the network to refocus on the legislature and what's happening in the building, as opposed to outside the building.
Toward the end of the relationship “we had said we would raise private funds to keep Capitol Report on the air and we were told if we did that we still would not be allowed to operate the network,” Sheehan said.
“Do I think that they've messed with the editorial control this year? No, I don't other than the fact of the things that are not being covered,” Sheehan said.
David McGuire, executive director of the Connecticut ACLU, said his organization believes there should be an independent third party operator and it should be “the network and not just politicians deciding what should be put on there.
Michael Savino, president of the Society of Professional Journalists, asked whether Legislative Management was invited to Monday's meeting and what they've offered as far as editorial control is concerned.
“Let me know what the answer is pleased,” Godfrey said. “I haven't been able to get it.”
There have been no indications that Legislative Management has offered any input at all on what's covered by the network.
While Connery sits in the staff meetings, he hasn't offered any input, according to sources.
Godfrey didn't answer Savino's question about whether Legislative Management was invited Monday to the meeting.
“They seem to be more than an obstacle than a help,” Godfrey quipped.
Since the contract ended in November 2017, Legislative Management issued one request for proposal, but never awarded a contract based on the responses it received. It will be issuing another request for proposal in the next few weeks, according to Connery.
Bye, who has been calling for legislative leaders to hold hearings on the television network since the fall, said Monday that she wants the Joint Committee on Legislative Management to hold a public hearing and offer input in the request for proposals.
Big decisions about what happens in the state Capitol and with the network should, according to Bye and Godfrey, be made by the legislature's Joint Committee on Legislative Management, but that committee hasn't met for six years.
Legislative leaders offered mixed feelings about a meeting.
A spokesman for Senate President Martin Looney, D-New Haven, said they have yet to make a decision about a hearing.
A spokesman for House Speaker Joe Aresimowicz said he expects each caucus will assign a staff member to work on the RFP with Legislative Management, like they did the last time.
Staff for Republican legislative leaders did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the subject.
Following Monday's meeting there was no clear answer for what would happen going forward.
Vermilion -
This year's 11th annual Rotary Garage Sale matched last year's funds raised taking in a staggering $16,000 on the opening night, April 19.
Vintage collectibles, furniture, knick knacks, and everything from blenders to paintings were bought, sold and bargained for during the sale.
The Rotary Club of Vermilion raised over $20,000 to put back into the community with the three-day garage sale.
“ We are overwhelmed at the success again this year, it's pretty amazing. The first hour and 30 minutes of the opening night was packed full of people as well as our beautiful things. The ladies outside working at the BBQ said they counted the people lining up as they waited for the doors to open, and they quit counting at 400! I'm not sure how many attended but it felt like there was a bigger crowd this year. This event has really become a community project, Rotary simply hosts it!” said Event Organizer and Rotary Garage Sale Chair Brenda Lee.
“ We had a lot of people saying, 'I'm not really here to buy anything but this is the happening place to be'. People seemed to be enjoying themselves and it is definitely a fun night for us. It is overwhelming and stressful, but man it's good. On the Friday we still had lots of stuff. We are over the moon excited with the results,” said Lee.
A total of 40 Volunteers worked the floor on the opening night. All items were presented in a clean and organized fashion.
“ When we get donations from households who are down-sizing or from homes of elderly people who have gone into the Lodge or passed away, and we want to lovingly care for their donations, and we want to very much respect the spirit in which these great things come to us,” added Lee.
Last year the sale also brought in $16,000 on the first night, making the both years the most successful ever recorded.
“ We often make half of our grand total on the first night. This was such an innocent project when it started and this community has just embraced it. People donate a lot of good items and then they come back and they shop.The success of the sale is due to our volunteers, including the Rotarians, who accumulated over 1000 hours of community service.”
All money raised at the Rotary Garage Sale is put into a pay it forward initiative, and saved for community partners.
“ Every year we select a showcase project to receive the first $5,000 that we raise, and this year our club made the decision to give it to the Vermilion Museum because when they had some water damage a few years ago, they also ended up with some floor damage that needs repairs. Partners who also receive donations include the Olive Tree, Books of Belize, the Community Closet, the Islay Care Center, the K9 Action project and many others.
We partnered with several youth organizations including the 4-H Club, Vermilion Dance Association, Girl Guides and Kids Make a Difference, these kids provided so much help and energy helping us to set up and organize the event, carrying in items and putting them in the correct place. They were a huge help this year,” said Lee.

Collusion?
Washington
After the United States decided to expel 35 Russian diplomats from Washington and close down two Russian facilities, Russian President Vladimir Putin decided not to expel American diplomats in a tit-for-tat reaction. Washington has accused the Kremlin of intervening in the 2016 US presidential election via cyber-attacking. The American authorities have also talked about imposing sanctions against Russia. On Wednesday, US President-elect Donald Trump dismissed allegations of Russian intervention in the election, called for ties with Moscow to be mended.
Scott Rickard, a former American intelligence linguist from Tampa, says that the change of US administration is going to alter America's hostile policies toward Russia.
“A slowdown of this anti-Russian rhetoric that has been pushed” by the incumbent US administration will occur after Trump takes office, Rickard told Press TV on Friday night.
He stated the Trump administration is expected to pave the way for slowing down from what the current administration is backing in Ukraine and Syria as well as their anti-Russia policies. The US president-elect, however, is getting information from some advisers who are pursuing anti-Russia policies, Rickard said.
“Trump has surrounded himself with some hawkish neocon and extremely anti-Russian individuals and his intelligence community contacts are going to feed him with information that would probably not be legitimate.”
Rickard also criticized the Republicans, who are not supporting Trump's strategy toward Russia, saying the anti-Russia politicians in the United States are financed by the arms industry and banking sectors, which themselves are under the influence of the Israeli lobby. Elsewhere, the former intelligence linguist touched on Washington's long history of intervention in other countries domestic affairs.
“The United States has worked through color revolutions and many different activities along Russian borders turning former Russian states actually into NATO allies and occupying those countries in violation of what was put together post World War II,” he said.
“The United States has been extremely aggressive not only against Russia but against many countries around the world, not only conducting espionage but manipulating elections left and right,” he added.
Brent Budowsky, a columnist at The Hill from Washington, said he supports what President Obama did in his expulsion of Russian diplomats, calling it a “smart move”.
The columnist referred to the stances of the US Congress and Trump on the Obama administration's hostile move against Russia. “Most Republicans in Congress as well as Democrats support the sanctions that were imposed by President Obama and Trump will not be able to reverse it with a big vote.”
Budowsky accused Russia of meddling in the US presidential election, claiming that “there is absolutely no disagreement anywhere in the American intelligence community or democratic allies that Russia interfered in our election for the purpose of electing Trump.”—Agencies
Mansplaining, hangry and ransomware are among over 1,000 new additions to the Oxford English Dictionary.
The handbook for the English language has introduced the variety of new phrases which have come into common use recently, with a mix of slang and technical terms among the new entries.
There are also a batch of ‘initialisms', such as TTC – “trying to conceive” and ‘BFN' or ‘BFP' – “big fat negative” / “big fat positive”, referring to a pregnancy test result.
Both can be seen in use on Mumsnet, the online parenting forum, which shows the power of the internet in influencing what has been traditionally known as a printed publication. ‘Ransomware' also makes it into the OED, having been very much in the news following the WannaCry cyberattack which affected the NHS last year.
‘Mansplaining' is another addition – when something is explained “needlessly, overbearingly, or condescendingly, especially to a woman, in a manner thought to reveal a patronising or chauvinistic attitude”.
It's believed that the term originated from an internet exchange between a man and a woman in 2008.
And although ‘hangry' – “bad-tempered or irritable as a result of hunger” – is another ‘new' word, it can be traced back to a psychoanalytic journal.from 1956.
However, ‘snowflake' – although being a considerably older meteorological term – now has a additional OED definition as “overly sensitive or as feeling entitled to special treatment or consideration”.
The OED consults experts to determine what should be added to its 829,000 words with the next update due in April 2018.

From the most awkward moment to the biggest roadhog, Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo reveals his end of season awards. (3:43)
Toro Rosso boss Franz Tost believes a short break from Formula One could be exactly what former driver Daniil Kvyat needs to revive his chances of a long-term career in the series.
Kvyat was dropped by Toro Rosso at the tail-end of a frustrating campaign which saw him score just five points, having struggled to match the pace of Carlos Sainz for most of the year. The Russian has now been cut by the entire Red Bull programme and his hopes of a 2017 drive rest on Williams, though he is appearing to be an unlikely candidate as the team continues to assess Robert Kubica and Sergey Sirotkin, with Pascal Wehrlein also still available.
Kvyat has endured a difficult time in recent seasons. Having graduated from Toro Rosso to Red Bull in 2015, he was dropped back to the junior team in favour of Max Verstappen ahead of the 2016 Spanish Grand Prix, which the Dutchman won. The demotion had a clear impact on Kvyat's confidence and for much of the year he appeared to be over-driving his car.
Tost thinks a prolonged period away from the scrutiny of the F1 paddock could help Kvyat's chances of a comeback.
"I am still convinced that Daniil has a very high natural speed," Tost told the official F1 website. "He was sometimes even faster than Daniel Riccardo, but somehow last year and this year he couldn't show the potential that is within him.
Daniil Kvyat's last race was the U.S. Grand Prix. Mark Thompson/Getty Images
"He was involved in many incidents - but in his defence I also have to say that he had many reliability issues and that didn't help build up confidence. Being the victim of too many incidents killed the performance he would have been able to show.
"Maybe a short break -- to get organised again -- and probably we will see Daniil back at his usual performance level with another team."
Kvyat was at the centre of a number of incidents this season, including a collision with Sainz at the British Grand Prix. Tost believes Kvyat would need to make tweaks to his approach to racing if he ever did make it back to a full-time drive.
"Sometimes he was too aggressive at the beginning of the race. The first corner was his weak point. He wanted too much in the first hundred metres -- success by any means! That puts you under pressure -- unnecessary pressure -- and that never works.
"I hope for him that he gets another chance, as I think he deserves to be in F1."

How would you like to define ‘art'? What kinds of paintings do you prefer to paint?
As of now art for me is what one experiences through mind, heart and soul. At the same time art is the ongoing recorded history of our people, our land and our culture.
The colours on canvas take birth during the process of my deeper reflection of my mind and feelings. It could be a myth, culture, a part of history or simply ordinary meeting with people that triggers the idea. What I am trying to say is that I enjoy making art with some sort of meaning or story supporting it.
Tell us something about the title of your upcoming exhibition, ‘Mukha – The Intimacy'.
I choose a title to a series in such a way that it could relate to each painting. ‘Mukha – the intimacy', is more for the unseen words, within me and you – ‘You' being the reader, the viewer. The fuel which passes through us and emerges via expressions, passion and hatred and these further create the stories of our lives. One should relate to each painting and seek the connection.
Could you brief us about the works that will be auctioned on January 7?
I used to volunteer at an old home in Toronto, where I was told a story about angels. The angels who protect us during our darkest hours are the pets of God. To protect us they change form – from lion to eagle as and when needed. These angels were created by god to be in their most pure form. God chose the birth giver – the women for this task. In our world, there are places where women are seen as inferior but in reality, the beast within is released when devil needs to be destroyed.
Among the entire Mukha series this painting is my favourite and I was happy it became a part of Sethu. The painting is titled 8 Griffons but has only 7 figures on it because the eighth griffon is the viewer, and in my case the eighth griffon is the group of the children at Sethu.
How can art describe culture, idea and perspective?
As an artist, I believe ‘Art' is the only way one could describe culture, idea and perspective; it doesn't matter whether it is a painting, sculpture or glasswork. We all experience people in our lives, and these people and places leave a print within us. Knowingly or unknowingly we are stirred inside by these footprints left by people. During the encounters an idea is born, and such it is always our reflection of the culture and situations what is forming the art.
You hold a record of being an Indian artist who sold the most expensive painting. Tell us something about the painting that you had painted then.
I was commissioned to create this painting. I did extensive research and spent long a time on and with this painting. Through the process of painting I went far, I created the originally Russian baroque Empress using the Indian perspective.
Generally, living and studying in Mumbai has had a lot of impact on my art, hence again, the influence by culture on the artist's expression. Especially the jewellery used on the figures and the general ornamental and symbolic appearances. So this strong Russian empress – the Elizabeth of Russia of my view is wearing an Indian nose ring, which goes from her nose to around her ear, and she is wearing a Rudraksha bracelet around her wrist. ‘Elizabeth of Russia' was just one of those paintings I did not want to part with. In fact, it was not accepted by many as the portrait was too fantastic and abstract – I played with the cultural symbolism.
However, I believe every art piece has a destination. Sometimes it reaches this place quickly, some travel long around the globe before they reach their destination, and the latter was the case of the Elizabeth of Russia.
(Art exhibition titled, ‘Mukha- The Intimacy' by artist Hesham Malik will commence from January 7 at 7 p.m. at Carpe Diem, Majorda. The silent auction for Sethu – Child development and Family Guidance Centre will begin on January 7. The event is open to all. The exhibition is on till February 3.)
SARGODHA-Work on the 200-bed hospital of the Sargodha Medical College, a constituent of the University of Sargodha, is underway at a brisk pace and likely to be operational in July this year.
According to a UoS press communiqué issued on Tuesdya, construction of the 200-bed hospital is in full swing and will be operational by the month of July. It said that senior professors and doctors will render medical services to people besides providing training and imparting medical education to students of the Sargodha Medical College. The UoS management said that additional 600 beds hospital will be open for public after its completion next year. The management said that the hospital will be equipped with modern medical equipment to ensure state-of-the-art healthcare facilities to the public.
On the other hand, University Diagnostic Centre pharmacy and hospital are providing quality medical facilities at cheaper rates to the local population.

A team from Yorkshire is in London helping survivors of the London fire disaster.
Wakefield-based charity Penny Appeal is working with the Faiths Forum for London and the British Red Cross to distribute water, food parcels and blankets to those who have lost everything.
They have been given responsibility for distributing hot food to 300 people who have been made homeless at the Westway in London.
And they have appealed to people in the region to make a cash donation. They have been inundated with blankets and clothing and don't need any more - but still are accepting sanitary products and phone chargers.
A team was scrambled as soon as news of the tragedy broke and were among the first charities on the scene.
They are being joined today by another dozen members from Wakefield, Leeds and Bradford. More are en route from the Midlands and Manchester.
Penny Appeal volunteers in London
More than £1 million has been raised to help those affected as fire tore through the 24-storey building while volunteers and charities helped feed and shelter people who could not return to their homes overnight.
The charity's chief executive Aamer Naeem said they would be doing all they could to help in the coming days and weeks.
He said: "There's been so many people affected - people from Wakefield with relatives who lived in the block.
"One of the ladies found out that her nieces passed away, but her sister-in-law is still missing.
A huge amount of shoes and other items have been donated
“We have a team on the ground, including our Head of Programmes and are coordinating with local partners including the Faiths Forum for London and The British Red Cross.
“We are also coordinating aid with the Sikh communities in Yorkshire and will be disseminating aid over the next few days as appropriate.
“Whilst our courageous emergency services are in their rescue phase, our team, and many others are working to make sure those affected know they are not alone.”
Call 03000 11 11 11 to donate or volunteer.

Penny Appeal shops in Bradford, Manchester and Birmingham are also accepting donations.
Qatar's Ministry of Defense said on Wednesday the country signed a deal to buy F-15 fighter jets from the United States for $12 billion.
The deal was completed despite the Gulf country being criticized recently by U.S. President Donald Trump for supporting terrorism.
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and representatives from Qatar were set to meet Wednesday to seal the agreement, a source familiar with the deal told Reuters. Bloomberg News reported the deal was for 36 jets.
The sale will increase security cooperation and interoperability between the U.S. and Qatar, the Pentagon said in an emailed statement on Wednesday.
Defense Secretary Mattis and Qatari Minister of State for Defense Affairs Khalid al-Attiyah also discussed the current state of operations against the ISIS and the importance of de-escalating tensions so all partners in the gulf region can focus on next steps in meeting common goals, the Pentagon added.
In November, the United States approved possible sale of up to 72 F-15QA aircraft to Qatar for $21.1 billion. Boeing Co is the prime contractor on the fighter jet sale to the Middle East nation.
Boeing declined to comment.
Trump on Friday accused Qatar of being a "high-level" sponsor of terrorism, potentially hindering the U.S. Department of State's efforts to ease heightening tensions and a blockade of the Gulf nation by Arab states and others.

LIBERAL DEMOCRAT leader Tim Farron moved quickly to frame the snap General Election as fresh Brexit referendum.
Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said: "This election is your chance to change the direction of our country.
“If you want to avoid a disastrous Hard Brexit. If you want to keep Britain in the Single Market. If you want a Britain that is open, tolerant and united, this is your chance.
"Only the Liberal Democrats can prevent a Conservative majority.”
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: "“I welcome the Prime Minister's decision to give the British people the chance to vote for a government that will put the interests of the majority first.
“Labour will be offering the country an effective alternative to a government that has failed to rebuild the economy, delivered falling living standards and damaging cuts to our schools and NHS.
“In the last couple of weeks, Labour has set out policies that offer a clear and credible choice for the country. We look forward to showing how Labour will stand up for the people of Britain.”
Caroline Lucas, co-leader of the Green Party, said: "Britain is at a crossroads – and today's announcement means that people are rightly given a say over the direction this country is going to take.
"Only the Green Party offers a bold, positive vision for a different kind of Britain. At this election we will stand for an economy that works for everyone, not just the privileged few; a Britain that's open to the world and the protection of our precious environment.
"We will stand up to the politics of hatred and division that is scarring our communities and give people across the country a chance to vote for a better Britain.”
BARCELONA (Reuters) - Barcelona beat Valencia 1-0 on Thursday thanks to a diving header from insatiable striker Luis Suarez to stay on course for a place in the King's Cup final for a record fifth consecutive year.
Suarez broke Valencia's resolve in the semi-final first leg by leaping to meet a cross from Lionel Messi in the 67th minute, scoring a 12th goal in 10 games in all competitions to leave Valencia needing to win by two goals in next Thursday's second leg at Mestalla to advance to their first final in a decade.
Despite being a Cup semi-final against one of the top teams in the league, only 50,000 fans made it to Barça's 99,000-capacity Nou Camp stadium after heavy rain throughout the day.
Barça defender Sergi Roberto risked getting sent off but was only booked for a wild lunge on Andreas Pereira, who was unable to come out in the second half and had to be substituted.

“We dominated the play but they had a plan, which was to leave here with a result that kept the tie open and they defended well. It's not a big advantage and there's still a long way to go in the tie,” Barça coach Ernesto Valverde told reporters.
Valencia were trounced 7-0 on their last Cup visit to Barcelona when Gary Neville was in charge and coach Marcelino opted for a cautious approach, with his side having under 20 percent possession at one point in the game.

The visitors' best chances came from distance strikes at goal, with Martin Montoya and Francis Coquelin narrowly missing the target either side of halftime.
“It's not a good result for us but we deserve credit for how we competed,” Marcelino said.
“It makes the tie very difficult but keeps it alive. We're going to fight with all our strength to win the tie. It might seem impossible but we'll try and pull off a miracle.”

Tokyo-An octopus, who correctly predicted all of Japan's World Cup results, has been killed and turned into sashimi. The mollusc, named Rabio, was hailed as psychic after an experiment in a paddling pool. But Kimio Abe, the fisherman who caught Rabio, felt he'd make more money selling it for food than from its clairvoyance. Local media in Japan reports Kimio decided his livelihood was more important than viral fame. Here's Rabio in action. It's in Japanese but you get the idea. Rabio - a giant Pacific octopus - predicted Japan's win against Colombia and their draw with Senegal by moving to different parts of a paddling pool. Each sector - marked as win, lose or draw - had food placed to tempt the octopus.
While Japan's footballers are left to dwell on what might have been, at least they still have their health. Unlike Rabio. But his spirit will live on, as the fisherman plans to use another octopus to predict the results of future fixtures.
Rabio was sent to market before Japan lost 1-0 to Poland on 28 June. He had, of course, predicted the loss - but not his own demise.
Rabio wasn't the first psychic octopus with an interest in international football competitions. In 2010, a German invertebrate named Paul correctly predicted six World Cup games.
Paul passed peacefully in his aquarium at the Sea Life Centre in Oberhausen in 2012, aged two.
Cameras are rolling on Disney's Maleficent 2, and an A-list cast is now on board.
Angelina Jolie will be reprising her role as the misunderstood fairy, opposite Elle Fanning's Princess Aurora.
Joining them are Michelle Pfeiffer as Queen Ingrith, and Chiwetel Ejiofor as a so-far unnamed character, but possibly the love interest for Maleficent.
Elsewhere, Deadpool star Ed Skrein is reportedly playing the film's villain, alongside veteran British actor Robert Lindsay.
Meanwhile, Imelda Staunton, Lesley Manville, and Juno Temple will be back as the pixies Knotgrass, Flittle, and Thistlwit.
Fanning dropped a snapped a couple of pictures from the production yesterday, posting them to Instagram.
According to the movie's official synopsis, the action goes like this: “A fantasy adventure that picks up several years after Maleficent, in which audiences learned of the events that hardened the heart of Disney's most notorious villain and drove her to curse a baby Princess Aurora, Maleficent II continues to explore the complex relationship between the horned fairy and the soon-to-be Queen, as they form new alliances and face new adversaries in their struggle to protect the moors and the magical creatures that reside within.”
The first movie, released in 2014, scored an impressive $758 million for Disney.
Helmed by Joachim Rønning, a release date is yet to be announced.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain's foreign minister won further support from the European Union and NATO on Monday over a nerve agent attack on a former Russian double agent as he denounced Moscow's denials of involvement as “increasingly absurd”.
Johnson discussed the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia at a session of EU foreign ministers, which he addressed, and in a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg after statements of solidarity last week by a host of Western governments.
“Our NATO allies have shown such undivided support,” Johnson told reporters after meeting Stoltenberg.
All 28 EU foreign ministers issued a joint statement on the attack, expressing “unqualified solidarity”.
“The European Union takes extremely seriously the UK government's assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible,” the statement said.
Russia, including its president, Vladimir Putin, denies any involvement.
The Russian Foreign Ministry later said it regretted the EU comments, which it said were motivated by “anti-Russian reflexes.”
“This state of affairs, of course, does not bring honour on the common foreign policy of the EU,” it said in a statement.
Johnson said he saw a “classic Russian strategy” as he arrived for the EU meeting, a day after Putin was re-elected for another six-year term as president.
“They're not fooling anybody anymore,” Johnson said.
“There is scarcely a country around the table here in Brussels that has not been affected in recent years by some kind of malign or disruptive Russian behaviour.”

Stoltenberg echoed that position, saying: “Russia will continue to seek to divide us.”
Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom meanwhile accused the Russian Foreign Ministry of deliberately sowing confusion by suggesting the nerve agent used in the attack on the Skripals might have come from Sweden.
“This is just ridiculous and totally unfounded,” Wallstrom said. “I think they are trying to divert the real issues here.”
Moscow on Saturday announced the expulsion of 23 British diplomats in a tit-for-tat response to Britain's decision last week to expel the same number of Russian diplomats from London.

On Sunday, Johnson accused Russia of stockpiling the deadly Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok used to poison the Skripals, a charge Moscow denies.
The couple were found unconscious on a bench in the English city of Salisbury on March 4 and remain in a critical condition in hospital.
British police meanwhile said the investigation into the attack was likely to take many months since it was a highly complex operation.
“This is one of the largest and most complex investigations undertaken by British counterterrorism policing,” the Metropolitan Police said in a statement.

Asked what support Britain had requested from the EU and NATO to counter Russia, Johnson said he was seeking to intensify work on a range of strategies, such as defences against Russian attacks on computer networks, challenging disinformation campaigns and acting against criminal financial networks.
“There are things we can and must do together,” Johnson said, adding that Britain was “going after the money that has been illicitly or corruptly obtained,” without giving details.
While there was no immediate prospect of further sanctions on Russia, British Prime Minister Theresa May will have an opportunity to present her case for any such measures at an EU summit on Thursday, or call for others to expel diplomats.
“We need to put pressure on Russia to take part in a real enquiry about the attack,” Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders told reporters.
“Nocturama,” Bertrand Bonello's hypnotically unsettling new movie, has the artful, suggestive symmetry of a Rorschach blot. In the first half, several young Parisians coordinate and execute a series of terrorist attacks over one afternoon. In the second, they hide out for the night in a locked-down shopping mall, where their killer instincts give way to a sudden appetite for luxury brands.
At once an oblique thriller and a cool, mesmerizing provocation, the film dispenses with backstory, motivation and the other dramatic conventions that movies typically used to make meaning, especially on a subject as troubling in its real-world implications as it is here.
But what is the subject of “Nocturama”? Despite the movie's attention-grabbing log line and its emergence at a state of heightened anxiety across Europe, I'd submit that it isn't really about terrorism at all. You could say that its chief concern is with its characters' moral vacuity, the banality of their particular evil. But Bonello's approach, always seeking to evoke rather than explain, doesn't allow us either the clarity of analysis or the comforts of condemnation.
That uncertainty may explain the film's polarizing effect on audiences since it opened in French theaters and began playing at film festivals last fall. Some of this, of course, is due to unfortunate timing: Bonello wrote the script in 2011, long before Al Qaeda gunmen attacked Charlie Hebdo's headquarters in January 2015, and filmed it in Paris mere months before the Islamic State-backed killings that rocked the city that November.
Needless to say, the result is not the easiest picture to approach or, for that matter, to see; it's unfortunate if unsurprising that one of the year's most significant and aesthetically accomplished films should be receiving just one theatrical showing in Los Angeles (it plays at 8 p.m. Tuesday at the Downtown Independent, courtesy of Acropolis Cinema).
But in addressing “Nocturama,” we should be particularly careful about confusing it with recent history, whether that means praising it for its uncanny prescience or damning it for deviating from events that Bonello never claimed as inspiration.
The story begins with its characters already in motion, and even those who go in cold will immediately sense, from the furtive precision of their movements and the play of blankness and anxiety on their faces, that something dangerous is afoot. As the cinematographer Léo Hinstin tracks several of them through the labyrinthine tunnels of the Paris Métro, then follows a few others along the upper floors of a skyscraper and the red-carpeted hallways of the Ministry of the Interior, Bonello's technique exerts a shivery, hypnotic power.
We watch as these good-looking ciphers plant plastic explosives in empty rooms and parked cars, then toss their burner phones in trash cans. One girl, Sabrina (Manal Issa), disguised as a city employee, applies a flammable substance to a bronze sculpture of Joan of Arc, her nervous eyes briefly meeting the statue's inscrutable gaze.
Occasionally there will be a flashback to the planning stages, allowing us to observe the scale of the operation and the diversity of the participants. With a few exceptions — like Mika (Jamil McCraven), a soft-spoken black youth, and Omar (Rabah Nait Oufella), a brash kid of Middle Eastern descent — most of them are white, including the de facto leader, David (Finnegan Oldfield), and his girlfriend, Sarah (Laure Valentinelli).
Another flashback, in which a university student named André (Martin Petit-Guyot) unpacks his thesis that “civilization is a condition for the downfall of civilization,” is as close as Bonello gets to parsing the nature of their radicalization.
Stalking his characters with sinuous camera movements and split-screen surveillance footage, Bonello turns it into the stuff of a waking nightmare.
By 5:15 p.m., Paris is burning. Having targeted symbols of France's revolutionary past and globalist future, the terrorists converge at the evacuated mall, where Omar, a security worker, has granted them secret access. It's here, in this multi-story consumer paradise, that “Nocturama” shakes off its controlled, simmering paranoia and, along with its characters, stirs to a different kind of life.
Like the abandoned mall in George Romero's “Dawn of the Dead,” one of several cinematic allusions in the offing here (Stanley Kubrick's “The Shining” is another), this capitalist mecca is at once a wondrous after-hours playground and a hell of a loaded metaphor. Bottles of wine are cracked open; designer bathrobes are tried on. One of the self-styled rebels, Yacine (Hamza Meziani), comes face-to-face with an identically Nike-clad mannequin in the movie's most startlingly surreal image.
In less assured or idiosyncratic hands, the notion of these killers suddenly transfixed — zombified, even — by Chanel, Fendi and Sonia Rykiel might have played as a cheap satirical dig, a facile reminder of the hypocrisy behind their anti-establishment rage. Stalking his characters with sinuous camera movements and split-screen surveillance footage, Bonello turns it into the stuff of a waking nightmare, complete with the occasional dreamlike apparition drifting into view. Are they specters of the already dead, or omens of the deaths still to come?
The ease with which the director navigates this high-end fantasyland comes as little surprise, considering the druggy, decadent style he brought to bear on his 2015 fashion-world biopic, “Saint Laurent.” But the movie actually feels closer in some ways to his little-seen 2008 feature, “On War,” much of which was set in a rural retreat for young people, who seek escape in a haze of communal self-exploration and slow-motion dancing. There is one brief, hypnotic sequence like that in “Nocturama” (set to the director's own techno score), whose story and visual style continually evoke the media obsessions of modern youth, effectively trapping the characters in a bubble of their own creation.
Occasionally, some of the conspirators tear themselves away from the mall's wares to monitor their grim handiwork via a TV news feed, though any real information on the human toll of the attacks is curiously absent. Bored and in need of release, the kids blast Willow Smith's “Whip My Hair” over the mall's speakers — not the only time the soundtrack will work in impudent counterpoint to the mounting tragedy of the situation.
The grimly attenuated final sequence is at once inevitable and frightening in a way that I've never quite seen in a thriller before; it's as if Bonello, reluctant to either rush his characters toward their fate or grant them a mercy they don't deserve, decided instead to linger and hold them close. In “Nocturama,” a haunting vision of the world gone beautifully mad, it's the cruelest, most unsparing possible embrace.
It Comes at Night is a master class in dread, but with more mood than meaning
Trust me, Trey Edward Shults is a name you're going to want to remember. Still in his 20s, the Houston-born writer-director served up a ferociously tense debut in 2016 with the low-budget psychological thriller Krisha. It was the kind of creepy, white-knuckle workout that manages to wring a lot out of a little. Now, with his follow-up, It Comes at Night, Shults has conjured another master class in anxiety, claustrophobia, and dread. He's a natural-born filmmaker.
Set in the aftermath of some unexplained plague, the movie closes in tight on a family of survivors barricaded in a cabin deep in the woods. Joel Edgerton plays the bearded, paranoid father, Selma's Carmen Ejogo is the resilient, resourceful mother, and The Birth of a Nation's Kelvin Harrison Jr. is their 17-year-old son. Together they try to keep out what's left of the infected world beyond their doors. Of course, that's easier said than done, as someone shows up in the middle of the night determined to get in.
Who is he? Can he be trusted? Is he sick? If this all sounds familiar, that's because It Comes at Night is essentially a zombie movie minus the zombies. But Shults is more interested in the nightmares of the living than the horrors of the living dead. Unfortunately, his goal is more focused on building mood than delivering meaning. I kept wanting Shults' film to add up to a little more in the end. Still, his chops behind the camera are undeniable. I can't wait to see what he does next.
How A High Schooler Helped Reunite Twins 74 Years After Their World War II Deaths
Enlarge this image toggle caption Virginia Mayo/AP Virginia Mayo/AP
Sometimes a high school history project ends up making history. That's what happened when a 16-year-old Nebraska student decided to participate in the National History Day project in 2015.
Partly due to her research, the bodies of two American twin brothers, separated at death during World War II, were finally reunited.
On June 19, 2018 — 74 years to the day after they were killed off the coast of Normandy, France — Ludwig Julius Wilhelm "Louie" Pieper and Julius Heinrich Otto "Henry" Pieper were laid to rest side by side in the Normandy American Cemetery, high on a bluff overlooking Omaha Beach.
The twins were born in Esmond, South Dakota, and grew up in Creston, Neb. They enlisted in the Navy together and took part in the 1944 D-Day Normandy invasion as radiomen 2nd class on the same landing ship.

Nearly two weeks after D-Day, Landing Ship Tank 523 was crossing the Channel from England, trying to reach France's Utah Beach. It was loaded with men, vehicles, equipment and explosives. The ship hit an underwater German magnetic mine, exploded and sank within minutes, according to the American Battle Monuments Commission. The Pieper twins were 19 years old.
Rescuers found Louie's body after the explosion. But Henry's wasn't immediately found and identified. He became one of World War II's tens of thousands of missing in action. His name was inscribed on the Walls of the Missing at the American military cemetery in Normandy, where Louie was buried.
Henry's remains were eventually discovered, but remained unidentified. For decades, the body was labeled "Unknown X-9352" and was buried at another military cemetery in Belgium — until now.
Tim Nosal, who heads external affairs at the American Battle Monuments Commission in Virginia, says they are always looking for America's missing soldiers, but this time there was an incredible coincidence that helped them find one.
"We were looking at all the information we have on the unknowns in our cemeteries when, at the same time, a high school student in Nebraska was doing research," says Nosal. "And it's almost like a new piece of the puzzle came across the table."
It was 2015, and Vanessa Taylor was a student at Ainsworth High School in Ainsworth, Neb., and was looking for a topic for a class project.
"We were supposed to select a silent hero from our state," says Taylor, now a student at the University of Nebraska.
She began her research by looking at websites listing soldiers killed from her state.
"I just happened to notice there were two people killed who had the same exact last name," she says. "So I thought it was kind of interesting and wondered if there was a connection or if it was just a coincidence."
Taylor says she found out they were twin brothers who served in the same branch of the military. "And they were on the same ship when they died," she adds.

Taylor's requests to the U.S. government for personnel files on the sailors caught the attention of officials at the Defense POW-MIA Accounting Agency, which tracks soldiers who have been prisoners of war or missing in action. They drew a possible link between the missing twin and the remains of six unidentified sailors found by French divers who were dismantling a sunken American ship off Omaha Beach in 1961. Those unidentified remains were buried at the Ardennes American Cemetery in Belgium.
"It was fresh [information] to them and it helped them put the pieces together to identify a sailor that was missing from this particular vessel," says Nosal.
The remains were positively identified as Henry's in November 2017, using DNA and dental records.
The twins had four other siblings. Their last living sister, MaryAnn Pieper Lawrence, died in May.
At the June ceremony in Normandy, her daughter Susan Lawrence said her mother got the news of the positive identification last Thanksgiving.
"For her, it was like the biggest burden lifted off her shoulders. She was just carrying it all this time," says Lawrence. "What happened to the brother — and to have him identified and know he was found, it was the biggest blessing for Thanksgiving we could have possibly had."

The family asked the monuments commission if they could bury the twins side by side in the verdant, pine tree-lined cemetery above Omaha Beach.
Louie's body was moved to a space where it could be reburied next to Henry.
"The American Battle Monuments Commission went out of its way to make it happen," says Lawrence.
At the end of World War II, about 79,000 Americans were unaccounted for, according to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. Today, the agency's website says, more than 72,000 remain unaccounted for from the war.
Many bodies have been identified, says Nosal. But once they are, their families usually repatriate them to the United States.
He says this is the first missing soldier to be identified and buried in this Normandy cemetery of more than 9,300 graves.
"People will be talking about the Pieper twins and visiting their graves for as long as this cemetery exists," he says. "Five million visitors come through this cemetery each year. If you were to rebury your loved one in a private cemetery back home, he would never receive so many visitors. There's a strong message here for the world, of what these men sacrificed their lives for."
As the June ceremony got underway, taps was played as six midshipmen carried Henry's flag-draped coffin between the rows of white marble crosses and Stars of David. The twins' family members sat in a row of chairs on the green lawn. Six nieces and nephews of the twins traveled from the U.S. to witness the burial of uncles they never met.
One of the nephews, Louis Henry Pieper, is named after both twins. His father died before learning of the discovery of the missing sibling's remains.
"He knew that one of his brothers was buried in Normandy and the other one was unknown," said Pieper. "It was always a wound in his heart not knowing where his brother was, so he never talked about it."
As eldest niece and next of kin, Linda Pieper Suitor, was presented with the flag from Henry's coffin after the ceremony. She said this event has changed her life.
"I think I've found a new purpose for my life," Suitor said. "I'm going home and I'm going to visit high schools and share this story and make sure students know about this history project. I'm going to tell them what it's meant to me and my family."

A newspaper clipping from the summer of 1944 in student Vanessa Taylor's online project says 300 people turned out for a memorial ceremony for the twins in their little Nebraska town. Henry and Louie were the first sons of Creston to die in the war, according to the old newspaper article.
The twins were first-generation Americans. Both their parents had emigrated from Germany. Niece Susan Lawrence says the family was proud to be American and knew Hitler had to be stopped.
Initially, Henry and Louie were separated in the Navy. But their father wrote a letter asking that they be able to serve together.
And Lawrence recalls that the twins wrote to their parents just before they died.
"Do not worry about us," she remembers it saying. "We are together."
It turns out, the oyster aphrodisiac myth not be a myth at all. You may have heard that they'll get you in the mood because oysters are high in zinc, which is linked to high testosterone levels and in rats. I've also heard it's because eating an oyster is similar to giving oral sex to a woman, which I don't understand because I've definitely never done that in a Red Lobster. But as far as oysters leading to sex is concerned, there may be science to back this idea up.
New research from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, which looked at data of 501 couples who were trying to get pregnant, shows that eating seafood is linked to having more sex — and higher pregnancy rates. They study went on for four years, where couples were each followed for one year or until pregnancy was detected. And the results were clear — more seafood intake was associated with having more sex and fecundity — which essentially just means fertility or the ability to produce offspring. Say it with me: fecundity. More seafood, higher fecundity.
Basically, the research found that 92 percent of the couples who ate fish and shellfish at least twice a week were able to get pregnant within the year. They also found that those who ate the most fish and shellfish — to the tune of eight or more times a month — had a 22 percent higher rate of sexual activity than average. So if you're trying to get pregnant — or just have more sex life — you may want to pass the lobster.
The researchers actually didn't set out to prove the link between seafood and sexual intercourse, so the results were a shock to them too. "We are not sure what exactly is driving this association," Audrey J. Gaskins, Sc.D., Research Associate at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health, tells Bustle. "For example, the original reason why shellfish such as oysters were linked to increased libido was due to their high zinc content. Studies have shown that in humans, dietary zinc intake has a positive correlation with testosterone levels and in rats that zinc therapy improves sexual competence. However, given that we did not measure zinc intake in our study and zinc is found in many other foods other than seafood, we felt uncomfortable making this link in our study."
Gaskin also says there's a possible behavioral explanation for the link. "It is also possible that couples who consume higher amounts of seafood together share more meals and thus more time together (including nights) which may be a behavioral explanation for the association we observed with sexual activity," she says.
So now you know. But that's not the first time a link between food and sex has been proven. Take a look at some of the connections below.
1 Millennials Like Food As Much As Sex Andrew Zaeh for Bustle In 2016, a survey from Havas Worldwide and Market Probe International, of almost 12,000 adults of all ages, found that 54 percent of millennials believed that food is on the same level as sex. Millennials are far more likely to put food that high on the list than other generations — as only 42 percent of Baby Boomers said the same.
2 Guacamole Can Help You Hook Up Andrew Zaeh for Bustle Whether you're looking for love or sex, certain foods can help you get there. Zoosk, the dating platform, looked at 3,733,185 dating profiles and 364,609,566 first messages and found that food was often associated with a higher response rate. For example, mentioning guacamole in a message got you 114 percent more replies than not mentioning it. It really is the way to our hearts — and our everything else.
3 An Apple A Day Can Help Your Roll In The Hay Andrew Zaeh for Bustle This is one reason to get your five-a-day. Research published in the journal of Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics found that apples can actually stimulate sexual arousal in women. The research found that apples can improve lubrication and overall sexual function. Just something to keep in mind the next time you're at the grocery store.
4 Men And Women Think About Sex More Than Food Andrew Zaeh for Bustle A 2011 study from psychologists at Ohio University found that women think about sex about once every 50 minutes, compared to men who think about it every 28 minutes. When it comes to food, women think about it every 62 minutes — while men tended to think about it every 38 minutes. So let me get this straight: Some women think about food less than once an hour? The average woman does? I have never met any of these women. I want to take my own poll about how many seconds pass between me thinking about bread. If I can get the number up to 20, I win.

It is no secret where Scunthorpe United's problems lie at the moment and where they have done for most of the season
Especially over the last month the problem has been masked slightly by the great run the Iron have been on, but it has painfully been laid bare over the last week, with the Iron exiting two cup competitions and suffering a disappointing defeat to Walsall.
The problem of course is the lack of goals from the strikers and that has been a problem all season.
Of the 26 goals scored in the league this season, only eight have these have come from the strikers, with Lee Novak netting four, Paddy Madden two and Tom Hopper two.
Indeed the top marksmen are again Josh Morris, who has seven league goals to his name, while Duane Holmes has five.
The 26 scored is the equal lowest in the top 11 and is a far cry from last season, when the Iron had scored 43 by this stage last year.
Each team pushing for promotion is likely to have one 20-goal a season striker but the Iron do not seem to have that at the moment.
If the Iron are to mount a serious promotion push then at least one, if not two strikers, are needed in the January transfer window as goals are needed to complement the solid defence United have.
Teams will inevitably be chasing forwards, as they are the players that are most likely to get you the goals and someone in the mould of Eoin Doyle at Oldham, who has already scored nine this season, would be a perfect fit for Scunthorpe.
Anyone who is brought in during January, you would them to be hitting at least 10 before the season is out, to aid the Iron's promotion push.
If Scunthorpe moves for a striker, even in the loan market, they would look for someone like Ivan Toney, who netted six goals for the Iron after joining in January.
If they can find a striker who can find the net on a regular basis then they can sustain a promotion push and then revisit the situation in the summer.
All of the strikers have their attributes but Alexander has failed to find a partnership that has really worked.
Madden and Hopper have started recently but failed to find an understanding that blossomed at the end of the 2015/16 season, while Hopper and Kevin van Veen have not been played together despite a promising start to last season.
Even though Lee Novak has scored twice in as many games on two occasions his partnership with Hopper looked less than convincing.

The problem is the longer the strikers go on without scoring, the more the problem will be highlighted.
Some perspective is needed and the Iron still sit fifth with nearly half the season gone and their good work should not be overshadowed by a poor week.
If the strikers can get firing then a top two finish, although tough, is not beyond the realms of possibility.
Alexander is aware of the barren run of games his strikers have gone through – October 28 was the last time one scored in the league – and is aware they need to start scoring sooner rather than later.
“For them and us, I would like them to hit the back of the net on a more regular basis,” he told the Telegraph.
“They have all been part of winning games, and we have been winning games on a consistent basis.
“But we can't just rely on the same two or three players every week to get us the goals.
“We have to spread them around and we have done that well over the last season and a half when we have had lots of different goalscorers.
“We need to try and get them back on the goalscoring trail because we don't want the pressure to be on just two or three.”

Bitcoin Futures Soar Amid Frenzy Over Virtual Currency
NEW YORK (AP) – Wall Street got its first taste of bitcoin on Monday, with the price of the first-ever futures contract for the digital currency jumping 20 percent. It's a step forward for the bitcoin, which has soared this year despite concerns that the surge of investor interest has transformed it from a new-age currency into just the latest speculative bubble.
Trading on the contract for the virtual currency began Sunday. The first-ever futures contract closed at $18,545, according to data from Cboe Global Markets, ending its initial day of trading with a 20 percent gain from its opening price.
Overstock.com, which accepts bitcoin, surged $9.92, or 22 percent, to $55.
Apple Orchestrates Deal for Song-Recognition App Shazam
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple has bought Shazam, the maker of a song-recognition app that Apple's digital assistant Siri has already been using to help people identify the music playing on their iPhones. The companies didn't disclose the price of the acquisition announced Monday, but previous reports placed the value at about $400 million. Siri began drawing upon Shazam's technology to answer questions about songs in a 2014 update to the iPhone's operating system.
Some Glitches Seen in Deadline Week for ‘Obamacare' Sign-Ups
WASHINGTON (AP) – Consumer advocates are reporting some glitches in the final days for “Obamacare” sign-ups, but the Trump administration largely seems to be keeping its promise of a smooth enrollment experience. Some HealthCare.gov customers got an incorrect message that no plans were available. President Donald Trump came into office promising to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, but it survived. Now his administration is overseeing the finale to sign-ups. Friday, Dec. 15 is the last day in most states.
Zinke, House GOP Face Criticism Over Patagonia Attacks
WASHINGTON (AP) – Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and House Republicans are escalating their feud with an outdoor retail company that opposes the Trump administration's plan to shrink two sprawling Utah national monuments. The House Natural Resources Committee said in a tweet that clothing giant Patagonia is “lying” about Mr. Trump's plan in order “to sell more products to wealthy elitist urban dwellers from New York to San Francisco.”
Waiting for Congress, Mnuchin Makes 2nd Emergency Debt Move
WASHINGTON (AP) – Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday he is making a second emergency move to keep the government from going above the debt limit while awaiting congressional action to raise the threshold. In a letter to congressional leaders, Mnuchin said he will not be able to fully invest in a large civil service retirement and disability fund. Skipped investments will be restored once the debt limit has been raised, he said.
Comcast Drops Bid for Fox Assets, Leaving Disney in Pole Position
NEW YORK (Reuters) – Comcast Corp said on Monday it had abandoned its bid for most of the assets of Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc, leaving Walt Disney Co as the sole suitor in pursuit of the $40 billion-plus deal. “When a set of assets like Fox's becomes available, it is our responsibility to evaluate if there is a strategic fit that could benefit our company and our shareholders,” Comcast said in a statement. “That is what we tried to do and we are no longer engaged in the review of those assets. We never got the level of engagement needed to make a definitive offer.”
Disney's negotiations with Fox are continuing, and a deal could be reached as early as this month, sources close to the situation said on Monday. The persons asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.

If current trends continue, Islam is on track to become the largest religion in the entire world by the end of this century according a stunning new report that was just released by the Pew Research Center. While it is true that Christianity is still growing on a global basis, it is not growing nearly as rapidly as Islam. So unless something changes, Christianity will only be the second largest faith in the world by the year 2070. According to this newly released report, Islam is the only major religion that is growing faster than the global population overall, and it is being projected that the number of Muslims on the planet will rise by a staggering 73 percent between 2010 and 2050…
Islam is the only religion growing faster than the world's population, and it will be the largest in the world by 2070, research has found. US-based Pew Research Center analyzed demographic change among the world's major religions and found that the world's population of Muslims will grow by 73 percent between 2010 and 2050, compared to 35 percent for Christians, the next fastest-growing faith. The world's population will grow by 37 percent over the same period. If those rates of growth continue past 2050, Muslims will outnumber Christians by 2070, the report found.
Of course there are religious groups that are growing even faster than Islam, but they were not part of this study.
For example, I have previously written about how witchcraft is the fastest growing faith in America, and yesterday I wrote about how membership in the Satanic Temple in the United States has been absolutely exploding since Donald Trump was elected.
So it isn't just Islam that is gaining ground.
But without a doubt, Islam is now the dominant worldview on much of the planet. Many in the western world tend to think of it as a Middle Eastern religion, but the truth is that most Muslims actually live in the Asia-Pacific region…
Some 62 percent of Muslims live in the Asia-Pacific region with large populations in Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iran and Turkey, Pew researchers said. In 2050, India is set to take over from Indonesia as the country with the world's largest Muslim population, according to the study.
In India, there truly is a battle going on for the spiritual future of that nation right now. Christianity and Islam are both making a tremendous amount of progress, and this has greatly upset a lot of traditional Hindu groups.
Islam is making a lot of progress in Europe as well. A tremendous amount of immigration has caused the number of European Muslims to surge in recent years, and this new report is projecting that 10 percent of all Europeans will belong to Islam by the year 2050.
Here in the United States, Muslims still only make up a very small percentage of the population, but that percentage is growing too. The following comes directly out of the new Pew Research Center report…
In 2015, according to our best estimate, there were 3.3 million Muslims of all ages in the U.S., or about 1% of the U.S. population. Pew Research Center's 2014 Religious Landscape Study (conducted in English and Spanish) found that 0.9% of U.S. adults identify as Muslims. A 2011 survey of Muslim Americans, which was conducted in English as well as Arabic, Farsi and Urdu, estimated that there were 1.8 million Muslim adults (and 2.75 million Muslims of all ages) in the country. That survey also found that a majority of U.S. Muslims (63%) are immigrants. Our demographic projections estimate that Muslims will make up 2.1% of the U.S. population by the year 2050, surpassing people who identify as Jewish on the basis of religion as the second-largest faith group in the country (not including people who say they have no religion).
Once the number of Muslims in the United States surpasses the number of Jewish people, what impact will that have on U.S. politics?
That is something to think about.
The report indicated that there are a couple of primary reasons why Islam is growing so rapidly around the world.
First of all, Muslims tend to have larger families than everyone else. The report said that the average Muslim woman has 3.1 children during her lifetime, while all other groups only have 2.3 children per woman.
So in the end, Islam could end up dominating the world just by simply making more babies than everyone else.
Muslims are also younger on average than other religious groups. According to the report, on a global basis Muslims are “seven years younger than the median age of non-Muslims”.
Unfortunately, when Muslims become dominant in a society they often want to impose their systems of government, law, economics, etc. on everyone else. That is why “sharia law” is such a sensitive issue, and the report found that in some Islamic countries an overwhelming majority of Muslims want to impose sharia law on everyone else…
For instance, a Pew Research Center survey of Muslims in 39 countries asked Muslims whether they want sharia law, a legal code based on the Quran and other Islamic scripture, to be the official law of the land in their country. Responses on this question vary widely. Nearly all Muslims in Afghanistan (99%) and most in Iraq (91%) and Pakistan (84%) support sharia law as official law. But in some other countries, especially in Eastern Europe and Central Asia – including Turkey (12%), Kazakhstan (10%) and Azerbaijan (8%) – relatively few favor the implementation of sharia law.
In his new book entitled “Mystery Babylon: Unlocking the Bible's Greatest Prophetic Mystery“, best-selling author Joel Richardson suggests that the identity of the “Mystery Babylon” that we read about in the Book of Revelation could actually be Mecca.
I am not sure whether that is true or not, but nobody can deny that Islam is one of the most dominant forces on the entire planet in 2017, and it looks like it is going to become even more dominant in the years ahead.
And that is troubling news for Christians and those of other faiths, because all you have to do is to look at countries such as Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan and Iran to see what happens to other faiths once Islam takes total control of a nation.
In a truly Islamic state, there is no room for religious freedom, and so the growth of Islam is likely to be one of the greatest global threats to the free exercise of religion for the foreseeable future.

Are you sitting down with a martini or a box of cheap wine, because the Will & Grace revival has just been confirmed! Leslie Jordan, who played Beverly Leslie on the original NBC comedy, confirmed in an interview with KPBS that NBC has ordered a 10-episode short season that starts shooting over the summer. Rumors about the revival have been floating around ever since the four stars and two creators got back together for that hilarious 10-minute video during the 2016 presidential campaign. When the interviewer said that the show “perhaps” might be back, Jordan corrected him quickly, saying, “not perhaps. Absolutely.” This is the first absolute confirmation that has been given, but not the first hint that a Will & Grace revival was coming. In December, during an interview with PrideSource, Megan Mullally was asked if the show was coming back or if she was working on new episodes. In a very un-Karen like moment, Megan replied simply this. “Well, OK. All I can say is that there is a very good chance that that might happen. It's not happening right this second. I mean, we're not rehearsing or anything like that. But there is a very good chance that something is going to materialize…can't really talk about it or say anything, because you know how it is.” It's difficult to imagine what the 10-episode arc will be about, although Mullally had some ideas. She indicated that with Donald Trump as president, the story lines could just write themselves and riff on the current state of American societal and political mores. She did say that she sees Karen as the secretary of state for a President Trump. After all, they are very old friends. The rest of the principle cast are sure to make room in their schedules to shoot the 10-episodes. From left, Megan Mullally, Debra Messing and Eric McCormack. [Image by Frank Micelotta/AP Images] Debra Messing, who played Grace, one-half of the title characters, has been having fun doing guest spots on other shows and specials, coming off of a two-season run starring on The Mysteries of Laura. Eric McCormack, who played the other half of the title as Will, has been keeping busy. His turn in the Canadian science fiction drama Travelers was picked up for broadcast by Netflix before the series finished airing in Canada. He's also been busy guest starring on multiple television shows and participating in various charities. Megan Mullally, of course, has been in many films and is a prolific voice actress, lending her signature tone to shows from Sofia the First to Bob's Burgers. She is currently promoting the recently released romantic comedy, Why Him? starring James Franco, Bryan Cranston, and Zoey Deutch. [Image by Charles Sykes/AP Images] Sean Hayes, who played the flamboyant Jack McFarland, has done numerous voice acting gigs since the end of Will & Grace. He's also been involved on the producer side of several shows including the popular supernatural drama, Grimm. Will & Grace was broadcast on NBC for eight seasons and was considered a groundbreaking comedy and was the darling of Thursday night television. During the 8-year run, Will & Grace earned 83 Emmy Award nominations and won 16 total awards. The hour-long series finale was the most watched episode of the last two seasons of the series. The manner of the final episode brings into question how exactly a new season would fit into the story. If you don't remember, during the finale, Will and Grace have a falling out that lasts for years. Despite a forced reconnection initiated by Karen and Jack, Will and Grace drift apart again. The series ends as Will and Grace reunite 20 years later, meeting as their kids move into their dorm rooms. The episode and the series ends as Will and Grace watch ER and talk about how their children are going to be married. NBC hasn't released any details or commented on Jordan's revelation.

SOUTHAMPTON 1 ARSENAL 1
Dec 10 (Reuters) - Second half substitute Olivier Giroud rescued Arsenal with a late equaliser on Sunday after Southampton had looked like taking all three points in a 1-1 draw at St Mary‘s.
France international Giroud, who came off the bench in the 72nd minute to replace compatriot Alexandre Lacazette, made it 1-1 in the 88th with a glancing header into the bottom right corner.
Until then Arsenal had been staring at a second successive league defeat, after a stinging 3-1 loss to Manchester United at the Emirates last weekend. The Gunners moved up to fifth place and behind Liverpool on goal difference.
Southampton had made a dream start with Charlie Austin grabbing his fourth goal in four league games with a third minute shot past Petr Cech after being fed through by Dusan Tadic. (Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Toby Davis)

NUML is committed to bring the students again in libraries rather than wasting their time on cell-phones or other new era devices and book fairs can play a key role for revival of library culture in the country. Director General National University of Modern Languages, Brig Muhammad Ibrahim expressed these views on Monday while inaugurating the Book Fair launched by the Urdu Department of NUML.
He said that NUML is not against the modern devices but their negative use has badly affected the habit of reading books. “This kind of book fairs can play a key role for revival of library culture and hence we are committed to bring book reading culture in our university”, he added. Three-Day Book Fair 2018 has commenced at National University of Modern Languages (NUML) with an objective to revive book-reading traditions among young generation, particularly students.
A total of 12 book publishers with 36 stalls showcased a wide variety of books on the topics including literature, linguistics, management sciences, engineering, information technology, international relations, mass communication, Islamic studies, history, economics, corporate social responsibility, Pak-China Relations and translation and interpretation etc. The DG NUML said there was no greater pleasure than reading books in one's leisure time. He said the current boost in technology has made it easier for students to get access to the E-books of their interest but the pleasure and contentment connected with the hard copy of a book, was inexplicable.
Head department of Urdu Dr Rubina Shahnaz, Directors and other faculty members' along with students also attended the inaugural ceremony.

Los Angeles Dodgers right-hander Kenta Maeda was placed on the disabled list Wednesday after an MRI revealed a right hip strain.
Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said he was unsure when Maeda will be able to return.
The Dodgers also placed second baseman Chase Utley on the DL with a left thumb sprain.
In corresponding moves, right-hander Dennis Santana and ambidextrous pitcher Pat Venditte have been recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma City.
Maeda was removed in the second inning of Tuesday night's 6-1 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies.
Maeda was examined by trainers at the mound after he struck out Jake Arrieta for the second out of the inning. He left the game after only 38 pitches and with a runner on second base.
Maeda allowed two runs, three hits and a walk in 1 2/3 innings. He struck out two.
He is 4-4 with a 3.61 ERA in 11 appearances (10 starts) this season.

Toyota, Intel, Ericsson, with friends, have formed a new “Automotive Edge Computing Consortium” to “develop an ecosystem for connected cars to support emerging services such as intelligent driving, the creation of maps with real-time data and driving assistance based on cloud computing.”
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, NTT DOCOMO and DENSO Corporation have come along for the ride, too.
The group justifies its existence with the familiar “everything's going to make more data” spiel, and an informed guesstimate that come the year 2025 the vehicles on Earth's roads will send a combined fleet 10 exabytes per month somewhere. All that data, the Consortium reckons, will need “new architectures of network and computing infrastructure to support distributed resources and topology-aware storage capacity.”
The Consortium will therefore “focus on increasing network capacity to accommodate automotive big data in a reasonable fashion between vehicles and the cloud by means of edge computing and more efficient network design.” Members promise to “develop use cases for emerging mobile devices with a particular focus on the automotive industry, bringing them to standards bodies, industry consortiums and solution providers.”
The members mentioned above see themselves as getting the motor running, but plan to “invite relevant global technology leaders and expand the consortium.”
But not, according to launch documents, other car companies. Which may not be a problem, as Toyota is the world's largest auto-maker, albeit not far ahead of Volkswagen and General Motors. Yet with market share of over 10 per cent, Toyota can influence the supply chain and make sure its preferred tech pops up elsewhere. The company's already shown a liking for in-car computers by adopting automotive Linux for its infotainment systems. That effort's just set course for in-car virtualization, which could help the new Consortium's efforts to get cars talking, or help with “topology-aware storage”. ®
Sponsored: The Joy and Pain of Buying IT - Have Your Say
BEIJING, Feb 2 (Reuters) - China's fourth-biggest bank pledged on Friday to provide eight property firms, including Vanke and Country Garden, with at least 200 billion yuan ($31.84 billion) in response to a government-led push to increase the supply of rental housing.
China's real estate market, dominated by build-to-sell properties, has boomed over the past two years, prompting authorities to tighten control in more than 100 cities to clamp down on speculative buying.
Soaring prices, particularly in the biggest cities, have also raised concerns that many people are now priced out of the market.
Bank of China said its funding plan was in response to calls from China's top leaders who have said they want to ensure “houses are built for living in, not for speculation”, the bank said in a release posted on its website.
The funding will be used to develop new rental housing projects, as well as converting existing commercial projects including offices into rental homes, it said.
The other six property developers that will receive funding from the bank include China Overseas Land, China Resources Land, China Merchants Property, Poly Real Estate Group, Longfor Properties, and Greentown China Holdings.

PanARMENIAN.Net - The mysterious assassinations of jihadist leaders in northern Syria continued on Monday, December 11 in Aleppo countryside after another commander of Hay'at Tahrir Al-Sham was killed in the Jabal Al-Hoss region, Al-Masdar says.
According to opposition activists on social media, the commander of Jaysh Al-Ousama (HTS offshoot), Abu Amara Al-Hossi, was assassinated this morning when his vehicle was targeted by IED (improvised explosive device) in Jabal Al-Hoss.
Before his assassination on Monday morning, Al-Hossi appeared in a video last week that showed him and his fighters brutally executing a Syrian Arab Army (SAA) soldier in southern Aleppo.
No group has claimed responsibility for this latest assassination.

Hackett was arrested at his parents' home at Mermaid Beach around Midday [AEST], Channel 9 footage showing the champion swimmer in handcuffs as the police vehicle entered Southport watch house.
But he was a free man later Wednesday afternoon; his father telling the Gold Coast Bulletin of the day's earlier events.
"He's been receiving treatment from a doctor," Nev Hackett said. He's big and powerful when he's not happy.
"We decided he needed some treatment but there was no way he was going to go and get treatment this morning so we called the police.
"The only way the police can do anything under the law of the land is to arrest him for domestic violence."

He'll have to fit in, but Number Three will be "baby" forever
The Mirror's Alison Phillips, herself a mum-of-three, has some advice for the Royal parents...
(Image: DAN KENNEDY)
Oh the joy of three.
The three musketeers, The holy trinity, The Three degrees, Neapolitan ice cream.. the best things always come in threes. As Kate and William are now to discover.
And congratulations to them and little George and Charlotte as they welcome home their baby brother this week.
I too have got three children in the same boy/girl/boy sequence so I may have some insight into the pleasure (and pain) which lies ahead for the royal couple.
A friend of mine once said she thought anyone willing to have more children than hands was deeply suspect. She's probably right.
‘And if you've got a blue one and a pink one, why have more?' she questioned. (Clearly, the gender neutral narrative hadn't quite reached her.)
But if you love the noise and chaos of babies and toddlers it is very tempting after two kids to go for ‘just one more'.
It's like having ‘one for the road'. Rarely a good idea. Always hard to resist.
And actually, as parenting goes, the leap from two to three, is possibly the easiest of them all.
(Image: AFP)
You're way past the exhausting neuroticism of first time parenthood and have come to realise that so long as the baby is loved, fed and has their nappy changed (occasionally) they'll be fine. The jolt to the family dynamic is far less severe than the earthquake of first arrival or the seismic second child.
Or, as my husband puts it, ‘if life as you once knew it is already wrecked, how much worse can it get?'
The thing third children realise before the umbilical chord is cut, is their role in life is to fit in.
A first child's start in life is filled with attention 24 gruelling hours a day, mind enhancing and stimulating baby activities and all items within 100 yards fully sterilised. By Number 3 the most stimulation is watching the buggy straps being fastened as they get belted up to follow the other two around. A quick lick of the dummy does the job of sterilisation and crying has become ambient sound to shattered Mum. Those baby monitor contraptions have been disconnected long ago.
And yet for all that the fascinating thing is how well balanced Number Threes turn out. (Prince Andrew is of course an exception to most rules).
They develop those brilliant life skills of ‘fitting in' and ‘not making a fuss' in their earliest years.
And they tend to be emotionally and physically mature from keeping up with older kids' rough and tumble.
Although most Number Threes do a great job of hiding that maturity to play their everlasting role of ‘the baby'.
As older siblings grow and become more independent, Number 3 finally gets their moment in the parental sunshine as ‘baby'. Most never give it up.
It drives my older two children wild.
‘Don't pick on your brother... he's only little.'
‘Mum – he is eight and a half years old and you are still tying his shoelaces.'
‘I know, but he's only a baby, look at his chubby little cheeks.'
‘His cheeks are chubby because he's just rammed an entire Mars bars in his mouth.'
‘Oh I know, but he didn't mean to.'
(Image: REUTERS)
Because, it's important to mention..... Number Threes are naughty. (Back to Prince Andrew). They're not ‘nasty naughty', just ‘cheeky naughty'. The kind of naughty that you can raise an eyebrow to, although if it had been Number One, you'd have been raising the roof.
Esther Rantzen once wrote that a parent is only ever as happy as their least happy child. And so with three children come three sets of worries and anxieties. But I've adopted the Meatloaf approach to parenting when it comes to such concerns as school reports, mood swings and childhood illnesses. For, as he so wisely observed, ‘Two out of three ain't bad.'
A great thing for the children about being one of three is that there's always someone to play with. Even better, there's always someone to wind up and fight with.
To check my observations about being a Number Three, I asked my own youngest what he thought life would be like for the new royal arrival.
‘It'll be good,' he said, looking discreetly over his shoulder to check his sister was out of ear shot.
‘He'll get away with LOADS'. And he flashed me that grin which ensures he gets away with loads.
So yes, I imagine little will dent the charmed existence of Kate & William's Number Three.
Unless, of course, they decide to go for Number Four...
Etleap is a play on words for a common set of data practices: extract, transform and load. The startup is trying to place these activities in a modern context, automating what they can and in general speeding up what has been a tedious and highly technical practice. Today, they announced a $1.5 million seed round.
Investors include First Round Capital, SV Angel, Liquid2, BoxGroup and other unnamed investors. The startup launched five years ago as a Y Combinator company. It spent a good 2.5 years building out the product says CEO and founder Christian Romming. They haven't required additional funding up until now because they have been working with actual customers. Those include Okta, PagerDuty and Mode among others.
Romming started out at ad tech startup VigLink and while there he encounters a problem that was hard to solve. “Our analysts and scientists were frustrated. Integration of the data sources wasn't always a priority and when something broke, they couldn't get it fixed until a developer looked at it.” That lack of control slowed things down and made it hard to keep the data warehouse up-to-date.
He saw an opportunity in solving that problem and started Etleap. While there were (and continue to be) legacy solutions like Informatica, Talend and Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services, he said when he studied these at a deeply technical level, he found they required a great deal of help to implement. He wanted to simplify ETL as much as possible, putting data integration into the hands of much less technical end users, rather than relying on IT and consultants.
One of the problems with traditional ETL is that the data analysts who make use of the data tend to get involved very late after the tools have already been chosen and Romming says his company wants to change that. “They get to consume whatever IT has created for them. You end up with a bread line where analysts are at the mercy of IT to get their jobs done. That's one of the things we are trying to solve. We don't think there should be any engineering at all to set up ETL pipeline,” he said.
[gallery ids="1627465,1627466,1627467"]
Etleap is delivered as managed SaaS or you can run it within your company's AWS accounts. Regardless of the method, it handles all of the managing, monitoring and operations for the customer.
Romming emphasizes that the product is really built for cloud data warehouses. For now, they are concentrating on the AWS ecosystem, but have plans to expand beyond that down the road. “We want help more enterprise companies make better use of their data, while modernizing data warehousing infrastructure and making use of cloud data warehouses,” he explained.
The company is currently having 15 employees, but Romming plans to at least double that in the next 12-18 months, mostly increasing the engineering team to help further build out the product and create more connectors.
HARARE – Zanu PF's politburo will have its first meeting of 2017 in Harare tomorrow, amid fears that the gathering could become very heated as the party's tribal, factional and succession wars continue to worsen.
An insider who spoke to the Daily News yesterday said top of the agenda would be the “high level of indiscipline and deep-rooted factional fights” ravaging the party — which had recently seen provincial structures rebelliously reinstating suspended officials without the politburo's approval.
For example, the party's Masvingo structure finds itself deep in the throes of factional anarchy following the regional leadership's recent decision to bring back suspended former provincial leader Ezra Chadzamira to replace Amasa Nenjana who has been the acting chairperson.
Similarly, the party's Midlands provincial executive stubbornly elected to elevate deputy regional chairperson Daniel Mackenzie-Ncube to replace Jorum Gumbo, who had been seconded to the province by the politburo to replace the suspended Kizito Chivamba.
The province also brought Chivamba back into the fold as Mackenzie-Ncube's deputy, in a divisive move that has led to confusion and more ructions within the troubled party over procedure.
Zanu PF national political commissar Saviour Kasukuwere — while clearly unwilling to speak to the Daily News about the party's travails — nevertheless confirmed that the two provinces' actions were irregular.
But the well-placed source who spoke to the newspaper earlier said the proper procedure, in the case of the Midlands, was that Gumbo — who was seconded to the province to investigate the chaos that followed Chivamba's suspension on allegations of promoting factionalism and undermining powerful First Lady Grace Mugabe — was supposed to have tabled a report of his findings first to the politburo.
“The province clearly jumped the gun. In as much as it is constitutional for provinces to co-opt their membership into positions, the case of these provinces is different given that the national disciplinary committee suspended Chivamba and Chadzamira, and they were only reinstated as ordinary card-carrying members.
“This means that any attempt to bring them back now is tantamount to making a mockery of the national disciplinary process.
“The case of Chivamba is even more interesting given that it was actually the politburo which tasked Gumbo to look into the matter.
“This means that he (Gumbo) was supposed to give feedback to the politburo first before a decision on who takes over is made. What they have done shows their utter contempt for the politburo and its decisions,” the source said.
However, Masvingo provincial minister Shuvai Mahofa — who is also a politburo member — insisted that their decision had been above board.
“You have done the right thing to ask me as a politburo member.
“When Chivamba, Chadzamira and (Joel Biggie) Matiza's cases were discussed in the politburo, they were found innocent of all the charges that were preferred against them and it was recommended that they should go back to their provinces where a decision of whether or not to accept them back would be made.
“So, Masvingo and Midlands made theirs. Anything else is rubbish,” the forthright Mahofa said emphatically.
On the other hand, Cornelius Mupereri, the Midlands provincial spokesperson, said Gumbo had presented a report to the party's provincial assembly and central committee, which was later presented at the Zanu PF annual conference in Masvingo last year.
Mupereri also said while the province had expected to hear from the politburo afterwards, when they got no communication back, they then went ahead and co-opted members to fill all gaps as provided for in the Zanu PF constitution.
“We did all we were supposed to do according to the party constitution . . . we had vacancies we felt we needed to fill to regularise the provincial structure, and we maintain that it was all in order,” he said.
Some of the other thorny issues which are expected to be brought up for discussion tomorrow include the alleged “indiscipline” of some party members who are allegedly backing Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa to succeed Mugabe.
Many of the VP's vocal allies have been openly calling for Mugabe to resign, to make way for the Midlands godfather both at party level and in government.
“Those against ED (Mnangagwa) will certainly bring to Mugabe's attention to the issue of the infamous coffee mug and the Christmas party that he hosted for rebels, which has seen provincial chairpersons demanding action against the VP,” another senior party official said. -Daily News
New York Mets outfielder Curtis Granderson cleared revocable waivers earlier this month, meaning he is eligible to be traded to any team. But there have been conflicting reports as to the level of interest he is drawing from around the game.
Marc Carig of Newsday reported on Sunday that the 36-year-old veteran continues to generate minimal demand on the market. However, Mike Puma of the New York Post indicated that interest in Granderson had "picked up" as of Monday.
Granderson sported a .122/.175/.211 slash line with one home run and six RBIs on May 2, but has picked up his production in recent months. Since plummeting to rock bottom, he has elevated his numbers to .271/.392/.572 with 16 home runs and 41 RBIs.
Mets general manager Sandy Alderson has been open about his willingness to move veterans like Granderson for prospects or salary relief. New York entered Monday at 53-62, 16.5 games behind the Washington Nationals in the NL East and 11 games out of a wild-card spot.
Granderson is in the final season of a four-year, $60 million contract. He is a lifetime .254/.340/.474 hitter with 310 career home runs.

The Alberta government has reached a new agreement with physicians that calls for no fee increases for two years.
The deal that runs until March 31, 2020, covers about 10,000 doctors who are members of the Alberta Medical Association.
READ MORE: Province, Alberta doctors reach tentative agreement
Health Minister Sarah Hoffman says the agreement will save the government about $95 million.
Hoffman notes the province has similar no-increase deals with unions that represent nurses and other health professionals.
READ MORE: New AMA president says Alberta needs more physicians in rural areas
Dr. Neil Cooper, president of the association, says 89 per cent of physicians who voted are in favour of the agreement.
The province and the AMA reached the tentative deal after months of negotiations that focused on government concerns about health spending and its budget.
The Ontario Liberals have an extra $1.5 billion to spend between now and the next election and can still keep their promise to balance the provincial budget by 2018, thanks to a helpful ruling on how to handle surpluses in a couple of big provincial pension funds.
For $1.5 billion, the Liberals could cut electricity bills by another eight per cent and probably buy labour peace with Ontario's doctors and have some left. They could stop pressuring boards of education to close half-empty schools. They could replace half a dozen small hospitals. They could even cut taxes.
We're talking serious money.
Premier Kathleen Wynne and Finance Minister Charles Sousa have sworn up and down that Ontario will finish 2018 with a balanced provincial budget.
But they got a shock last fall when Bonnie Lysyk, the province's auditor general, told them she thought it was wrong to count money held by the pension plans for the Ontario Public Service Employees Union and Ontario's teachers' unions as provincial assets. Specifically, about $11 billion in surpluses in those funds, the government's share of which had been treated as government assets for as long as they'd been there. That stripped billions of dollars off the government's balance sheet.
More importantly, it meant $1.5 billion in income that the government had treated as revenue could no longer be handled that way.
That produced a nasty spat between the auditor-general and Liz Sandals, the minister who, as president of the treasury board, is in charge of how the province keeps its books. Sandals presented the legislature with an unaudited financial report because Lysyk wouldn't sign off on it, a brazen way of handling an ordinarily dull part of running the government.
The money's there either way, the only question is in which ledger it should be inscribed. If it's in this ledger here, it makes the Liberals' budget-balancing promise $1.5 billion easier; if it's in that ledger there, the promise is $1.5 billion harder.
The government appointed an expert panel to make a ruling, a four-person group led by Tricia O'Malley, former chair of the Canadian Accounting Standards Board, a job she had twice, with a long stint helping set international accounting standards in between. The others are a benefits lawyer, an actuary who consults for Ernst & Young on pensions, and the Province of New Brunswick's chief accountant.
What they say doesn't have the force of a judge's order, but they have credibility. And they say the government can count the money as a provincial asset.
The provincial government co-sponsors the pension plans, so it's effectively a half-owner. That said, the government can't directly draw on the surpluses, the money has to stay in the plans. If the government can't take the money, Lysyk's reasoning goes, the money isn't really a government asset.
Nevertheless, the panel's report volleys back, those surpluses work in the government's favour.
"It is reasonable to expect that the plan sponsors will be able to benefit from lower contribution levels in the future, if the plans have surplus assets," the panel's report says.
Ultimately: "The surpluses in the plans can be used by reducing the contributions the government is required to make to the plans, freeing cash that would otherwise be required to make contributions to be used for other purposes."
"We are committed to implementing the advice of this independent panel and will use it in preparing the province's financial statements," Sandals said in a written statement.
And in campaigning for 2018.

No one ever accused Nazis of being smart. For example, there's Twitter user Adolf Otto Eichmann (@Kage43Kent) who has a swastika avatar. Mr. Crazy Pants is a pro-Hitler, holocaust denier type of guy. His Twitter timeline looks like David Duke took a sh*t all over it. While everyone else was celebrating the arrival of a New Year – because 2016 sucked so bad – the Nazi spent three hours yelling at a bot which uses the name Liz (@arguetron). The bot was created by Sarah Nyberg who tweeted, “even if you had a shitty new year's eve, it wasn't as bad as this nazi's, who spent 3hrs yelling at a robot around midnight.”
Alberta Premier Rachel Notley is flying to China on Monday where she'll begin a 10-day trip to promote Alberta's energy sector and to grow other export markets.
The trip will begin in China's capital, Beijing, where her itinerary includes attending a China-Alberta Energy and Climate Change roundtable and meeting with members of both the public and private sector as well as Canada's new ambassador to China, John McCallum.
The trip will also see Notley head to the Chinese port city of Guangzhou before heading off to Japan. While in Japan, the premier will attend an Alberta Agriculture roundtable, meet with officials with the Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation, tour an Alberta lumber-processing facility and visit an Alberta agri-food product site.

“China and Japan dominate Alberta's export economy, second only to the U.S… and investment missions are instrumental to connecting with the right people and identifying how to harness that potential,” Notley said in a statement before leaving Edmonton. “Building and fostering productive and visionary relationships with both countries will mean more jobs in a growing and increasingly diverse economy here at home.”
According to the government, Alberta's trade with China has tripled over the past 15 years or so and Japan accounted for 15.7 per cent of Alberta's non-U.S. exports last year.
Trade Minister Deron Bilous will accompany the premier on the trade mission. In a statement, Bilous said he believed a variety of Alberta-based industries would receive a boost from the trip.
“Our exports to Asia are represented by our major industries, energy, petrochemicals, agriculture, forestry and value-added products in those sectors. Asian investors and businesses are hungry for these products, and face-to-face meetings with our premier will build more confidence and credibility for our companies.

“Showcasing Alberta abroad means more opportunities at home.”
According to the province, the estimated cost of the trip is $140,000. In addition to Noley and Bilous, that amount is expected to pay for four political staffers and two public servants to join them and to cover the cost of security.
The official trade delegation also includes Calgary Economic Development CEO Mary Moran and Gordon Houlden, director of the China Institute at the University of Alberta. Moran and Houlden will pay for their own expenses.
THE Fremantle Port has allowed Animals' Angels Australia accesses to undertake independent monitoring of livestock loading at the port on a trial basis.
The proposal by the animal rights group, which is opposed to the live export of animals, was forwarded on to the Minister for Transport, Rita Saffioti, by State Agriculture Minister Alannah MacTiernan who supported the appointment along with the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD).
Ms MacTiernan said the decision to allow Animals' Angels to be present at the port was a "decision made by Minister Saffioti".
"I simply forwarded the proposal by Animals' Angels to Minister Saffioti for her consideration," Ms MacTiernan said.
"In my view, DPIRD officials will be doing all statutory monitoring at the port and on vessels. I presume that Animals' Angels will be observers."
WA Transport Minister Rita Saffioti said Animals' Angels were moved away from their old location to an outer security gate in 2012 where they did not have line-of-sight to the wharf.
"Following a request we liaised with Fremantle ports to accommodate the group at a position in which wharf activities are visible whilst maintaining strict security procedures," Ms Saffioti said.
"Animals' Angels are the only organisation to have made a request of this nature.
"The new arrangement will proceed on a trial basis to be reviewed after each vessel."
Fremantle Ports manager of external affairs Ainslie de Vos said "representatives of the advocacy group Animals' Angels, who are issued with a permit by Fremantle Ports, will be able to observe the livestock operations at North Quay from a specific area".
"The number of permits issued will be limited to two or three people from that organisation and these representatives will be required to complete an induction," Ms de Vos said.
"The designated observation point is outside the fenced berth and the Animals' Angels representatives issued with a permit (with photo ID) will be required to go through a security checkpoint.
"They will be required to remain within the designated area at all times."
Ms de Vos said the decision to grant Animals' Angels access for independent monitoring on a trial basis was a response to the increasing community interest in animal welfare aspects of Australia's livestock export trade.
"Fremantle Ports has had a good relationship with Animals' Angels in the past," Ms de Vos said.
"There is no intention to grant similar access to other organisations."
There is no intention to grant similar access to other organisations.
According to a letter, anonymously sent to Fairfax Agricultural Publishing, written by the Fremantle Port general manager port operations/harbour master Captain Allan Gray - Animals' Angels will be allowed to visit an "observation area that is back from the wharf but within the security boundary and close to Koolinda House on North Quay".
"This will provide Animals' Angels a viewing span that will enable observation of the entry gate to the berth and wharf operations," Mr Gray said.
Animals' Angels conducted monitoring operations of WA saleyards earlier this year and reported on the high stocking density and lack of access to water points for some of the livestock.
The group has a specific focus on the transport and handling of livestock and seeks to ensure that all livestock are treated within the requirements of the law and if not it will report findings, including video and photographic evidence, to relevant authorities.
The group published the document "Australia's Contradiction - Farmed Animal Welfare" in 2012.
Authored by Dawn Lowe and Dr Peter Kerkenezov the summary states that "without active enforcement there is not, and can never be, any prevention of cruelty and suffering".
"Without enforcement, our efforts remain a theory because our efforts have failed in practice."
Who are Animals' Angels?
Based in Germany, Animals' Angels has an international reach.
The group has been active at the WA saleyards, taking footage and reporting on its findings to relevant authorities.
Animals' Angels calls for "the enforcement of existing animal protection laws", "asserts the right of animals to life, liberty and happiness", and "aims to have animals treated as sentient beings with rights".
It also "regards the struggle for animal rights as on a par with the struggle for human rights".
The group's Australian projects specialize in animal welfare in saleyards and during livestock transport.
In February, 2018, it reported having attended the Muchea Livestock Centre and Katanning Regional Saleyards.
TORONTO – With the Maple Leafs down 2-0 to Washington and the building dead, Toronto centre Nazem Kadri took matters into his own hands in the first period Monday night.
Kadri, generously listed at six feet and 195 pounds, came out with a rampaging shift that saw him flatten Caps defenceman Brooks Orpik twice.
The first hit happened between the Esso and Sportsnet sign on the corner boards in the Washington end. Orpik had just eluded Connor Brown only to be crunched by Kadri, who cross-checked Orpik for good measure once the two got back up.

Meanwhile down the wall, linemate Leo Komarov was exchanging love taps with his stick with fellow Russian Alex Ovechkin.
Before he finished his shift, Kadri went back for seconds with a high hit on Orpik that sent both men flying at the benches.
The crowd erupted.
“Two pretty big hits that definitely got us going,” said Auston Matthews, who scored for the Leafs on the next shift.
Toronto fourth-liner Matt Martin, no stranger to collisions himself, also acknowledged the importance of those hits.
“We hadn't done a whole lot to get the crowd into it,” he said. “I think Nazzie went out there and kind of took it upon himself and threw a couple of big hits. Obviously Mattie responded with a goal right after that.
READ MORE: Toronto Maple Leafs erase doubts in Game 1 OT defeat
“That was definitely a big shift.”
Matthews scored but the Kadri line fuelled the fire, helping start a comeback that finished with a 4-3 win thanks to a Tyler Bozak power-play goal 1:37 into overtime – with Kadri getting an assist.
After the third straight overtime of the best-of-seven series, Toronto leads two games to one.
In the locker-room, Kadri took a geometry-like look at playoff hockey and hitting.
“There's not much space. You've got to fight and grind,” he said. “I just felt the need to take a couple of opportunities and take a couple of quick hits.”
Out of his hockey equipment, Kadri is a slender man. But Martin says the outside isn't what counts.
“He's feisty. It's what you've got inside … It's part of who he is. He's a passionate guy. He's a physical guy and he's got a edge to him. He always has. I've played against him plenty to know he's not a guy who's going to back down from anyone.”
Martin says Kadri's not the only Leaf with a “burning fire” inside. He pointed to 160-pound Mitch Marner's penchant for finishing checks and Matthews responding in kind when he gets hit.
“It's kind of fight or flight mentality and I think we've got a lot of fight in this room,” said Martin.
Asked how he manages to hit so hard, Kadri was candid: “Just vulnerability, catching guys with their heads down.
“Obviously I'm not trying to hurt anybody out there but a clean hit's a clean hit. I mean they're doing the exact same thing to us. We're not going to be a group to be intimidated. If we get knocked down, we're getting right back up and going after them.”
Kadri, 26, did more than frustrate. His second-period goal brought the Leafs to within one goal at 3-2 when his shot from the point – he was covering for Morgan Rielly who had gone to goal – deflected into the goal off Orpik's backside as he tangled with Connor Brown in front of the net.
Monday's game featured 73 hits, with Toronto leading the way with 42. Kadri and Zach Hyman had six apiece for Toronto.
The Leafs, in the words of coach Mike Babcock, were “amped up, to say the least.”
The Ford Focus RS hit the scene in 2015 with promises of being the rally-ready road car fans of the Blue Oval had been waiting for – and for the most part, it has been exactly that. But recently the hot hatchback has come under scrutiny with owners suggesting that the 2.3-liter EcoBoost engine may have some issues.
In a statement to Autocar, Ford has confirmed that the 2.3-liter engine can develop an issue that causes the hot hatchback to consume coolant fluid. The issue has been noted on early Focus RS models, and appears to be affecting cars with as little as 6,000 miles (9,656 kilometers) on the odometers.
The issue reportedly produces "white exhaust smoke" as the engine burns coolant during cold running. When asked if the problem would result in a recall of the Focus RS, a Ford spokesman said that the company is "working on a repair for all customers." The fix could also include new Focus RS models that currently may not be affected by the issue.
Ford has reportedly already replaced a number of engines that have been affected. The new engines are built to the latest specification and are under a full warranty. The company hasn't released an official cause for the issue just yet, but owners have suggested that the head gasket is failing to seal the engine block to the head effectively.
The coolant problem has been liked to block distortion, and not the head gasket itself. It is rumored that the shape of the engine changes through multiple heat cycles, preventing the gasket from sealing the two parts correctly. Thankfully for Mustang owners, the issue is reportedly limited to the 2.3-liter engine found in the Focus RS. The Mustang engine uses a different type of alloy for its block and head, while the Focus RS is made from an upgraded alloy with a cast-iron lining.

Londoners braved the snowy weather Saturday afternoon to hear performances and discussions all dedicated to Black History Month.
Leroy Hibbert hosted the celebration that saw city councillors, London Police and other local officials in attendance.
Hibbert is the Multicultural Outreach Program Coordinator for LUSO Community Services and serves on the London Black History Coordinating Committee.
“I think it's wonderful to rally around something that's important to everybody, no matter what shade or ethnicity you are,” Hibbert said.
Panel discussions, spoken-word performances and presentations were all in line with this year's theme, Voices in Resilience.
2016 London's Got Talent winner Kadeem Jenkins shared a new spoken-word piece during with the audience, while panelists discussed their personal experiences with workplace discrimination. The event wrapped up with a beechnut steel-drum performance.

Another recurring idea was the need to keep the conversation about equality going throughout the year.
“I'm still black all year long, so why do we only talk about it for one month?” Jenkins noted.
The London Black History Coordinating Committee will be hosting more events through February to celebrate Black History Month.
A full list of events can be found on London's Cross-Cultural Learning Centre's website.
LONDON: Scientists in the UK have designed a new "intelligent" bandage which can detect how well a wound is healing and send a progress report to the doctor.
The bandage, which could be trialled within the next 12 months, uses real-time 5G technology to monitor what treatment is needed and also keep track of a patient's activity levels.
"The intelligent dressing uses nano-technology to sense the state of the wound at any one specific time," said Marc Clement, chairman of the Swansea University's Institute of Life Science in the UK, which led the research.
"It would connect that wound to a 5G infrastructure and that infrastructure through your telephone will also know things about you - where you are, how active you are at any one time," Clement was quoted as saying by BBC News.
The plaster would help clinicians know the performance of the specific wound at any specific time, who can then tailor the treatment protocol for the individual.
3D printers would be used to produce the bandages which would bring down the cost, researchers said.

Rumors about the first lady's whereabouts have been swirling around for days, and she's clearly fed up with all the wondering. On Wednesday, Melania Trump tweeted that she's at the White House and "feeling great," while taking an apparent shot at the media for "working overtime speculating" about where she's been.
To be precise, it's been 20 days since the last time the first lady was seen in public, and what's going on with her has become a subject of some scrutiny and curiosity. According to People magazine, the first lady's tweet insisting she was "with her family," and "working hard on behalf of children and the American people," was sent at the same time the president was on the south lawn of the White House, for an event recognizing youth athletes.
The first lady was reportedly released from the hospital on May 19, and returned to the White House afterwards. Her office put out a statement thanking supporters and well-wishers for their concerns.
"She is resting comfortably and remains in high spirits. Our office has received thousands of calls and emails wishing Mrs. Trump well, and we thank everyone who has taken the time to reach out," the statement said.

Miley Cyrus is blaming her "unrealistic schedule" for bailing on Sunday's Teen Choice Awards, and she spun her truancy into an announcement about her upcoming single, "Younger Now."
Because that's what pros do.
The "Malibu" singer was the recipient of the show's top honor, the Ultimate Choice Award, but failed to appear at the Galen Center in Los Angeles on Sunday night to accept it.
PHOTOS: The 2017 Teen Choice Awards
The reformed enfant terrible, an 18-time Teen Choice Award winner, was announced as a last-minute cancellation early in the ceremony, the Associated Press said.
"I know," presenter Victoria Justice said. "It's a bummer."
Cyrus later took to Instagram to thank her "dearest fans" and all those watching for voting for her.
"I am beyond bummed I couldn't make it to the show as I had every intention of being there to accept and celebrate this honor!" the 24-year-old wrote, adding, "I created an unrealistic schedule for myself which leads me to this announcement!"
Then Cyrus divulged her secret (and what appears to be throwback cover art for the eponymous album): Her new single and its accompanying music video are set to drop on Friday. It's the latest in the lead-up to the release of her sixth studio album, due Sept. 29.
"I hope to always make people smile and shine light thru my work! I look forward to making music for the rest of my life and I'm thankful everyday for those who listen!" she added. "I am sending so much love and peace into the world right now because THATS what we need most! Love Love & more LOVE!"
The culture surrounding Baylor University and its football program not only affected how coaches and administrators handled allegations of sexual assault against players but also kept the university from randomly drug testing its student-athletes for marijuana and other recreational drugs -- making it one of the few major collegiate programs not to do so, according to an upcoming book about the university's sexual assault scandal.
Baylor regents had no idea that the university wasn't randomly drug testing its student-athletes until the Philadelphia law firm the school hired to examine how it handled allegations of sexual assault by students, including football players, turned up the issue. Already reeling from bad publicity around the mishandling of sexual assault cases, the lack of drug testing was another indicator of just how insular the football program had been under former coach Art Briles.
"That was my first realization that this was likely to not end up well," Baylor regent J. Cary Gray said in "Violated," which was authored by ESPN reporters Paula Lavigne and Mark Schlabach and will be released by Center Street on Aug. 22.
According to the book, Gray and regent David Harper were at an Association of Governing Boards national conference in Washington, D.C., in mid-April 2016, when Harper told Gray about the drug policy issue and the administrative tug-of-war around it.
Harper, who was the law firm Pepper Hamilton's main contact and knew more about the investigation than almost anyone on the board, already feared where the investigation was headed. Harper said he was made aware of incidents of violence toward women, including the 2013 domestic violence allegation against former star defensive end Shawn Oakman, which had been reported within athletics but not to anyone outside the department.
According to Baylor regents and other administrators, its athletics department avoided random drug testing because of the university's overall strict policy against marijuana use, in which one reported incident might lead to suspension for a semester and a second incident could result in expulsion. Since the university's strict conduct code might derail a student-athlete's career, athletics department officials didn't think it was fair to subject them to random testing.
"What was really happening was the underlying message to them is, 'Hey, the rules don't apply to you,'" one regent said in the book. "You know, and they have been hearing that since the seventh grade anyway. Some rules do apply to everybody, and telling them they don't apply is not calculated to make them productive citizens."
According to the book: "Another regent said there was a concern that the no-testing policy drew recruits to Baylor who wanted to smoke marijuana, and contributed to the football program's problems of 'getting bad guys.' It also kept players who had addiction problems from getting help, with one regent referencing the 2010 arrest and subsequent suspension of Baylor football players Josh Gordon and Willie Jefferson, who were found asleep in a local Taco Bell drive-thru lane and charged with misdemeanor marijuana possession. Multiple failed drug tests would derail Gordon's NFL career. 'We didn't do anything to help him apparently,' the regent said."
The NCAA doesn't require its member institutions to drug test its student-athletes. But if a school has a written drug policy it is required to follow it under NCAA rules. The NCAA tests for street drugs and performance-enhancing substances at its championship events and does random testing at least once a year at its member institutions. A 2011 study by the Associated Press found that 99 percent of the 56 FBS programs it surveyed tested its football players for marijuana and cocaine.
After Pepper Hamilton released its findings of fact and recommendations on May 26, 2016, Briles was suspended with intent to terminate, university president Kenneth Starr was demoted and athletic director Ian McCaw was suspended. Starr and McCaw later resigned altogether.
Weeks before then, Baylor funded two airplanes full of administrators and regents to fly to South Bend, Indiana, to meet with officials at Notre Dame who had come up with a solution for drug testing there.
In 2016, Baylor adopted the same drug policy that Notre Dame uses. It calls for a six-month probationary period for the first positive test for marijuana; one year of probation and ban for 33 percent of competition for a second; one-year ban and probation for a third; and dismissal from the team for a fourth. There are more severe penalties for using street drugs other than marijuana, including a one-year ban for a second positive test and dismissal from team after a third.
New Baylor athletics director Mack Rhoades said he was surprised to learn about the drug testing problems when he was hired to replace McCaw in July 2016. He told ESPN earlier this summer that the Bears had already suspended a football player for testing positive.
"Candidly, it really surprised me," Rhoades told ESPN. "It was the first program that I'd been a part of that didn't have a robust policy."
Among other findings in "Violated:"
• A former Baylor student, quoted under the pseudonym "Jennifer" in the book, describes in detail being gang raped by football players twice in 2012. She described one of the alleged assaults that took place in a bathroom:
"I kept asking, 'I want to leave. I want to leave,' and I was crying. I tried to get up and they threw me back to the ground. I was all bruised up because of that."
The woman didn't report either incident to the police or school at the time. But she detailed how the alleged gang rapes took a toll on her as she endured what she described as a hostile environment on campus. She said her grades plummeted and she had to take time off from school and temporarily transfer to another college, where she developed a skin-picking disorder that is common among people who experience trauma. In November 2016, she and a friend, who was also identified as a victim in one of the alleged 2012 gang rapes, came to an undisclosed financial settlement with Baylor.
• For the first time, Briles (through his attorney) and former head volleyball coach Jim Barnes addressed what happened when a former Baylor volleyball player alleged that she was gang raped in 2012 by several football players. The allegation became significant in November 2016, when Baylor issued a statement saying that no one -- including Briles and McCaw -- reported the incident to judicial affairs when they learned about it.
In July 2012, the woman's mother reported the incident to an associate athletics director in charge of strength and conditioning, according to later legal filings and interviews. Briles's attorney said that around that time, the strength coach told Briles that he had "met with the mother of a volleyball player who was concerned about her daughter 'partying' with football players. Briles asked if there was anything else 'we needed to do,'" and the strength coach said no.
The attorney said that the first Briles heard it was a gang rape allegation was when Barnes told him in April 2013, after Barnes said he heard it for the first time from his player. Barnes said he did call judicial affairs and said to the woman who answered the phone, "If there's someone who needs to report something, how do they go about doing it?" he said. Barnes said he was told the victim needed to come by that office or call.
"I said, 'Well, that's what I'm attempting to do,'" Barnes added, saying that the volleyball player and her parents refused to make a report or take any further action -- a statement the former student-athlete contradicted in a lawsuit she filed against Baylor earlier this year.
• A Waco Police officer failed to secure evidence from former Baylor football player Sam Ukwuachu's apartment, after a female soccer player accused him of raping her there, because the officer didn't know how to spell his name and couldn't locate his address.
According to the book, Waco Police sergeant Stephanie Gibson never interviewed Ukwuachu on the morning of Oct. 20, 2013, and police also failed to secure the sheets and blankets from his bed and take photographs of his apartment she couldn't locate his apartment.
"For whatever reason, Gibson never called police dispatch to try to obtain Sam's address or telephone number," according to the book. "Gibson would later say she didn't try because she only had a phonetic spelling of his last name."
Ukwuachu, who transferred to Baylor from Boise State and never played in a game for the Bears, was convicted in August 2015 of sexually assaulting the woman. He was sentenced to 180 days in jail, 10 years of felony probation and 400 hours of community service. A Texas appeals court overturned his conviction in March, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals is deciding whether he should be given a new trial. The woman reached an undisclosed financial settlement with the school in December 2015.
In another incident, in November 2011, there is no indication that Waco police ever followed up with a woman who accused former Bears football player Tevin Elliott of vandalizing her car in retaliation for him being disciplined for improperly touching her. The woman, identified by the pseudonym "Phoebe" in the book, called Waco police after someone slashed two of the tires on her 1998 Nissan Maxima, left key marks all over the hood and spray painted the word bitch in gold paint on the fender.
A Waco police officer asked her, "Do you have any idea who would want to do that?" She responded, "I do absolutely have an idea." Just days earlier, Elliott had received a misdemeanor assault citation for an incident months earlier in which Phoebe told police he improperly touched and restrained her in her apartment.
The woman said in the book that police officers didn't dust her car for prints, didn't take photographs and never followed up with her after she made an initial report. Her mother even notified a Baylor Police Department officer about the damage to the car, but she only received an acknowledgement of her complaint.
In January 2014, Elliott was convicted of raping Baylor student Jasmin Hernandez on April 15, 2012. He was also accused of sexually assaulting three other women while playing at Baylor. He is serving a 20-year sentence in Texas and is eligible for parole in 2024.
McLennan County assistant district attorney Hilary LaBorde, who was critical of the way Waco police investigated Elliott, questioned whether its officers were properly trained to handle cases involving sexual assault. She also questioned whether there was enough cooperation between Waco police and Baylor police during their investigations.
"Would it occur to probably a small child that they should call Baylor PD and tell them, 'Hey, this guy now has two different events? Yes," LaBorde said in the book. "Honestly, do I think it occurred to Waco PD? No, I don't."

METHUEN, Mass. — Authorities in Massachusetts say a 10-month-old baby had to be revived twice after she was exposed to fentanyl.
Police arrived at the Methuen residence early Saturday afternoon after receiving a report of a child not breathing.
First responders took the child to Lawrence General Hospital, where police say she stopped breathing twice and had to be resuscitated. She was later airlifted to Tufts Medical Center in Boston, where she's in stable condition.
Authorities say hospital tests indicate the baby had the potent synthetic opioid fentanyl in her system.
The Department of Children and Families says it has taken custody of the baby. The incident remains under investigation.
Mayor Stephen Zanni says, “The opioid epidemic knows no boundaries.”
‘Ducks Drill Down' is a regular, ~weekly column that recaps the latest goings-on with the Anaheim Ducks.
The Anaheim Ducks are back in third place in the Pacific Division following three consecutive victories. After a dispiriting 4-2 home loss to the St. Louis Blues on March 12, Anaheim turned the homestand around with wins over the Vancouver Canucks, Detroit Red Wings, and New Jersey Devils.
Montour & New Guys Lead Resurgent Ducks
What ended up being a strong week began with a rather meek effort against the Blues. The Ducks were never able to really get anything going. Down 3-1 in the third, they got to within 3-2 fairly early in the third period on Derek Grant's ninth goal of the season that featured a primary assist from Chris Kelly—his first point as a Duck.
In a microcosm of that game, however, Anaheim fell behind by two once again just five minutes later. They could not muster anything after that and generated just 22 shots on goal the entire night.
Having suffered their third loss in a row, the Ducks needed a big turnaround. They got the start of that Wednesday night at home against the Canucks, earning a 3-0 shutout victory. John Gibson made 32 saves while Brandon Montour scored twice. In between those two scores, newcomer Jason Chimera scored his first goal with Anaheim—off another assist from fellow newcomer Kelly.
﻿
Incredibly, Montour's two goals against the Canucks were his first since Nov. 19—in between, he did not score a goal for 49 straight games. As an offensive-minded defenseman who got off to a strong start this season in the scoring department, the drought was a bit unexpected, but now perhaps he's catching fire during the stretch run.
Montour indicated that his confidence did not ever really waver despite the prolonged drought that he finally extinguished.
“I feel like every level that I've been at, I've been able to produce,” Montour said on Thursday. “It's one of those things where it comes with confidence. I believe in my ability.
“It's not one of those things where because it's the NHL—obviously it's going to be tougher and you got all that—but I feel like I should be capable to do that.”
Anaheim made the win over Vancouver stand up with a solid 4-2 victory over the Red Wings Friday night before one of their most complete efforts of the season Sunday night against a good Devils team that includes old friends Sami Vatanen, Patrick Maroon, and Kyle Palmieri. The Ducks jumped out to a 2-0 lead early in the first period on goals by Ryan Getzlaf and Jakob Silfverberg, and they led all the way to the end. Montour added another goal on the power play while Rickard Rakell picked up his 31st of the season.
In a rare dominant performance from a possession standpoint, the Ducks outshot the Devils 36-17 in total and had 69 percent of the total shot attempts at 5-on-5. This kind of effort is what Anaheim has been looking for all season, and if it's a harbinger of things to come, the Ducks could be a very dangerous club, assuming they get into the playoffs.
Injuries Befall Ducks' Defensemen
Bieksa Sidelined With Hand Injury
Despite their overall successes on the ice, the injury bug struck the Ducks yet again. Defenseman Kevin Bieksa had surgery on Friday to remove scar tissue from his left hand. Bieksa had apparently been bothered by it for most of the season, and it finally got to the point where he decided to get it taken care of. He will be out of the lineup for two to five weeks.
The 36-year-old's Bieksa's deteriorating speed has hurt his game this season, but it would seem that his hand issue would undoubtedly have an adverse effect on his puck-handling, passing, and shooting abilities.
“I think you'd have to ask him that,” head coach Randy Carlyle said when asked about the impact of the injury on Bieksa's game. “To take the step to have the correction done, it obviously was an issue. Certain individuals have certain strengths they have to play to. This was something that was bothering him.”
Bieksa's absence does afford an increased opportunity for 21-year-old defenseman Marcus Pettersson, who had been scratched in two of four games before Bieksa had his surgery. It will be interesting to see how much more responsibility Carlyle gives the youngster, but he does not have too many other options.
Manson Exits Game Sunday
Adding injury to injury, Josh Manson—who has been one of Anaheim's most consistent defenders all season long—left Sunday's game against the Devils in the first period and did not return. The team's Twitter account indicated that he had an upper-body injury. The extent of the injury is unknown, but hopefully it's nothing serious, as Manson has been so good for Anaheim all season long.
Manson has played with Hampus Lindholm for much of this season, forming the team's most reliable defensive pair. He's also chipped in 5 goals and 25 assists for 30 points, easily shattering his previous career high of 17 that he compiled last season.
If he's out for any extended period of time, Pettersson's role becomes that much more important, and Korbinian Holzer might have to step in to eat some minutes. The Ducks and their fans, of course, are hoping the situation doesn't come to that at this stage of the season.
Ducks' Upcoming Schedule
The Ducks will look to keep their winning ways going when they head up north of the border this week for the start of a crucial four-game set that will take them through Calgary, Winnipeg, Edmonton, and Vancouver. They've won three games in a row, but all have been in the comfort of Honda Center, so that will have to translate to the road if they are to maintain their tenuous grasp on a top-three spot in the Pacific Division.
Through the weekend's action, the Ducks have 86 points through 73 games while the Los Angeles Kings are right on their heels with 84 points through 72 games. Anaheim has fallen three points behind the second-place San Jose Sharks and has played one more game. At this point, though, any type of playoff berth would be welcome given the tumult the Ducks have faced this year.
BOSTON (AP)  The Kenyans are back in Boston after a relative lull that saw them shut out in the worlds most prestigious marathon twice in the past three years.
More surprisingly, so are the Americans.
Geoffrey Kirui won the 121st Boston Marathon on Monday, pulling away from three-time U.S. Olympian Galen Rupp with two miles to go to give Kenya its first mens victory in five years. Edna Kiplagat won the womens race to complete the Kenyan sweep.
They were followed closely by Americans who grabbed two of the top four womens spots and six of the top ten for men  the first time thats happened since the race went professional in 1986.

Its so exciting to see Americans being competitive here, said Rupp, the Olympic bronze medalist who was making his Boston debut. Its a real exciting time. And its awesome to see American distance running on the upswing and being competitive in these races.
Kirui finished in 2 hours, 9 minutes, 37 seconds to claim a silver trophy, a guilded olive wreath from Marathon, Greece, and the $150,000 first prize. Rupp was 21 seconds back, and Japans Suguru Osako 30 seconds behind him.
Rounding out the top 10 were runners from California, Arizona, Colorado, Oregon and Utah.
American distance running is looking good today, said sixth-place finisher Abdi Abdirahman, a Somali immigrant and Tucson resident who is a four-time Olympian. We have the podium for both men and women, so the future is great.
Kiplagat finished in 2:21:52 to win her Boston debut, adding the victory to two world championships and wins in London, New York and Los Angeles. She pulled ahead of Rose Chelimo of Bahrain in the Newton hills to win by 59 seconds.
American Jordan Hasay, making her first run at the 26.2-mile distance, was third and Desi Linden was fourth  the first time since 1991 that two U.S. women have finished in the top four. Linden lives in Rochester Hills and trains with Hanson-Brooks.
It keeps happening. We keep getting closer. Were putting more numbers in there and its just a matter of time, said Linden, the 2011 runner-up by 2 seconds. When Americans break the tape, its going to be a big deal here.
Kenya had won either the mens or womens race every year since 1991 before being shut out in 2014 and again last year. In fact, Kenya had taken both titles six times since 2000, so dominating the top 10 that Boylston Street began to look like a Great Rift Valley training run.
But Ethiopia has surpassed its East African neighbors on Patriots Day the past four years, earning its first sweep in 2016. Then, in December, Kenyan Rita Jeptoo was stripped of her 2014 title for failing a drug test and it was handed instead to Ethiopias Buzunesh Deba.
For Kirui, even when he was running shorter distances, he had his eye on Boston.
In my mind, I was sure that one day I would win this race, said Kirui, 25, who was running just his third marathon. To come here to Boston, I knew I was going to face my colleagues who have run many times here. ... I knew I would challenge some of the champions who have been competing here.
The American drought reached more than three decades from the time Greg Meyer won in 1983 until Meb Keflezighi ran down Boylston Street to raucous chants of U-S-A! in 2014, the year after the finish line bombings killed three people and wounded more than 260 others. (No U.S. woman has won since 1985.)
Keflezighi, 41, said he plans to enter the New York Marathon, which he won in 2009, one last time in the fall before retiring. In his last competitive Boston run, he finished 13th in 2:17:00 despite pain in his quad muscles.
The crowd got me through the finish line, he said.
Also running on Monday was Ben Beach, who completed the race for an unprecedented 50th time in a row. And Kathrine Switzer, wearing the same bib number  261  that she wore when she entered the all-male race 50 years ago, using only her initials, K.V.
The warm temperatures that hit 79 degrees at the 20-kilometer mark in Natick slowed the runners, but the strong tailwind was a boost  especially in the wheelchair races.
Marcel Hug won Boston for the third time, out-pushing 10-time champion Ernst Van Dyk down Boylston Street and finishing in 1:18:04 to beat the course record and world best by 21 seconds. Fellow Swiss Manuela Schar shattered the womens mark by more than five minutes, winning in 1:28:17.
The winners times on the point-to-point Boston course are considered a world best and not a world record because of the possibility of a supportive tailwind like the one on Monday.
The wind is so important, Hug said. The roads were good. Everything was fantastic today.
Earlier Monday, city officials announced plans for memorials to mark the sites where two bombs exploded during the 2013 race. Also in the field was Boston Police Commissioner William Evans, who ran for the 18th time in 2013 but has skipped the races since the bombings so he could be available in case of another emergency. Evans, who completed his 52nd marathon overall, said he wanted to show that Boston is back to normal.
If I can come back, he said, everyone can.

Minister for Civil Supplies and Price Control Govind Gaude on Friday said that an appropriate decision will be taken by October-end on Centre's suggestion to close down fair price shops run under the public distribution system and switch over to direct benefit transfer mechanism.
The minister held a meeting on Friday to discuss the proposal of the Centre, which has suggested stopping provision of subsidised foodgrain supplies under the PDS, and instead opt for direct transfer of subsidy to ration cardholders.
The suggestion, if implemented, will bring about closure of 446 fair price shops in the state.
“I have been seeking feedback from various stakeholders on the proposal since I took the charge of the civil supplies department. Today I held a meeting to discuss the matter,” Gaude told reporters adding that so far he has spoken to some 200 people on the matter.
If the PDS is replaced then we will have to close down the fair price shops in the state, he said adding that the government is examining the matter by taking all stakeholders into confidence and will make a decision by the end of this month. It is learnt that before taking a call on the proposal the state government will also factor in migrants, who work as labourers in various sectors especially at constructions sites in Goa.
To eliminate a lot of wasteful expenditure, corruption and leakages, the Centre has suggested to all states to replace the present system of distributing subsidised foodgrains through fair price shops and transfer the subsidy amount to bank accounts of beneficiaries.
Under the PDS, the government provides subsidised rice, wheat, sugar and kerosene to consumers through the fair price shops.
KHANEWAL(Hammad Shah): Like other government projects, also the waste collection scheme through installation of over 200 drums at various spots with a cost of Rs4.4 million across the city has suffered a complete failure.
Almost four years ago, Khanewal administration had started a scheme of waste collection. The scheme cost Rs4.4 million. The district management fixed 200 drums in all the UCs of Khanewal for waste collection and four motorcycle rickshaws were purchased to collect garbage from these drums. The then Khanewal DCO held meetings with people of these areas and advised them to inform, if these drums are not cleared on daily basis.
Now, the 200 drums are lying in the waste area of the Municipal committee Khanewal and out of those four rickshaws only two are standing there and one without motorcycle. Rs4.4 million of the taxpayers' money is now rusting in the waste area. The huge amount was wasted only for a few days scheme and no one bothered about the waste of the money.
According to the people of Khanewal, it all shows the lack of concern of the government in the public welfare and in the cleanliness of the city. According to them, the scheme was also for the sake of photo session and for commission. Now, people demand that these drums be repaired and re-fixed at appropriate points in these areas.

New England may celebrate Tom Brady's age. But for football fans pretty much everywhere else in the country, Brady's age serves as a point of frustration. Brady may be 41, but he doesn't act like it.
It seems like at least one defensive player is wishing the clock would tick a little faster for the New England Patriots quarterback.
“He just will not age,” Buccaneers defensive tackle Gerald McCoy said on NFL Network, via Pats Pulpit. “I don't know if it's the Benjamin Button's disease or whatever it is, man. It's like reversed. It's like he's getting younger, man.”
McCoy was asked about Brady for NFL Network's “Top 100” rankings, which is arranged through player voting. Brady landed atop the list at No. 1. For the third time in four seasons, Brady and the Patriots finished the season in the Super Bowl. Unlike the previous two appearances, New England lost in a 41-33 contest with the Philadelphia Eagles. Brady had 505 yards and three touchdown passes, but had a costly fumble in the final minutes of the fourth quarter.
Brady's regular season was excellent as well, as he finished the season with the NFL MVP after throwing for 4,577 yards, 32 touchdowns and eight interceptions. There were some signs of age — or at least vulernability — during the 2017 season, as the Patriots quarterback suffered achilles and shoulder injures. However, Brady cites his age as a positive factor as he approaches each game.
“You can't surprise me on defense. I've seen it all. I've processed 261 games, I've played them all,” Brady told MMQB in February 2017. “It's an incredibly hard sport, but because the processes are right and are in place, for anyone with experience in their job, it's not as hard as it used to be. There was a time when quarterbacking was really hard for me because you didn't know what to do. Now I really know what to do, I don't want to stop now. This is when it's really enjoyable to go out.”
The group ‘Vancouver Island Fibre Shed' is encouraging farmers to produce more environmentally-friendly crops.
The group of women from Courtney are passionate about creating a local fibre community.
The group says fibre products, unlike cotton or polyester, are better for the environment.
Co-creator of the group, Lynda Drury wants locals to start thinking about where their clothing comes from.
“How could I achieve a wardrobe that would be better for the environment that's more locally sourced.”

The Fibre Shed movement has spread across North America and into Europe.
“We're just getting people excited about ‘how can we do this in our community?'”
The group gave a proposal to the Investment Agriculture Foundation for funding.
They will have a full assessment in a few weeks.
Andre Ward is seizing the moment, and vice versa.
The three-belt light-heavyweight champion from Oakland whose talent has long deserved a greater audience arrives for his Saturday pay-per-view rematch against Sergey Kovalev with U.S.-Russia tensions once again front and center.
Confronted by a truly hostile enemy in the ring, Ward (31-0, 15 knockouts) said he can't deny the parallels between his feelings and those of many of his countrymen who've been drawn this month to the Capitol Hill testimony of fired FBI Director James B.

“There are definitely a lot of similarities between everything's that going on with our politics, and what's going on with people taking sides in this fight. They want to really show allegiance to their country,” Ward said.
Ward, the most recent U.S. Olympic male boxing champion (2004), has struggled to gain the same patriotic support that made Olympic champions Sugar Ray Leonard and Oscar De La Hoya household names during their professional rise.
After defeating a slate of foes best known in Europe while winning a super-middleweight tournament in 2011, Ward fought only once between September 2012 and June 2015 while splitting from the late Southland promoter Dan Goossen.
In November, Ward rose from an early knockdown to pile up rounds in the second half of the bout against Kovalev (30-1-1, 26 KOs) and win a unanimous decision by 114-113 scores on all three cards.
Since then, Kovalev has switched toward the Russian prototype — angered and stone-faced over judging, vowing icily to “punish” Ward, and promising a merciless destruction of the cerebral, improvisational champion.
“When you have an event like this with people involved from these different countries, people are going to take sides,” Ward said. “I might stay out of the political side of it, but I'm aware of it.”
Ward's path to Olympic gold included a quarterfinal victory over two-time world champion Russian Evgeny Makarenko, which veteran fight reporter Peter Garczarczyk of Poland's Polsat TV called “the most remarkable three minutes of boxing I've ever seen.”
That 23-16 victory was more stirring than the rally against Kovalev, considering Ward's massive underdog status.
“I didn't need the political climate of today to get me pumped up about serving my country,” Ward said. “It's always been an honor and a privilege. I also relished being in [the super-middleweight tournament] for many reasons, but the top one was because I was the American. I've always been cognizant this is an opportunity when I step into the ring to represent my country. This is the best place in the world.”
Many tickets remain for this meeting of fighters who some rank as the top two in the world, and Ward's promoter, RocNation Sports President Michael Yormark, lamented the de-emphasis on the U.S.-Russia hot button pressed by Kovalev's promoter, Kathy Duva.
“It was a story line Roc Nation felt comfortable with, and it's the reality of what we have,” Yormark said. “We would've promoted it further, but we acquiesced to that request.
“But when you think of this fight, there's no question there is a U.S.A. versus Russia element with contrasting styles who dislike each other. And that dislike runs very deep.
“Sergey is what you envision of a Russian fighter. Andre is exactly what you would envision if you were trying to create the perfect boxer to represent U.S.A. Why not take advantage of that?”
Kovalev said he's never met Putin, but would be happy to accept his call should he win Saturday night.
“Of course. That's my country,” Kovalev said.
Duva explained, “Sergey's got his feet in two worlds. He lives in California, he's here as an immigrant who has made his fortune. He's not like [the ‘Rocky IV' character Ivan] Drago, who just showed up.
“Is this what we need to do to sell tickets? Have him breathing fire? Sergey is 100% genuine. He can't do phony. He's alternately charming and frightening, menacing and fun to be with, and I think that makes him unique.”
Ward knows — stereotype or not — he'll be confronting the enraged Russian bear.
“He can be as mad as he wants to be. Frankly, that's a good thing,” Ward said. “He wants to come in hot-headed? It's my job to cool him off.
“It's not just that he's a mean Russian. You've got a mean American on the other side of the ring.”

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP)  The man charged in a shooting that killed one person and wounded six others at a Tennessee church has a court date.
On Friday, 25-year-old Emanuel Kidega Samson has a hearing scheduled in front of a Davidson County general sessions judge.
Samson is charged with the fatal shooting of one woman and additional charges are expected after the rampage at Burnette Chapel Church of Christ in Nashville. He's being held without bond.
An arrest affidavit says Samson waived his rights and told police he arrived at Burnette armed and fired upon the building late last month.

Police haven't determined a motive. Law enforcement officials told The Associated Press that a note in Samson's car referenced retaliation for a white supremacist's 2015 massacre at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran is holding talks with European planemaker Airbus to buy 48 helicopters for civilian use, an Iranian official was on Saturday quoted as saying, as Iran continues its shopping spree of Western aircraft after the lifting of sanctions.
"The Health Ministry is planning to order 45 HEMS (Helicopter Emergency Medical Service) helicopters and the purchase is being negotiated by the Ministry of Roads and Urban Development," Iran's Financial Tribune daily quoted Deputy Minister Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan as saying.
"Ports and Maritime Organization is also planning to hold a tender to purchase three search-and-rescue helicopters," he added.
An Airbus Helicopters spokesman said: "We don't comment on discussions we may or may not be having with potential customers".

Iran has ordered more than 200 planes since international sanctions against the country were lifted last year in return for curbs on the country's nuclear activities.
Flag-carrier IranAir has ordered 100 planes from Airbus, 80 from U.S. rival Boeing (BA.N) and 20 ATR turboprops, but implementing the deals has been hampered by uncertainty over financing.
On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he did not believe that Iran was living up to the spirit of the 2015 deal to curtail its nuclear weapons programme. But it was not immediately clear whether Washington may take measures that could affect Tehran's plane purchases.
In June, Airbus said two other Iranian airlines had committed to buying 73 planes in a last-minute flurry of deals for the aircraft manufacturer at the Paris Airshow.
Fakhrieh-Kashan said Iran was holding negotiations to merge the helicopter order into the IranAir-Airbus contract signed in December, Financial Tribune reported.
PanARMENIAN.Net - The Iraqi Armed Forces continue their rapid advance near the strategic Huwija District, liberating several sites from the Islamic State (IS) terror organization, Al-Masdar news reported on Friday, October 6.
Led by Hashd Al-Sha'abi (Popular Mobilization Units), the Iraqi Armed Forces began the day by advancing from two different axes, resulting in the liberation of several towns, including Al-Muhammadiyah.
The biggest advance by the Iraqi Armed Forces came from the southern axis of Huwija, where the aforementioned town of Al-Muhammadiyah is located.
The operation to liberate Huwija began late last month, when the Iraqi Prime Minister, Haidar Al-‘Abadi, announced the start of this imperative offensive to clear central Iraq.
A day after a man identified as Vernest James Griffin allegedly went on a shooting spree that left two dead at businesses in Taylor and Pontiac, the owner of a third business that was targeted for more carnage was still trying to process the close call his company experienced  apparently at the hands of a former employee he described as a nice guy who got along well with everyone.
He was a good worker. Everybody liked him, said Dale Verhey, owner of Assured Carriers in Waterford. Im totally shocked, everybody here is just in shock. Its going to take awhile to process this.
Griffin, 45, left on good terms when he quit his job as a local trucker for Assured Carriers about two years ago, Verhey said. And no one had any contact with him since  until Thursday morning when he walked through the companys back door carrying an AK-47, then went to the office of Nick Verhey, Dales son, and asked for the general manager.
Thats when Nick Verhey slammed his office door, jumped out the window and called 9-1-1.

He was here to kill (the general manager), Im 100 percent convinced of it, Dale Verhey said.
Prior to Griffin arriving at Assured Carriers shortly before noon, its alleged he shot and killed Keith Kitchen, 60, at BSD Linehaul in Taylor where he used to work, then stole a semi-truck and drove to Aluminum Blanking in Pontiac, where he shot and killed Eriberto Perez, 58. He drove away, and after shootouts with Waterford police at two different locations, was taken into custody at about noon. He had surgery Thursday and is expected to survive.
Griffin is listed as an inmate at the Oakland County Jail with a homicide charge.
We feel so bad for the previous places he visited, Verhey said. Assured Carriers were the lucky ones on this.
On Friday, grief counselors and two pastors were at Aluminum Blanking to help employees deal with the aftermath of the deadly attack.

Authorities in Toronto identified Alek Minassian as the man suspected of using a Ryder rental van to run down several pedestrians in Canada's largest city, killing at least 10 people and injuring 15 others while leaving carnage in his wake.
Minassian, of Richmond Hill, Ont., was named Monday as the alleged driver of a white van that was used in the rampage that stretched about a kilometre in the city's North York neighbourhood.
Here's what we know about the suspected van attacker.
According to a LinkedIn social media profile, Minassian has been a student at Seneca College since 2011, studying computer software development.

In 2014, a person with the same name created an Android public parking app, available on Google Play, that allows users to search for parking locations in Toronto close to a specific address. The app was last updated in 2014, and had over 100 downloads.
Global News obtained a Facebook post Monday that Minassian wrote, just before carrying out his rampage, where he praised the “Incel Rebellion,” and California mass-killer Elliot Rodger, just before carrying out the rampage.
Facebook has confirmed to @globalnewsto that the post I tweeted last night allegedly written by Alek Minassian was authentic. Comment: “This is a terrible tragedy … We have found and immediately deleted the suspect's Facebook account.” – Facebook Spokesperson — Catherine McDonald (@cmcdonaldglobal) April 24, 2018
“The Incel Rebellion has already begun!” reads the post. “We will overthrow all the Chads and Stacys! All hail the Supreme Gentleman Elliot Rodger!”
Rodger killed six people in 2014 in a vehicle and shooting rampage. Before carrying out the act, Rodger posted a video blasting the women who rejected him and the men who weren't rejected and were sexually active.

“I'll take great pleasure in slaughtering all of you,” he said. “I don't know why you girls are so repulsed by me.”
Facebook confirmed to Global News it removed Minassian's post Monday.

“This is a terrible tragedy and our hearts go out to the people who have been affected,” a spokesperson for the social media company said in an email. “There is absolutely no place on our platform for people who commit such horrendous acts.”
Minassian spent a short time with the Canadian Armed Forces last year, but quit after completing just over two weeks of training.
“The accused in the recent incident in Toronto, was a member of the Canadian Armed Forces for two months in late 2017 – from Aug. 23 until Oct. 25,” a spokesperson for the Canadian military said. “He did not complete his recruit training and requested to be voluntarily released from the CAF after 16 days of recruit training.”
York Regional Police raided a home in Richmond Hill following the Toronto attack, at an address believed to be where Minassian lives. Global News showed a picture of the accused to area residents and many said it is the man who lives in the house police raided.
WATCH: Father of suspect Alek Minassian leaves court
Vahe and Sona Minassian were listed as the owners of the home, located in the area of Bayview Avenue and 16th Avenue.
Motive of the attack remains unclear
The city is reeling from the attack, that struck the heart of the vibrant north Toronto community on a sunny day.
At around 1:30 p.m. ET Monday, police responded to the call of eight to 10 people being struck by a van near the intersection of Yonge Street and Finch Avenue. The carnage continued south on Yonge Street, until about 1:50 p.m. when Minassian was arrested after a brief standoff with an officer.

“Based on witness accounts, we have a vehicle that started north on Yonge Street from Finch and drove southbound at some points in time on sidewalks, at some points in time driving southbound in the northbound lane,” Toronto police Chief Mark Saunders said. “So it's very clear just from a general perspective to say that the actions definitely looked deliberate.”
The motive behind the van attack remains unclear Tuesday, but police said Minassian, 25, was not known to authorities.

“We don't rule out anything. What we have to do is we have to follow what we have,” Saunders said. “It's very early in the investigation right now. You have to appreciate that there has to be forensic investigations, digital and otherwise. There has to be witnesses [to] not just what may have occurred but witnesses that may have information based on the person that we're alleging has done this.”
Minassian appeared in a Toronto courtroom Tuesday, where he was formally charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder and 13 counts of attempted murder.

* Sydney case shows how money launderers used Commonwealth Bank
* Australian regulators are suing CBA over lax controls
* CBA to fight lawsuit, says ATM coding problem to blame for most breaches
* AUSTRAC alleges meat firm deposited A$17.7 mln in crime proceeds with CBA
By Byron Kaye
SYDNEY, Aug 13 (Reuters) - In a run-down mall in one of Sydney's biggest Chinese neighbourhoods in 2015, 29-year-old Jizhang Lu showed up at the top-floor offices of a meat export company carrying a carrier bag stuffed with hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash.
According to police documents filed in court and reviewed by Reuters, Lu said he made the trip to the shopfront of CC&B International Pty Ltd eight times over three weeks. Each time a CC&B employee would hand him a receipt showing a different company had bought tens of thousands of kilograms of meat.
The cash - as much as A$530,200 ($416,840) at a time - was then deposited at a Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) branch, according to the police statement of facts agreed by Lu.
But the apparent purchases were fake, and last year Lu was jailed for two years after pleading guilty to helping launder A$3.2 million of what police allege were proceeds from an unidentified international drug syndicate.
The court records reviewed by Reuters did not name Lu's lawyer. Lu could not immediately be contacted directly because he was in custody.
The police case against Lu is now one of several being cited by financial intelligence agency AUSTRAC in its statement of claim against CBA, the largest civil court action of its kind in Australian corporate history.
AUSTRAC has accused CBA of "serious and systemic" breaches of money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing rules, alleging the country's second biggest mortgage lender failed to detect suspicious transactions nearly 54,000 times. It faces fines potentially amounting to billions of dollars.
CBA has said it will fight the AUSTRAC lawsuit, saying it would never deliberately undertake action that enables any form of crime. CBA said a coding error with new automated teller machines was behind most of the breaches but that it recognised there were "other serious allegations" in AUSTRAC's claim were unrelated to that software problem. It declined to comment specifically about the police case against Lu.
PROCEEDS OF CRIME
AUSTRAC's lawsuit against CBA asserts that, in total, A$17.7 million was deposited at the bank from February to August 2015 on behalf of a company identified in the earlier criminal case as CC&B.
"These funds were the proceeds of a drug importation syndicate and were proceeds of crime, within the meaning of the Criminal Code Act," AUSTRAC's statement of claim says, referring to CC&B only as Company 1.
Lu was identified in AUSTRAC's statement of claim against CBA, which also specified the time and length of Lu's sentence. A subsequent Reuters search of the criminal case against Lu produced the police "facts sheet" which provided further detail of his operation, including the name of CC&B.
The records of Lu's criminal case, provided to Reuters by a communications officer for the court which convicted Lu, showed that he pleaded guilty.
A call to the phone number listed on CC&B's website went unanswered. A Reuters visit to the address where Lu said he dropped off bags of money, at Lemon Grove shopping centre, showed no sign of CC&B - other than a mention in an old store guide for shoppers.
Calls over two days to Lemon Grove also went unanswered.
Australian company filings showed CC&B's corporate address as "Sunnyside Accountants". A woman who answered the phone at that firm said CC&B was a former client but that she could give no further information because the organisations had parted ways. Sunnyside hasn't been named in AUSTRAC's suit.
"CAN YOU HELP?"
Lu, a Chinese national on a business visa, described himself as a "net engineer", according to the police document filed in court. He had no involvement in the meat export industry and earned 60,000 yuan ($9,000) a year in his home country, he told police.
Lu said he met another Chinese man while grocery shopping in the Sydney suburb of Chatswood, where CC&B was based.
"After some chatting, he says, 'can you help me do this please?'," Lu told police, according to the document.
Lu agreed to help "because the man asked him", the police statement said, without elaborating.
He told police he didn't understand the receipts because they were written in English.
Australia's Joint Organised Crime Group charged two CC&B employees with dealing in criminal proceeds about the same time as Lu, in August 2015.
The Australian Federal Police could not immediately provide an update on the two CC&B employees identified as being charged.
The police statement said a third CC&B person, company director Ka Chun Leung, was a "potential co-accused" but has left the country. Efforts by Reuters to contact Ka were unsuccessful. ($1 = 1.2719 Australian dollars) ($1 = 6.6637 Chinese yuan renminbi)
LAHORE: Excise and Taxation Department Punjab has decided to launch a complete package of vehicle transfer which includes car registration smart card, universal number and new number plate for the convenience of citizens.
The work on this project has been started and complete package will be officially introduced before June this year.
After the implementation of new rules, when a car will be transferred to new owner, a new smart registration card will be issued to the purchaser instead of registration book.
Moreover, the old number plate of vehicle will remain with previous owner and buyer will be issued new number plate on his own name.
No extra charges will be taken from people for this package as well.
Due to this step, vehicle transfer process will be done quickly and trend of open transfer letter will end due to updated motor branch record.
According to sources, Excise and Taxation Department had earlier decided to only issue universal numbers of cars from current year to decrease work load from department's offices in all over Punjab, but it has now decided to launch a complete package.
The decision will help a great deal in eradicating agent mafia, eliminate forgery from Excise and Taxation Department as well as remove the highhandedness of excise data entry operators and key punch operators (KPO).
Additional Director General Excise and Taxation Department Punjab, Masood ul Haq has said that the value of cars will become equal after the launch of this package.

BRUSSELS (AP) — A power outage has hit Brussels airport that is causing chaos during the morning rush hour and is set to delay planes throughout the day.
Florence Muls of Brussels airport says the outage hit at 5 a.m. (0400 GMT; 11 p.m. EDT) Thursday and specifically affected the luggage and air conditioning systems. Hundreds of passengers were left outside the terminal at dawn and were allowed inside around two hours later.
"There was no communication at all so nobody knew what was going on," said passenger Karolien Coenen who missed her morning flight to Barcelona.
Passenger Daniel Stas arrived at dawn and said that "there was no electricity at all in the airport so we could not check in. Everything was blocked, computers were blocked, it was a real total blackout"
All systems were back to normal by midmorning but by then the backup was such that it would affect schedules for the rest of the day.
"The system dealing with the luggage is extremely complex, it took time to restart it so several passengers have not been able to get their luggage back or to leave with their luggage," Muls said.
Despite the delays, the airport warned passengers to show up on time. The airport said incoming flights shouldn't be affected.
The crescent Moon starts the night off right, with a beautiful encounter with two planets. It then keeps the good skywatching going by setting around 9 or 10 o'clock — making way for the year's first meteor shower.
As the color of twilight begins to drain from the sky, look for the planet Venus to the lower right of the Moon, and Mars to the upper left. Venus is the brilliant “evening star,” so it really stands out. Mars is only about one percent as bright, but it's also closer to the Moon, so you shouldn't have any trouble finding it. It looks like a fairly bright orange star.
Moonset clears the way for the Quadrantid meteor shower. It's named for the extinct contellation Quadrans Muralis, which represented an early astronomical instrument. Today, that region of the sky lies within the borders of Bootes, the herdsman. It climbs into good view in the wee hours of the morning, marked by its brightest star, Arcturus. You don't have to look at Bootes to see the shower, though — its meteors can shoot across any part of the sky.
The shower is one of the shortest of all — its peak lasts just a few hours. But the Quadrantids can produce dozens of meteors every hour during that peak, so the shower is a good one to watch.
To do so, find a dark, safe viewing site far from the glow of city lights. Then bundle up against the winter chill, look up, and enjoy the show.
We'll have more about the Moon and its planetary companions tomorrow.

NORRISTOWN, Pa. — A defense lawyer for Bill Cosby told jurors in his sexual assault retrial Tuesday that they should reject the “flimsy, silly, ridiculous” case against the entertainer and find him not guilty of all charges.
Defense lawyer Thomas Mesereau directly addressed the #MeToo movement — the cultural awareness that has resulted from the many accusations of sexual assault leveled against rich and powerful men over the last year — and asked the jury to “stand up against the rumor, gossip and shallowness” of that heated atmosphere.
“That's what our country is filled with at this moment,” Mesereau said in a 70-minute summation delivered in a hushed courtroom here in suburban Philadelphia.
Mesereau urged jurors to reject the testimony of Andrea Constand, who alleges that she was drugged and molested by Cosby at his home outside Philadelphia in January 2004.
“You're dealing with a pathological liar, member of the jury,” he said.
The jury of seven men and five women — plus six alternates — seemed to be listening intently to the pair of defense summations that dominated the morning of the 12th day of the trial. Prosecutor Kevin Steele is scheduled to deliver his closing argument this afternoon.
Related Key Defense Witness Takes Stand at Bill Cosby Retrial Bill Cosby Retrial: Jury Hears What Entertainer Told Police in 2005
Cosby, now 80, is the only major celebrity to face a jury in the atmosphere of the movement. He is charged with three counts of aggravated indecent assault, has pleaded not guilty and contends the sexual encounter with Constand was consensual. Each count carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.
Cosby's first trial ended in June when a different jury deadlocked on all charges after more than 50 hours of deliberations. He is now facing a jury that is slightly younger over all and has been sequestered at a hotel since testimony began April 9 here in Montgomery County, just outside of Philadelphia.
Constand is one of dozens of women who have accused Cosby of drugging and then assaulting them — but she is the only one whose allegation became the focus of a criminal case.
Mesereau focused with laser-like intensity on records of phone calls between Cosby and Constand in January 2004 — the month she says he assaulted her — and said the incident could not have happened in January.
He told jurors that Constand testified that, on the night in question, she drove to his Elkins Park home and called him from her car to tell him she had arrived. But Mesereau went through the records of the phone calls and said that there were no phone calls that entire month from Constand's cell phone to Cosby's home outside of Philadelphia.
While a video display on a courtroom screen showed the words, “Bill Cosby Gets Conned,” Mesereau told jurors that Constand, who received a settlement of nearly $3.4 million after filing a lawsuit against Cosby, was out for his money.
“Bill Cosby got conned big time,” said Mesereau, who added that the entertainer is now an 80-year-old man “on trial for his life.”
Defense lawyer Kathleen Bliss also urged the jury to find the once-beloved comedian not guilty.
“Acquit Mr. Cosby,” Bliss said.
Bliss told jurors they should rely heavily on the testimony of key defense witness Marguerite Jackson, who said that Constand once confided that she could set up a high-profile person in order to get money to go back to school and start a business.
Jackson told the jury that Constand, who was operations manager of the women's basketball team at Temple University, made the comment when they were rooming together during a team road trip to Rhode Island in February 2004.
Jackson, who at the time was an academic counselor for the basketball team, told the jury that they were watching TV when a news report came on about some well-known figure being accused of sexual assault in a civil case. Constand, she said, told her that “she had something similar happen to her” but had not reported the incident because she couldn't prove it.
Jackson said she asked Constand repeatedly whether something like that had actually happened, and that Constand finally replied, “no, it didn't” but that she “could say it did” in order to get money.
In her testimony, Constand told the jury that she left Temple shortly after Cosby assaulted her and returned home to Canada, where she went to school for massage therapy. She eventually filed a lawsuit against Cosby and received a settlement of nearly $3.4 million.
Constand testified that she had gotten to know Cosby when she worked at Temple, where Cosby was a famous alum and major booster.
She said when she went to his home in Montgomery County in early 2004, he offered her three pills to help her relax. She said she believed they were some kind of herbal remedy so she took them because she trusted him, and soon became incapacitated. Then, she said, she felt his fingers inside of her.

British Prime Minister Theresa May has announced that she is calling for early elections on June 8.
"At this moment of enormous national significance, there should be unity here in Westminster," she said in televised remarks in front of 10 Downing Street, referring to the U.K.'s negotiations to leave the European Union.
"But instead, there is division," May said, accusing other political parties of putting up obstacles.
"What they are doing jeopardizes the work we must do to prepare for Brexit at home, and it weakens the government's negotiating position in Europe," May added. "If we do not hold a general election now, their political game-playing will continue, and the negotiations with the European Union will reach their most difficult stage in the run-up to the next scheduled election."
Watch her remarks here:

The Mutant Underground let a cuckoo into their nest, and the results were fatal—both for the underground, and for Sentinel Services. Esme finally began to reveal her allegiance in “eXploited,” and it's to none of the sides we've seen thus far on The Gifted. No, this is something else…
But I'm getting ahead of myself. Tonight's midseason finale began with a flashback, one that sees someone who looks an awful lot like Esme, but who goes by the name “Stacey” infiltrating the campaign of an anti-mutant senate candidate. Before Stacey has a chance to finish her mission, she is telepathically warned (presumably by one of her sisters) that her cover has been blown.
Fast forward two months later and Esme has embedded herself in the Mutant Underground, subtly manipulating the mutants there into doing her bidding. First, she gets Caitlin and Reed to go on a crazy (albeit successful) mission to convince Agent Turner to transfer Sentinel Services' captured mutants away from Trask Industries and Dr. Campbell's psychopathic experiments, then she gets the Mutant Underground folks to lead her to the transport.
From there, Esme takes the reins, and she's much more powerful than she has led her new “friends” to believe. She not only has the power to read others' minds, but to control them. By forcing the Sentinel Services agents to shoot each other and then themselves, Esme breaks her two identical sisters out of the prisoner transport shuttle, breaking out Andy, Lauren, and Clarice in the process, along with a handful of random other mutants.
The fun is just beginning, the Stepford Cuckoos (the canonical name for the telepathic triplets) tell their new maybe-minions. Could Esme & co. be working with the Brotherhood, Magneto's clan of extremists? Or do the cuckoos have another allegiance? For now, one thing is for sure: They're not Team Mutant Underground. Esme never once let the gang in on her plans, and she does not seem to be planning a big reunion now that she has rescued the Sentinel Services' mutants.
While Esme's plan was arguably good for Clarice, Lauren, and Andy, it was too late for Sonia, who was murdered in front of her fellow prisoners and friends to convince the Strucker siblings to use their powers. In doing so, Campbell said he got everything he needed to fix the mutant problem. Does this mean he knows how to replicate the “cure” that suppressed the mutant gene in Lauren and Andy's dad? Or does he have different solution in mind?
While Sonia's death was frustratingly teased in the promo for tonight's episode, it was still affecting. This is a character that has been with us from the beginning of the show and, while she has made a few questionable choices (namely, giving Clarice false memories to motivate her into saving Johnny), she was a good person. She used her final moments to tell Lauren and Andy not to give Campbell what he wanted, a rebel to the end.
If we had to see Sonia go (and, you have to admit, it does raise the stakes here), then I'm glad the story was told through the Sonia/Clarice dynamic, which has grown to be an interesting one. Sonia may have violated Clarice's mind shortly after they first met, betraying her trust, but they grew to be allies.
Seeing Clarice first comfort Sonia, and then mourn her death was particularly affecting. The Gifted has rarely been so invested in showcasing the devastating effects of conditions like imprisonment, loss of rights, and corporate murder technically committed under the authority of the U.S. government, and the show is all the stronger for it.
THE MERCURY NEWS/ FOREIGN POLICY – PAUL McLEARY
The ambush that took the lives of three American Special Forces soldiers and wounded two others in Niger on Wednesday highlights the little-noticed but growing American involvement in contested pockets of Africa, where jihadist groups have taken root and Washington is rushing to backstop allies.
Islamic State-linked militants may have been responsible for the ambush, U.S. officials said Thursday.
Wednesday's attack came after U.S. and Niger forces met with local tribal members about 120 miles north of Niger's capital, Niamey, near its border with Mali. Two American troops were wounded.
Niger's President Mahamadou Issoufou said several of his nation's soldiers died in the attack, blaming it on Mali-based Islamic extremists near Niger's village of Tongo-Tongo in the Tillaberi region.
“Our country is once again the target of a terrorist attack, with a large number of victims,” he said.
Some officials originally suspected the attack was the work of al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb.
But Americans official said Thursday the U.S. now has reason to believe it was extremists affiliated with IS. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the incident publicly.
New Delhi: Announcing the further investments of Reliance Company, the Chairman of Reliance Industries Mukesh Ambani went on to say that he is happy to announce five commitments for Assam over next three years.
“Today I am happy to announce five commitments for Assam over the next three years. Reliance will invest an additional Rs 2,500 crore to augment its presence in this market,” he said at the inaugural function of the Global Investors Summit 2018 here.
Under this programme, the company will enhance its retail division's outlet to 40 from existing two, while the number of petrol depots will be increased to 165 from the existing 27, he added.
“We are also going to open new offices in all 145 tehsil headquarters across Assam. Our approach has always been to create sustainable livelihood opportunities and have generated 20,000 jobs in Assam,” Ambani said.
Assam has always been a low priority market for other telecom operators, but it is a ‘Category A' market for Reliance, he added.
“We now target to increase the sustainable livelihood opportunities by five-fold to 1,00,000 jobs,” Ambani said.

When the Boston Bruins took on the Nashville Predators in their season opener, there was a noticeable difference in the way they performed compared to their play a season ago. The high-pace, up-tempo game was exciting to watch and was a result of Bruce Cassidy getting to implement his strategy from day one. Despite missing Patrice Bergeron, David Backes and Torey Krug due to injuries, it was clear that the team wasn't going to let up at any point in the game, thanks in large part to the trio of rookies in the Bruins' lineup in Charlie McAvoy, Anders Bjork and Jake DeBrusk who all made their NHL debuts Thursday.
It isn't uncommon for NHL teams to start a few rookies in their lineup on opening day. Teams like to give training camp and preseason standouts their opportunity to compete and get their feet wet in the league. For the 2017-18 Bruins, however, that's far from the situation that the team is dealing with. Instead, the Bruins have a plethora of young talent that are ready to step into the lineup. Rather than just filling a hole on the roster, the Bruins want their rookies to make an impact. This is evidenced by the fact that Bjork is starting on the team's top line, DeBrusk on the team's second line and McAvoy on the Bruins' second pairing. While the expectations are high for all three rookies, it would be hard to predict that all three would have had such a huge impact just one game into their careers.

While the expectations are high for all three rookies, it would be hard to predict that all three would have had such a huge impact just one game into their careers.
In what has now become a tradition here on The Hockey Writers, a group of Bruins' writers got together to discuss the rookies and even look at picking out which one had the best debut of the three. Joining in the discussion was Drew Johnson, Joe Ochs, Chris Gere and Brandon Share-Cohen.
Drew Johnson:
The Boston Bruins kicked off the season on Thursday by kicking down the doors of the 2017 Campbell Bowl-winning Nashville Predators. Making their NHL regular season debuts were Notre Dame alumn Bjork, Boston University alumn McAvoy, and DeBrusk who tallied 49 points in 74 games with the Providence Bruins last season.
Taking a Closer Look at the Trio
McAvoy had the most impressive debut out of the three rookies, scoring the first goal of his NHL career as well as assisting David Pastrnak's power-play goal. In a 4-3 win, McAvoy made a direct contribution to 50% of Boston's goals against Nashville. Beyond that, McAvoy showed that he is capable of filling Krug's skates while he is injured with a fractured jaw. He captained the Bruins' power play and showed the tenacity of a top-two defenseman.
DeBrusk had the most gut-wrenching performance of the night. He also contributed to 50% of Boston's production, notching a goal and an assist in front of his family who were in attendance. His father, Louie DeBrusk, who accumulated 1,161 penalty minutes through 401 NHL games, was seen shedding tears of joy after Jake's first NHL goal.
Bjork assisted DeBrusk's goal en route to a plus-two rating in his first NHL game. It wasn't a bad night for the rookie seeing as though his designated center throughout the preseason, Bergeron, was out with an injury. He took the spotlight and displayed his speed and agility, making swift cuts. Though he didn't score his first NHL goal like the two above, Bjork did a nice job making opposing defensemen look like pylons, and that isn't a bad first step.
In the end, McAvoy impressed me the most, simply because the expectations have been so high all offseason and for him to deliver on night one is fantastic. In all three zones, McAvoy seemed almost a step ahead on every shift, especially when he hammered home David Krejci's pass to the high slot. You might as well call the Power play his bread and butter as he excelled there as well.
Joe Ochs:
In a night full of great debuts from Boston's young guns, DeBrusk's, in particular, stood out to me the most. In 14 minutes of ice time, he played precisely the kind of simple, mistake-free hockey the Bruins envisioned when penciling him into the top-six.
His first NHL goal was the culmination of exemplary hustle to beat a backchecking Kevin Fiala to the net prior to a deft and nifty finish. In picking up the secondary assist on McAvoy's first career goal it was his net drive (get used to that) which pulled both Roman Josi and Matt Irwin to the net with him, leaving both McAvoy and Bjork wide open at the top of the slot. Moreover, following two goaltender interference penalties in the preseason, DeBrusk had the presence of mind to stop just outside the blue point, showcasing his awareness and coachability.
This kid's compete level is through the roof.
McAvoy looked dynamic with the puck and scored the first two regular-season points of his career. But he had a somewhat uneven contest, which is probably going to get lost in the shuffle of his box score. He was caught flat-footed on several occasions, taking three separate minor penalties on the evening. Mistakes like these are to be expected, and by no means would I suggest this somehow negates the “good” from his game. But considering the expectations heaped on him, the glimpses into his game during last season's playoffs and the flawless performance from DeBrusk I would have to say that it was DeBrusk, not McAvoy who had the most impressive debut.
Chris Gere:
While Bjork really stood out in the preseason, DeBrusk was the one who stood out to me in his debut. He showed his ability to use his speed and strength to gain position on multiple occasions. He wasn't afraid to go to the front of the net, and it paid off in the form of a highlight-worthy goal.
At the risk of judging on a minuscule sample size, DeBrusk looks to be everything the Bruins could have hoped for in a rookie on the second-line. I'm sure he'll have his fair share of struggles (almost all rookies do), but he looked right at home flanking Krejci.
As for Bjork, his night was fairly quiet. Nothing particular about his debut stood out, but that's okay. He looked solid and limited his mistakes, which is all you can really ask for from an inexperienced player. Expect his productivity to increase drastically upon Bergeron's return.
McAvoy Proving He'll Be a Star
McAvoy's NHL regular season debut was somewhat rocky. Just looking at the stat sheet might have you believe that he played a great game. It was great on the offensive end, but as a defenseman, that's not the entirety of his job description. He looked bad at times in his own zone. Nashville forwards exploited him with regularity, blowing past him and drawing penalties. It's a part of his game that he'll really need to iron out if he wants to develop into a number one blue-liner.
That said, McAvoy looked electric in the offensive zone and on the power play. His goal showed uncommon offensive skill for a defenseman. His assist showed creativity and improvisation on a broken cycle with Pastrnak at the top of the zone. He's every bit the exciting player we've been expecting, just with a couple errors, he'll look to correct.
Brandon Share-Cohen
As Joe Mentioned, McAvoy looked really good throughout most of his 22 minutes of ice time. Still, he made a few mistakes and when trying to make up for them, took a few minor penalties that put his team in a tough position. It's going to happen to the best players on every team throughout the year and it's to be expected from rookies, so it's safe to say McAvoy's potential to win the Calder Trophy this season wasn't hurt by his debut game. Scoring his first goal and recording his first multi-point game in his NHL regular season debut help in that regard as well. Still, McAvoy didn't have the best debut of the three.
Out of the two rookie forwards on the team, Bjork and DeBrusk both did a lot of good in their debuts. Bjork showed the strong vision, smooth skating and nifty stickwork that made him such a force at Notre Dame while recording his first career point and coming close to his first career goal – a one-timer that was stolen by McAvoy, which led to the blueliners first career goal. If those two are going to compete and both be in position to score goals throughout their careers, they'll both be more than okay.
DeBrusk Making His Mark
As for DeBrusk, however, his game translated exceptionally well in his first game. A combination of his strong work on the puck and ability to get to the net as well as a rejuvenated Krejci with a newly-signed Pastrnak on his line, DeBrusk looked like a legitimate NHL player throughout the entire game. The result? A beautiful goal and an assist for his first multi-point game coming in his debut as well.
DeBrusk was probably the best of the three Bruins' rookies in their debut, but the fact that they all played so well is reason enough to be happy regardless of who's game was better. It won't always be this pretty, and the three will likely struggle at various points throughout the season, but as long as Cassidy gives them the chance to recover and redeem themselves, things will undoubtedly sort themselves out.
After the discussion, the two biggest standouts on the night of the three players were DeBrusk and McAvoy with two writers siding with the forward and two with the blueliner. It's a good debate from the Bruins' perspective as it means both players left a lasting impact (as did Bjork). All three will get a chance to impress in the Bruins' second game of the season and their home opener against the Colorado Avalanche,
The national organisation responsible for improving skills in the construction industry is to move its head office to Peterborough.
The Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) has announced it is to seek premises in Peterborough for its new head office in an effort to bring customers and colleagues closer together.
CITB chief executive Sarah Beale
The agency hopes it will be able to sign a lease later this year with the move completed by January 2020.
The move will bring together some functions from its operations from across 11 sites in the UK including its training centre on a former RAF site in Bircham Newton in Norfolk where it has been since 1966.
Consultations have begun with unions and staff about the proposed move in a bid to reduce the number of redundancies.
The CITB employs a total of 1,370 people and it is estimated that about 133 jobs will be impacted by the plans.
A CITB spokesman said Peterborough was the preferred location because it is a diverse city with a strong talent pool, a generous supply of modern, sustainable office facilities, supported by excellent road and rail transport links.
Chief executive Sarah Beale said: “This is a necessary step for CITB.
“For a number of us who work at CITB, this change will be a challenge as well as an opportunity.
"Peterborough was selected as the preferred location with colleagues, as well as customers, in mind as it offers the greatest potential to reduce redundancies, therefore retaining some talented colleagues, whilst meeting our future needs.
"British construction firms pay their levy and rightly expect high-quality skills as a result. The creation of a single head office will bring us closer to our customers and create the right environment to ensure that CITB delivers the ‘levy in, skills out' focus that industry and Government have demanded.
"As a GB-wide organisation, it is vital that we are better connected to our customers so that we can reach important partners – including construction firms – more easily providing a flexible workspace which can accommodate a highly mobile workforce.
"Our new head office will also be designed to suit the size and mission of the organisation that CITB will become."
Peter Lauener, chair of CITB, said: “CITB has embarked on a radical transformation programme which will deliver the skills British construction needs.
"To do this, we will need to become a more flexible, dynamic organisation, working in partnership with employers in all parts of Great Britain and setting the standards for future skills.
“Part of that change will mean establishing a new head office in a more central location such as Peterborough where access to other parts of GB will be easier.
“Meanwhile Sarah Beale and I are committed to doing everything we can to maximise the development of the CITB's site in Bircham Newton and thereby leave a lasting legacy for the local community and the economy of North Norfolk.”

Construction of a 77-room Fairfield Inn & Suites hotel started in the last couple weeks in downtown Midland and is expected to be complete mid-April.
The 14,066-square-foot hotel site plan from Wolgast Design Group on behalf of Davis Lodging, VII, LLC was approved by the Midland City Council in November. The hotel will be located on what used to be the Dirk Waltz auto dealership at 506 East Buttles St.
The hotel will be a great addition to the community, said Lyle Davis, president of DML Management Inc. during a groundbreaking event Wednesday morning.
The hotel will be the seventh under DML Management, which oversees hotels in the Great Lakes Bay Region, Davis said. He expects 15-20 people for its staff.
Amenities at the hotel will include an indoor pool, 13 suites, Wi-Fi, a complete fitness room, and a complimentary hot breakfast for guests. There are no plans for a restaurant or bar, Davis said, but beer and wine will be sold out of a marketplace within the hotel.
"It's an exciting time to be part of Midland. We see the growth here in the downtown and across Midland," said Sarah Opperman, interim president and chief executive officer of the Midland Business Alliance. "And it's positive for all of us as we go forward. We fully embrace and support a vibrant, sustainable downtown critically important to the community and all of us in the business community as well."
Planning the project was done in collaboration with Momentum Midland, an initiative of the Michigan Baseball Foundation.
Building the hotel is starting in the midst of a slew of other ongoing construction projects downtown, including 1st State Bank at 400 Ashman Street, Pathfinder Commons apartments at 411 Fitzhugh Street, Midland County Courthouse on Main Street, Ellsworth Place at 211 E. Ellsworth Street, reconstruction of the M-20 Bridge, and construction at the future location of the Midland Daily News at 219 Main Street.
The hotel building will be constructed at the East Ellsworth Street end of the land parcel that is also bordered by George, Buttles and Conkright streets, with the parking lot taking up the rest of the area. There are 74 parking spaces in the site plan approved by the city council, so the hotel might strike a deal with surrounding businesses to find additional parking spaces.
The Midland Area Community Foundation is investing 2 percent of its assets — about $2 million — in the hotel as its first impact investment into a local venture.
The hotel is expected to deliver a positive financial return for the foundation in addition to a social return in the form of creating jobs and encouraging commerce in Midland's downtown corridor, said the president and CEO of the Midland Community Foundation, Sharon Mortensen.
The investment and future impact investments will not be taken from any funds earmarked for grant making, Mortensen said.
WINNIPEG — Floodwater is receding across parts of southern Manitoba but officials warn water is on the rise along the Assiniboine River.
In its flood bulletin, the province says it has lifted a flood warning for some rivers since flows are decreasing.
But officials say a flood watch remains west of Winnipeg, between Portage la Prairie and Headingley, as the water continues to rise into the weekend.
RELATED: Carman mayor says second surge of flooding could be on the way
The province says a significant amount of water is coming in from Saskatchewan and ice jams are a concern on a few rivers where the ice is still intact.
Officials say the Red River has already crested in Winnipeg and water is decreasing in some tributaries.
RELATED: 5 of the worst floods in Canadian history
Forecasters have said soil moisture is very high following a wet fall, and river and lake levels are above normal in some areas.
Officials are urging any homeowners affected by this spring's flooding to review their home insurance. They say overland flood insurance was introduced by some insurers in Manitoba last year.

Scunthorpe United fell to a 1-0 defeat to Walsall at the Bescot Stadium after a deflected effort from Kieron Morris was enough to seal the three points for the West Midlands side.
Here, Charlie Wilson takes a look at five things we learned from the Iron's defeat to the Saddlers.
The strikers need to find their shooting boots
It has now been 39 days since a Scunthorpe United striker last scored a goal in the league (Tom Hopper vs Oldham on October 28).
During the six-game winning streak the Iron have, on too many occasions, relied on the attacking midfielders to come up with the goods.
Josh Morris, Hakeeb Adelakun and Duane Holmes have all been in tremendous form as of late and have all been major contributors throughout the past month. And whilst they are all capable of popping up from nowhere and creating goalscoring opportunities for themselves or others, the frontmen must do a better job of getting on the end of the service which they are getting.
Whilst Tom Hopper and Paddy Madden have both put in impressive performances in terms of their off-the-ball work, both have not got themselves into positions to score. On too many occasions they find themselves both out of the box, as Hopper comes short to hold the ball up whilst Madden likes to drift out to the wings.
Novak could be available for the MK Dons game this Saturday, and it would be interesting to see if he can help end the strikers scoring drought.
This team struggles to play without Funso Ojo
The Iron have now lost three games on the bounce, with all three of the losses having one thing in common… No Funso Ojo.
With Andrew Crofts failing to secure a place in Alexander's side after a less than convincing performance against Doncaster Rovers, the Iron boss decided to deploy a 4-4-2 diamond formation, playing Neal Bishop as the lone midfielder with Duane Holmes playing in the attacking midfield role.
The formation asked too much of Bishop as Walsall played with three attacking midfielders, which meant that the 36-year-old was overrun in the middle of the park, and struggled to retain possession.
Alexander reverted back to a traditional 4-4-2 in the second-half with Josh Morris playing alongside Bishop, and whilst the Iron looked much better with two men in midfield – they clearly missed Ojo.
One of Ojo's best qualities would be his ability to win the ball back, and then retain possession… he rarely ever seems to give the ball away. Alexander will hope that Ojo is able to fully recover from his injury for Saturday's game.
Scunthorpe could do with a player like Erhun Oztumer
Walsall's number 10 was the best player on the pitch on Saturday, and it wasn't even that close.
Oztumer was a constant thorn in the Iron's side, as he was able to pick up the ball in dangerous areas and showed his technical ability in beating United defenders and attempting eye of the needle through balls.
Whilst Scunthorpe have three players who are capable of playing those passes, and matching Oztumer's final third creativity, all three of those are wingers – Adelakun, Holmes and Morris.
Oztumer is a play in the ‘number 10' role, playing behind the striker and being able to link up play with the wingers and strikers.
A player who could blossom into one similar to that of Erhun Oztumer, would be Clayton Lewis. Whilst it will take time for the New Zealand international to adapt to English football, Lewis is a player similar to Oztumer.
They both are at their best when pick up the ball in the pocket between the midfield and defence and are capable of finding that killer pass to the strikers, as Iron fans saw Oztumer do just that when he played Luke Leahy through into the penalty area, who was then awarded a penalty.
Levi Sutton should be the right-back going forward with Jordan Clarke out
Whilst not many positives could be taken from Saturday's loss to the Saddlers, the performance of Levi Sutton should leave Iron fans pleased.
Sutton can certainly improve defensively, and will do just that with playing time. When Clarke was ruled out for spell earlier in the season, Sutton improved game-by-game defensively and was one of the Iron's better performers at times.
What was most impressive with Sutton's performance on Saturday however, was his willingness to attack and make the correct overlapping runs, whilst not being caught out defensively.
As a midfielder during his youth days, Sutton is certainly confident when going forward, and could offer a real threat down the right flank if he is to continue at the position.
January acquisitions needed
Iron fans should expect one or two new faces at Glanford Park when January comes around.
With Andrew Crofts falling down the pecking order, Sam Mantom injury issues and Devonte Redmond returning to Manchester United in January, the Iron will likely bring in another central midfielder.
And with the Iron struggling for goals from strikers, this could be another position which the Iron could look to bolster.
Kevin van Veen and Paddy Madden struggling for goals, out of contract and lower down in the pecking order than Tom Hopper and Lee Novak, January transfer window could very well see the Iron go in for a striker.
A groundbreaking study published in the current issue of the Journal of Hematology & Thromboembolic Diseases reveals the potential “leukemogenic” properties of the Bt toxin biopesticides engineered into the vast majority of GMO food crops already within the US food supply.
The causal link between cancer and genetically modified food was confirmed in a French study, the first independent long-term animal feeding study not commissioned by the biotech corporations themselves. The disturbing details can be found here: New Study Finds GM Corn and Roundup Causes Cancer In Rats
Now, a study published in the Journal of Hematology & Thromboembolic Diseases indicates that the biopesticides engineered into GM crops known as Bacillus Thuringensis (Bt) or Cry-toxins, may also contribute to blood abnormalities from anemia to hematological malignancies (blood cancers) such as leukemia.[i]
A group of scientists from the Department of Genetics and Morphology, Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Brasilia, Brasilia/DF, Brazil set out to test the purported human and environmental biosafety of GM crops, looking particularly at the role that the Bt toxin found within virtually all GM food crops plays on non-target or non-insect animal species.
The research was spurred by the Brazilian Collegiate Board of Directors of the National Sanitary Surveillance Agency (ANVISA), who advocated in 2005 for evaluations of toxicity and pathogenicity of microbiological control agents such as Bt toxins, given that little is known about their toxicological potential in non-target organisms, including humans.
While Bacillus Thurigensis spore-crystals have been used since the late 1960's in agriculture as a foliar insecticide, it was only after the advent of recombinant DNA biotechnology that these toxin-producing genes (known as delta endotoxins) were first inserted into the plants themselves and released into commercial production in the mid-90's, making their presence in the US food supply and the bodies of exposed populations ubiquitous.
What the study revealed is that various binary combinations and doses of Bt toxins are capable of targeting mammalian cells, particularly the erythroid (red blood cell) lineage, resulting in red blood cell changes indicative of significant damage, such as anemia. In addition, the study found that Bt toxins suppressed bone marrow proliferation creating abnormal lymphocyte patterns consistent with some types of leukemia.
The researchers also found that one of the prevailing myths about the selective toxicity of Bt to insects, the target species, no longer holds true:
It has been reported that Cry toxins exert their toxicity when activated at alkaline pH of the digestive tract of susceptible larvae, and, because the physiology of the mammalian digestive system does not allow their activation, and no known specific receptors in mammalian intestinal cells have been reported, the toxicity these MCAs to mammals would negligible [8,22,23]. However, our study demonstrated that Bt spore-crystals genetically modified to express individually Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac or Cry2A induced hematotoxicity, particularly to the erythroid lineage. This finding corroborates literature that demonstrated that alkali-solubilized Bt spore-crystals caused in vitro hemolysis in cell lines of rat, mouse, sheep, horse, and human erythrocytes and suggested that the plasma membrane of susceptible cells (erythrocytes, in this case) may be the primary target for these toxins [33]
The study also found:
1) That Cry toxins are capable of exerting their adverse effects when suspended in distilled water, not requiring alkalinization via insect physiology to become activated as formerly believed.
2) That a dose of Cry1Ab as low as 27 mg/kg, their lowest tested dose, was capable of inducing hypochromic anemia in mice – the very toxin has been detected in blood of non-pregnant women, pregnant women and their fetuses in Canada, supposedly exposed through diet.
3) Whereas past reports have found that Bt toxins are generally nontoxic and do not bioaccumulate in fatty tissue or persist in the environment, the new study demonstrated that all Cry toxins tested had a more pronounced effect from 72 hours of exposure onwards, indicating the opposite is true.
4) That high-dose Cry toxin doses caused blood changes indicative of bone marrow damage (damage to “hematopoietic stem cell or bone marrow stroma”).
The authors noted their results “demonstrate leukemogenic activity for other spore-crystals not yet reported in the literature.”
They concluded:
[R]esults showed that the Bt spore-crystals genetically modified to express individually Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac or Cry2A can cause some hematological risks to vertebrates,increasing their toxic effects with long-term exposure. Taking into account the increased risk of human and animal exposures to significant levels of these toxins, especially through diet, our results suggest that further studies are required to clarify the mechanism involved in the hematotoxicity found in mice, and to establish the toxicological risks to non-target organisms, especially mammals, before concluding that these microbiological control agents are safe for mammals.
Did you get that? Their conclusion is that it is premature to consider GM toxins to be safe in mammals. Billions have already been exposed to Bt toxins, in combination with glyphosate-based herbicide formulations such as Roundup, and yet, most biotech research scientists and industry regulators still claim they are unequivocally safe. This has much to do with the well-known relationship that biotech corporations like Monsanto have with so-called ‘check book' science firms who are basically paid to obfuscate adverse health outcomes of their products, such as the GMO-Cancer link. [see: Monsanto-Funded Science Denies Emerging Roundup Cancer Link]
Consider also that the question of combined toxicity of Cry toxins and glyphosate-based residues within plants have not been sufficiently explored, and that glyphosate exposure has already been linked to non-Hodgkins lymphoma and hairy cell leukemia in the biomedical literature.[ii]
The reality is that we no longer have time to wait around for additional research to accumulate on the adverse health effects of GMOs, especially considering the biotech industry has far more capital to infuse into their own faux research on the topic.
Some, in fact, argue that we should not be waiting around for the corrupt legislative process to compel manufacturers to label GMOs, rather, we should be fighting to ban them altogether, advocating for the precautionary principle before it is too late to undo the damage to our biosphere.
In the meantime, you can join the growing movement to March Against Monsanto, occurring world wide on May 25th, as a way of expressing your desire for real change, as well as vote with your forks, the only immediately effective tool we have against biological and environmental harms caused by the dominant GMO-based food system.

Many experts said it was not a case of “if” Canada's largest city would be hit with a terrorist-type attack, but “when.”
Whether it is a lone wolf with mental illness or one claiming to be affiliated with an international organization, the outcome is the same. Innocent people are killed or wounded and a city is terrorized by an unspeakable primitive act.

Canada is not yet numb to such tragedy. You could tell by the witnesses that were left trembling with shock after watching a van plow through Toronto's crowded Yonge St on Monday.
People of every description were trying to do what they could once they had realized what exactly was happening.

Little is known about the killer or his motives but we do Canada has lost some of its innocence. We can no longer stand back and say we are different than other countries.
But what will define us is how we react to such events and continue to be the free and open country that has made us the envy of the world.
Unfortunately, Canada has had to come together very recently in the wake of painful tragedy, although through different circumstances, and we will rally again.
That was evident when Toronto refused to cancel events at Maple Leaf Square ahead of the playoff game against Boston at the Air Canada Centre.
The city, and country, chose to rally in unity instead of wallowing in fear.

Barring something spectacular happening at the Oscars on Feb. 26, we know who's a shoo-in to win the imaginary best Speech of the Season statuette this year: Meryl Streep.
The Oscar-winning actress' use of her lifetime achievement award acceptance at the Golden Globes in January to focus on political issues rather than her own career electrified both the crowd in the Beverly Hilton's ballroom and audiences watching around the world. And earned her a couple very special tweets from President Trump.
“We could discuss for an hour all the things she did right in that speech,” says Hilari Weinstein, president of High Impact Communications, and a specialist in helping people prepare for speeches of all kinds. “She wore her glasses. She apologized for having lost her voice. She addressed individuals in the audience by their place of birth. Tricks come across as tricks, but it was perfection because it felt real.”
But while Streep made it look natural and easy, giving a passionate acceptance speech – especially one that has to be delivered in a highly emotional, agitated state before millions, knowing you'll be played off the stage in a matter of seconds – is no easy task. Those who decide to just wing it are doomed to either failure or mediocrity.
If you sound incoherent or sophomoric it really undercuts your credibility." — Dan Gerstein
“There's a real risk for public figures who want to be taken seriously,” says Dan Gerstein, founder and president of Gotham Ghostwriters. “If you sound incoherent or sophomoric it really undercuts your credibility. We're a celebrity-driven culture, but for a lot of Americans we suspect celebrities are dilettantes or entitled or self-serving. If you want to be taken seriously, it's important to make sure you know what you want to say.”
So where to start? If you've landed a nomination, you've got a one-in-five (in most categories) chance of winning an Academy Award, which means it's time to get down to business and abandon all superstitions that advance preparation will somehow jinx your win.

“Meryl Streep, who has won probably more awards than anybody, has never failed to prepare – and it has never jinxed her,” scoffs Weinstein, who notes that there's no simple formula for a great acceptance speech.
Yet there are elements every speaker should consider, starting with who will be listening. “There are two audiences,” she says. “One in the room and the one watching around the world. Those receiving an honor need to find ways to connect with both.”
Weinstein says structure and organization – not necessarily memorization – are your friends. She suggests breaking down an acceptance speech based on the time allowed. A 45-second speech can be broken into one- or two-sentence blocks of 15 seconds each.
“Think about how if you could only get out one sentence, what would that sentence be?” she says. “There's a comfort in knowing that in the back of your mind, or on a notecard in front of you, three elements you want to get out there even if you're overcome with emotion.”
Talk about your competition, then the people you want to thank, then relate a personal story or call to action." — Patrick Munoz
Patrick Munoz, a West Hollywood voice and speech coach who works with celebrities on their accents and speeches, relies on CPR: Competition, People, Relate. “Talk about your competition, then the people you want to thank, then relate a personal story or call to action,” he says.
“Remember Leonardo DiCaprio, who won for ‘The Revenant'?” says Munoz. “He started out talking about his competition, thanked people, then related a personal story about having to go to the southern tip of the world to film because they couldn't find snow, which is a direct result of global warming – his call to action. That's what he was passionate about.”
Additionally, practice is a must – and if you're a woman, Weinstein suggests preparing by reading the speech in the heels you'll be standing in on the big night. “Having that sense of groundedness helps the presenter better articulate what they want to say. If you're wearing heels designed for fashion, it can make the body feel like it doesn't have equilibrium.”
In the end, says Gerstein, it's about not just speaking for the sake of speaking. “The Oscar stakes are higher than the Golden Globes,” he notes. “It's a more serious setting, so the opportunity is greater – but so is the potential risk. If you win an Oscar, it's likely the pinnacle of your career. You never know if you'll win another. So to not be ready in that moment is completely unnecessary.”

Halifax Regional Council is back in session after a week break and it's set to deal with a number of issues that should be familiar to Halifax — including the always contentious debate around chickens in the municipality.
Here are some of the issues heading to council on Tuesday that are worth watching.
READ MORE: Dartmouth business group wants increased ferry service to continue
Alderney Ferry schedule
On Tuesday, council will examine whether or not to continue the 15-minute frequency of the Alderney-Halifax ferry until at least May 28.
The motion isn't a permanent solution for the year as that will be determined during the fiscal budget process on March 28 — instead, it'll function as a stop gap.
If the motion were to be voted down on Tuesday, then the 15-minute frequency of the ferry would end on April 1, causing Haligonians to have confusing or incorrect travel information until transit's quarterly adjustment date in May.
Staff say that if passed, the motion will ensure that travellers aren't left in the dark.
Chickens
If you've ever wanted to own a chicken in the Halifax Regional Municipality, you might get your chance.
Coun. David Hendsbee is bringing a motion forward that will ask for a staff report to examine permitting all regions of the HRM the ability to house chickens or hens if they choose.
Currently, residents in areas outside of metro Halifax are not allowed to keep their own egg-laying chickens.
WATCH: Whitman censured over conduct, no punishment for other councillors
Code of conduct, round two
Coun. Tony Mancini wants to add teeth to the municipality's code of conduct.
He has brought forward a motion requesting a staff report on requiring an annual personal review of the code of conduct. If that sounds familiar, it is because it is.
Halifax council has been here before, having discussed the issue and then soundly defeating the motion in 2017.
But Mancini seems to think that now is the time to reintroduce the topic after the council has “debated a few high-profile incidents involving the conduct of elected officials.”
He seems to be referring to council's decision in February to censure Coun. Matt Whitman for violating the council's code of conduct.
At the very least, Mancini may not be alone in his willingness to revisit the topic.
After Whitman's censure, Mayor Mike Savage expressed interest in revisiting the topic. He'd previously helped vote down the motion last year.
“I'm prepared to revisit the concept of [an integrity commissioner],” he said.
“There is frustration that we end up back here too often.”

Ceasefire funding
The funding of a community group that works to stop violence in the Halifax Regional Municipality will be on the line at Tuesday's council meeting.
A staff report in front of council does not recommend that the city continue to fund Ceasefire Halifax, but rather roll some of the organization's components into pre-existing youth programs.
Instead, city staff have recommended that council explores outside funding to support programs like Ceasefire.
Funding for the organization from the provincial government will be cut off at the end of March.

* Strong U.S. wage growth boosts inflation expectations
* Euro zone yields follow U.S. Treasury yields higher
* German Bund yields highest since Sep 2015 (Updates prices, adds Viceroy)
By Fanny Potkin
Feb 2 (Reuters) - Euro zone bond yields extended their rise on Friday after U.S. payroll data indicated that annual wage growth in the world's biggest economy was the strongest since 2009.
U.S. job growth surged in January and wages increased further, recording their largest annual gain in more than 8-1/2 years and bolstering expectations that inflation will rise this year as the labour market hits full employment.
“It was an extremely strong report,” said John Vail, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management.
“The wage data, especially, is negative for bonds because it shows there is greater inflation on the horizon.”
Germany's 10-year government bond yield, the benchmark for the euro zone, hit a day's high of 0.768 percent, up 4 basis points (bps) on the day, before edging back to 0.757 percent in late trades..
The British 10-year government bond yield jumped to 1.609 percent after the data, its highest since May 2016, up 7 bps on the day, as March gilt futures extended losses.
Meanwhile, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to 2.854 percent, its highest in four years.
“There's definitely a correlation between U.S. and European bonds but it's also important to remember the two regions have completely different dynamics,” said Mizuho strategist Antoine Bouvet.
“We expect that eventually U.S. Treasuries will underperform Bunds, and the spread between the two will widen further.”
The gap between U.S. and German 10-year government bond yields, the “transatlantic spread”, widened a touch after the payroll data to 207 bps from 205 bps before, and is close to some of the widest historical levels.
German Bund futures briefly dropped below a cash price of 158.00 for the first time since December 2015, before rising back up to 158.10; still down 51 ticks on the day.
Elsewhere, French central bank chief Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on Friday the European Central Bank was normalising policy and whether it ended asset purchases in September or wound them down gradually was not an “existential” issue.

For the first time since November of 2007, Brad Wall is not the premier of Saskatchewan.
It's no secret Scott Moe‘s predecessor was Saskatchewan's biggest cheerleader, touting business and trade with the province and often drawing national attention.
READ MORE: Scott Moe sworn in as Saskatchewan's new premier
“Certainly Saskatchewan punched way above its weight,” said Greg Poelzer, a political scientist at the University of Saskatechewan. “We're three per cent of the population, but we weren't three per cent of the national stage with Brad Wall.”
Now that Moe is officially Saskatchewan's 15th premier, residents and businesses alike are looking to the future with cautious optimism.
“I think right now we're in a period of some uncertainty,” said Darla Lindbjerg, CEO of the Greater Saskatoon Chamber of Commerce. “People are going to be poised and waiting to see what moves he's going to make and how things are going to look in the next two years.”
The group credits Wall and his advocacy for industry in Saskatchewan for much of the province's success over his 10-year tenure.
“He promoted trade — that was a big policy initiative of his both inter-provincially and international,” Lindbjerg said. “So we're hoping to see that continue going forward.”
However, it was Wall's clashes with the prime minister on policy, such as over carbon pricing, that drew most of the national spotlight.
“Some of the attacks on the prime minister by our former premier had a bit of a personal edge to them,” Poelzer said. “I think you'll see less of that with Scott Moe.”
READ MORE: Scott Moe wants Ottawa to recognize Saskatchewan's climate change plan
Instead, Poelzer predicts less forcefulness from the province's new premier on the national stage — he believes Moe will draw attention toward the province for collaboration rather than confrontation when it comes to natural resources and Indigenous issues.
“I think Scott Moe is going to prove to be a very effective premier,” Poelzer said. “I think you're going to see some more space open up for cooperation between Saskatchewan and the federal government that we really haven't seen over the last couple of years.”
But the Saskatchewan Party plans to get the province familiar with the new premier first — a plan that was in place no matter who won the leadership vote.
The party will be “doing some regional dinners [like] we did in the past with Premier Wall, getting the new leader out in front of as many people as we can,” Saskatchewan Party president James Thornsteinson said prior to the party's convention on Jan. 27. “[We will be] coming up with policy and so forth that will lead us forward to the 2020 election.”
Moe was officially sworn in along with 18 members of his new cabinet at a ceremony at Government House in Regina on Friday.
Nigerian based SureRemit has launched a crypto token aimed at money sent home by global immigrants.
The startup — which is incorporated in Mauritius — offered pre-sales of its remittance focused tokens this week, before a January 2018 ICO. SureRemit will use blockchain partner Stellar's platform.
The company is connecting its crypto product — which is not redeemable by consumers for cash — to a network of pre-approved merchants in Nigeria, Kenya, and Rwanda. SureRemit plans to launch in India and the Middle East in the second quarter of 2018.
Clients can use SureRemit's app to present tokens as payment for things such as utility bills, student tuition, and online consumer goods. African e-commerce giant Jumia is among its merchant partners.
There'll be no purchase or transfer fees for the tokens above face value. SureRemit will generate revenue from businesses, who pay a percentage on each token transaction, and then redeem the tokens (fewer fees) for cash from SureRemit.
SureRemit's merchant network — according to co-founder Samuel-Biyi — views the fees as the cost of accessing a new pool of customers. “We're a big channel to connecting them to the multi-billion dollar market of remittance inflows,” he said “So our model is transferring costs of remittances to the merchant side away from the sender side.”
Remittances — and the high fees charged by money transmitters such as Western Union and MoneyGram — represent an enormous pool of global capital. According to World Bank stats, roughly 250 million global migrants transferred $601 billion to their home countries in 2016. More than half, $441 billion, went to developing countries: $39 to Sub-Saharan Africa, $69 billion to India, and $20 billion to Nigeria.
On global remittance fees, Sub-Saharan Africa pays the highest fees — roughly 10 percent per $200 — of any other region.
One of SureRemit's backers, 500 Startups, sees these high transfer costs as a disruptive opportunity for the venture. “The fees are horrible, and Western Union is ripping off people who can least afford it,” said 500 Startups Partner, Marvin Liao. “It's a huge market…and a lot of these basic financial and commerce needs that people have been still not being addressed effectively,” Liao said of the potential for SureRemit's crypto token product in Africa.
On the regulatory side, SureRemit's Samuel-Biyi sees less risk of their crypto token product being used for money-laundering compared to other block-chain payments systems, such as Bitcoin. “Because it's not cash redeemable and tied to particular merchants…one would not be able to transform tokens to cash that easily. This makes it an unattractive money laundering channel,” he said.
To the question of why consumers would use SureRemit's crypto tokens versus other blockchain finance products, Biyi named “speed and cost” as competitive advantages. “Remit tokens ensure zero-cost, high-velocity cross-border transactions, which Bitcoin is not currently optimized for,” he said.
SureRemit has already proven market demand for cashless consumer payment and merchant programs through its predecessor, SureGifts product. SureGifts customers purchase digital shopping vouchers via e-mail or SMS, and use them for payment at 300 partner merchants in Rwanda, Nigeria, and Kenya. SureRemit plans to leverage this network for its new remittance focused crypto token.
Central Michigan junior outfielder Daniel Jipping was taken with the 656th pick in the 22nd round of the MLB Draft by the Colorado Rockies.

Indian IT Outsourcers Anxious Over Potential Changes To H1-B Visas
Enlarge this image toggle caption Manjunath Kiran/AFP/Getty Images Manjunath Kiran/AFP/Getty Images
With the Trump administration vowing to tighten rules for skilled workers entering the United States, India's software services companies are worried. Indian IT giants outsource tens of thousands of tech specialists to the United States each year, and limiting the visa program that brings them in could disrupt their multibillion-dollar industry.
Congress and the White House have targeted what is arguably the most coveted of U.S. visas: the H1-B. It's "a kind of temporary work visa that allows professionals from other countries to work in the United States for a designated U.S. employer," explains Stephen Yale-Loehr, a Cornell University immigration law professor.
Yale-Loehr says that with the economy strengthening, the program is in particularly big demand. Last year, U.S. companies that sought to bring highly skilled workers to the U.S. filed 236,000 petitions that went into a lottery for just 85,000 H1-B visas, the legal cap. The bulk of the winners: Indian computer specialists, many of them graduates of U.S. universities.
Yale-Loehr says that places like Europe and Australia have special visas to attract such talent, but that the United States doesn't.
"We have to shoehorn high-tech workers into categories like the H1-B, and it's getting more difficult every year," he says.
For many H1-B holders, the temporary work visa — issued for a maximum of six years — has been a stepping stone to obtaining a green card. That grants permanent residence in the U.S., and in turn provides a path to citizenship.
But newly introduced legislation in Congress and drafts of executive orders reportedly circulating in the Trump White House that could limit the H1-B program.
Executives from the software services firms will travel to Washington this month to lobby against measures that threaten one of India's most successful industries — which last year earned 60 percent of its $108 billion in export revenues from the U.S.
One bill proposes more than doubling the minimum wage of H1-B holders, which by law is set at $60,000. Critics argue the H1-B has been misused to displace American workers, and that there has been an incentive to prefer Indian IT workers because they are cheaper.
Shailesh Chitnis, with the data mining and analysis company Compile, says that while the median salary for all H1-B holders is $71,000, most but not all Indian outsourcers pay below that. If they had to double salaries, Chitnis says, Indian IT companies would have to change their 20-year-old business model.
"Because these organizations are not going to be bringing in people at $120,000 to fill those jobs — it would simply be too expensive," he says. "They'll have to look at some other alternatives."
But Shevendra Singh with India's National Association of Software Services Companies, or NASSCOM, refutes allegations that Indian companies are dislocating American workers or supplying low-paid labor. Singh says there is demand in the U.S. for Indian technical talent because of a severe shortage of qualified Americans with degrees in science, technology, engineering and math.
Talent has become more important than investment or trade. ... Those who consciously cut themselves off from the global supply chains of talent are depriving themselves of a good thing.
"The crux of the issue is the STEM skill shortage in the U.S.," Singh says.
In its 2012 report, the U.S. president's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology found that "fewer than 40-percent of students who enter college intending to major in a STEM field complete a STEM degree." The council concluded that by 2022, economic forecasts suggested a need to produce "approximately 1 million more college graduates in STEM fields than expected under current assumptions."
R. Chandrashekhar, president of NASSCOM, says that if the skills aren't available in the U.S. — and companies can't bring workers in — the jobs either won't get done or they will go out of the country and be done remotely.
"Talent has become more important than investment or trade," he says. "And those who consciously cut themselves off from the global supply chains of talent are depriving themselves of a good thing."
Chandrashekhar notes that the intermingling of American and Indian ingenuity helped build Silicon Valley, and says protectionist impulses could weaken the United States, and what makes it unique.
"America is No. 1," Chandrashekhar says. "What has really helped them to rise, absolutely, to the top, is that they have attracted talent from across the world. ... It would be really a pity if that was reversed without thinking it through."
Immigration expert Yale-Loehr, co-author of a 21-volume treatise on immigration law, agrees that the United States faces a crisis in maintaining its innovative and competitive edge, and says it should be inviting more, not less, IT talent to its shores.
"In a globalized economy, the best and the brightest want to work in the best places — and if they're unable work in the United States, or it takes too long or is too difficult, they'll find a place in Canada or Europe or India where their talents can be appreciated," he says.
If implemented, Yale-Loehr says the draft executive order would initiate a review of the H1-B program but likely have no direct, immediate impact.
However, he says "it sends a strong signal that we no longer like foreign workers — we're all about only U.S. workers.
"That is eventually going to hurt us."
It was February 2017 when the first letter about anti-abortion groups and the Canada Summer Jobs program landed in Labour Minister Patty Hajdu's office.
The Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada wanted Hajdu to keep crisis pregnancy centres — which offer an anti-abortion spin on
pregnancy counselling — from getting summer-jobs funding.
READ MORE: Canada Summer Jobs: Everything you need to know about the crackdown on anti-abortion groups
Applications were already being reviewed, and the centres were likely on the list, the letter warned.
There was no response.
Not until April of that year — when media reports emerged about a rookie Liberal MP who approved $56,000 in funding for an
anti-abortion group in her riding in 2016 — did the issue seem to catch Hajdu's attention.

Since then, there has been no shortage of media attention paid to the Liberal government's efforts to screen organizations applying for Canada Summer Jobs money, blocking any that refuse to attest that neither they nor the summer jobs in question would support an anti-abortion agenda.

On Tuesday, Hajdu launched the 2018 version of the program, playing down any issues with the employer declaration by saying that faith-based groups had accessed funding.
The Employment and Social Development Canada website shows hundreds of churches among the employers approved for funding this year, along with faith-based camps.
Hajdu said the Canada Summer Jobs program was about the students, despite the attention paid to protesting groups.
“Canadians expect us to be thoughtful about how we run programs and that we make sure that especially for these first jobs for kids, that they are with organizations that respect the fundamental rights of Canadians and don't ask them to do things that are essentially looking to undermine those rights,” Hajdu said.
“We made that commitment to Canadians that we would do this and that's exactly what we're doing.”

The evolution of the Liberals' policy that stoked concerns from religious groups is laid out in some 200 pages of documents obtained by The Canadian Press under the Access of Information Act or provided by groups, along with interviews with stakeholders and government officials, some speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.
A briefing note from August shows Hajdu had already directed the department to come up with the new employer declaration to ensure funding went to groups with “mandates that are consistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and court decisions.”
Hajdu needed to approve the final wording before the fall, the note said.

Her department crafted several pages of legal advice, all of it blocked from release on the grounds of solicitor-client privilege.
The Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada, meanwhile, was getting only radio silence from Hajdu's office.
“We didn't know what was really going on,” said Joyce Arthur, the coalition's executive director.
“Then, in December, they suddenly announced this attestation requirement. At the time we didn't really know why they chose that solution, but we thought, ‘Whatever works.'”
COMMENTARY: Liberals will win the fight on Canada Summer Jobs program
The new requirements appeared to come out of nowhere, said one government official, who described initial political trepidation about the eligibility rules.
Faith-based groups howled in protest, saying they violated religious and free-speech rights. Hajdu and Liberal MPs defended the wording of the declaration.
One Toronto-area Liberal MP wrote to a complainant, saying that while individuals could disagree with the declaration, “freedom of religion is an individual right and is not something which can be superimposed on an organization.”
Religious leaders who met with Hajdu in late March left with the impression there might be some movement on the wording, but a government official said Hajdu only agreed to a review and gave no hint that the language dealing specifically with reproductive rights would be removed.
Hajdu said Thursday she is looking to clarify language in the application form and guide that clears up concerns from groups and lets the government meet its policy objectives.
In the meantime, Arthur's organization plans to pore over the full list of this year's employers to see if any of the hundreds of
groups in their database have been approved for funding.
Hajdu also said the department is working with employers who are concerned that increases in provincial minimum wages in provinces like Ontario may force them to cut back on hours offered to summer students.

Again facing long odds and another elimination game, the Bryant Black Sox came through with a 5-0 victory over Randolph County, North Carolina, Sunday to take a spot in the final four of the American Legion World Series at Keeter Stadium in Shelby, North Carolina.
Bryant youngster Will McEntire, again pitching on the big stage, threw a three-hit shutout to help advance the Black Sox into the semifinals, which they play today against Henderson, Nevada, at 2 p.m. (Central). McEntire pitched the seven-inning complete game, giving up the three hits and two walks, and struck out three for the shutout.
“It was a win or go home the way it played out,” Black Sox Coach Darren Hurt said. “He threw a heck of a ballgame, again. He threw a big game for us in state, a big game in regional, and now in the world series. He has come up huge for us.”
The 16-year-old McEntire picked up the win in the winner-take-all state championship game giving up two runs in six innings, and after Bryant fell into the loser's bracket in the Mid-South Regional, McEntire pitched a complete nine-inning game for the win giving up just one earned run. McEntire had walked just two totals in the postseason before his two walks on Sunday, doing an excellent job of keeping the opponent off the base paths.
“That's what he's been doing and he did it again,” Hurt said. “We try not to give them free ones, walk anybody. He threw a complete, nine-inning game in regional and didn't walk anybody. He pounds the zone, mixes his pitches up and just keeps them off the bases.”
In fact, on Sunday, the only inning North Carolina made it past first base was the fifth when Peyton Williams tried to stretch his leadoff double into a triple, but Bryant's Alex Shurtleff did a great job of getting the ball in from right field, after slipping, throwing it to second baseman Seth Tucker, who relayed to Scott Schmidt at third for the tag out. McEntire walked the next man, but would induce two ground outs to get out of the inning unscathed.
“It wasn't like he threw a bad pitch on the double,” Hurt said. “He threw a pretty good pitch, the kid just had a good piece of hitting. That play for Shurtleff to get the ball back in to Tucker and Tucker threw the guy out at third, that kind of got Will pumped up and I don't think he did a good job of calming down quick enough and he walked the next guy. He settled back down and got a couple groundouts.”
Having plenty of chances to score early in the game, the Black Sox wouldn't get on the board until the top of the sixth when Tucker was hit by a pitch to start and Dylan Hurt singled to center. Shurtleff attempted to sacrifice bunt the runners over, yet was unsuccessful. But, Shurtleff did get the job done sending the runners to second and third on a ground out.
Jeff Stelling is nearing the end of the road on his marathon march for Prostate Cancer UK and today is looking forward to returning to his beloved Hartlepool United.
He is raising awareness and money to help beat the disease that affects one in eight men across the UK.
The March for Men group at Kidderminster Harriers.
The life-long Poolie is due at the re-named Victoria Park this evening and is hoping to be welcomed by lots of supporters.
Jeff is due to finish his challenge on Friday at Newcastle United's St James's Park after racking up a staggering 400 miles in just 15 days.
He said: “The carrot to get me to the end of the day is the fact that I'm finishing in Hartlepool.
“I think I'm performing the naming of the ground. It will be very good to be back.
“Last time I started from there so it is nice to know this time I will have only one more day to go.”
Jeff described the sponsorship deal with Hartlepool energy consultancy Utility Alliance, which will see the ground revert to Victoria Park, as “a great move”.
Jeff spent yesterday on a tour of non-league clubs as he and the team worked their way up through stunning Yorkshire countryside.
But he was feeling the heat as temperatures soared.
Among those from the footballing world walking alongside Jeff was Preston North End manager Simon Greyson and Match of the Day pundit Danny Mills.
Jeff said he has been buoyed by between 30 and 100 supporters every day.
“I couldn't do it myself,” he said. “If I can have a conversation with someone for 15 or 20 minutes there is another mile gone.
“I have had fantastic support. The public have been great. I have had a woman offer to give me £100 for a selfie.
“Last night in Bradford a homeless man actually gave us some of the money he had.”
Jeff has also been touched and inspired by countless personal stories from people about how prostate cancer had affected them.
He said: “Most of the people who have joined me have been recovering from prostate cancer or know someone who has it.
“Today I was joined by two people who have terminal prostate cancer.”
According to the walk's website, Jeff's efforts have so far helped to raise almost £240,000.
That is in addition to the £500,000 raised last year by walking 10 marathons in 10 days.
Despite the scale of the task, Jeff sad he is bearing up well.
“It has been mentally tougher,” he said. “After 10 days last time I was having a beer, putting my feet up and looking forward to a nice rest but this time I still had five days to go.
“Physically, it has been easier. I think I knew what to expect a bit more and that's been a big help.”
Jeff is due to arrive at Victoria Park at around 6pm on Thursday.

Mariah Carey is shaking off her failed New Year's Eve performance, while her team is insinuating that she was set up to fail by producers.
By now, you've likely seen or at least heard about the music icon's disastrous night in Times Square on Saturday night in NYC:
Carey failed to complete her planned performances for Ryan Seacrest's annual New Year's Rockin' Eve special, baffling viewers nationwide.
Her reaction, in her own words:
S–t happens, people!
“Have a happy and healthy new year everybody! Here's to making more headlines in 2017,” she added in a brief message to her Twitter fans.
Severe audio issues 86'd the performance, in which she was supposed to sing “Emotion,” “We Belong Together” and “Auld Lang Syne.”
Throughout the live gig, Carey told the crowd she couldn't hear through her earpiece, telling them she was still “trying to be a good sport.”
“We didn't have a [sound]check for this song, so we'll just say it went to number one,” she said, adding that the track was missing “some of the vocals.”

A man who was out on bond for attempted murder in Charleston County was re-arrested Thursday because drugs were found in the same car where he was a passenger.
Berkeley County deputies say Perry Raekwin Dashawn Jackson tried to run from a traffic stop when he discarded 1.47 pounds of a substance which tested positive for marijuana. More than $5,000 was also found in Jackson's pockets, the Berkeley County Sheriff's Office said.
Jackson's attempted murder charge stemmed from an incident on Sept. 23, 2015 in the county.

Most sunscreens will soon be banned in the sunny state of Hawaii.
On Tuesday, Governor David Ige signed a bill that bans sunscreens with the chemicals oxybenzone and octinoxate in an attempt to protect the coral reef that surrounds the island.
“This is just one small step toward protecting and restoring the resiliency of Hawaii's reefs,” Ige said at a signing ceremony for the bill, which takes effect in 2021.
“Two chemicals contained in many sunscreens, oxybenzone and octinoxate, have significant harmful impacts on Hawaii's marine environment and residing ecosystems, including coral reefs that protect Hawaii's shoreline,” the bill read.
READ MORE: The coral reef off of Samoan island is dying off, scientists say
The bill is largely based on a study by Craig Downs of the Haereticus Environmental Laboratory in Clifford, Va., which said the chemicals stunted the growth of coral and caused reproductive problems in fish.
Critics of the bill have said the science is weak, and that banning sunscreens will be detrimental to the health of Hawaiians' skin.
Jörg Wiedenmann, head of the Coral Reef Laboratory at the University of Southampton, told Nature in 2017 that there are many issues that contribute to the deaths of coral reefs.
“Banning sunscreen will not solve other problems: for example, temperature anomalies, overfishing, coral predators and the big issue of coastal runoffs that pollute and destroy reefs,” he said, according to Nature.
“But if you have places with a high load of tourists going in, it is not unreasonable to stay cautious and say, ‘Yes, there may be additive effects.”
WATCH: Local dermatologist weighs in on sunscreen and SPF levels
About 70 per cent of over-the-counter sunscreens contain at least one of the two chemicals, which filter out UV light and protect the skin from sunburns.
“The health, safety and welfare of millions of Hawaii residents and tourists has been severely compromised by the passage of SB 2571 … based on weak science blaming sunscreens for damage to coral reefs,” a release from the U.S. Consumer Healthcare Products Association said in May, when the bill passed state legislature.
“This irresponsible action will make it more difficult for families to protect themselves against the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays.”
(The bill allows an exception to those who have a prescription for the sunscreen.)
WATCH: Half of all Great Barrier Reef's coral has died since 2016
However, there are already sunscreen products that don't contain the chemicals affected by the ban.
Mineral-based sunscreens containing substances such as zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are permitted by the ban, and dermatologist Monica Li told Global News they are a very good alternative.
She says some of these mineral-based creams can be even more effective than their chemical counterparts, because the minerals block out the sun instead of filtering it.
That includes brands like TropicSport and Raw Elements, the New York Times reports.
The mineral-based sunscreens are widely available and apply clearly just like the chemical-based ones — they've come a long way from the creams of the past which were more solid in appearance.
Li says it's very important to continue using the alternatives to protect yourself from skin cancer and other diseases.
“Of course the same kind of parameters apply,” Li said. “The number at minimum should be 30 (SPF). Ideally 50 and higher, it should still be reapplied every two hours.”
WATCH: Oncologist shares how to identify skin cancer – and prevent it in the first place
She says to look for broad-spectrum sunscreen that protect from UVA and UVB rays, and if you're going into the water, you'll want to make sure the sunscreen is water resistant.
She also said that sunscreen is only one component in protecting yourself from the sun. Other methods include:
Wearing a large wide-brimmed hat,
wearing sunglasses,
wearing lose-fitting clothing with long sleeves,
seek shade during peak sunlight hours (11 a.m.-3 p.m.).
“Sunscreen is one element. It's not the only element, but it's very important element,” Li said.
Another alternative is to wear UV clothing; the Canadian Cancer society recommends that you look for clothes with a UV protection factor (UPF) of 15 or higher.

Since 2001, impact VC firms have raised $13 billion to invest in companies that provide a social or environmental benefit as part of running their for-large-profit business. Indeed, $10 billion of that has been raised since 2010 alone. Impact VCs are VCs first that intend to generate market-beating financial returns because of, not in spite of, an impact-oriented investment thesis.
To date, these impact VC funds have yet to be categorized as a venture trend. Too often they are mistakenly lumped in the general impact investing category, a very broad space of investors — from foundations to private equity to wealth management — that seek social or environmental impact, but for near-market, sub-market or even net-zero financial returns. Impact VCs focus on early-stage and mid-stage private businesses and most have institutional LPs that are expecting 3x or higher returns on their investments.
Similarly, the for-large-profit businesses in which they invest, which have been identified as a trend, do not have a consistent moniker that encompasses the whole sector. In the last 30 years, these companies have been called double-bottom line, triple-bottom line, ESG, social enterprise, benefit corporations, B Corps, profit-from-purpose and more, which are all relevant, but don't cover the whole category.
Of those, I prefer profit-from-purpose, as it makes clear there is a higher purpose to the company, but profit always comes first. However, if I could wave my wand and assign the sector a catch-name akin to fintech and SaaS, I would assign the name GoodBusiness to the sector of for-large-profit businesses that also provide a social or environmental benefit.
15 years of impact VC fundraises
I've prepared what I believe is the first comparison of all impact VC funds. It includes data on fund size, fund count and age, GPs, LPs, relevant investments and exits and the firms' mission statements. I include only funds investing in startups (seed to late-stage) for top-quartile returns that explicitly state their profit-from-purpose investing strategy and have a portfolio that is at least 50 percent invested in GoodBusiness.
Impact venture capital will not be overlooked or misunderstood for long.
While many traditional funds invest in businesses with social or environmental missions, if backing GoodBusiness companies is not their primary mission, I did not include them. Likewise, I did not include family funds, even those dedicated to impact, if it was not possible to extract what percent of the fund is dedicated to direct startup investments.
Impact venture capital will not be overlooked or misunderstood for long. DBL Partners (as in double-bottom line) created one of the earliest traditional impact VC funds in 2004, and has had big exits in Tesla, SolarCity, eMeter and OPX Bio, among others. Other investors have had healthy exits with 7th Generation, FLS Energy, Nest Labs, SolarBridge, 2U, Chariot, SKS Microfinance, Ujjivan Financial Services and more. This investment sector is also growing quickly; $3 billion in new funds (TPG Rise and Breakthrough Energy) were announced recently.
Broad-focus impact VC funds
Jeffrey Skoll's six-year-old Capricorn Investment Group is currently the sector behemoth, with more than $5 billion raised in 24 funds. Al Gore and David Blood's roughly $2 billion Generation Investment Management fund is very active in later-stage deals as part of their $12 billion private equity fund. Both are very broadly invested and have had some notable exits. Capricorn, notably, is a certified B Corp itself, making it, I believe, the financially largest B Corp in the world.
The sector started taking form, however, with the launch of a number of traditional VC-style firms whose total fund raises range between $100 and $900 million. Elevar Equity, LeapFrog Investments, Collaborative Fund, Obvious Ventures and Renewal Funds all invest broadly in GoodBusiness.
These funds invest from seed to late stage, and are standing in to back businesses much earlier in their trajectories than Capricorn or Generation. We should expect more fundraises and aggressive investing from this group, though some are still waiting on their first GoodBusiness exits. In the sub-$100 million categories, City Light Capital, Vast Ventures, Better Ventures, Radicle Impact and Pi Investments (part of a family fund) also are making broad sector investments.
Founder/LP funds
The hardest impact VC to pin down is where the founders are the sole LPs. They tend to be discreet about fund totals, are unrestricted in how they use their money and are unconcerned about future fundraisers.
Omidyar Network is the oldest and most well-known. They allocate their funds for a spectrum of financial returns, ranging from commercial (VC returns) to sub-commercial (impact investing) to outright charitable donations. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative will be doing the same, but is expected to eventually have $45 billion in funds, enough to possible transform entire ecosystems.
Millennial and modern shoppers have high expectations for the companies they patronize.
Laurene Powell Jobs' new Emerson Collective hasn't exposed how they'll be using her $20 billion net worth (so they're not included in my analysis), but have stated commitments to supporting entrepreneurs creating positive social change. Kapor Capital is a dedicated VC fund that works closely with their Kapor Center for Social Impact. Freada Kapor Klein is very clear about how they leverage the Kapor Center to guide the Kapor Capital investment team to determine which potential investments targeting America's underrepresented STEM students and entrepreneurs will have the most commercial potential.
The enhanced VC opportunity for these funds is that if you can catalyze change on first-order problems using donation dollars, you're ideally positioned to reap financial returns by backing the entrepreneurs and businesses that will best serve newly opened marketplaces.
Impact VC sub-sectors
The largest industry sub-sector centers around protecting the earth's environment. Reducing or reversing climate change, alternative energy and resources, improving water quality and access, decreasing waste and improving the food system are embraced by many funds. Breakthrough Energy, a new billion-dollar fund backed by a who's who of tech billionaires, is focused exclusively on alternative energy solutions. Another estimated $300+ million has been raised by Closed Loop Fund (recycling), Prelude Ventures (climate change), EFW Partners (energy, food, water) and Closed Loop Capital (food and agriculture).
Another $1.25 billion is dedicated for businesses serving the billion people forecast to enter the middle class in emerging markets this decade. LeapFrog Ventures, Elevar Equity, Gray Ghost Ventures and Khosla Impact are focused on large frontier markets opportunities. For two years I served as COO of Tala, a rapidly growing mobile-based financial service provider targeting the underserved in emerging markets. I experienced firsthand how fast a business can grow by smartly offering fair and convenient services to people who have been mistreated or ignored entirely by existing providers. This sector will achieve exceptional returns because of the combination of massive markets and a relative dearth of investment capital.
There's also a growing sub-sector of businesses providing high-value products in Western economies. These funds are confident that millennial and modern shoppers have high expectations for the companies they patronize. They want to know management is ethical, employees are treated well, supply chains are clean of exploitation and that the environment is respected in the creation of their product.
Patagonia, 7th Generation, Ben & Jerry's and Dansko are all showing, it pays to be a B Corp. Both TOMS Social Entrepreneurship Fund and Patagonia's Tin Shed Ventures have grown out of ethically minded B Corps and invest in early- and mid-stage GoodBusiness consumer-focused startups. Core Innovation Capital is focused on providing fair and trustworthy financial services, a sector historically known for deceptive pricing, unethical management and bad customer service. Fledge is the first B Corp-oriented accelerator.
The newest and smallest sub-sector is focused on good governance and supporting unrepresented founders and entrepreneurs. Village Capital, Impact America Fund and Backstage Capital are all seeking out and supporting businesses that are often overlooked by traditional VC. From their perspective, their investing is the impact. They seek to jump-start new classes of business people that will transform society by opening new opportunities for more unrepresented business leaders in the years to come.
What's next?
The concurrent global trends of handheld internet connectivity, digital money and wallets, socio-economic turmoil as we exit the Industrial Age, global climate change, rapid population growth, broadening financial inequality and the rise of the global middle class will continue to expose social and environmental problems and opportunities that will allow for different types of businesses than industrial capitalism created. Elon Musk is the most admired leader in technology. Unilever is rumored to become the world's largest publicly traded B Corp. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative shows that investing LLCs, not charitable foundations, are how billionaires will give back.
Even Dick Cheney can see the relentless innovation in alternative energies is going to swamp carbon-based industrial in our lifetimes. And even a factory worker can see that robotics, automation and AI are going to decimate a once-reliable job sector, while climate change may affect many others.
Funds that back the alternative energy trends, alternatives to natural resource extraction and improved agriculture will all do well. Funds that back products and services for the large underserved classes will do well. Funds that focus on creating the job sectors of the future will do very well.
While I expect many of the above impact VC funds to expand and raise more funds, and I expect more funds to arrive globally, I expect dedicated sector expansion will slow in 10-15 years. The change will come when traditional VC funds expand their investment theses to include GoodBusiness, and raise funds and bring on partners to focus just on that.
While President Trump's buy-American, pro-fossil fuel, pro-heavy industry, anti-science and climate-denial platform will get the short-term attention, there is no stopping the global trends I listed above. Now's the time to invest in the long game.

Philadelphia rapper Meek Mill has been released on bail after an order from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.
The announcement of his freedom was made by 76ers co-owner Michael Rubin, a close advocate of the rapper as he went through the process of his appeal.
Meek Mill is expected to attend the 76ers game tonight in Philadelphia, and will likely ring the ceremonial pregame bell should he make it to the arena on time.
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ordered that Philadelphia rapper Meek Mill be released Tuesday on bail, and it looks likely that he'll be spending his first night out with the Philadelphia 76ers as they take on the Miami Heat in Game 5 of the first round of the NBA Playoffs.
His release was announced by 76ers co-owner Michael Rubin, who took to Instagram to share the good news.
Not only did Rubin say he was heading to pick him up, but he added that he would be in attendance at the Wells Fargo Center as the Sixers attempted to close out their series with the Miami Heat.
Meek Mill had been serving a 2-4 year sentence for violating his probation, leading to many in the local community to call for his release, arguing the punishment far outweighs his crime. Since his initial sentencing, Meek had found allies across the sports world, both amongst Philadelphia sports icons and even including some unlikelier names like New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft.
Upon his release, Meek Mill expressed gratitude for all of those who had worked on his behalf.
With a chance to secure their first playoff series win since the dawn of the "Trust the Process" era, and Meek Mill finally back in the building, Philadelphia will be rocking tonight.

Down 8-3, Francisco Lindor connects on a grand slam off the foul pole that brings Cleveland within one. (0:47)
CLEVELAND -- Life in October was never going to be as easy as the Cleveland Indians made it look in August and September. After winning 33 of their last 37 regular-season games, they were due for some regression here and a little dose of reality there.
But did they really have to pack so much bad news into the span of an hour?

Flush with excitement after Trevor Bauer's dominant performance in the opening game of the American League Division Series, the Indians watched two main roster cogs crash-land in the first three innings in Game 2.
First, Edwin Encarnacion, their cleanup hitter and home run leader, suffered an ankle injury that put the rest of his season in serious jeopardy. Then, staff ace Corey Kluber surrendered more earned runs (six) in 2 2/3 innings than he'd allowed in the entire month of September (four).
But the Indians summoned the resilience to get the job done. They won Friday after taking advantage of a questionable managerial decision by Joe Girardi and what appeared to be a missed hit by pitch in a dreadful sixth inning for the Yankees. With two outs, reliever Chad Green faced pinch-hitter Lonnie Chisenhall, who fell behind 0-2. After four foul balls, it was ruled that Chisenhall was hit by a pitch. Replays showed that it may have just hit the knob of Chisenhall's bat and Gary Sanchez caught the ball. If the Yankees had challenged, that would have likely been the third out -- and perhaps the ballgame. Instead, Francisco Lindor launched a grand slam off the foul pole to cut an 8-3 deficit to 8-7, and Jay Bruce hit a solo shot off David Robertson to tie it in the eighth as a sellout crowd at Progressive Field erupted.
Then came the capper a few innings later: Yan Gomes' single down the third-base line off Dellin Betances in the bottom of the 13th gave the Indians a 9-8 victory and a 2-0 ALDS lead as the best-of-five series heads to the Bronx.
“I'm speechless, man. It was a full-on team effort,” Gomes said during a postgame interview on MLB Network.
“I'm pretty sure I swung at a ball that was going to hit me. That's how bad I wanted to get it done,” Gomes said of the game-winning single. “I've never choked up that much on the bat. I was just trying to get the job done, just move the guy over and just pass the bat around and just let somebody else do it.”
The Indians' euphoria from a come-from-behind win against the Yankees' vaunted bullpen was tempered by concern over their big middle-of-the-order slugger. Encarnacion rolled his ankle while stepping on second base in the first inning and crumpled to the ground in pain. He left the field with help from the training staff, and the in-game reports weren't good.
ESPN's Buster Olney tweeted that Encarnacion was on crutches and in a walking boot as he left the clubhouse and got into a cart before leaving the ballpark. Against that backdrop, the likelihood of him returning to the lineup anytime soon appears extremely remote.

Still, the Indians' victory ensures the series would return to a Game 5 in Cleveland next week. In the meantime, they'll try to polish off the Yankees in either Game 3 or 4 in New York.

GUATEMALA CITY – Researchers using a high-tech aerial mapping technique have found tens of thousands of previously undetected Mayan houses, buildings, defence works and pyramids in the dense jungle of Guatemala‘s Peten region, suggesting that millions more people lived there than previously thought.
The discoveries, which included industrial-sized agricultural fields and irrigation canals, were announced Thursday by an alliance of U.S., European and Guatemalan archaeologists working with Guatemala's Mayan Heritage and Nature Foundation.
The study estimates that roughly 10 million people may have lived within the Maya Lowlands, meaning that kind of massive food production might have been needed.
“That is two to three times more (inhabitants) than people were saying there were,” said Marcello A. Canuto, a professor of Anthropology at Tulane University.
Researchers used a mapping technique called LiDAR, which stands for Light Detection And Ranging. It bounces pulsed laser light off the ground, revealing contours hidden by dense foliage.

The images revealed that the Mayans altered the landscape in a much broader way than previously thought; in some areas, 95 per cent of available land was cultivated.
“Their agriculture is much more intensive and therefore sustainable than we thought, and they were cultivating every inch of the land,” said Francisco Estrada-Belli, a Research Assistant Professor at Tulane University, noting the ancient Mayas partly drained swampy areas that haven't been considered worth farming since.
And the extensive defensive fences, ditch-and-rampart systems and irrigation canals suggest a highly organized workforce.
“There's state involvement here, because we see large canals being dug that are re-directing natural water flows,” said Thomas Garrison, Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Ithaca College in New York.
The 810 square miles (2,100 square kilometres) of mapping done vastly expands the area that was intensively occupied by the Maya, whose culture flourished between roughly 1,000 BC and 900 AD. Their descendants still live in the region.
The mapping detected about 60,000 individual structures, including four major Mayan ceremonial centres with plazas and pyramids.

Garrison said that this year he went to the field with the LiDAR data to look for one of the roads revealed. “I found it, but if I had not had the LiDAR and known that that's what it was, I would have walked right over it, because of how dense the jungle is.”
Garrison noted that unlike some other ancient cultures, whose fields, roads and outbuildings have been destroyed by subsequent generations of farming, the jungle grew over abandoned Maya fields and structures, both hiding and preserving them.
“In this the jungle, which has hindered us in our discovery efforts for so long, has actually worked as this great preservative tool of the impact the culture had across the landscape,” noted Garrison, who worked on the project and specializes in the city of El Zotz, near Tikal.
LiDAR revealed a previously undetected structure between the two sites that Garrison says “can't be called anything other than a Maya fortress.”
“It's this hill-top citadel that has these ditch and rampart systems … when I went there, one of these things in nine meters tall,” he noted.
In a way, the structures were hiding in plain sight.
“As soon as we saw this we all felt a little sheepish,” said Canuto said of the LiDAR images, “because these were things that we had been walking over all the time.”
BANNU: General Officer Commanding (GOC) Maj-Gen Hassan Azhar Hayat has told that the army will collaborate with political administration to retrieve 942 misused girls schools of North Waziristan Agency that influential people had turned into their personal hujras.
He said that these schools will soon be ready for the girls and they would go to these schools as they are supposed to. He urged elders not to repeat past mistakes and provide learning environment to their children.
Gen Hayat said security forces and people of North Waziristan had rendered matchless sacrifices for restoration of peace in the tribal agency which was considered hub of terrorism across the world.
He said the army would play its role for maintenance of peace in the area.
DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - The chief minister of Germany's state of North Rhine-Westphalia has been elected to the board of the foundation that is the largest shareholder in engineering group ThyssenKrupp (TKAG.DE), it said on Monday.

The election for a seven-year term of Armin Laschet, from Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, comes as ThyssenKrupp seeks to diversify away from its traditional focus on steel.
“The membership is not tied to the position of chief minister. It is the individual who is elected, as with all other members,” the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation said in a statement.
The foundation controls more than 20 percent in ThyssenKrupp, which has agreed to merge its steel operations with those of India's Tata Steel (TISC.NS) and is focusing on growth areas like elevators and auto components.
Labour leaders have urged the state government to take a more active interest in ThyssenKrupp to minimise possible job losses that may result from the steel merger.
The state's previous chief minister, Social Democrat Hannelore Kraft, was a member of the Krupp foundation board but stood down after losing an election in May.
One woman was taken to hospital on Monday after a house fire in the community of Glendale.
Emergency crews were called to the 2200 block of 38 Street S.W. at around 1 a.m.
A woman living in the home was able to get out safely before firefighters arrived at the scene and was taken to hospital as a precaution.

Neighbouring homes were evacuated as firefighters doused the flames.
Crews were able to quickly extinguish the fire, limiting its damage to the house where it originated. A spokesperson for the Calgary Fire Department (CFD) told Global News the fire caused significant damage to the basement and main level of the home.
The cause of the fire is under investigation.
A self-driving vehicle made by Uber has struck and killed a pedestrian. It's the first such incident and will certainly be scrutinized like no other autonomous vehicle interaction in the past. But on the face of if it's hard to understand how, short of a total system failure, this could happen when the entire car has essentially been designed around preventing exactly this situation from occurring.
Something unexpectedly entering the vehicle's path is pretty much the first emergency event that autonomous car engineers look at. The situation could be many things — a stopped car, a deer, a pedestrian — and the systems are one and all designed to detect them as early as possible, identify them, and take appropriate action. That could be slowing, stopping, swerving, anything.
Uber's vehicles are equipped with several different imaging systems which work both ordinary duty (monitoring nearby cars, signs, and lane markings) and extraordinary duty like that just described. No less than four different ones should have picked up the victim in this case.
Top-mounted lidar. The bucket-shaped item on top of these cars is a lidar, or light detection and ranging, system that produces a 3D image of the car's surroundings multiple times per second. Using infrared laser pulses that bounce off objects and return to the sensor, lidar can detect static and moving objects in considerable detail, day or night.
Heavy snow and fog can obscure a lidar's lasers, and its accuracy decreases with range, but for anything from a few feet to a few hundred feet, it's an invaluable imaging tool and one that is found on practically every self-driving car.
The lidar unit, if operating correctly, should have been able to make out the person in question, if they were not totally obscured, while they were still more than a hundred feet away, and passed on their presence to the “brain” that collates the imagery.
Front-mounted radar. Radar, like lidar, sends out a signal and waits for it to bounce back, but it uses radio waves instead of light. This makes it more resistant to interference, since radio can pass through snow and fog, but also lowers its resolution and changes its range profile.
Depending on the radar unit Uber employed — likely multiple in both front and back to provide 360 degrees of coverage — the range could differ considerably. If it's meant to complement the lidar, chances are it overlaps considerably, but is built more to identify other cars and larger obstacles.
The radar signature of a person is not nearly so recognizable, but it's very likely they would have at least shown up, confirming what the lidar detected.
Short and long-range optical cameras. Lidar and radar are great for locating shapes, but they're no good for reading signs, figuring out what color something is, and so on. That's a job for visible-light cameras with sophisticated computer vision algorithms running in real time on their imagery.
The cameras on the Uber vehicle watch for telltale patterns that indicate braking vehicles (sudden red lights), traffic lights, crossing pedestrians, and so on. Especially on the front end of the car, multiple angles and types of camera would be used, so as to get a complete picture of the scene into which the car is driving.
Detecting people is one of the most commonly attempted computer vision problems, and the algorithms that do it have gotten quite good. “Segmenting” an image, as it's often called, generally also involves identifying things like signs, trees, sidewalks and more.
That said, it can be hard at night. But that's an obvious problem, the answer to which is the previous two systems, which work night and day. Even in pitch darkness, a person wearing all black would show up on lidar and radar, warning the car that it should perhaps slow and be ready to see that person in the headlights. That's probably why a night-vision system isn't commonly found in self-driving vehicles (I can't be sure there isn't one on the Uber car, but it seems unlikely).
Safety driver. It may sound cynical to refer to a person as a system, but the safety drivers in these cars are very much acting in the capacity of an all-purpose failsafe. People are very good at detecting things, even though we don't have lasers coming out of our eyes. And our reaction times aren't the best, but if it's clear that the car isn't going to respond, or has responded wrongly, a trained safety driver will react correctly.
Worth mentioning is that there is also a central computing unit that takes the input from these sources and creates its own more complete representation of the world around the car. A person may disappear behind a car in front of the system's sensors, for instance, and no longer be visible for a second or two, but that doesn't mean they ceased existing. This goes beyond simple object recognition and begins to bring in broader concepts of intelligence such as object permanence, predicting actions, and the like.
It's also arguably the most advance and closely guarded part of any self-driving car system and so is kept well under wraps.
It isn't clear what the circumstances were under which this tragedy played out, but the car was certainly equipped with technology that was intended to, and should have, detected the person and caused the car to react appropriately. Furthermore, if one system didn't work, another should have sufficed — multiple failbacks are only practical in high stakes matters like driving on public roads.
We'll know more than Uber, local law enforcement, federal authorities, and others investigate the accident.
APRIL 24, 2018 — Rolls-Royce has signed a contract to deliver ship design and an extensive range of equipment to a 70 m long stern trawler to be built for Olympic Seafood based in Fosnavåg, Norway.
The vessel is to be built by Turkey's Cemre Shipyard. The shipbuilding contract includes an option for a second vessel of the same type for Olympic Seafood.
Shipowner Stig Remøy, said: "This is a new and modern generation of trawler. The planning and design has been conducted under the headline smarter, greener and safer. Low energy consumption and reduced emissions make the concept a perfect fit for our strategy of sustainable ocean harvesting. Rolls-Royce has played a central role in the development of our new ship."
The vessel will be of type NVC 370 with a low resistant hull design that meets increased demands for fuel efficiency combined with good sea keeping.
Monrad Hide, Rolls-Royce, Vice President Sales, said: "It's a pleasure working with ambitious shipping owners such as Stig Remøy and his team. We've designed a highly efficient trawler that will be equipped with a package of power and propulsion, electrical and automation systems that will deliver benefits to both the owner and the environment, as well as safety and good working conditions for the crew."
The equipment to be delivered by Rolls-Royce includes a Bergen B33:45 diesel engine as part of a hybrid propulsion system that can deliver both mechanical and diesel-electric drive to the vessel's Promas integrated rudder and propeller system. A Hybrid Shaft Generator (HSG) ensures optimum propeller and engine efficiency by running both at their most efficient point.
Rolls-Royce deliveries will also include its latest deck winches, driven by a permanent magnet electric motor.
The new vessel is designed for bottom trawling as well as pelagic trawling. It will have a modern factory deck arrangement to handle and freeze both white fish and shrimp and ensure a high quality catch.
The vessel is expected to be delivered from the shipyard in 2020.
U.S. President Donald Trump expressed his “deepest sympathies” to Canadians on Tuesday morning in the wake of the fatal van attack in Toronto that left 10 people dead and 15 others injured.
Trump was speaking in front of the White House with French President Emmanuel Macron by his side during an arrival ceremony in Washington.

“I also want to express our deepest sympathies to the Canadian people following the horrendous tragedy in Toronto that claimed so many innocent lives,” Trump said.
“Our hearts are with the grieving families in Canada.”
The condolence comes after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also spoke with media Tuesday morning, calling the deadly rampage “horrific” and “senseless,” adding all Canadians stand with Toronto.
The attack happened Monday around 1:30 p.m. ET when a man drove a white rental van down a busy stretch of sidewalk on Yonge Street in the city's north end. Witnesses on scene described the van as “deliberately” hitting people on the sidewalk.
Toronto police have arrested 25-year-old Alek Minassian in the incident; he has been charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder.
Trump isn't the only politician to reach out to Canada following the attack.

Charlottesville, Va. — The young man accused of plowing a car into a crowd of people protesting a white supremacist rally was fascinated with Nazism, idolized Adolf Hitler, and had been singled out by school officials in the 9th grade for his “deeply held, radical” convictions on race, a former high school teacher said Sunday.
James Alex Fields Jr. also confided that he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia when he was younger and had been prescribed an anti-psychotic medication, Derek Weimer said in an interview with the Associated Press.
In high school, Fields was an “average” student, but with a keen interest in military history, Hitler, and Nazi Germany, said Weimer, who said he was Fields' social studies teacher at Randall K. Cooper high school in Union, Kentucky, in Fields' junior and senior years.
“Once you talked to James for a while, you would start to see that sympathy toward Nazism, that idolization of Hitler, that belief in white supremacy,” Weimer said. “It would start to creep out.”
Police charged Fields with second-degree murder and other counts for allegedly driving his silver Dodge Challenger through a crowd of protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday, killing a 32-year-old woman and wounding at least 19 others. A Virginia State Police helicopter deployed in a large-scale police response to the violence then crashed into the woods outside of town. Both troopers on board died.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced late Saturday that federal authorities would pursue a civil rights investigation into the circumstances surrounding the crash. The violence and deaths in Charlottesville “strike at the heart of American law and justice,” Sessions wrote.
Fields, 20, had been photographed hours earlier carrying the emblem of Vanguard America, one of the hate groups that organized the “take America back” campaign in protest of the removal of a Confederate statue. The group on Sunday denied any association with the suspect, even as a separate hate group that organized Saturday's rally pledged on social media to organize future events that would be “bigger than Charlottesville.”
The mayor of Charlottesville, political leaders of all political stripes, and activists and community organizers around the country planned rallies, vigils and education campaigns to combat the hate groups.
Weimer said Fields left school for a while, and when he came back he was quieter about politics until his senior year, when politicians started to declare their candidacy for the 2016 presidential race. Weimer said Fields was a Trump supporter because of what he believed to be Trump's views on race.
As a senior, Fields wanted to join the army, and Weimer, a former officer in the Ohio National Guard, guided him through the process of applying, he said, believing the military would expose Fields to people of different races and backgrounds and help him dispel his white supremacist views. But he was ultimately turned down, which was a big blow, Weimer said.
“The Army can confirm that James Alex Fields reported for basic military training in August of 2015,” said Army spokeswoman Lt. Col. Jennifer Johnson. “He was, however, released from active duty due to a failure to meet training standards in December of 2015.”
Fields' mother, Samantha Bloom, told the AP late Saturday that she knew her son was going to Virginia for a political rally, but she had no idea it involved white supremacists.
“I just told him to be careful,” she said, adding she warned him that if there were protests “to make sure he's doing it peacefully.”
In a photo taken by the New York Daily News, Fields was shown standing Saturday with a half-dozen other men, all wearing the Vanguard America uniform of khakis and white polo shirts. The men held white shields with Vanguard America's black-and-white logo of two crossed axes. The Confederate statue of Robert E. Lee was in the background.
The Daily News said the photo was taken about 10:30 a.m. just hours before authorities say Fields crashed his car into the crowd at 1:42 p.m. The Anti-Defamation League says Vanguard America believes the U.S. is an exclusively white nation, and uses propaganda to recruit young white men online and on college campuses.
In a Twitter post, the group said it had handed out the shields “to anyone in attendance who wanted them,” and denied Fields was a member. “All our members are safe an (sic) accounted for, with no arrests or charges.”
In blog posts after the violence, the Daily Stormer, a leading white nationalist website that promoted the Charlottesville event, pledged to hold more events “soon.”
Saturday's chaos erupted as neo-Nazis, skinheads, Ku Klux Klan members and other white supremacist groups arrived for the rally. Counter-protesters were also on hand, and the two sides clashed, with people throwing punches, hurling water bottles and unleashing chemical sprays. Officials have not provided a crowd estimate but it appeared to number well over 1,000.
Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency, police in riot gear ordered people out of the streets, and helicopters circled overhead. Then, as the counter-protesters marched a few blocks from the statue, the Dodge Challenger tore into the crowd, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer as she was crossing the street.
Hours later, the helicopter crashed, killing two state police troopers, Lieutenant H. Jay Cullen, 48, and Berke M.M. Bates, one day shy of his 41st birthday.
Red Wings decry logo use
The Detroit Red Wings are decrying the use of their logo by some participants in a white supremacist rally in Virginia.
“The Detroit Red Wings vehemently disagree with and are not associated in any way with the event taking place today in Charlottesville, Va.,” the organization said Saturday in a statement on social media. “The Red Wings believe that hockey is for everyone and we celebrate the great diversity of our fan base and our nation.”
The organization said it is exploring legal action against those misusing the logo.
Photos on social media were being shared widely Saturday of groups that had appropriated the logo during the protest. Some altered the spokes in the winged wheel in a way reminiscent of the Nazi SS logo.
The groups and individuals involved were not immediately identified. However, their logo matches one posted by a group called the Detroit Right Wings on Twitter. The group joined Twitter in July. Another group called the Muskegon Minutemen also uses the altered logo on Twitter.
The National Hockey League said it would take “immediate and all necessary steps to insure the use is discontinued as promptly as possible, and will vigorously pursue other remedies, as appropriate.”

A Dunstable businessman wants to screen the remaining England World Cup matches by creating a fan zone in Grove Park, but faces police opposition.
England dramatically beat Colombia on penalties in their round of 16 game in Russia last night (Tuesday).
Now HQ Sports Bar wants to fence off an area in the park to screen Saturday's quarter-final against Sweden, as well as the semi-final and final/third place play-off should Gareth Southgate's team progress.
But Beds Police are opposed to the idea fearing there will be public safety issues.
Jamie Head, of HQ Sports Bar has applied for a temporary event notice for the fan zone which would be opposite the venue. A large screen would be put up, along with an outside bar.
His application is due to be heard by members of Central Bedfordshire Council's licensing sub-committee on Thursday (June 5).
The police object to the proposal based on the prevention of crime and disorder, as well as public nuisance and the protection of children from harm.
The local authority's environmental health officer has also objected citing the prevention of public nuisance.

In 2013, the NDP won by 909 votes (47.1 per cent to 36.6 per cent).
Technically, it's slightly outside the 10 pere cent rule, but it's not a very populated riding (less than 9,000 people voted in 2013) so it doesn't take much of a shift for this riding to swing one way or the other. Doug Donaldson, the NDP MLA, has the incumbent's edge but it's still usually close.
In 2009, the NDP's Doug Donaldson won this riding over BC Liberal Scott Groves by 465 votes (50 per cent to 45 per cent).
History & Geography: The largest riding in size and smallest in population, Stikine spans the often barren northwest section of the province. Smithers in the only major town in the riding, but Dease Lake, Stewart, Telkwa and Atlin are also small population centres. The riding was known as Atlin from 1903 to 1991, but had to be drastically expanded to the south after consistent complaints its population was not large enough to merit an entire seat. The riding has gone to the NDP 13 out of the last 16 elections, with the Liberals doing the best in and around Smithers, and the NDP doing best in the rest of the province.
Candidates
BC Liberals – Wanda Good: Deputy Chief Councillor of Gitanyow. Recently, she has been working to secure bus service connecting Prince George and Prince Rupert along the ‘Highway of Tears'. One of three indigenous candidates being highlighted by the BC Liberals.
NDP-Doug Donaldson: First elected in 2009, in 2016 Donaldson was named the NDP critic on Energy and Mines. Previously a four-term councillor in Hazelton.

"Lightning Bolt" and "Sunny," the two loggerhead sea turtles who have spent the past eight months recovering at a New England Aquarium hospital, will soon return to open ocean.
The sea turtles, weighing 50 and 70 pounds, were found in dire health conditions on Cape Cod shores last December. The New England Aquarium says the turtles were suffering life-threatening bouts of hypothermia, as well as dangerous dehydration, pneumonia, and emaciation.
Since the rescue in December, Lightning Bolt and Sunny were rehabilitated at a sea turtle hospital in Quincy managed by the aquarium. This year, as part of the aquarium's annual theme for naming its new animal-patients, the two sea turtles were named for weather-related terms. The loggerhead turtles are an endangered species.
Last Thursday, the pair were examined. In a statement, the NEAQ said the turtles had gained 40 percent more body weight over the past eight months.
The turtles will be released into Cape Cod waters sometime over the next two weeks, possibly with satellite tags attached to their hard shells. The aquarium says the devices help scientists gather valuable data, such as where the turtles travel and how they live in their habitats.
According to the Cape Cod Times, the loggerheads will be placed off of West Dennis, instead of Cape Cod Bay, the warm-water spot where young sea turtles migrate to in the summer. Some sea turtles have trouble migrating back to warmer waters during the fall, and end up trapped in freezing New England winter conditions.
The New England Aquarium is currently showing a film at its IMAX theatre that explores the process behind rescuing and rehabilitating sea turtles discovered along Cape Cod.
If you thought 21 Savage performing on Ellen was weird, I raise you Parquet Courts.
The violent image 21 projects on record might clash with the family-friendly aesthetic Ellen DeGeneres is known for, but his appearance made sense in at least one way: He's tabloid-famous due to dating Amber Rose. That fame trumps whatever cognitive dissonance is inspired by watching DeGeneres chitchat with the guy who once rapped that he'd “pull up on you, tie your kids up/ Pistol whip you while your bitch naked.” Still, that sure was a lot of cognitive dissonance, huh?
And yet Parquet Courts on Ellen might be even stranger. To my knowledge, the New York indie-rockers have never recorded anything quite as transgressive as “Dunk right in your bitch like O'Neal, dog/ I shoot like, shoot like Reggie Mill', dog/ Chopper sting you like a eel, dog,” but they're still obscure enough by mainstream standards that it's pretty funny to think of them gracing the Ellen stage. I guess that Danger Mouse connection goes a long way because here they are performing the title track from their new album Wide Awake! on today's broadcast, joined by a whole slew of buddies.
It's a real party-starter! Or as the show's promotional team puts it: “The band is here to perform one of Ellen's favorite songs, ‘Wide Awake,' and it's guaranteed to get you moving and grooving!” Watch below.
Wide Awake! is out 5/18 on Rough Trade. Pre-order it here.

Family, friends and community members came together Monday evening to remember a young man fatally shot in Halifax a year ago.
Tyler Richards, 29, was found dead inside a home in the 6900-block of Cook Avenue on April 17, 2016.
For those who knew Richards, there's only one word to describe the past year: “Tough,” said longtime friend Michael Williams.
“Especially for certain occasions, when you know he'd normally be there that he's not there for. Community events and stuff like that. Certain days are harder than others. Definitely.”

Balloon release honours Richards
Richards was a former Halifax Rainmen basketball player.
He was a four-time AUS basketball all-star, who also previously played basketball at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, N.S., from 2004 to 2009 before joining the Rainmen.
On Monday, loved ones wrote notes to Richards on pieces of paper and tied them to balloons. They then counted down and released the balloons all at once.
The event took place in the community of Mulgrave Park, where a large mural of Richards stands, as a way to honour his memory.
Organizers say the balloon release is also a chance to raise awareness about violence in the Halifax Regional Municipality.

“The kids pick up a basketball and they think of him”
“I knew Tyler for over 20 years. We were really close. Me, Tyler and two friends of ours hung tight every day, just down on the steps where we had the mural put up. Just to remember him and all he's done for the community and in the community,” said Williams.
Williams hopes that Richards' legacy will include the things he did for the community of Mulgrave Park.
“The kids pick up a basketball and they think of him,” he said. “He had a program during the time of his passing so people put together something to finish out his program where they get to keep drill books and things like that, and they had a lot of his coaches finish off what he started with the youth. ”
“He [Richards] never asked for anything. He just did it because it was the thing to do,” said Williams. “If he was walking through and a kid had a basketball, he was right there. This is what you need to do, here's how you get better, but he always told them, ‘It means nothing if you don't buckle down and do your schoolwork.'”
WATCH: Police working around the clock to solve recent Halifax homicides
Homicide case remains unsolved
No charges have been laid in connection with Richards' death. Police say the file remains open and is still being actively investigated, but investigators need help.
“Our biggest thing would be to reach out to the public and really ask for some assistance in the matter,” said Const. Phil Power of Halifax Regional Police.
“We do believe that there are pieces of information out there that the public do know that could be crucial in solving this homicide.”

Investigators have never publicly released any information regarding a suspect or suspects in connection with Richards' death.
However, police have confirmed that they found evidence related to Richards' homicide in a wooded area at the end of Mountain Avenue in Dartmouth.

Police need help solving case
Halifax police are asking anyone with information about the homicide of Tyler Richards to come forward. They say the smallest piece of information could make a big difference in solving the case.
“There are a number of different ways that people could reach out in the community and contact police. Obviously, Crime Stoppers is number one, either through telephone or online tips,” said Power. “The second way would be to contact a member of our investigative team, and of course, last but not least would be to reach out to one of the members of our community response team.”
Williams hopes that Richards' case will be solved soon. “Obviously, everyone needs closure and if there's no end to it, there's no closure, and no matter what we do to remember or anything, we're always searching for that closure,” he said.

While the conclusion of the Stanley Cup Playoffs is still close to two months away, the Anaheim Ducks' 2017-18 season is over after an embarrassing first-round sweep at the hands of the San Jose Sharks. Injuries and a number of systematic issues contributed to the Ducks' demise, so this offseason will be about looking for ways to rectify the latter.
Here are some potential paths the Ducks could consider venturing down in this unique and important offseason.
Ducks GM Murray Sheds Light on Future
Carlyle to Be Retained?
After a rough postseason that saw the Ducks win zero games and manage just four goals, starting by looking at bench boss Randy Carlyle is warranted. Given the way Anaheim spiraled out of control and completely lost its focus and poise for much of the series against San Jose, a culture change is something the organization might need to consider.
Nevertheless, all indications are that Carlyle will be back behind the bench for the Ducks next season. General manager Bob Murray is electing to take the view that the team overachieved given its injuries and first-half record. Murray was proud of how the Ducks rallied late in the year to not only secure a playoff spot, but also home-ice advantage in the first round as the No. 2 seed in the Pacific Division.
“In all honesty, I thought they did way better than I thought they were going to do. To get to where we finished, (tied for) eighth in the league in points, I never thought that.” -Ducks GM Bob Murray
That is indeed commendable and would be the completely correct takeaway even if the Ducks had lost a hard-fought first-round series with a decent showing. But the manner in which they were dismantled and embarrassed while failing to maintain their composure illuminated the need for the club to start fresh. They need to play a style that focuses less on physicality, retribution, and intimidation, and more on speed, skill, creativity, and mental toughness—something the Sharks shattered all too easily.
Ducks Need a New Style
Murray recognizes the importance of such a revamped style.
“We just played a team that was way faster than us,” Murray said on breakup day. “And they played the game faster than us.”
“Are Logan Couture and Joe Pavelski really fast skaters? Are they?” Murray asked, pointing out that team speed is not necessarily the same thing as individual player speed. “I had one of them in Team Canada. No. They're good hockey players. But if your team plays fast, you can make players faster. And that's the first thing that has to be addressed around here.”
Bringing in a new coach would be a huge initial step in making that change, but it does not seem as though Murray is ready to pull the trigger (even though he already has with respect to assistant coach Trent Yawney, who oversaw the team's defensemen). Carlyle has had a lot of success in the NHL, including a Stanley Cup championship in 2007 in his first stint with the Ducks. He also took the team to the Western Conference Final last season and thus seemed to be a good fit.
But things can change quickly. Now, it appears the Ducks are best suited to move in a new direction and completely redefine the way they play in the modern and ever-evolving NHL. The only hang-up is that Murray does not appear to be on board just yet with respect to a coaching change, even though he sees the need for the team to adopt a new systematic approach.
If Murray is not ready to relieve Carlyle of his coaching duties, he'll have to trust that Carlyle will demonstrate an ability to adapt. Then, even though Murray's comments about team speed versus individual speed seem to contradict the notion of a roster overhaul, he will inevitably have to make at least a few minor roster changes purely based on the realities of every offseason.
Ducks' Pending Free Agents
On the blue line, Anaheim will likely get younger on the bottom pair since veterans Francois Beauchemin and Kevin Bieksa are on their way out. Beauchemin, whose contract is up, has already announced his plans for retirement. The Ducks will also see Bieksa's bloated $4-million average annual value (AAV) come off the books. He saw limited action down the stretch and in the postseason, and his exit-interview comments all but confirmed that he will not return to Anaheim.
The team's remaining unrestricted free agents (UFAs) at the NHL level are Antoine Vermette, J.T. Brown, Derek Grant, and late-season acquisitions Chris Kelly and Jason Chimera. There is also goaltender Reto Berra, who spent most of the year in the AHL but filled in for the big club at times when John Gibson or Ryan Miller were nursing injuries. Forward Jared Boll, who eventually found himself in the minors after appearing in 10 games for the Ducks this season, is also a UFA.
It seems unlikely that the 35-year-old Vermette, whose playing time dwindled as the season wore on, will be brought back. Ditto for Kelly (37) and Chimera (38). These would be the right moves for a team that could use more youth.
Brown, 27, could be someone the Ducks consider retaining. Grant, 28, would seem less likely than Brown to return, even though he played the best hockey of his fragmented NHL career this year. Keeping him for additional depth, even if some of his action is in the minors, might be a nice insurance policy for a Ducks team that is no stranger to the injury bug. The 31-year-old Berra would also still provide value in the same role he had this season. Boll, on the other hand, should not be back.
Meanwhile, Ondrej Kase and Nick Ritchie, each 22 years old, are restricted free agents (RFAs). They are each due a raise from their entry-level contracts (ELCs), which Kase earned with an excellent, breakout season that saw him score 20 goals in 66 regular-season games.
Ritchie, the 10th overall pick in the 2014 NHL Entry Draft, also seemed primed for a breakout after a 28-point season (14 goals and 14 assists) in 2016-17. Alas, he was unable to build on that production, posting just 27 points (including only 10 goals) this season. He's still young, but given his lack of development this season and his proclivity for unnecessary minor penalties, he's someone the Ducks should possibly consider dangling in the trade market, especially as part of a package for a more established, left-shooting scoring winger if they do not acquire one in free agency (more on that in a bit). A trade of Ritchie might not have to happen this season, either. For him, a short-term bridge deal seems more appropriate than a long-term commitment at this point.
Potential New Faces for Ducks
Prospects Who Could Make the Jump
Assuming some of these departures become official, the Ducks will have some positions to fill but some cap space with which to play. At the conclusion of the regular season, the Ducks had about $3 million in cap space, even with the close-to-being-very-problematic expensive long-term contracts for Ryan Getlzaf, Corey Perry, and Ryan Kesler. Bieksa's contract coming off the books should negate the total increase from the raises for Kase and Ritchie, while the departures of Beauchemin and others, plus a presumed increase to the cap, would give Anaheim even more room.
Even with that space, the Ducks can first look to some internal candidates to fill some of their open spots. Troy Terry, who signed an entry-level contract with the Ducks right after his college season at the University of Denver, should also have an inside track at a roster spot after getting a quick taste of NHL action this season. Sam Steel, a 20-year-old center who has posted a combined 214 points in 120 games for the WHL's Regina Pats over the past two seasons, is ready to move on from junior hockey and could jump straight to the NHL to fill a bottom-six role. In addition, developing power-forward and Max Jones, 20, could be ready to challenge for a role with Anaheim. Steel and Jones were both late first-round picks of the Ducks in 2016, and now they might be on the cusp of cracking the NHL.
Defenseman Jacob Larsson seemed poised to challenge for a roster spot this season but ultimately did not make the cut. That was the beginning of what evolved into a trying season for one of Anaheim's top prospects—one where he saw several other AHLers get a chance with the injury-plagued Ducks before him. He was called up before Game 4 against the Sharks but did not suit up.
“It's been a lot of injuries this season,” said the 20-year-old Larsson, whose season was marred by a difficult recovery from knee surgery that took place about a year ago, in addition to other ailments along the way. “So it's been in and out all the time. I'm not really happy with the season and how it went. I just need to continue doing rehab. Hopefully I have a good summer and come back better next year.”
Next season presents a prime opportunity for Larsson to establish himself as a full-time NHLer. Perhaps, too, 24-year-old Andy Welinski will get more of a regular shot in the Ducks' lineup after seeing some action the postseason while Cam Fowler was sidelined with a shoulder injury. Marcus Pettersson also appears to be ready for a full-time gig after becoming a mainstay following his call-up in February. All of these players should have a legitimate chance to earn a third-pairing role behind top-four defenders Fowler, Hampus Lindholm, Josh Manson, and Brandon Montour.
Possible Free-Agent Targets
Beyond their in-house candidates, the Ducks could also look to supplement via free agency.
On defense, 28-year-old John Carlson will be the top player available unless he strikes a new deal with the Washington Capitals prior to hitting the open market on July 1. He'll command a major contract, likely north of $6.5 million per season over a long term, so that's probably not the type of move the Ducks need to be making at this stage. Beyond Carlson and 32-year-old Mike Green, though, most of the remaining defensemen on the market are depth players who would cost much more than any of the youngsters Anaheim could plug in for likely equal if not better efficacy.
Up front is where the Ducks might want to make a more notable UFA signing. James van Riemsdyk, who will be 29 by the time next season starts, is a solid left wing who is good for 25-30 goals a year and actually hit a career-high 36 this season. The Toronto Maple Leafs will likely be unable to afford him given their cap situation and need to lock up RFA William Nylander this offseason before Auston Matthews and Mitch Marner next offseason. van Riemsdyk will be coming off an AAV of $4.25 million, so he'll likely get a bit more than that on the open market, but he is the type of bigger-ticket player who would be a better fit for the Ducks right now than someone like Carlson.
Beyond van Riemsdyk, James Neal could be an interesting consideration if he gets to UFA status on July 1. So too could Josh Bailey of the New York Islanders, though it remains to be seen if he'll be as productive as he suddenly was this season if he is no longer playing alongside John Tavares (and before you ask, no, Tavares—the top pending UFA in this year's class—is likely not a viable option for the Ducks). Then there's Evander Kane, who the Ducks saw go to the San Jose Sharks at the trade deadline before he contributed to Anaheim's ugly postseason demise. He seems to be a good fit in San Jose, but if he does not re-sign there, he's someone for the Ducks to consider.
Other options who should prove to be more cost-effective include one-time Ducks David Perron (although he is another right-handed shot) and Patrick Maroon. Michael Grabner, Leo Komarov, and Antoine Roussel are also names the Ducks might look at, although the latter two are better characterized as agitators and energizers than true scoring threats.
Murray and the Ducks might not end up making a huge splash, but the inevitable turnover of players from this year's club should lead to a much-needed infusion of youth. That and an updated, speed-based style of play will be the keys to improvement for an Anaheim club that needs to be careful but purposeful with its decisions in order to remain a contender.

LIVERPOOL 1 EVERTON 1
Dec 10 (Reuters) - Everton captain Wayne Rooney scored for the first time in a Merseyside derby on Sunday with a late penalty to take an unlikely point in a 1-1 draw against Liverpool at Anfield.
With the snow swirling, Rooney sent the 77th-minute spot kick straight down the middle after Dominic Calvert-Lewin went down following a push in the back by Croatian defender Dejan Lovren.
Mohamed Salah had earlier fired Liverpool ahead with a 42nd-minute stunner that sent the Egyptian clear of Tottenham Hotspur's England striker Harry Kane as the league's top marksman with 13 goals this season.
Liverpool stayed fourth with 30 points, 13 adrift of leaders Manchester City who were playing later at second-placed Manchester United. Chelsea is third on 32 with Sam Allardyce's Everton moving up to 10th. (Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Toby Davis)
LAHORE: Spokesperson for Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) made an announcement on Sunday that to avoid engaging in political activities on the auspicious Independence Day, Nawaz Sharif would not be addressing a press conference on August 14.
The ousted Prime Minister had earlier said during Lahore's Dada Darbar address on August 12 to his party workers that he would soon reveal the future course-of-action of his party now that he had been disqualified by the Supreme Court in corruption charges.
The spokesperson said that the political party would consult other parties before Nawaz Sharif will be announcing party's agenda.
After the PM was disqualified on the basis of article 62,63 by the apex court, PML-N nominated former oil minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi as candidate for the premiership who was later elected Prime Minister in a National Assembly (NA) session with over 200 votes.
Abbasi had said multiple times after he was sworn in that policies of Nawaz Sharif would continue to prevail as according to him he ‘remains to be the premier of Pakistan'.
Heavenly Love proves too much for her rivals in the Grade 1, $400,000 Darley Alcibiades Stakes for 2-year-old fillies at Keeneland on October 6, 2017. (6:56)
LEXINGTON, Ky. -- It was supposed to be an evenly matched race among unknowns, but once the 10 2-year-old fillies in the Alcibiades turned for home Friday at Keeneland, Heavenly Love already had put it away.
Giving jockey Julien Leparoux and trainer Mark Casse their third and most important victory on opening day of the Keeneland fall meet, Heavenly Love stamped her ticket to the Breeders' Cup in emphatic fashion, winning the Grade 1, $400,000 Alcibiades by 5 1/2 lengths.
"She exploded [on the turn], but we still had some left," said Leparoux. "She's still a little baby, but she's a very nice filly."
Heavenly Love, bred and owned by Debby Oxley, returned $13.40 after finishing 1 1/16 miles in 1:45.32 over a fast track. The daughter of Malibu Moon was coming off a maiden victory last month at Kentucky Downs before putting forth a breakthrough effort that earned her an expenses-paid berth to the Nov. 4 BC Juvenile Fillies at Del Mar.
Casse was supposed to be here all day, but his morning flight out of Gainesville, Fla., was canceled, leaving assistant David Carroll to deputize.
"Awesome performance," said Carroll, who until last year trained his own stable for nearly 25 years. "She trained beautifully."
Earlier in the day, Casse and Leparoux teamed to win a pair of maiden special races with Gio Game ($5.60) and Magical Sky ($5.20).
On a mostly sunny day, and before an on-track crowd of 19,204, Heavenly Love sat a relaxed second as her stablemate, Dancing, set fractions of 23.94, 48.38, and 1:13.81. Midway through the final turn, Leparoux let his mount out a notch, and by the time the filly passed the furlong pole, she had a three-length lead en route to a decisive score.
The win was the second in Alcibiades history for Leparoux (Peace and War, 2014) and the third for Casse (Spring in the Air, 2012, and My Conquestadory, 2013). Debby Oxley's husband, John, was the owner of record of Spring in the Air.
Princess Warrior, a surprise 3-2 favorite off just a maiden sprint win at Churchill Downs last month, emerged best of the others when finishing second, another 1 1/2 lengths before Dancing. The Brad Cox pair of Sassy Sienna and Kelly's Humor were separated by just a head when fourth and fifth, respectively, and were followed in order Bet She Wins, Caroline the Great, Arabella Bella, Over Thinking, and Pacific Gale.
Kenny McPeek, trainer of Princess Warrior, said he was very encouraged by the filly's effort and said "there's a good chance" he will look to run the daughter of Midshipman back in the BC Juvenile Fillies. "This was just her second start, but she handles everything like she's an 8-year-old."
The $2 exacta (9-1) paid $48.80, the $1 trifecta (9-1-8) returned $171, and the 10-cent superfecta (9-1-8-10) was worth $112.48.

The Jungle Book pretty much has the Best Visual Effects Oscar in the bag this year, but Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them sure made a compelling case. While the Harry Potter prequel/spinoff failed to secure a nomination, the film's visual effects are nevertheless stunning, and a new VFX reel released online shows us just how extensive those effects were. It's somewhat shocking to see that shots I assumed were practical were actually 99% CG, and the bevy of adorable creatures that were crafted for the film are a stunning work of art.
I actually had the opportunity to visit the London set of Fantastic Beasts when it was filming in the fall of 2015, and I can attest that while the VFX work is indeed extensive, the practical effects and production design left me awestruck. They literally built almost an entire New York City block complete with store fronts, roads, etc.—and some of the stores were even built out so that the characters could walk inside. It's no wonder the film is a serious contender to win the Best Production Design Oscar.
But it's this marriage of opulent, tangible sets and a talented VFX team that makes the magic happen, and you'll see in the video below that the artistry involved in crafting not just CG buildings and backgrounds but entire characters and environments is impressive.

Peterborough Panthers have turned to a GB international rider to solve their injury woes.
Edward Kennett comes in as a replacement for Emil Grondal, who crashed heavily in Denmark last week with his recovery time unclear at this stage.
And with Bradley Wilson-Dean also on board to replace Nike Lunna, it means there will be something of a new look to the Panthers when they visit Glasgow in their next Championship fixture a week on Friday (June 8).
Promoter Ged Rathbone said: “Once again, this is a case of us needing to act due to injuries, and we weren't looking to make changes prior to Nike and then Emil getting hurt.
“But having been in touch with Emil since his crash, it's clear that he could be looking at longer than five or six weeks out, and we just can't afford to run with rider-replacement given the number of matches over that period.
“We have six matches in June and as we keep saying it's such a short season this year that if you have a bad run when you're not at full strength, it can virtually be season over.
“Edward is an experienced rider who had been looking for a Championship team place, and the opportunity was there to bring him in without disrupting the rest of the side, which is also important for us.
“I've explained the situation to Emil, who's done absolutely nothing wrong – it's simply a case of us feeling that a full team is very much the stronger option than doing at least six or seven matches, and possibly more than that, with rider-replacement.
“We'll continue to work with both Nike and Emil, and should they regain fitness prior to the transfer deadline then they have a chance of being put back in – and that should also keep everyone else on their toes.
“We wish them both all the best for their recoveries and we look forward to seeing them back at the East of England Arena soon.”
Kennett's home debut will come up against Glasgow on Sunday June 10, which is the first of three Alwalton fixtures in the month – also including the potentially vital Shield clash with Ipswich on June 17.
It is a break and enter that for the operators of Kelowna's Arion Therapeutic Farm call shocking.
It happened between Saturday night and Sunday morning when someone broke into the office trailer at the East Kelowna farm and stole a cash box filled with about $400.
Arion Farm is home to some 50 animals that provide therapy and healing to thousands of people of all ages every year, including children with autism and those living with disabilities. It also provides support to people struggling with mental health.
Officials say the theft is a set back.
“Our fee costs are huge we spend at least $2,500 a month in hay and that does not include vet costs, supplements, alternative health measures we do to help rehabilitate and maintain our animals,” operator Heather Henderson said.
But the community is responding. A Go Fund Me page has already been started and donations are pouring in.
Some of the money could be used to buy a surveillance camera.
The Iron probably had the more clear-cut chances throughout the game but could only manage the one, with Duane Holmes netting within two minutes after coming on as a substitute.
The first half was an entertaining affair and Scunthorpe had some great chances to go into the lead.
Josh Morris had a good shot saved by Josh Lillis, while the former Iron goalkeeper also denied Paddy Madden, when the Irishman pounced on a poor backpass.
Scunthorpe's Conor Townsend also should have done better when he put a close range free header over the bar, while Funso Ojo went close.
The Iron manager had called for the same after his side's 3-3 draw with Notts County in the Carabao Cup, despite netting three goals.
Alexander said he was satisfied with a point but just slightly frustrated that his side could only put away one of their chances.
“We needed a little bit of care in the final third,” he told the Telegraph. “We got into some great positions with a couple of overloads, as well as some great crossing and shooting positions.
“To have just one goal to show for it is a little frustrating.
“We are creating and getting opportunities and we know we can improve on those. If we weren't creating anything that would be the bigger issue.
“If we get that ruthlessness in front of goal and I know we will score goals.”
The 2017 Randox Health Grand National weights, framed and decided by the British Horseracing Authority's Head of Handicapping, Phil Smith, will be unveiled by 9.00pm this evening, Tuesday, February 14, at the famous Victoria & Albert Museum in London. A separate release will be sent to you detailing these weights at 9pm.
The Randox Health Grand National is the only handicap of the year where Smith has absolute discretion to deviate from the normal handicap ratings when determining the weights.
Smith has handicapped the Randox Health Grand National every year since 1999 and he explained how the class of the great race in 2017 is the highest ever.
He said today: “The percentage of horses rated over 135 entered in 2017 is 88 per cent, which is the highest ever. The previous highest percentage of horses in this category was 85 per cent.
“Significantly, the number of horses rated above 150 stands at a record level, with 34 horses falling into that category. If you go back a decade to 2007, there were only half that number (17) having a rating of 150 or higher at the time the weights were unveiled.
“The median rating for all entries in this year's Randox Health Grand National is 146, which again is the highest ever, and if you go back to 2007 it was 137.
“Last year, the lowest-weighted horse to get a run in the race was 59th on the list at the time the weights were unveiled.
“For years and years, horses in the mid-70s at the time of the weights managed to run on the day, while in 2015 it dropped to 67 and then 59 last year.
“I would be a bit surprised to see it as low as 59 again this year, but I would expect it to be somewhere in the 60s, especially as we know that a lot of the entries will be running between now and Aintree. Where exactly in the 60s is in the lap of the gods.
“The top of the handicap is dominated by Irish-trained horses, which is a symbol of the respective strength of Irish and UK Jump racing.
“When I get the entries, I have a train of thought and then something happens which means I have to change that. The race at Leopardstown on Sunday (Irish Gold Cup) had a big bearing on the weights. It was the crucial race, two days before the weights, which had a big effect on the top of the handicap.”

Researcher Michael Myng found a deactivated keylogger in a piece of software found on over 460 HP laptop models. A full list of affected laptops is here. The keylogger is deactivated by default but could represent a privacy concern if an attacker has physical access to the computer.
“Some time ago someone asked me if I can figure out how to control HP's laptop keyboard backlight,” wrote Myng. “I asked for the keyboard driver SynTP.sys, opened it in IDA, and after some browsing noticed a few interesting strings.”
The strings led to something that appeared to be a hidden keylogger – a program that sends typed characters to an attacker – in a Synaptics device driver. Given that the decompiled code prepared and sent key presses to an unnamed target, Myng was fairly certain he had something interesting on his hands.
Luckily, HP responded quickly.
“I tried to find HP laptop for rent and asked a few communities about that but got almost no replies,” he said. “One guy even thought that I am a thief trying to rob someone. So, I messaged HP about the finding. They replied terrifically fast, confirmed the presence of the keylogger (which actually was a debug trace) and released an update that removes the trace.”
The bottom line? Update your HP laptop as soon as possible. If you are on HP's list of affected laptops you can download the fix here.
Islamabad - Allama Iqbal Open University will come out with new academic programmes for promoting research in gardening and horticulture sector.
The department of agriculture sciences is being strengthened for this purpose, said Vice Chancellor Dr Shahid Siddiqui while addressing a prize distribution ceremony on Sunday for the gardeners on winning top positions, in the recently held national-level flower shows.
Moreover, he added, the university has also prepared a plan for improving the working conditions of low-grade employees, enabling them to deliver the best possible services in their respective discipline.
The welfare plan includes upgradation of medical and housing facilities and employees' promotions to their next grade, he added.
Dr Siddiqui noted that the university's gardeners have proved their worth in promoting healthy environment in the federal capital. Lush green gardens and lawns not only added beauty to the surroundings but also had a positive impact on the environment, he remarked.
Canada ranks 37th on a list of 41 rich countries for children having access to enough nutritious food, and higher-than-average rates of child homicide and teen suicide also point to a need for action, a UNICEF report says.
Over 22 per cent of Canadian children live in poverty and most issues related to kids showed no improvement or worsened during the last decade, said the 14th report from UNICEF on children's well-being amongst wealthy countries.
The mental health of Canadian teens has been declining, with 22 per cent of adolescents reporting symptoms more than once a week, said the report release Wednesday. Canada ranked 31st for the teen suicide rate, it said.

The report ranked countries in the European Union and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and put Canada in 25th place overall on children's well-being. Norway topped the list from the UN Children's Fund.
Romania, Bulgaria and Chile were at the bottom of the list based on 27 indicators. Canada has data to report on 21 indicators, including food security, unhealthy weight and bullying.
“We placed 17th in 2013 and 23rd in 2016 (overall) on similar indexes measuring how Canada's kids are doing compared with other rich countries,” UNICEF Canada said in a companion report.
The main report is based on so-called sustainable development goals set in September 2015 by 193 countries that aimed to end extreme poverty and hunger, provide education, protect children from violence and fight climate change.
David Morley, president of UNICEF Canada, said countries that moved up in the rankings invested more in early child development including day care.

“When you invest in the poorest children the payoff is greater. When the safety net is stronger, families can be stronger,” he said.
It is too early to say if Canada's tax-free child benefit, introduced last year, will make an impact, he said.
While many indigenous children live in poverty, they represent only about six per cent of kids in Canada, suggesting all kids need stronger policies, Morley said.
It's a myth that Canada is the best place in the world to grow up and that the country has great air quality, the report said.
“Air quality has been improving over the past 10 years in almost all rich countries except for Canada and Turkey,” the report said. Children are more vulnerable to the negative effects of air pollution because they breathe in more air per unit of body weight than adults, it said.
“Canada is, in the minds of many, a big, clean, safe and healthy nation. But the data in this report card suggest it is not so very clean, safe or healthy for its children and youth.”
Canada ranked 29th of 41 countries on unhealthy weight of children. Nearly 25 per cent of young people are obese, above the average of 15 per cent, the main report said.
Cindy Blackstock, executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada, said the country has failed to meet the needs of many of the most vulnerable children living on reserves.
“You can't give these kids less money for education, less money for health care, less money for early childhood and deny them even basics like clean water and expect them to be doing OK,” she said from Ottawa.

She noted the federal government has yet to follow repeated compliance orders issued as late as last month by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, which ruled in 2016 that Ottawa racially discriminated against youth in its delivery of child welfare services on reserves.
Blackstock, whose group fought the government on the issue, said the need for equitable education and health care for First Nations children has been ignored for years.
“No political party in this country in 2017 should be able to racially discriminate against 165,000 children,” said Blackstock, a member of the Gitxsan First Nation in B.C.
“I think the government has so normalized this racial discrimination against First Nations children that it's really in the DNA of the government,” said Blackstock, who is also a professor at the school of social work at McGill University in Montreal.

BLANTYRE-(MaraviPost)-The main opposition Malawi Congress Party (MCP) member Sidik Mia on Tuesday demande apology from ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) official against Muslims in the country
The demand also comes a day after DPP Mangochi campaign Mangulenje director resigned from his position following the same remarks.
But the party has not rebuked the DPP Governor for Eastern region Julius Pipe' remarks on muslims
Below is the statement Mia released and made available to The Maravi Post;
….I am saddened by the remarks made by a senior ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) official against Muslims in the country.
For those who missed it, the Malawi media, both print and electronic, reported that DPP Governor for Eastern region, Hon Julius Pipe, disparaged all Muslims in the country.
Hon Pipe told a rally that Malawians should not vote for Malawi Congress Party (MCP) in 2019 because there is a Muslim in the party, Muhammad Sidikh Mia. He said voting for MCP with Muhammad Sidik Mia, a Muslim, is tantamount to voting for war in 2019.
Logically, what the ruling DPP through their senior official is saying, is that Muslims are war mongers.
My fellow Malawians,
Islam is a religion of peace. I am a peace loving Muslim and so are my fellow Muslims in the country. We are not warmongers.
For instance, Dr Bakili Muluzi is a Muslim. He was head of State for two consecutive terms. Did he cause war in the country?
Muslims are tolerant of other religions.
I am working so comfortably with President Dr Chakwera, himself a Christian.
You may wish to note that I even attend Christian gatherings when invited for their fundraising events and/or other important Christian ceremonies. The same applies to our Christian brothers and sisters, they equally attend our important functions when we invite them.
We, Muslims and Christians, live peacefully together and we must not allow misguided individuals such as Hon Pipe to sow seeds of hatred and discord in our country.
We say no to such childish, divisive and irresponsible remarks from DPP through their senior official Mr Pipe.
I therefore applaud DPP's Mangochi District Campaign Director, Hon. Wellington Mangulenje for resigning from the party because of such unfortunate remarks from his boss Pipe.
We hope that DPP will officially apologies to all Muslims in the country for this insult and failure to do so shall mean DPP's official position regarding the way they view Muslims is as communicated by their senior official Hon Julius Pipe, that Muslims are war mongers.
My fellow Malawians,
We are one nation and one people and we must therefore cherish the gift of peace God gave us in our country and we must not allow irresponsible and misguided people like Hon Pipe to tamper with this greatest treasure of peace God bestowed on us.
May God Bless Malawi and May He always keep it a land of peace.
Sidik Mia
MCP Member

Detroit — The "Spirit of Detroit Plaza,” a curved walkway and seating area along the median of Woodward, will remain open permanently, the city confirmed Friday.
The stretch of Woodward, between Jefferson and Larned, has been closed to motor traffic since June 12 for a three-month trial.
The goal of Spirit Plaza was to move people from Campus Martius to the Detroit Riverfront and Maurice Cox, the city's planning director, said officials concluded the project was a success.
"We've received an overwhelming amount of positive responses. We're moving for it to be a permanent fixture, so we are now coming up with fall and winter programming to keep people coming back," Cox said.
Cox said the city surveyed and monitored traffic associated with the road closure and has seen an improvement.
"It's much less difficult for pedestrians to reach Hart Plaza. We monitored 11 locations and found that traffic was actually improved, especially on Jefferson. Some of the other spots on Griswold and Randolph, there was no significant impact," Cox said.
The 20,000-square-foot plaza includes a seating area, occasional food trucks and art.
The trial period was funded with private and public dollars costing under $200,000. Cox said they hope to return to investors and others to fund the plaza year-round.
Contributors included, Helen Johnson, vice president of strategic investments for Quicken Loans, one of the projects funders, previously said her organization contributed $50,000 to the project while the William Davidson Foundation granted $50,000. The city of Detroit invested $60,000, Johnson said, and state officials granted $25,000.
Cox said the city will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Spirit of Detroit statute in May and hopes to have a clearer plan by then for what the plaza will be.

Buzunesh Deba Inherits 2014 Boston Win, But Not the Prize

BOSTON – Buzunesh Deba will leave the Boston Marathon with one champion's medal this week.
She would like to make it two.
The 29-year-old Ethiopian inherited the 2014 title this December when Kenya's Rita Jeptoo was stripped of her victory for testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs. Jeptoo joins Rosie Ruiz, who was caught cutting the course in 1980, as the only people to be disqualified from the Boston Marathon after breaking the tape on Boylston Street.
“She took my chance,” Deba said this week after returning to Boston, where she has also finished third and seventh. “I lost so many things.”
When Ruiz took a shortcut to the finish line, she deprived Jacqueline Gareau of the thrill of breaking the tape , being crowned with the traditional olive wreath and hearing the Canadian national anthem waft over Copley Square. Race officials, who were immediately skeptical of the unknown and unseen Ruiz, made it up to Gareau with a substitute victory ceremony and even had her cross the finish line again – this time in street clothes.
But Gareau's victory was in the race's amateur era, so there was no cash to recover.
Jeptoo, whose 2006 and 2013 victories remain unchallenged, claimed $150,000 for the victory and an additional $25,000 for setting a course record. Both legally belong to Deba, whose time of 2 hours, 19 minutes, 59 seconds remains the fastest in Boston Marathon history, but the Boston Athletic Association would have to claw it back from Jeptoo.
“We are trying,” CEO Tom Grilk said.
In the year after the finish line explosions that killed three people and wounded hundreds more, Jeptoo herself was already an afterthought, coming in just minutes before Meb Keflezighi claimed the first American victory in the men's race since 1983 . As “The Star-Spangled Banner” played over Boylston Street, Jeptoo's third win – even in a course-record time – drew less attention than normal.
But for Deba, it was costly. All the after-the-fact ceremonies, medals and even the prize money – if she ever gets it – wouldn't make up for the opportunities lost when she wasn't able to capitalize on being a returning champion.
“When you are the champion, the next year, the appearance fees, the contracts, everything” is more lucrative, the two-time New York City Marathon runner-up said this week. “My happiness is that day. But she took it from me.”
Deba's husband and coach, Worku Beyi, said they are talking to B.A.A. officials about the prize money, “but it is not 100 percent.” They are hoping Jeptoo will return the money.
“She knows herself she is not champion,” Beyi said.
Deba has a chance to steal back the spotlight on Monday, when she joins a field of more than 30,000 in Hopkinton for the 121st edition of the race. Among them are defending champion Atsede Baysa of Ethiopia; Kenya's Gladys Cherono, who has the fastest time in the field; and two-time Olympian Desi Linden, who is trying to become the first American woman to win in Boston since 1985.

Three keys to the Ducks' 5-4 overtime victory in Calgary in Game 3 of their playoff series:
1. The Ducks survived a special-teams nightmare. Calgary scored three power-play goals — the first time they've done so in a playoff game since 2006, also against the Ducks — while the Ducks had no power plays.
2. Shea Theodore played perhaps the best game of his young career. Bolstering a Ducks defensive unit that has had injuries, the 21-year-old defenseman had two goals; the second forced overtime.
3. The Ducks prevailed despite an atypical possession game. The Flames won 39 of 74 faceoffs against the Ducks, the best faceoff team in the NHL this season. Antoine Vermette was the Ducks' outlier, winning 11 of 15 faceoffs.

A bereaved father, his brother-in-law and two other motor-biking pals have raised £13,000 to help build a new £150,000 maternity bereavement suite at Scunthorpe General Hospital.
Pete Jackson, 38, and his pals, Allwyn Dalton, 25, John Haynes, 37, and Giles Cooper, 47, all from Winterton, took 19 hours to rise from John O'Groats to Land's End
But the 900 mile trek did not go according to plan as one of the bikes broke down en route, leaving the rider to ride pillion to the finishing post.
The foursome hit the open road after Pete and his wife Bev's daughter Alicia was born stillborn earlier this year.
Team organiser Allwyn said: “I never thought that my family would be affected by stillbirth and after seeing my sister Bev and brother-in-law Pete lose Alicia, I wanted to help keep her memory alive.
“We always knew the ride was going to be a tough challenge, but to have your brother-in-law and friends there with you kept us all motivated.
“The ride did not go as planned as my bike broke down but I was determined to get to the end so rode pillion with Giles, which wasn't comfortable at all but we stuck it out for Alicia.”
As well as the ride, Allwyn organised an online auction and he held a fundraising evening at Winterton Rangers.
Alicia's parents Pete and Bev Jackson said: “We are so proud of everyone who took part in the challenge and everyone who helped make it a success.
"Everyone's support has helped us through our darkest days.”

FILE - In this March 15, 2018, file photo, Cleveland Browns' Damarious Randall speaks at an NFL football news conference in Berea, Ohio. Randall underestimated two things: the power of social media and the passion of Cleveland fans. Randall said Wednesday, May 30, 2018, he never imagined that an innocent Twitter posting about the NBA Finals would blow up into a national story - and maybe something he may live to regret. A big fan of Golden State star guard Stephen Curry, Randall posted a tweet on Monday night promising that if the Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Warriors in the “2018 NBA finals, I'll buy everyone who retweets this a jersey…” By Wednesday afternoon, Randall's tweet had been retweeted 869,000 times.

Rollin G. Freshour was born February 4, 1896 in the small mining community of Jenny Lind in Calaveras County, after which his family relocated to Ripon. Before the advent of World War I, Freshour was a popular local boy with many friends, and worked as a butcher at a creamery in Modesto. He was one of the first to leave early in the war, and was sent to Camp Lewis in Tacoma, WA, where he was assigned to a regiment of engineers preparing for battle in France.
In June of 1918, Freshour was wounded in the battle of Chateau-Thiery. He was injured in a leg and the back of his neck, and the only way he was able to survive the onslaught of flying shrapnel, was horrifyingly by covering himself with the bodies of those fallen around him. He was one of just three men in his regiment to survive. After 3 days, a German man whose sons were fighting in the war came across Freshour, took him in, and cared for him.
At this point, Freshour had been officially declared Missing in Action, and his family believed him to most likely be dead. It is unclear why, but apparently is was several weeks before he was able to get to a hospital where the bullet was removed from his leg. After his healing, he spent the next six months in a German prison camp. His weight plummeted from 165 pounds down to an astonishing 85. Although he reported being treated well and suffering no abuse by the Germans, the prison rations were not enough to sustain his body.
At the end of the war when the Armistice treaty was signed, Private Freshour was released from the prison camp, but rather than being sent home immediately due to ill health, he was held back in Europe for military police duty. While there are conflicting reports as to why he was detained, the delay may have been due to the fact that his whole company was wiped out, along with all of his paperwork proving he was an American soldier.
During this time, Freshour was able to exchange some limited correspondence with his family. Although his family and friends wrote to him weekly, it seems he received only 5 letters, including one from his mother and one from his sister. A bit of their correspondence from the time was published in the Ripon Record, where one letter, written in May of 1919 near the time of his homecoming, was published in its entirety. In this letter, Freshour expresses his confusion that he hasn't been sent home when just about everyone else has, as well as his thoughts on Germany:
“It's a very nice country, but that's about all you can say for it. The Germans haven't much love for us, and we haven't much more for them.”
Freshour couldn't wait to get home and had been counting down the days. When he finally made it back to the states, he was already sick, and had contracted pneumonia by the time he was discharged from the Presidio. Upon his arrival, he went straight home to see his mother, and none of his friends were allowed an opportunity to see him, as he deteriorated rapidly. He was reticent to talk about his time oversees and what had occurred there, and sadly the majority of his experiences will likely forever remain a mystery as doctors recommended he “be kept in perfect silence” as they believed talking would delay his recovery. Sadly, his last few days were spent in delirium and it is reported he talked constantly as though he were still in battle and fighting the Germans, even “calling for more hand grenades”. A Dr. Gould is mentioned in several records, and he tried valiantly to save young Freshour, who never left the house again after his homecoming.
Rollin Freshour passed away just one week after returning home from the war on August 24, 1919, at the tender age of 23. His death rocked the community whom had been overjoyed at the news of his homecoming after going missing, only to lose him so soon after his return. He was survived by both of his parents, three sisters, and a brother. Services were held at the Freshour's home. He was later buried at Park View Cemetery in Manteca, and pallbearers included other returned soliders Howard Clendenen, Warren Hageman, Leslie Hammock, Downing McBrian, Harry Preshaw, and Elmer Wolf. He received a farewell salute, and his gravestone holds the inscription “Gone but not forgotten”.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is one of the most anticipated films of the year, whether you're a comic geek or not. Before Star-Lord and the gang blast their way back into theaters on May 5th, however, writer/director James Gunn already has us looking forward to Vol. 3, as he's just announced he'll officially be returning to helm the third entry of the franchise.
Gunn, who introduced the world to the GotG with the original film in 2014, made his announcement in a Facebook post addressed to fans. “There is a history in Hollywood of haphazard endings to trilogies, and I didn't want to become a part of that dishonorable tradition of pretending the third one doesn't exist,” the filmmaker wrote. “I couldn't do it for the money, and I couldn't do it because it was what other people wanted me to do. I needed to do it because it was what I needed to do.”
He went on to profess his love for the characters in GotG and the teams at Marvel and Disney who have worked with him on the films over the years. Though he kept things predictably vague, Gunn also gave some hints as to what Vol. 3 might look like: “Much of what's happened in the MCU for the past ten or so years has been leading, in a big way, to the Avengers' Infinity War. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 will happen after all that. It will conclude the story of this iteration of the Guardians of the Galaxy, and help catapult both old and new Marvel characters into the next ten years and beyond.” That gives us a timeline and a teasing look beyond Vol 3., as he refers to the characters as “this iteration” of the team, signaling big changes could be coming down the line.
“I will be working side-by-side with Kevin Feige and the gang to help design where these stories go, and make sure the future of the Marvel Cosmic Universe is as special and authentic and magical as what we have created so far,” he concluded, implying that even if he steps away from writing or directing films for Marvel after Vol. 3, his input will be felt well into the future of the MCU.

Opening May 5th, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2. stars Chris Pratt (Star-Lord), Kurt Russell (Ego the Living Planet), Zoe Saldana (Gamora), Dave Bautista (Drax the Destroyer), Vin Diesel (Groot), Bradley Cooper (Rocket), Michael Rooker (Yondu Udonta), Karen Gillian (Nebula), Pom Klementieff (Mantis). Elizabeth Debicki plays the antagonist Ayesha, and Sylvester Stallone has an unidentified cameo.
Gurley's sensational turnaround season in which he ran for 13 touchdowns and caught six TD passes sparked an equally impressive reversal of fortunes by his team, which won the NFC West at 11-5.
"The Saints got the rookies and we took home the offensive and defensive" player awards," Gurley noted. "It just tells you the type of players we have on the team. We all help each other out, absolutely. We have some talent, but we're nothing without the whole nine yards and everybody together. And we also have a coach who's up for Coach of the Year."
A little while later, McVay was handed the coaching award.
In his first season running a team and as the youngest head coach in NFL history, McVay led the Rams to a seven-game improvement. McVay, who turned 32 on Jan. 24, ran away with the voting with 35 votes to 11 for Minnesota's Mike Zimmer.
The Rams' hat trick of awards was not unprecedented. In 2003, Baltimore's Ray Lewis was top defensive player, Jamal Lewis won the best offensive player, and Terrell Suggs was Defensive Rookie of the Year. And in 1999, the St. Louis Rams had three award winners: Kurt Warner (MVP), Marshall Faulk (Offensive Player) and Dick Vermeil (Coach).
New Orleans' sweep of the rookie awards was the first since 1967, when Detroit running back Mel Farr and cornerback Lem Barney were honoured. That was the first season for the top defensive rookie award.
"You get caught up in the season, you don't really get time to pat yourself on the back," Kamara said. "But when the season is over you realize what you've done. I've kind of had to time to look back and say, I made some history this season."
Kamara shared duties with veteran Mark Ingram as the Saints won the NFC South. He rushed for 728 yards with a 6.1-yard average, and scored eight times. He also caught 81 passes for 826 yards, with five touchdowns.
The 11th overall draft pick and first from his position selected, Lattimore was a shutdown defender as the Saints went 11-5. He had five interceptions and 18 passes defenced in 13 games, was a sure tackler and, by midseason, was someone opposing quarterbacks tended to avoid. He missed three games, one because of a concussion and two with an ankle injury.
Allen returned from two devastating injuries to win the comeback honour. Allen missed half of the 2015 season with a kidney issue, then was lost in the 2016 season opener with a torn right ACL. There were questions if Allen would ever player at a high level again.
He answered those emphatically this season with the best year of his career. Allen caught 102 passes for 1,393 yards and six touchdowns. He was targeted 159 times, nearly 10 per game.
The award were announced Saturday night at NFL Honors.

The smell of fresh-baked steak pies. The sound of a crunching tackle yards in front of you. The crisp taste of a pint of lager on the terrace.
These are just some of the reasons why I love non-league football - and why you should get out and try your local football team today, on national Non-League Day.
For the seventh consecutive year, semi-professional clubs up and down the country are opening their doors to newcomers with special offers and charitable initiatives.
For me, non-league football is my life. My dad is manager of Curzon Ashton in the National League North and he has been in charge of clubs in the lower echelons of the football pyramid ever since I can remember.

I've grown up on the terraces and found myself travelling everywhere from Workington to Poole for football.
Plenty of people ask me why I do it, but it's tough to put it down to one thing.
It's the warm welcome as you walk through the turnstile and purchase your ticket for the meat raffle.
It's the characters you come across, whether it be Doris in the tea hut serving cuppas as a volunteer for the 45th consecutive year or Harry in the boardroom, the club founder still dreaming of that money-spinning run to the FA Cup first round.

It's getting a lift to an away game with a director. It's standing where you want in the ground. It's listening to every eff and jeff that is bellowed from the dugouts.
And beyond all that, the actual football, competed between a mix of seasoned ex-professionals and local talent, is a far cry from the Sunday league hoofball that many expect.

So please, if you're free this weekend, just go and give it a go. It's not that expensive.
It might not be for everyone, but there are dedicated volunteers at every single club who deserve your support.
And you never know... you might just like it.
