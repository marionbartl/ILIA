Pope Francis in Bethlehem urges an end to the Middle East conflict
Updated
Pope Francis has called for an end to the "increasingly unacceptable" Palestinian-Israeli conflict during a visit to the West Bank city of Bethlehem.
On the second leg of a three-day visit to the Middle East, Francis referred directly to the "state of Palestine", giving support for its bid for full statehood recognition in the face of a paralysed peace process.
However, the Pope made clear that a negotiated accord was needed, calling on leaders from both sides to show the necessary courage to forge a deal.
"For the good of all, there is a need to intensify efforts and initiatives aimed at creating the conditions for a stable peace based on justice, on the recognition of the rights of every individual, and on mutual security," they said.
Later, in an unscheduled stop, they descended from their popemobile when it drove past the hulking grey concrete wall that Israel erected 10 years ago during a Palestinian uprising to divide Bethlehem from the adjacent Jerusalem. Israel says the wall is needed for security reasons.
The pontiff spent several minutes under the shadow of an Israeli watchtower and said a prayer.
"Free Palestine" was written in graffiti on the wall near where Francis paused.
Church officials say their tour of the region is focused on religious issues. However, the stark dividing lines of the Middle East conflict are impossible to ignore, and the Pope's every move has been scrutinised for meaning.
Abbas, Peres invited to the Vatican
Francis flew by helicopter to Bethlehem, becoming the first pontiff to travel directly to the West Bank rather than enter via Israel.
They later travelled to Israel from where they will return home on Monday, with some 8,000 police deployed in Jerusalem to guarantee their security.
The Pope's decision not to use a bullet-proof car meant Israeli security officials have cleared the roads and created numerous "sterile areas" ahead of their 24-hour stay in the city.
Standing alongside Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, Francis pointedly referred to them as "a man of peace and a peacemaker" before heading to Bethlehem's Manger Square, close to where Christians believe Jesus was born, to celebrate an open-air mass.
A mural behind the altar showed Jesus, who was a Jew, swaddled in a Palestinian keffiyeh, with their father, Joseph, also wearing the black and white headdress, made famous by the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
At the end of the mass, Francis invited Israeli president Shimon Peres and Mr Abbas to their home in the Vatican for a "heartfelt prayer" for peace.
"I offer my home in the Vatican as a place for this encounter of prayer," they said.
The leaders accepted the offer and are due to meet at the Vatican next month.
On Sunday evening, Francis prayed for Christian unity with Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople, spiritual leader of Orthodox Christians, in the Basilica of the Holy Sepulchre.
It was first time various branches of Christianity prayed together inside the centuries-old structure where Christians believe Jesus was buried and rose from the dead.
They usually are governed by strict rules of separation dating back to the Ottoman Empire.
The meeting was the main religious purpose of the trip, timed to commemorate the 50th anniversary of a historic meeting of Catholic and Orthodox leaders, whose Churches split in 1054.

President Barack Obama called for a 1 percent pay increase for federal employees in two letters they sent to Congress Friday afternoon. The letters, which were nearly identical, applied to both members of the uniformed services and civilian federal employees covered by the General Schedule.
“Civilian Federal employees have already made significant sacrifices as a result of a three-year pay freeze that ended in January 2014 with the implementation of a 1.0 percent pay increase — an amount lower than the private sector pay increases and statutory formula for adjustments to the base General Schedule,” Obama wrote. “However, as the country's economic recovery continues, we must maintain efforts to keep our Nation on a sustainable fiscal course. This is an effort that continues to require tough choices and each of us to do our fair share.”
Obama also called for locality pay percentages to remain at their 2014 levels.
Congress, which has yet to pass a fiscal 2015 budget, could still block the pay raises through legislation when members return from recess on Sept. 8.

While the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1, the pay raises proposed by President Obama wouldn't go into effect until Jan. 1, 2015.
Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), chairperson of the Senate Appropriations Committee, praised the President's decision to give a cost of living adjustment (COLA) to federal employees in 2015.
“This modest COLA would go a long way in further recognizing the value of federal employees and help bring to a close year of pay freezes,” Mikulski said, in a press release. “I'm proud to fight on the front lines on behalf of federal employee pay just as federal employees work on the front lines each and every day on behalf of the American people. Federal employees have been undervalued and underappreciated for too long. Each and every day, federal employees stand up for America.”

For most individuals, Santa brought a cornucopia of electronics, gift cards and items to exchange or return. Tech bloggers found an extra surprise in their stockings: reports of another iPad upgrade and an Acer tablet priced at $99.
The products sound promising -- Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) will reportedly release a thinner and lighter version of the full-size iPad. The company may also add a Retina Display to the iPad Mini. Meanwhile, Acer is believed to be developing a low-cost tablet that will retail for $99 in China and other emerging markets. It is not yet known if Acer's seven-inch device, which has yet to be confirmed, will come to the United States.
(Amid the tablet competition, what about smartphones?)
Acer is the second company that is rumored to be developing a $99 tablet. Asus, which produced the Nexus 7 for Google, recently denied a report that it would do the same.
As an emerging market tablet, Acer's $99 device will compete with a number of high-end products from big manufacturers, including Apple. It may soon compete with Amazon, which has been setting the stage for a Chinese invasion. However, Acer is designing the tablet to compete more effectively against white-box tablet makers from China, which already produce cheap tablets.
Thus far, consumers seem to prefer the higher-end products that Apple develops. The iPad has dominated the tablet market since the day it was released. That domination continued in China last quarter when Apple produced more than 70 percent of the tablets sold in the nation. With a starting price of $329 in America, the iPad Mini is anything but cheap.
If Acer is able to charge 1/3 of that price, it could prove to be a positive move for the manufacturer. Consumers are not easily persuaded to make a generic tablet purchase. After releasing the HP TouchPad, Hewlett-Packard learned that a lower price can change everything.
However, Hewlett-Packard had one advantage that other cheap tablets do not. By starting at $499, consumers thought of the HP TouchPad as being an expensive high-end alternative to the iPad. No one bought it at that price because they figured that if they were going to spend that much money they might as well get an iDevice. That changed the moment Hewlett-Packard lowered the price to $99, at which point consumers believed that they were getting a $500 tablet for 1/5 the price.
In order for Acer's $99 tablet to achieve a high level of success, the company needs to convince consumers -- in China, America or anywhere else in the world -- that they are getting a device of a much higher quality than the price suggests.
When the history of Android is written, HTC's name will go down as one of the early innovators that propelled the young platform to its fullest potential. This Taiwanese company built the first ever Android phone as well as the first Nexus. But when HTC's history is recorded, the One A9 smartphone will stand out as that time the Android pioneer tried to build an iPhone.
Ever since the One M7 at the start of 2013, HTC has been cultivating a signature aluminum unibody design, characterized by a particular mix of subtle curves and precise straight lines. The company's designers have spoken about wanting to keep its phones recognizable as HTC products at first sight, and this year's One M9 stayed true to that ethos with a remix of its two predecessors' designs. The new One A9, however, discards much of that heritage and instead opts for the iPhone look. The back has been flattened, the stereo speakers have been replaced by a new home button with a built-in fingerprint reader, and the corners now have the exact same radius as the iPhone's. There's no question about it: this is an iPhone clone.
HTC didn't stop at just copying the iPhone's looks. The One A9's battery is closer in size to the iPhone's than the Android average, and the rest of its specs also appear to pay no mind to the usual Android spec race. Instead, HTC is prioritizing software — with the 5-inch One A9 being the first non-Nexus device to ship with the latest Android Marshmallow — and aiming to create an integrated and optimized user experience.
It's like HTC took a look at Apple and Google, the two biggest winners of the mobile world, and decided that the way to revitalize its own slumping fortunes was to combine the best of both. Apple's appealing form and Google's multifaceted function.
The design is graceful in its elegance, disgraceful in its copying
If you read the One A9's spec sheet, you'd immediately classify it as a mid-range phone with nothing special about it. Which is precisely why you shouldn't read spec sheets. Using the One A9 has shown me a phone that makes the absolute most of its components, resulting in a device that compares favorably with most other companies' flagship smartphones.
It all starts with the design. I'm smitten with it. Yes, it has those iPhone-aping qualities of thinness, lightness, and pleasingly rounded sides, but HTC has added a couple of extra touches that I also really enjoy. The ridged power button, very much in the style seen on Motorola's recent phones, is easy to find by touch alone, thanks to the tactile contrast between its roughness and the A9's otherwise smooth form. Together with the slight camera bump, the power button is my anchor point for recognizing which way is up when pulling the phone out of my pocket .
The capacitive home key can't be pressed in, which I initially thought would be a downside relative to the iPhone or Galaxy phones with real buttons, but I actually prefer HTC's implementation. It makes unlocking the phone more convenient, whether it's resting on my desk or tucked away in a pocket. With the integrated fingerprint reader, I only need to find the home button and cover it with my thumb while pulling the phone out of a pocket and by the time I've got it in front of me, the Android home screen is already waiting for me.
Unbelievably light and easy to handle
The two most common things said about aluminum-encased smartphones are that they feel more premium because of the material, but also that they're more slippery than conventional handsets. Both are true of the One A9. I absolutely love holding and using this phone, and I never get the feeling that it's a cheap iPhone imitation — HTC has copied every bit of the quality of Apple's phone along with the look . But as an experienced iPhone user, I also know how easily that phone can slip out of its user's grasp when handled without a case — the HTC One matches that aspect of it too.
HTC extends the aesthetic appeal of the One A9 by using a very good AMOLED display. This 5-inch, 1080p panel reminds me of Samsung's excellent Galaxy S6 screen. The latter has a much greater pixel density, however the advantage that grants over the One A9 is pretty much ephemeral. HTC's display looks just as organic, just as much as a real piece of printed paper sitting atop the glass, as Samsung's. Viewing angles, contrast, and even color accuracy — usually a weak point for AMOLED screens — are all top notch on the A9. I love the warmth and vibrancy of its colors. They are just right, feeling punchy without straying into looking artificial.
The fingerprint reader is a great addition
Another good engineering choice made by HTC is the removal of the company's famed stereo BoomSound speakers. That's made the new fingerprint reader possible, and I'd much rather have that than really loud stereo speakers on my phone. HTC has instead focused its audio efforts on improving the listening experience via headphones, integrating a powerful amp, supporting high-res audio and Dolby Surround Sound, and even laying out the internal circuit board to minimize electrical distortion.
Testing it with a set of high-end Audeze EL-8 headphones, I actually got to a louder volume with the One A9 than I could achieve with my iMac, and the sound was crystal clear at all times. It's the attention to details like these that makes the difference between the best phones and the rest. You don't need to be aware of the technical spec, nor to even know what HTC has done behind the scenes, to better enjoy listening to music on this phone.
So the One A9 has great sound, a great display, and a great, if unoriginal, design. All of that could be said of the One M9 that came before it, and the big question with the A9 was whether it would address its predecessor's biggest weakness: the camera. The good news is that, yes, this is HTC's best camera to date and it marks a significant improvement over the One M9's mediocrity. The bad news is that HTC's best is still only decent by wider industry standards.
Camera performance is no longer a big problem, but neither is it a strength
The best thing about the One A9's camera is its quickness. The phone can go from my pocket to shooting a photo and back in my pocket within a handful of seconds. And I can be reasonably assured of getting a good shot because this is the first One device since 2013's M7 to include optical image stabilization. The One A9's exposure metering and white balance are also reliably accurate. That makes the camera much more forgiving to sloppy operation, which, if we're honest, is the default way we all use our phones, and thus very important to get right.
I'm not hugely impressed with the quality of the pictures produced by the One A9. Their sharpness is only okay, especially when set against the Xperia Z5, LG G4, or Galaxy S6. In low light, those other cameras can crank up the ISO and capture scenes that the A9 is simply not capable of. HTC supports RAW capture on the One A9 and offers a Pro mode with manual controls, but neither will help you achieve results comparable to the best Android cameraphones.
A point of differentiation for HTC is the addition of a Hyperlapse shooting mode, which does the same thing as Instagram's more famous iOS app by the same name. It can record up to 45 minutes of video and then stabilize and accelerate it, allowing you to set different speeds for different segments. It's fun stuff, just like the iOS app, but HTC is wrong to claim it as unique — there's already a Microsoft Hyperlapse app on Android.
This phone has its limitations, but you'll probably be okay with them
HTC's new camera is good enough to not be a big problem. What it gives you is reliable and predictable operation. You'll quickly learn the limitations of what you can and can't shoot with it, and I suspect you'll be okay with them. The two-tone flash on the back does a fine job of making up for the A9's low-light deficiencies, illuminating even nearby subjects evenly and without blowing out any details. Macro photography is also pretty easy with this phone, thanks to its quick and accurate focus. It's not the best camera, but for most, it will be good enough.
It's worth also mentioning that the One A9's front-facing camera is the same UltraPixel unit that figured on the back of the One M8 and the front of the One M9. Its enlarged pixels make low-light photography its greatest strength, and even though it's substandard for the job of being a main camera, it's perfectly suited to the role of a selfie shooter and is one of the better ones you can get.
After the camera, the second biggest question with the One A9 was its battery. It's only 2,150mAh, which is more than you'd get on the iPhone, but far below the Android average. By some dark magic , HTC makes this work. The One A9 lasts for a full day, though never more than that. It's in the same ballpark as the Android phone it most resembles, Samsung's Galaxy S6. Both HTC and Samsung made a conscious decision to sacrifice battery life in favor of a sleeker, lighter design. I can't begrudge the choice, because I'm a big fan of the design of both phones — you'll just have to be conscious of this tradeoff and accept the more regular need to recharge . The Galaxy S6 does have the advantage of integrated wireless charging, which the One A9 lacks.
HTC makes the most of a lower-spec processor
The processor inside the HTC One A9 is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 617. It's a tier below the 800 series that offer the most power and performance, but — just like this phone's display, which also isn't the top spec available — that's not stopping it from being highly competitive. In fact, never mind competitive, the One A9 is just plain smoother and faster than the vast majority of Android phones out there. Android 6.0 simply sings on this device. All the small animations and transitions are realized beautifully, and there's none of the frustrating lag or stuttering that bothered me with the Moto X Play or Xperia Z5. The performance of the One A9's software is a perfect match for its exterior smoothness and elegance.
BEIRUT – A top officer in the Syrian regime's feared Air Force Intelligence Directorate has been appointed governor of the Druze-populated Suweida province, where a number of movements have sprung of challenging government authority.
President Bashar al-Assad issued a decree Wednesday selecting Amer al-Ashi as the new governor, replacing Atef Nadaf, who became a lightning rod for criticism by Suweida residents angry with worsening living conditions in the normally secure province.
State media did not provide any biographical details on the incoming governor, while the official homepage for the local government explained only that Ashi—born 1954 in Hama—is a “retired major-general in the Syrian army” who has three children.
Ashi, however, has a more notable background than let on by regime media outlets. In July 2012, the EU sanctioned the high-ranking officer for their role “in the repression of the Syrian opposition.”
A short biography prepared by the EU's sanction authority noted that Ashi—who graduated from the Aleppo Military School—in 2012 became the head of the intelligence branch within the Air Force Intelligence service, which is considered the most powerful apparatus in the Syrian security establishment.
The EU also said that Ashi was a close confidante of Daoud Rajha, Syria's Defense Minister from 2011 until July 18, 2012, when they were killed in an explosion in central Damascus that targeted a meeting of top regime security officials.
Ashi is set to face a host of challenges in Suweida, whose Druze residents generally maintain an autonomous attitude and have protested corruption, misrule and enlistment in the Syrian army that would force them to fight in far-off areas of the country.
Sheikhs of Dignity
Among the group's striking an autonomous position in Suweida is the clerical Sheikhs of Dignity Movement and its Men of Dignity affiliate, which sponsors the Bayrak al-Fahd (Banner of the Leopard) armed umbrella organization that oversees smaller groups of armed men scattered throughout the province.
Although the Men of Dignity do not seek the overthrow of the Assad regime, they maintain a fiercely independent stance and have called for reforms in Suweida while criticizing regime figures in charge of the Druze-populated province.
In February 2016, Sheikhs of Dignity leader Rafaat al-Balaous openly confirmed that their group is purchasing weapons after one of the movement's members was arrested at a regime checkpoint for possession of arms and ammunition.
“We're going to bring weapons and arm ourselves,” Sheikh Rafaat al-Balaous declared in a fiery speech.
Rafaat al-Balaous's admission that their group is buying weapons is the latest assertion of autonomy by the Sheikhs of Dignity movement, which was led by Rafaat's brother Waheed until they were killed in a September 2015 car bombing that their group implicitly blamed on Damascus.
Prior to their death, Waheed al-Balaous had taken an increasingly strident tone against the Syrian regime and its intelligence chief in Suweida, who the cleric accused of attempting to eliminate Assad's enemies in the province.
Only weeks before Balaous's assassination, the Sheikhs of Dignity announced the formation of its own fighting force, Bayrak al-Fahd.
The Sheikhs of Dignity as well as its affiliates have kept up their autonomous stance following the death of Balaous, who their brother Rafaat replaced as leader of the movement in October 2015.
On November 4, the Sheikhs of Dignity angrily accused the Syrian regime of “declaring war” against it after state media ran a report linking Rafaat Balaous to the killing of a top Baath Party official in Suweida.
Less than a week later, the Syrian regime's security chief in Suweida province appeared in a video with official religious representatives of the country's Druze sect announcing a crackdown on the Men of Dignity.
“The words ‘Balaous's group,' that phrase must be killed,” the head of Suweida province's Political Security Branch, Wafiq Nasser, said in a video that was leaked on to social media.
“It must be killed on the ground as an armed aggressing force and it must be killed as a term.”​
In early January, the Men of Dignity announced that its members were taking measures to “protect our internal security in most areas” of the mountainous Druze-populated province.
Civil Society
Students and activists in Suweida have also challenged the government's authority in the province, staging a number of demonstrations in the past months over local grievances.
In early March 2016, a number of youths formed the “You Broke Us” movement in anger over the arbitrary firing of teachers called up for military service. However the grassroots movement quickly struck an increasingly strident tone against the Syrian regime.
One protest in mid-April saw the activists gather in the center of the provincial capital and chant daringly independent slogans as they spraypainted “Square of Dignity” over a pedestal in the officially named “Hafez al-Assad Square.”
One of the crowd's chants captured their independent bent, with protesters taking potshots against staunch regime allies as well as jihadist groups.
“Syria is free, Iran get out! Syria is free, Russia get out! Syria is free, ISIS get out! Syria is free, Nusra get out!” the crowd shouted.
In another video allegedly showing the rally, the protesters chanted “long live Syria, and fall Bashar al-Assad,” one of the most direct challenges issued against Damascus in a demonstration held in the Suweida province.
Security forces did not intervene to quash the rally, as was practice with the opposition rallies in the early days of the Syrian uprising.
However, a month later in May another “You Broke Us” rally degenerated into chaos when regime loyalists massed around the rally.
Activists claimed that a fistfight erupted between the two groups, while an Assad supporter opened fire with their weapon into the air.
In the ensuing weeks “You Broke Us” protests died down, however a number of similar protest movements in the past have fizzled out only to be replaced by a new group.
In the summer of 2015, soaring prices, rising crime and poor infrastructure all stoked already growing levels of popular discontent in Suweida, sparking the formation of the “We Are Being Strangled Movement,” which held a number of mass rallies until the September.
The protests gained in size, with hundreds of demonstrators gathering in front of the provincial government HQ on September 1, 2015 to call for then Governor Atef Nadaf's resignation. Days later Sheikhs of Dignity Movement leader Waheed al-Balaous was killed in a car bombing, and “You Broke Us” stopped its rallies.

A detailed look at why Luck's recovery hasn't progressed as quickly as hoped and how concerned you should be about a return in 2018
The Ongoing Saga of Andrew Luck
Until June, Andrew Luck wasn't much of a story. There may have been a raised eyebrow about Luck's limited practice participation over the past two seasons and a little nervousness over January's surgery, but it seemed likely we'd see Luck back on the field leading the Colts in Week 1.
The first hints of trouble came during June minicamp when Luck seemed defensive with reporters about their recovery. The news around Luck would progressively become more and more alarming. Now, after multiple specialist opinions, the Colts moved their franchise quarterback to injured reserve and prompted still more questions about Luck's future
The questions are complicated.
Why hasn't Luck recovered as quickly as hoped?
Will additional rehabilitation have a good chance at success?
Does Luck need another surgery?
And the most important question:
Is Luck fighting to save their career?
These are complicated questions. And there are no simple answers.
As I often have when discussing Luck, I'll be relying heavily on conversations I've had with Dr. Jeff Budoff, a noted upper extremity specialist who contributes to RotoViz.
What We Know
Luck likely suffered a subluxation (i.e. partial dislocation) of their throwing shoulder in September of 2015.
Luck was frequently limited in practice and continued to play through pain through the 2015 and 2016 seasons.
Luck elected to have surgery to repair labral damage in January 2017.
Luck has been unable to complete the throwing phase of their rehabilitation.
Luck had multiple steroid injections and changed their rehab personnel and protocols at least once in the past two months.
The Colts now concede Luck has no chance to return in 2017, eleven months after their surgery.
Recent Reports Add Clarity
Ian Rapoport and Chris Mortensen were finally able to squeeze meaningful detail from their sources and shared their findings on Sunday morning. Per Rapoport, Luck sought at least four additional opinions. The consensus was that Luck quit throwing for 2-3 months and focus again on rehabilitation. Rapoport further noted that none of the specialists felt surgery should be an imminent consideration.
Particularly pertinent are the following passages from Rapoport's feature (bolded passages are mine):
The belief is that additional issues arose in Luck's shoulder, which are byproducts of playing through the torn posterior labrum for two years. That, not the labrum, has led to the setbacks. ... Luck does have several problems inside their shoulder in other parts beyond what was repaired -- most of which came from their mechanics changing due to compensating for the injury. Doctors have tried to figure out if the soreness is from their original issue (they don't think so) or new issues. The shoulder doesn't look bad when examined. But there are little ailments that haven't been resolved. Over the last four weeks, Luck has spent weekdays in Birmingham, Alabama, working with Kevin Wilk, one of the nation's most respected physical therapists. And it has not gotten better. He'd rehab, then get sore, then shut it down. Every time they got close, he'd get sore. ... Yet, when camp loomed near, the main factor holding Luck back drew into focus: the other injuries around the posterior labrum tear. The fraying caused other parts of the shoulder to overcompensate. Their timeline got pushed back when the season started, and they believed he'd possibly return by Week 6. But Luck never quite got over the hump. He'd constantly ask those they worked with why their shoulder felt this way, why their shoulder felt that way. The cerebral quarterback always wanted to know and understand every step along the way, never quite sure why their shoulder felt so sore.
Though Rapoport's story suggests Luck's current plan is to rehab without throwing for 2-3 months, Mortensen tweeted Luck will be re-evaluated by their surgical team in December.
What Could Be Wrong With Luck's Shoulder
Budoff, who has extensive experience with labral repair and revision surgeries, has been kind enough to discuss the common difficulties facing those who have had a surgery similar to Luck. Recognizing the limitations of speculation based on media reports, there are multiple possible complications to consider.
**Shoulder capsule too tight after their labral repair
Fixing the type of labral injury Luck sustained is a technically challenging procedure. Scarring -- which is a necessary and expected part of the healing process -- sometimes leads to shoulder stiffness which then must be stretched out during rehabilitation. The resulting limitation in range of motion can cause soreness during rehab. This is one reason a successful surgery could still result in a longer rehab than expected.
**Residual shoulder instability after their labral repair
It's possible Luck's shoulder was loose and unstable in more than one direction. A repair of the posterior labrum could be successful but cause previously subtle instability elsewhere in the shoulder to cause pain, particularly at the end of a quarterback's throwing motion. This is another reason a successful surgery may still result in a longer rehab than expected.
**Cartilage damage
Damage to the labrum can be associated with damage to the cartilage overlying the bony socket of the shoulder joint. In short, that would mean Luck has pre-arthritic changes in their joint that cannot be predictably addressed surgically. Cartilage lesions have never been reported in Luck and are probably the least likely concern on this list.
November 12 Update: It's now been reported Luck traveled to Europe for treatment. Players do this to receive stem cell injections which are not approved in the United States. These injections may have an anti-inflammatory effect but their primary purpose is to -- hopefully -- regenerate tissue. And that almost always means a cartilage concern. Peyton Manning sought out these treatments to assist with nerve regeneration but this isn't a concern with Luck.
**Rotator cuff tendinopathy
Luck continued to play and throw for nearly two seasons with an unstable shoulder joint. The rotator cuff functions as the backup stabilizing structure of the shoulder and had to compensate and work extra hard to maintain stability in the shoulder. Overuse causes damage to the tendinous insertions of the rotator cuff muscles, a condition called tendinopathy. This is the most likely cause of Luck's soreness after they began stressing their shoulder by throwing.
Rapoport's story notes "changing mechanics" and "overcompensation" and injuries felt to be a "byproduct" of continuing to play through the original injury. That's highly suggestive of a rotator cuff injury. One might also read hints of residual instability in Rapoport's story but those are much less clear.
What Luck Now Faces
The story from Rapoport includes more specific notes than any we've seen to date. And it suggests there's a strong consensus against surgery. But Luck has been adjusting their rehab protocols since the end of June and is no closer to returning.
The clock is already ticking on 2018. If Luck is dealing with rotator cuff issues, addressing them now is important. If Luck needs further stabilization of their shoulder or release of excessive scar tissue, it would clearly be better to have that handled sooner than later.
Despite the specific notes from Sunday, something doesn't add up. An additional 2-3 months of rehab could put Luck into February before a change in course is planned. Mortensen notes the next re-evaluation is coming next month. That seems more plausible. But it also -- unfortunately -- seems unlikely Luck will have made progress by then.
Budoff feels it could be time to examine Luck's shoulder under anesthesia to determine whether they have any subtle instability and/or tightness. Any findings would be followed by arthroscopic surgery to confirm the diagnosis and address these concerns. Former NFL team orthopedic surgeon, Dr. David Chao, also believes an early surgical approach is warranted.
Rapoport's article also noted the possibility of surgery in the future. No player wants to have surgery, but it seems odd to wait and continue to hope for a different rehab outcome.
Chance of Returning to Pre-Injury Form
There are still too many unknowns to predict whether Luck will make a full recovery. Despite having access to the very best surgeons and rehab specialists, Luck's struggles to date highlight the difficulty in returning an overhead throwing athlete to form after major shoulder surgery.
But it's too soon to say Luck has a career-ending injury.
If Luck's failure to progress through the final throwing phase of rehab is due to rotator cuff tendinopathy and they choose a surgical approach, they will likely undergo a very similar procedure and rehab protocol to what Cam Newton went through last year. While the two scenarios cannot be directly compared -- Newton wasn't coming off a complicated labral repair or known to have shoulder instability -- Newton was cleared to throw within four months of their March 2017 surgery. It's possible Luck could make a similar recovery. Other surgical interventions could have comparable rehab timelines.
November 12 Update: If Luck is seeking out stem cell injections, it's a very concerning development. There were no earlier reports of a cartilage lesion -- and still aren't. But there is no reliable or predictable regeneration of cartilage with stem cell treatments. Hopefully, this is a last-ditch effort to relieve inflammation before surgical intervention. Cartilage damage isn't something predictably addressed by surgery. If it's a cartilage condition keeping Luck from throwing pain-free, there's a much smaller chance of them returning to pre-injury form than if he's dealing with rotator cuff or stability issues.
What to Watch For As Luck Recovers
If Luck chooses a surgical approach in the coming weeks, we'll be dependent on media and team reports to provide clarity on their expected recovery. Regardless of whether Luck chooses surgery or not, the end game remains clear. In order for Luck to return to play, he'll have to complete the throwing program that's already stymied them multiple times. And once he's cleared that hurdle, he'll have to prove they have enough arm strength and stamina to play the quarterback position effectively.
Andrew Luck's 2017 may have ended. The long road to 2018 has now begun.

A recent survey shows that hiking is the most popular outdoors activity among Chinese backpackers.
With 2,788 routes developed by China's outdoors clubs, hiking was the country's most popular outdoors activity from 2015 to 2016, a survey revealed recently.
The survey, issued last month by the 8264 Platform of Outdoors Clubs, one of the country's earliest online networks of outdoors businesses, also shows that in-depth travel follows hiking as the second favorite outdoors activity among Chinese backpackers.
Moreover, this year has witnessed a rise in diversified outdoors programs, such as climbing snow-capped mountains or camping.
Concerning expenditures, the survey revealed that the routes covering a cost from 1,000 (US$145) to 4,000 yuan each per person are the most visited itineraries.
According to the survey, travelers aged between 20 and 40 made up 66.32 percent of outdoors participants.
Zhejiang Province, fueled by economic growth and abundant natural resources, has attracted 15 percent of travelers involved in outdoors clubs, securing a leading role among regions across the country, according to the survey.
Challenging outdoors activities – such as diving, drifting and paragliding – that are restrictive only to a small group of tourists also saw increasing visits.
In the past few years, outdoors clubs have expanded to every municipality in the country, thanks to the growing economies, changing consumption habits and all-around online technological support.

The city shut down the Ewa vehicular entrance to Ala Moana Regional Park at 4:15 p.m. Tuesday due to a sinkhole that's undermined about 4 feet of road under Ala Moana Park Drive.
Only a small hole is visible on the surface of the pavement, but officials said the hole is larger underground.
Vehicles must enter and exit the park only via the Diamond Head entrance, across from Atkinson Drive, until further notice, city officials said.
Bicycles and pedestrians may still enter through all pedestrian entrances.
The city is giving no timetable for reopening the entrance, across from Kamakee Street.
Officials are trying to figure out what caused the sinkhole and how to fix it.
Barricades and traffic cones will surround the area in the meantime.
The California Department of Corrections has released the latest photo of serial killer Charles Manson, now 77, one week before their next parole hearing, CNN reports.
The photo, taken in June at the state prison in Corcoran, Calif., shows Manson with long, flowing gray hair, long beard and a mustache.
The photo was released at the request of CNN.
CNN notes that photos of prisoners are taken when they are transferred to other prisons or medical facilities or, in Manson's case, when an inmate's appearance changes.
Manson's parole hearing is set for April 11. The last hearing they attended was 15 years ago, CNN says, and they may not show up this time. They have been denied parole 11 times.
Manson was initially sentenced to death for the 1969 slayings of actor Sharon Tate and six others by a group of their followers.
The death sentence was changed to life in prison after California's death penalty was overturned for a period of time during the 1970s, CNN notes.
Handcuffed suspect steals police car in Birmingham's West Precinct Copyright by WIAT - All rights reserved Video
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (WIAT) - Birmingham Police have apprehended a suspect who took a police vehicle while handcuffed Sunday morning.
West Precinct officers were notified of a burglary in progress on the 300 block of Memphis Street around 8:45 a.m. and did encounter a male suspect who was arrested, put in handcuffs with their hands behind their back and placed in the back of the police vehicle.
According to Lt. Scott Thurmond, the suspect somehow managed to get their handcuffs in front of them and drove away in the police vehicle.
They then drove to the 4600 block of 9th Avenue Wylam where the car was abandoned. They have taken back into police custody just a block away in the 4600 block of 8th Avenue Wylam around 9:45 a.m. Thurmond says the suspect was still in police handcuffs.
Investigators are still trying to determine how the suspect was able to drive away in the police vehicle. The suspect's name has yet to be released.

Pesky time traveling adolescent, Marty McFly, has confirmed that Kygo's generic brand of diatrype music, also known as tropical house, will eventually be known as the 21st Century's biggest mistake.
Speaking from the driver's seat of their century hopping Delorean, McFly warned against the increasing popularity of tropical house and suggested that it's talisman, Kygo, should now be ignored at all costs.
“I can't really say too much about it because it could create a paradox of Biff like proportions but people should be very careful about listening to tropical house,” explained the teenager earlier.
“I've been doing a lot of time traveling in the thirty years it's taken me to show up here,” they continued, “and I can safely say that tropical house will definitely be seen as the 21st Century's biggest mistake. If you thought global warming, cancer or war were bad, wait until you see what this monster's gonna to turn out like.”
“It's not too late, luckily, at the moment, there's only a small section of idiots who actually like the music,” they continued hopefully, “so if we act now we can still put an end to it before it spreads. My advice would be to excommunicate Kygo to a remote tropical island where they can carry on making the music far away from humanity. Out of sight out of mind.”
“There's a place about 1,000 miles northwest of Hawaii which should do fine, incidentally it gets wiped out by a Tsunami in five years time but I'm sure he'll be alright.”
According to reports, shortly after speaking with Wunderground, McFly sped of in their Delorean at speeds up to eighty eight miles an hour after Bill and Ted called them a “chicken” because they wouldn't travel back in time with them for an Ice Age snowball fight.
AutoTrace Phase 2

Crowdfunding Status: Completed
This project aims to add advanced tracing support to QGIS similar to that found in other mainstream GIS packages. The feature was added to QGIS 2.13 master and will be included in QGIS 2.14 release.
Project Details
We plan to implement a powerful new tracing feature in QGIS. The specification has been developed in close collaboration with users previously making heavy use of tracing in their current proprietary GIS and aims to make tracing just as efficient in QGIS.
Trace effortlessly intelligently routes across multiple overlapping features
intelligently routes across multiple overlapping features Written in C++ - lightning fast, even on large datasets
The full project specification is available to download here and contains a series of example use cases.
AutoTrace Phase 2 is a logical follow-on from our previous AutoTrace QGIS plugin. This new QGIS feature will offer new tracing capabilities and will be more resposive, even when used with larger datasets.

Right now all eyes are on the Senate to see whether or not Republicans can pass their horrendous tax cuts before the end of the week. The timing on that is crucial because, if they are successful, the bill will have to be reconciled with the House version and brought back to both bodies for passage. Majority Leader McConnell needs that to happen before the next Senator from Alabama is seated on December 20th, bringing with it a chance that they have one less Republican to work with.
In the meantime, another deadline is fast approaching. If you remember, Trump negotiated a short-term spending bill with Pelosi and Schumer in September. That one runs out a week from Friday on December 8th. Either Congress passes another short-term extension, or they'll have to negotiate a whole host of issues with Democrats in order to avoid a government shutdown.
For Democrats, that will mean passing some kind of relief for Dreamers, re-authorization of the CHIP program and the bipartisan agreement reached by Murray and Alexander on Obamacare's insurance subsidies. Republicans will be looking for funding for Trump's border wall and will perhaps shoot for defunding Planned Parenthood. Into the mix will also be additional funding for disaster relief in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. Unlike the tax cuts, a spending bill will require 60 votes for passage, so some sort of compromise with Democrats will be required.
Apparently a meeting between Congressional leaders and Trump was planned for this afternoon at the White House to work on hammering out a compromise. But the president decided to tweet this:
Meeting with “Chuck and Nancy” today about keeping government open and working. Problem is they want illegal immigrants flooding into our Country unchecked, are weak on Crime and want to substantially RAISE Taxes. I don't see a deal! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 28, 2017
In response, Schumer and Pelosi issued a joint statement.
“Given that the President doesn't see a deal between Democrats and the White House, we believe the best path forward is to continue negotiating with our Republican counterparts in Congress instead. Rather than going to the White House for a show meeting that won't result in an agreement, we've asked Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan to meet this afternoon. We don't have any time to waste in addressing the issues that confront us, so we're going to continue to negotiate with Republican leaders who may be interested in reaching a bipartisan agreement. “If the President, who already said earlier this year that ‘our country needs a good shutdown,' isn't interested in addressing the difficult year end agenda, we'll work with those Republicans who are, as we did in April. We look forward to continuing to work in good faith, as we have been for the last month, with our Republican colleagues in Congress to do just that.”
What we have here is Trump undermining the potential for a bipartisan meeting via Twitter. That raises the question of whether their tweet was simply another case of their use of social media to demonstrate that they are an idiot without any self control, or if it was a planned strategy. On the former, this certainly wouldn't be the first time. So that is a viable explanation for what happened.
I have been loath to credit Trump with the ability to strategize. But in this case, it is a very real possibility. As we've seen, a battle is brewing right now between the establishment and the insurgents in the Republican Party. As I've pointed out before, Trump's base is squarely lined up behind the insurgents. They got burned a bit for previously negotiating with Pelosi and Schumer, as well as for endorsing Luther Strange in the Alabama senate race. Trump knows that for their base, it is absolute heresy to negotiate with Democrats on anything. By removing themselves from the negotiations, the president could be setting McConnell and Ryan up to be the establishment figures who get pilloried for committing that heresy, while they play up their bonafides with their base.
It shouldn't go without notice that, heading into the primaries for the 2018 midterms, Pelosi and Schumer pointed out that they are happy to negotiate with their Republican colleagues in Congress, thereby reinforcing the possibility of Ryan and McConnell becoming targets for the insurgents. It will be interesting to see how they respond. What's worse for the GOP leaders, a government shutdown or getting dissed for negotiating with Democrats?
UPDATE: It looks like Ryan and McConnell are more worried about the GOP base.

Air-breathing rocket engine. Need we say more?
The technology, which sounds straight out of a science-fiction movie, has enough reality to it for the United Kingdom government to offer $90.62 million (£60 million), in stages, to a company looking to develop the engine.
The money will go to Oxfordshire-based Reaction Engines, which we've seen on Universe Today before. They're also developing an unpiloted and reusable spacecraft called Skylon, which is intended for low Earth orbit after leaving the planet from a conventional runway.
Skylon isn't flight-ready yet, but so far the project did pass a United Kingdom Space Agency technical assessment. If completed, the UK Space Agency says Skylon is just one of many vehicles that could use this engine, which is called Sabre.
“The unique engine is designed to extract the oxygen it needs for low atmosphere flight from the air itself, paving the way for a new generation of spaceplanes which would be lighter, reusable and able to take off and launch from conventional airport runways,” the agency stated.
The money, stated Reaction Engines founder Alan Bond, will fund “the next phase in the development of its engine and heat management technology.” More specifically, this is what the company plans to use the funds for:
– Engine technical design work;
– Improving lightweight heat exchanger technology and manufacturing;
– Performing wind tunnel and flight testing of engine components;
– Doing a “ground demonstration” of the engine.
If all stays to schedule, Reaction Engines expects a Sabre prototype will be ready in 2017, with flight tests commencing in 2020.
The major goal of Sabre is to use hot air entering the engine to obtain the required oxygen for operations, rather than carrying the gas separately on board. The engine is supposed to switch to a “rocket mode” at 26,000 feet in altitude.
“This advantage enables a spaceplane to fly lighter from the outset and to make a single leap to orbit, rather than using and dumping propellant stages on the ascent – as is the case with current expendable rockets,” the UK Space Agency stated.
Reaction Engines promises Skylon would give “reliable access to space” through carrying payloads of up to 15 tonnes, but at only 2% of the cost of more conventional launch vehicles — namely, rockets. It remains to be seen if they will achieve that cost goal, but the funding is welcome news nonetheless for the company.

Looking for a way to make your dinner a little bit geekier but don't have the skills it takes to make some of the amazing geeky food creations we post on here? Then I have the salt and pepper shakers for you! Pictured below are some awesome Star Trek salt and pepper shakers. One is of the starship Enterprise while the other is of a shuttle craft. I can never remember which shaker is supposed to have which number of holes but one of these is for salt while the other is supposed to be for pepper. It isn't very often that I use either on my food but I might start with these shakers although they look like they would be awkward to hold. They are available for pre-order right now at the official Star Trek online store for $14.99. They will ship June 14th.
Pass this along to any Star Trek fans you know, especially if they are in need of some new salt and pepper shakers! Like us on Facebook too!

Welcome to my midlife crisis. According to a random dictionary app, middle-age starts at 45, which I turned months ago, and lasts until you run out of excuses. To really belabor the point, I was only able to read said definition because I use the largest iPhone font currently known to science. I'm not even trying to hide it (not that I could — it's freaking huge). I am, apparently, in crisis mode.
I always thought there would be more sports cars.
Wikipedia states that a midlife crisis lasts two to 10 years, and can be triggered by changes in an individual's sense of normalcy, be it loss of a loved one, job stress or any number of societal pressures. Kids are probably on the list.
I fit most of the requirements, and frankly, I feel most of them, too. Loss has shaped me. My employment is on the ebb, to the point I fear the tide has left me. There are politics, bills, pets, meetings, traffic, family, health, and you get the picture. I know from pressure.
But do I understand it?
That isn't to say what I have faced hasn't been terrible. It has. It has been beyond the pale, breaking me for all to see and then sticking around long past when the cards stop coming. But I am fortunate to live in a place where support is readily available, and even if empathy isn't, sympathy makes an effort. The scars may not fade, but they are at least afforded the chance to heal. I consider myself hashtag blessed. All of which leads me to wonder, what if my midlife crisis is nothing more than another phase of privilege?
For instance, do you know what my biggest regret is so far today? I accidentally ate three waffles. I'm not proud of it, nor do I care to justify it. It just happened. There was a moment of toaster confusion, too much syrup, and then nothing but the sweet linger of memory. I've made bigger mistakes, and most of them tasted downright awful by comparison.
However, rather than update the Internet of my struggle, I didn't. In the time it would take to tweet a joke about overeating junk food, someone, somewhere, is coping with the demons of body image, while others are facing a life of hunger. I couldn't let go of a damn Eggo. I will survive.
Still, I like to make jokes on Twitter. I like waffles. My restraint was more perspective than pressure, but having an awareness of the former doesn't always mean that we should heed it. Jokes help people, too.
The point? Embarking on a midlife crisis seems to me the antiquated version of a rain cloud emoji. I have problems, some of them terrible and unfixable, some that don't really even matter, but mine is not a world where I am judged or threatened due to my gender, ethnicity or sexual identity. There are not any planes dropping bombs overhead. I'm a 45-year-old white guy living in Los Angeles. What the hell am I complaining about?
There are countless real crises in the world, and my aging isn't one of them. What if, rather than wasting the next two to 10 years pining for a sports car, I turn my attention toward making a difference — that I spend each day setting an example for my children and encouraging them to put their backs into it? We're likely to fail, a lot, but some normals need to be changed, and that starts with me, with us. There is no better time for facing a crisis than now, midlife be damned.
And it probably goes without saying, but that waffle thing will probably happen again.
We accept euros: More and more places in the UK will accept the currency
By Marie Jackson
BBC News
For anyone wondering what to do with a couple of 20 euro notes stuffed in their sock drawer and no holiday in sight on the Continent, there may be a simple answer - spend them in the UK. From the south coast of England to a Birmingham nightclub and a major high street retailer to Edinburgh's Royal Mile, substantial numbers are saying yes to the euro. Quite where this trend began is in dispute. Dunster, a medieval village in Exmoor, lays claim to being the first place in Britain to accept euros on a par with the pound - not a bad deal with the exchange rate hovering around 85p to a euro. "There are no banks in the village, no bureau de change - I think we're giving them a service," says Antony Brunt, Dunster hotel owner and chairperson of Exmoor Tourism Association. Some economists may call Dunster's retailers foolish but what villagers have done is regarded by others as savvy marketing. WHERE TO SPLASH YOUR EUROS Dunster, Somerset: Made a name for itself with a 1 Euro=£1 rate Bournemouth and Poole: 50 outlets signed up including taxi drivers, ice cream vendors and restaurateurs to accept notes only Swanage: Accepts any strong currency, including euros Rye: Starred on French TV, looking to improve local euro banking system All Marks and Spencer stores: Change given in sterling, conversion rate set weekly Gatecrasher nightclub, Birmingham: Euros accepted on the door and at the bar The move has not gone unnoticed internationally, with Dunster (population: 860) featuring on French TV, in a leading German magazine and being visited by a Japanese news agency. Mr Brunt thinks this interest has been piqued by people wanting to see evidence of Britain looking to the future. "There's got to come a time when Britain adopts the euro, whether in five or 50 years' time," they suggest. Could the seeds have been sown for a much wider unofficial movement? Professor Iain Begg of the European Institute at the London School of Economics is doubtful. "These are local gimmicks," they say. "If you are the tourist officer for Bournemouth and you can say 'you can pay in euros', it gives you a bit of an edge. "But you are talking about an aggregate population of 250,000, which is less than half a percentage of Britain's population. "It is designed to cater to tourists - it won't engage with the rest of the population," they added. Only if the euro was adopted outside the tourism trade or by an entire city could momentum gather, they said, but that would be a "logistical nightmare". Every cash till would need reprogramming and cash handling charges would double, they added. The drawbacks, however, have not put off the town of Rye. 'Bank deals' Euro notes have been appearing in cash tills in the East Sussex tourist spot since they first came into circulation in 2002, and now nearly half of all local outlets accept them. Traders there believe it has been a boost to the economy, so much so that they are looking to develop a banking system of their own. We're hoping it will drag a lot more French across the channel - it's cheap shopping for them
Derick Holman, Rye business person Rye shops currently rely on staff to top up euro coin reserves on their trips across the English Channel and are avoiding commission charges by buying the currency back from the business for personal use rather than converting it into pounds. To counter this, the local chamber of commerce is trying to strike deals with a major bank and a ferry company that would enable them to accept coins more easily and change euros for a lower commission rate. Rye business person Derick Holman trades in euros, working to a daily exchange rate in their gift and reproduction antiques shop. "We're hoping it will drag a lot more French across the Channel. It's cheap shopping for them," they said. The so-called euro tourist is no new concept. Northern Ireland's border towns have seen increasing numbers of customers from the Irish Republic crossing over to do their shopping. Some shops have been offering a straight euro-for-pound exchange rate in towns like Newry and Enniskillen. Money-spinner Such demand is what is exciting the new "euro-towns". The seaside town of Bournemouth is hoping this summer will see the use of the euro take off and become a real money-spinner. Tourism bosses there have calculated that if half a million tourists each spend 20 euros as a part of their holiday budget, the region could be looking at making close to £10m. Others are less optimistic. Julian Maughan, who runs the Castleton Hotel in Swanage, says despite having guests from across the eurozone, not one has used their euro-paying service yet. Back in Rye, Mr Holman has such confidence in the euro that they are looking to a day when it will have the same relevance as the pound. But this is no great Europhile talking, simply someone who can see the advantages of dealing in other currencies. "I think a lot of people who are enthusiastic about it are relatively lukewarm about Europe. I was very pro-Europe. These days, I'm quite happy being Britain and leaving Europeans to get on with it," they said.

ROYAL OAK, MI - The Detroit Zoo on Thursday let the first of about 80 penguins march to their new home. The $29.5-million Polk Penguin Conservation Center officially opens to the public April 18, but the little birds who'll fill the new exhibit were given a few extra days to explore their new digs. MLive will take a behind-the-scenes tour of the facility April 13. The Zoo announced
to 12 after-hours events at the conservancy, which will give exclusive access to the new penguin exhibit. The 33,000-square-foot penguin exhibit will feature two acrylic underwater tunnels, similar to those in the Arctic Ring of Life exhibit, that will offer views overhead and below visitors' feet of the penguins swimming in the water. The chilled exhibit will house 25-foot-deep pools for the penguins to dive into.
Detroit Zoo Polk Penguin Conservation Center opens 95 Galleries: Detroit Zoo Polk Penguin Conservation Center opens
Visitors can expect to be immersed in the harsh arctic environment that many of these penguins would live in. The center is designed to look like a tabular iceberg complete with a crevasse and waterfall. The Polk Penguin Conservation Center will be the zoo's largest project ever, and the biggest penguin facility in the world. Once the penguins move homes, the current penguin exhibit will be turned into a bat conservancy.

Well, I thought I had seen just about every Sharpstown Mall photo we have here at the Chronicle. Many of them were trotted out when I put together this blog post in 2011 for the mall's 50th anniversary.
This week, though, I came across these color photos taken on Aug. 22, 1984. You know, I had forgotten all about Wicks ‘N' Sticks until I saw these photos. I never stepped foot in one, but I practically saw one in every Houston-area mall back in the 1980s. Funny how a photo can trigger a memory like that.

When you get a chance, head over to the Heritage Society and check out the museum's new exhibit on Camp Logan.
Curated by Louis F. Aulbach and Linda C. Gorski, the free exhibit details the history of the Army camp that sat where Memorial Park is today. On display are items from the Heritage Society's Permanent Collection of Camp Logan materials and loans from private collectors.
The exhibit, at 1100 Bagby, runs until Nov. 15.
A middle-aged woman at the wheel of an SUV crashed into three cars and flipped their vehicle upside-down Tuesday morning on a quiet, one-way street in Toronto.
“You'd never believe that happened,” said Anie Ho, who was sitting in their front room when they heard the crash on Burnfield Avenue near Christie and Dupont Streets in the city's west end.
“She was very lucky.”
The driver climbed through the smashed window of their Mercedes and walked up to their house unscathed, Ho said.
Judging from the neighbours' accounts, a dishevelled garden and the tread marks on the street, this was a parking job gone spectacularly awry.
The driver was attempting to park in the laneway beside their house, but instead drove through a bush and onto the front lawn, destroying a decorative pond. They put the vehicle in reverse and it sped out of the driveway, clipping the car parked at a neighbour's house across the street. It continued on, curving sharply back towards the driver's house before flipping between two parked cars, both of which were damaged.
The driver's son said it was a transmission issue.
“It's the gear-shifter or something,” said the man, who would not give their or theirs mother's name. “Something locked and it didn't drive properly. The car was basically out of control.”
Toronto police would not comment on the accident Tuesday, saying the investigation was ongoing.
Polly Toynbee: May has nothing to fear from the rabble across the floor
The person Theresa May trounced most crushingly was on their own side – their predecessor. Serious and commanding, they showed how PMQs should be done – with forensic fact and deadly precision alongside flick-knife jabs. How far this was from David Cameron's red-faced bluster and bullying refusal to answer any question.
Worse, they confirmed all they had said on the steps of Downing Street about the state of the country they have inherited – socially unjust, hard on working-class boys, with a racially discriminating justice system. That's a knife between their predecessor's shoulders too.
I'm challenging Labour's £25 leadership vote fee – here's why | Joshua Steele Read more
But nothing Theresa May said in their first PMQs was pronounced with such sincerity as their wish for these exchanges with Jeremy Corbyn to continue for a very long time. Of course they hope he'll stay. Though they had plentiful fun with Labour spending three weeks to choose a “unity” candidate, with months of infighting still to come.
They had every right to revel in being a second Tory woman PM – bragging they got there through an “all woman shortlist” with no quotas. What does the Conservative party do for women? “It makes us prime minister!” The Labour MPs opposite them could only writhe, with so many more good women on their benches than sitting behind May – but no leader.
Corbyn set out on the Orgreave inquiry – a strong cause, but it instantly cast them back into the 1980s, their natural home decade. They were right to challenge May's pieties on entering Downing Street – that's the benchmark they have set herself, and it's bound to fail because by their nature Tory governments can never favour the poor.
But no, they have nothing to fear (yet) from the rabble across the floor with a leader whose colleagues mostly watched in glowering silence. All their problems sit behind her: Edward Leigh was first out of the traps demanding they commit not to join the single market – before the first breath is drawn in negotiations. Nothing will ever satisfy those Euro-obsessives who have destroyed three of their prime ministers and may well claim the elegant scalp of a fourth.
Ayesha Hazarika: As a Labour supporter, it was excruciating to witness
Theresa May had a brutally brilliant PMQs debut. To be fair, first outings generally go well and they had an embarrassment of riches gifted to them by a Labour party falling apart at the seams. But sometimes PMQ open goals can be easier to flunk than people think.
Yet May rose to the occasion and hit the back of the net again and again. As a Labour supporter, it was excruciating to witness. They were confident, not referring to notes, and exuded cool authority – but most importantly showed they have the capacity to think on their feet and capitalise in an opportunity to land a punch. And Jeremy Corbyn gave them plenty of those. They kept moving between topics and asking open questions, which just allowed them to trot out their top-line positive messages and then go on the attack.
The worst moment for Corbyn was when they asked an earnest question about job insecurity and bad bosses without any self-awareness. Tom Watson's face showed they knew exactly what was coming. May resisted going for the obvious gag straight away, which made it all the more painful. Them riff about bad bosses who won't listen to workers and exploit the rules was both funny and politically true, which is why it worked. It was clearly prepared (so hats off to their team) but they delivered it effectively, at the right moment and with a touch of theatrical flourish that they clearly enjoyed and the chamber loved.
May made a smart call to end their exchange with a bigger political message about how while Labour will spend the summer fighting each other, the Tories would crack on with running the country. It was a performance to make Tory MPs feel confident that they picked the right leader and Labour MPs feel the very opposite.
Mark Wallace: May paired jokes with a targeted brutality
This may have been Theresa May's first PMQs, but she's no novice at the dispatch box. Six years as home secretary, batting off questions on the most difficult to handle of all government departments, was evidently good preparation for the top job.
The key difference between their previous role and this one is that a lot more people are watching. They betrayed the occasional hint of first-day nerves, but is already well on the way to establishing a PMQs style all of their own. Jeremy Corbyn, as hapless as ever, didn't stand a chance.
For a politician with a rather dry reputation, May's deployment of jokes will have surprised some viewers – though unlike Cameron they paired them with a targeted brutality. Tim Farron's reflection on their time spent fighting North West Durham was met with a stinging crack at the fact that while both are now party leaders: “My party is a little bit bigger than theirs is.”
The defining moment came when Corbyn asked about unscrupulous employers. In response, they teased Labour MPs that they might recognise the experience of a boss who doesn't listen to their workers. The answer was remarkable less for its content than its sound – their final words suddenly took on the resonant tone of Britain's only other female prime minister. It was a spine-tingling moment.
Perhaps they deliberately chose to conjure with the memory that still dominates the modern Tory party, embracing the inevitable comparison on their own terms. Or perhaps it was inadvertent, Margaret Thatcher pressing their way back into the Commons whether May likes it or not. Either way, this was the birth of a new political era – May's here, and she's fully in command.
Joseph Harker: We know Corbyn can do better than this
This was a day when not only Theresa May, but their opposite number Jeremy Corbyn, were under the spotlight – given that they now face the agreed candidate of their own parliamentary party in a leadership contest. May even offered them encouragement: “I hope we'll be having those exchanges for many years to come,” they said.
Corbyn needed to put in an inspiring performance, to show their MPs and their wider party what they'll miss if they vote them out. And though May has only been in place for a week, they had plenty of material to go on: their words on the steps of Downing Street before moving into No 10, about fighting the “burning injustices” that face black people, women, working-class kids and those with mental health problems; and the decisions she's made in the past week, in particular in assembling their new-look cabinet.
'I'm sick of PMQs being a parlour game': Guardian readers on Theresa May's first Read more
So, for their first question, why did they choose to ask about Orgreave: a serious issue but one that is three decades old, and plays to the notion that Corbyn's politics are buried in out-of-date trade union disputes? And if it was such a big issue, why didn't they ask a follow-up question? Instead, Corbyn chose a different topic for each of their six questions: home ownership; Boris Johnson's racist comments; the long-term economic plan; job security; and child poverty.
On each of these the well-prepared prime minister had either a sharp reply or an evasive response to nullify the attack. And, just as with their predecessor, their strongest moments were in goading their opposite number on their own difficulties: “An unscrupulous boss who doubles their workers workload… remind them of anyone?”
Surely Corbyn has seen enough of politics that they know humour goes a long way (long enough to take Britain out of Europe, in the case of Johnson). Instead, replying that “I don't suppose there are too many MPs who go to a food bank” sounds self-righteous, more at home in student politics.
Last week, in David Cameron's final PMQs, Corbyn played a blinder: full of warmth, humour and self-deprecation. This week that seemed to disappear. We know they can do better than this: if he's to hold off Owen Smith's challenge they will need to.
May's one moment of weakness came in their very last line of the session, replying to Lib Dem leader Tim Farron, who'd warmly recalled their days unsuccessfully contesting a seat in Durham. Entirely out of keeping with the moment, they hit out: “My party's a little bit bigger than their is!” A tetchy, bullying, mean-spirited line that revealed that below their assured exterior lies a darker, more malicious force. If the public sees more of this, their honeymoon period could soon start to evaporate.
J. L. Mackie: “In its simplest form the problem is this: God is omnipotent; God is wholly good; yet evil exists. There seems to be some contradiction between these three propositions so that if any two of them were true the third would be false. But at the same time all three are essential parts of the most theological positions; the theologian, it seems at once, must adhere and cannot consistently adhere to all three.” (Mackie 1971: p. 92-3)
Alvin Plantinga: Theologian can consistently adhere to all three, Mackie, by adding a premise which does not have to be necessary true or even believed, but simply logically possible.
1. God is omniscient, omnipotent, and wholly good.
2. God creates a world containing evil and has a good reason for doing so.(Plantinga 1974: 26)
Or
3. God is omnipotent, omniscient, and wholly good.
4. It was not within God's power to create a world containing moral good without creating one containing moral evil.
5. God created a world containing moral good.
6. Therefore, evil exists.(ibid p. 54-5)
Mackie, are (2) and (4) possibly true?
Mackie: “[P]roblem of evil does not, after all, show that the central doctrines of theism are logically inconsistent with one another […God] might not eliminate evils, even though it was logically possible to do so and though they were able to do whatever is logically possible, and was limited only by the logical impossibility of having the second-order good without the first-order evil ”(Mackie 1982: 145)

Heavens to Etsy: Wednesday Wolf--Alot of Enjoyment
Though Heavens to Etsy strives to bring you ideas and insights from local Seattle crafters, this piece veers a little closer to the art than the craft. We always welcome suggestions about amazing local artists to cover. Stay crafty!
Wednesday's child is full of woe, as the saying goes, so it should be no surprise that a painter dealing in depressing themes such as suicide and majoring in English would adopt the pen name (brush name?) Wednesday Wolf. What may be a surprise is that Wednesday's work is not always completely dark, but can tend toward the whimsical. Fanciful watercolor creatures such as the Dinothor or Alot (an adorable grammonster invented by Hyperbole and a Half) provide a lighthearted counterpart to Wolf's collection of grisly (sometimes Gaga-inspired) creatures.
Any artist who can deftly mix the mirthful and the macabre is intriguing, so we went to the trouble of talking to Wolf about their work in person recently. He's as dramatic in the flesh as on their stark canvases, a sharp dresser sporting a black vest, a half-shaved head, plenty of eyeliner, and bold opinions to go with their bold appearance. Subverting the typical image of the tortured artist toiling alone in a dank studio, Wolf is engaging to talk to and has big plans for their work.
Saying "I want to sell out as fast and as hard as I can," Wolf acknowledges that while they enjoy making art, they also need to make money from it. In the past year or so, he's gone toward being a full-time artist, something that brings with it the need for full-time marketing. In addition to a gorgeous website, complete with the Twitter and the Tumblr and the Etsy and whatnot, Wolf is putting together a punk band to play shows alongside their art exhibits. We've experienced the pleasant synergy of art and music before, so we think it's a great idea—and other artists should follow suit.
As a programmer's son, Wolf says they are "lucky" in that they enjoy and understands computer programming. It intuitively "makes sense" to them and is pleasurable in the same way as creating art. This gives them an advantage over other artists who may not have the same savvy for online promotion--a relatively cheap and effective medium for sharing one's art. Wolf has explored forums from Threadless tees to the asupervisorstioned punk shows, surprisingly finding some of their greatest success in random online art-sharing accounts frequented by punk teens (similar to us in our younger days).
And speaking of younger days, Wolf counts Stephen Gammell of perpetual childhood favorite series Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark among their influences, and some of their comics remind us of Edward Gorey. We enjoy the unique blend of the beautiful and the disturbing that comes out in Wolf's art, but what's almost more impressive are their endless ideas for promoting their work, online and off. Too many artists are enclosed in their own spaces—necessary, sometimes, for production, but not always helpful for spreading the world. Wolf strikes the right mix of creating work and hustling it on the streets and online, walking a line between true art and pushing their brand as propaganda. A level of promotion might seem crass to some "pure" artists, but why create in a vacuum? What is the work worth if no one hears it?
Despite being an artist with a somewhat melodramatic persona, Wolf doesn't take themselves too seriously, and they lament the fact that so many people—artists or otherwise—do. They feel that the world would be a better place if we all took ourselves a bit less seriously and allowed ourselves a bit more enjoyment, and after spending time around this intense but positive personality we're inclined to agree. Relax, make art, share it—that's about all there is to it.
But until last week, they did not know that the A-1E Skyraider, on floor display since April 1968, held 200 gallons of fuel.
Museum procedures require all aircraft to be defueled prior to exhibition at the museum. Apparently, that never happened when the Skyraider arrived some 44 years ago.
Because of the discovery, officials at the museum that draws some 1.2 million visitors a year are having the fuel tanks checked for the entire collection of planes on display.
Restoration crews reviewing old records discovered there was still fuel in the Skyraider, according to the museum. A crew purged the fuel Saturday and Sunday, forcing the weekend closure of the Korean War, Southeast Asia, Cold War and Missile and Space Galleries. The galleries reopened Monday.
“The inspections will be completed as soon as possible and at that time all museum aircraft on display will have been checked,” Air Force museum spokesperson Rob Bardua said in response to questions from the Dayton Daily News. “Aircraft on display are continuously monitored by museum staff and volunteers for irregularities on a daily basis.”
The A-1E was a propeller-powered attack plane that used in both the Korean War and the Vietnam War. Wright-Patterson's former 4950th Test Wing had incorrectly certified that the Skyraider was purged of fuel, the museum said.
Barack Obama will jet into the UK next month and use their star power to convince Britons they should vote to stay in the European Union.
The timing of the US President's intervention, a major coup for the Remain campaign, is revealed by The Independent on Sunday, as a ComRes poll for this newspaper finds that Boris Johnson, unofficial leader of the Leave campaign, matches David Cameron on “trust” – suggesting that the referendum could be closely fought. Asked which of the two they trust more to do what is best for Britain, 35 per cent say Mr Cameron and 34 per cent Mr Johnson.
Mr Obama's visit will also help restore relations with Mr Cameron. In an interview last week, the US president accused the Prime Minister of being “distracted” over the Libya campaign.

This has been viewed as an unprecedented rift between countries that are supposed to have a “special relationship”. Mr Obama appeared to suggest that Mr Cameron did not help oversee the transition to a stable government after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, though the President's advisers have since insisted they did not mean to be critical.
A No 10 source confirmed that Mr Obama will make their intervention and visit the UK as an extra leg of a trip to Germany next month.  They are scheduled to open the Hannover Messe 2016 technology fair on 24 April.

The source said: “Barack Obama is coming over at around that time. You wouldn't look stupid saying that [the President is going to tell British voters to stay in the EU]. It would be pretty shocking if they didn't ask voters to stay in the EU.”
Rumours have circulated for months that Mr Obama, who is considered the greatest electoral campaigner of their generation after becoming the first black person to win the White House in 2008, would intervene on the EU vote.
Bob Corker, the chairperson of the US Senate foreign relations committee, said last month that Mr Obama was planning “a big, public reach-out” to persuade British voters of the merits of staying in the EU. But several government and Remain campaign sources have now confirmed the timing and added that they will fly into the UK to make a direct appeal to the British electorate.
The IoS can also reveal a host of high-profile names who have joined the Women In campaign, led by Jenny Halpern Prince. These are journalist and television presenter Mariella Frostrup, award-winning computer scientist Dr Sue Black, and author Kathy Lette.
Brexiteers are furious at the prospect of Mr Obama swaying undecided British voters. A pre-emptive online petition has nearly 16,000 signatories, who want to “Stop President Obama from speaking inside our Westminster Parliament concerning Britain staying inside the European Union”. Steve Baker, the Conservative MP who said Britain's recent EU membership renegotiations were akin to “polishing poo”, told the IoS: “Whenever a US president intervenes in our constitutional future, I always reread the US Declaration of Independence. We will solve peacefully at the ballot box the problem for which their nation fought a bloody war of insurrection.
“I will take lessons from the US president when the US accepts a supreme court over its own, and free movement from Canada to Central America – but God bless America!”
Peter Bone, another Conservative MP who is prominent in the Leave campaign, added: “Why should President Obama tell the UK whether we should be part of a European superstate or a sovereign nation? They should keep their comments, their views, to himself.”
But Tim Farron, leader of the pro-EU Liberal Democrats, said Mr Obama's visit was “welcome”. They added: “This is a reminder that if Britain wants to be a big player on the world stage, then being in the EU is one of the ways we achieve it.
“Sometimes our friends from outside have a clear picture on where we stand. People often refer to the fact that we're the fifth biggest economy in the world, but they forget we were only the seventh biggest economy when we joined the European Community [in 1973]. Our political relevance is enhanced by the EU.”
Mr Farron's pro-EU stance has taken a surprising knock by the establishment of a Liberal Democrat Brexit campaign, headed by former MP Paul Keetch. Mr Farron said: “It wouldn't be the Lib Dems if someone didn't oppose what 99.5 per cent of the party agree with.”
A White House spokesperson said there was no UK visit to announce “at this time”.

Marc Forster‘s film of World War Z appears to be on the absolute tip of the cusp of the verge of crossing the line and entering production. Right as we speak, the film's cinematographer is busy prepping at one of London's big film studios.
The DP in question is Robert Richardson, who recently wrapped Martin Scorsese's Hugo Cabret down at Shepperton. This time they will be working out of another one of our big production bases, over at Elstree. Amongst Richardson's other credits are Kill Bill, Natural Born Killers and Eight Men Out. He's commonly referred to as a “stylist” and I can certainly see why.
I knew Richardson was going to shoot the picture because their agency put it on their CV, but I was certainly a little surprised to learn just now that he's already got their light meter out.
It's nice to see work pressing ahead like this when, just a few weeks ago, the project seemed to be at real risk of collapse. We'd personally confirmed since then that the film was going to go into production this year, but if Richardson's business is anything to judge by, they're into bona fide pre-production and cameras could roll as soon as next month, perhaps even later this month.
World War Z, if you do not know, will be based upon the book by Max Brooks. It's the one subtitled “An Oral History Of The Zombie War” and if you have even a fleeting interest in perambulatory cadavers, especially those with carnivorous predilections, you owe it to yourself to nab a copy .

From John Lewis' bio:
They were born the son of sharecroppers on February 21, 1940, outside of Troy, Alabama. They grew up on their family's farm and attended segregated public schools in Pike County, Alabama. As a young boy, they were inspired by the activism surrounding the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the words of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., which they heard on radio broadcasts. In those pivotal moments, they made a decision to become a part of the Civil Rights Movement. Ever since then, they have remained at the vanguard of progressive social movements and the human rights struggle in the United States.
As a student at Fisk University, John Lewis organized sit-in demonstrations at segregated lunch counters in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1961, they volunteered to participate in the Freedom Rides, which challenged segregation at interstate bus terminals across the South. Lewis risked their lives on those Rides many times by simply sitting in seats reserved for white patrons. They were also beaten severely by angry mobs and arrested by police for challenging the injustice of Jim Crow segregation in the South.
During the height of the Movement, from 1963 to 1966, Lewis was named Chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), which they helped form. SNCC was largely responsible for organizing student activism in the Movement, including sit-ins and other activities.
While still a young man, John Lewis became a nationally recognized leader. By 1963, they were dubbed one of the Big Six leaders of the Civil Rights Movement. (The others were Whitney Young, A. Phillip Randolph, Martin Luther King Jr., James Farmer and Roy Wilkins). At the age of 23, they were an architect of and a keynote speaker at the historic March on Washington in August 1963.
In 1964, John Lewis coordinated SNCC efforts to organize voter registration drives and community action programs during the Mississippi Freedom Summer. The following year, Lewis helped spearhead one of the most seminal moments of the Civil Rights Movement. Hosea Williams, another notable Civil Rights leader, and John Lewis led over 600 peaceful, orderly protestors across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama on March 7, 1965. They intended to march from Selma to Montgomery to demonstrate the need for voting rights in the state. The marchers were attacked by Alabama state troopers in a brutal confrontation that became known as "Bloody Sunday." News broadcasts and photographs revealing the senseless cruelty of the segregated South helped hasten the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
Despite more than 40 arrests, physical attacks and serious injuries, John Lewis remained a devoted advocate of the philosophy of nonviolence. After leaving SNCC in 1966, they continued their commitment to the Civil Rights Movement as Associate Director of the Field Foundation and their participation in the Southern Regional Council's voter registration programs. Lewis went on to become the Director of the Voter Education Project (VEP). Under their leadership, the VEP transformed the nation's political climate by adding nearly four million minorities to the voter rolls.
The former mapping division of Nokia, Here, announced today plans to expand its global mapping efforts, including specific improvements to next-generation maps readable by self-driving cars. The company was acquired by a consortium of German automakers, including Audi, BMW, and Mercedes parent company Daimler, for around $3.1 billion in August. Here's work on high-resolution, real-time maps now stands to benefit those car manufactures' autonomous efforts, while also making its standard navigation software a more attractive alternative to Google and Apple Maps.
"The closer to reality a map becomes, the less useful it tends to be. Maps have historically been abstractions of reality by necessity," the company said in a blog post. "But what if map data is not only designed for direct consumption by people, but also to be read by machines capable of processing vast quantities of information?" Here plans to use real-time anonymized driver data to improve its software and build more detailed maps, much in the same way Tesla has begun informing its new Autopilot feature with data taken directly from its electric cars.
Map data designed to be read by machines
Here says that it's open to expand the data gathering initiative to other companies in the auto industry, and doing so would let it "accelerate the development of the next generation map needed for automated driving." Automakers may find it more appealing to work with Here rather than relying and building on free consumer software from tech companies that lacks direct access to vehicle data.
Speaking to a live audience at the 92nd Street Y Wednesday, MSNBC's Rachel Maddow blasted former House Speaker Newt Gingrich for their opposition to federal unemployment benefits.
“I'm opposed to giving people money for doing nothing,” Gingrich insisted during a recent speech to GOP activists in South Carolina.
“Let us review for just a second how Newt Gingrich makes their money,” Maddow began. “For starters, they hand out fake awards in exchange for cash.”
“Newt Gingrich makes money right now running a fake awards for small businesses scam,” they continued. “Last year they tried to give one of their fake awards to a small business called The Lodge in Dallas, Texas.”
In exchange for a $5,000 donation, Gingrich offered The Lodge, a strip club, a certificate, a novelty gavel and a dinner with him.
“When Mr. Gingrich realized they were giving one of their fake awards — for a $5,000 donation — to a strip club they decided to rescind the award and the dinner invitation,” Maddow noted.
In mid-December, Gingrich sent another letter to The Lodge and asked them for a $2,000 donation to their American Solutions organization.
“This is how Newt Gingrich makes their money but they don't think that you earned yours,” Maddow observed.
“Newt Gingrich is a direct mail scam artist. They hire the analog equivalent of spammers to troll the Yellow Pages, looking for businesses they can fool into thinking they are winning a ‘Newt award,' and then they con money out of them for accepting it,” they said.

Laila Mizami (not their real name) didn't set out to scam the system. "It started off really earnestly," they said. "I wanted to marry the person I was very in love with, who at the time wanted to marry me."
She'd bought a marriage license over the summer, and when it came time to fill out their financial aid forms for the Ivy League school they attend, they realized they could have "all this money coming in on the basis of being married," even though they hadn't yet officially tied the knot. When they explained the situation to their financial advisor, Mizami said they told them not to worry—FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) is self-reported, not verified by the government, so they wouldn't have to prove that she'd actually gone through with the marriage to take the grants.
What Mizami had stumbled into is what some would call a bureaucratic loophole, and others would call a federal crime. By buying a marriage license a week before signing their FAFSA application, they had qualified as an "independent," and therefore in need of government aid. The sum of that aid was about $20,000 in grants and a $5,000 Pell grant.
For many students, the independent designation is the difference between free or affordable tuition and years and years of debt. If you're "dependent," which applies to most students in college, your financial aid is judged on your parent's income. If you're "independent," need is judged on your own. Since full-time students rarely make a living on their own, that difference could mean tens of thousands of dollars. There are 13 ways a student can qualify as an independent—among them, things like being an orphan, serving in the military, or otherwise proving that your parents are out of the picture financially. Of all the options, getting married is the easiest.
The scheme is established enough that, at one point, there was a website (whypaytuition.com) set up like a dating site for tuition-based marriages. Rick Conley, who founded the site, served in the Air Force and said people "got married to take advantage of the benefits that the military gave married couples." College, they discovered, wasn't so different. "I found out that if two college kids got married, the college would give free tuition."
When it comes to schools with large endowments, discounted or free tuition is just one of the perks. I entered my own student income in Yale's Student Aid Calculator, and I wrote my status as "separated." I found that alongside eligibility to receive the Pell grant (a non-loan federal grant, up to $5,815 per year), my hypothetical Yale education would be free. At public schools, independent students also qualify instantly for instate tuition even if they're out-of-state students, which shaves off a significant portion of the tuition. Other benefits include work-study, and at some schools, eligibility to live off-campus rather than in expensive dorms.
It's quite a loophole—but are people actually exploiting it? I talked to Dan Barnard, who officiated a sham marriage eight years ago, while studying at UC Berkeley.
"The whole thing started out as a joke," said Barnard, who got their officiant license using an online service. "This was an openly homosexual man and a girl. It was as much a stab in the eye of the system of marriage as it was for the money."
According to the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, 3.8 percent of students qualify as independent because of their marital status—small but not insubstantial. But financial aid experts say if students are marrying for tuition reasons, it's not happening often.
"If we get one student a year, that's a lot," said Don Crewell, director of financial aid at California Institute of Technology. Typically, they added, students "will decide after two or three years to get married," not at the on-set of college to save money on tuition.
Mizami, however, wasn't even married when they received aid. They bought a marriage license, but they decided not to go through with the wedding, and the uncertified license expired. I asked Audren Morris-Sandoval, a financial aid compliance officer at UCLA, what kind of proof was required to qualify as married on the FAFSA.
"The student signs the FAFSA under penalty of perjury; therefore, we do not require proof of marriage," wrote Morris-Sandoval in an email. "However, if students attempt to change their dependency status after they have filed a FAFSA as a result of marriage, we would typically request a copy of the marriage certificate." In other words, unless you're changing your status, proof isn't required at all.

"I definitely think this is a loophole that just wasn't thought through by some bureaucrat once-upon-a-time," said Mizami.
But according to lawyers, the consequences are pretty clear.
"That's perjury," said Paul Wallin, a defense attorney who's been dealing in such cases for 35 years. "She could get anything from probation to county jail."
In addition to perjury, Wallin said lying to get aid would be considered fraud. In 2000, Congress passed the College Scholarship Fraud Prevention Act, setting a maximum penalty of five years in prison or fines of up to $20,000 for anyone participating in Pell grant fraud. While the consequences are harsh, the fact remains that these crimes are largely undetected. "Someone would have to squeal on her," said Wallin.
Morris-Sandoval confirmed this, saying that investigations are held "usually [after] receiving an anonymous report." Administrators look for inconsistencies if something looks awry and not necessarily evidence to prove that the marriage is legit. Crewell said that in their experience, he's never encountered a student who had committed fraud.
"Not that I'm aware of, anyway," they told me. "Every once in a while we'll ask about inconsistencies and see that they're addressed before we can proceed. But that's something we're required to do."
Mizami has two years of school left, and they expect their status to roll over without having to show any evidence of their marriage—which is lucky, since the evidence doesn't exist.
"The thing you learn above all else is how to play school," said Mizami. "It doesn't have to do with how brilliant you are, or how earnest you are, or how kind. It has to do with knowing which hoops to jump through in what ways. I don't think it's a cheaters' system. I think it's just how the world works."
"I made the marriage license into a paper boat," said Mizami. It now lies somewhere in the icy waters of Lake Michigan. Love, unlike student debt, rarely ever lasts.

MetalX, headquartered in Waterloo, Indiana, recently hosted a groundbreaking ceremony for its new facility in Delta, Ohio. The proposed $35 million investment will fund the development of a scrap processing plant that will create more than 75 new jobs to handle more than 500,000 tons annually in its first phase. MetalX says it expects the facility to be fully operational within one year and plans to begin certain operations as early as next summer.
In July 2017, MetalX purchased M&K Metal Processors in Delta. In August, the company announced its plans to build a greenfield scrap processing plant in Delta on a 60-acre site across the street from North Star BlueScope's flat-rolled steel mill.
MetalX says key ferrous scrap processing operations will include a heavy-duty shredder and recovery system, a production baler, mobile shears and a high-capacity staging and distribution yard for prepared grades. Nonferrous operations will focus on shredded aluminum recovery and industrial scrap processing. The company says it also will operate a full-service fleet transportation hub to support industrial and wholesale suppliers.
As part of the groundbreaking ceremony, Dean Monske, president of the Regional Growth Partnership for Northwest Ohio (RGP), Toledo, Ohio, offered their thanks to the company for bringing new jobs and investment to Fulton County. In conjunction with JobsOhio, the RGP facilitated an Ohio Jobs Creation Tax Credit and a JobsOhio Grant. MetalX also received an Ohio Rail Development Commission Grant and a local Jobs Creation Tax Credit from the village of Delta.
“Companies from around the world are finding that northwest Ohio offers high-value advantages at a low cost of doing business,” Monske said. “Together with Jobs Ohio, we look forward to working with MetalX in its continued growth.”
Also speaking at the ceremony were State Rep. Rob McColley and Fulton County Commissioner Jeff Rupp.
Other dignitaries in attendance included State Rep. Derek Merrin; Fulton County Commissioners Jon Rupp and Bill Rufenacht; York Township Trustees Robert Trowbridge and Jeff Mazurowski; Delta Mayor Dan Miller; Delta Village Manager Brad Peebles; Delta Village Council members Art Thomas, Frank Wilton, Bob Gilbert and Ashley Todd; Delta Chamber of Commerce President Janelle DeBacker; and Fulton County Economic Development Corporation Chairman Rich Menzel.
Matt Gilroy, executive director of the Fulton County Economic Development Corp., said, “MetalX executives have a long and successful history in the metals recycling business. In addition to the company's potential for growth, this project also offers tremendous opportunities for the community. The company will provide a valuable service to area businesses and individuals, will generate substantial tax revenues for the community and the state of Ohio and provide folks in the area with new, stable and well-paying employment opportunities.”
They continued, “Company officials have been great to work with through the entire process and they've selected the optimal location for their investment. This site is served by the Genesee and Wyoming short line railroad, an excellent highway infrastructure that includes State Route 109, State Route 20A, and the Ohio Turnpike, plus the company will have access to the highly skilled and hard-working workforce of northwest Ohio.”
MetalX President and CEO Danny Rifkin said, “We continue to be overwhelmed by the warmth with which we've been welcomed to this community and the resounding support for this project. Even though this is the ‘official' groundbreaking ceremony, we actually started moving dirt on Oct. 27. Aside from the fact that we couldn't wait to get started, that date is special to us, as it marked the fifth anniversary of the day we first opened in 2012!”
Rifkin added, “This project is a big undertaking and a sizeable investment. We are confident that this will be a success for us all. We truly appreciate the encouragement of the North Star BlueScope team, the special effort made by area officials to work through the process in an expeditious timeframe, the guidance and support of Matt Gilroy and the Fulton County Economic Development Corp., who have assisted us through the entire process, and of course, those people within our own company who have been so committed to getting this done.”
MetalX is a privately held scrap metal recycling business founded in 2012 by Danny and Neal Rifkin, third- and fourth-generation members of the Rifkin family, who have a long history in the scrap metal industry. MetalX is a full-service scrap metal recycling company engaged in the business of recycling, processing, and trading of scrap and secondary metals, as well as providing consulting and management services to industrial companies throughout the U.S. The company says it is focused on creating value through relationships with suppliers and consumers. MetalX currently employs more than 200 people in six locations.
Virtualization has become prevalent in all areas of our infrastructure, from the datacenter, to our remote offices. Virtualizing the ROBO (a common term used for remote or branch offices) brings additional challenges to organizations, beyond just the initial deployment. One of the most difficult aspects of vSphere ROBO management can be justifying the licensing costs to provide a redundant infrastructure in remote office. VMware vSphere Remote Brach Office editions solve this problem by providing an alternate licensing model for small VMware vSphere deployments and ROBOs.
Instead of host based licensing, VMware ROBO editions are licensed by the number of Virtual Machines. This license covers 25 virtual machines, which may be split between sites or hosts.
Many times, it can be difficult to justify licensing a vSphere ROBO. vSphere Remote Branch Office editions solve this problem, allowing for organizations to take advantage of vSphere clustering features for even the smallest deployments. In addition, vSphere ROBO allows you to manage your remote hosts from your centralized vCenter deployment. vSphere ROBO comes in two editions: Standard and Advanced.
VMware ROBO Licensing: Comparing VMware vSphere ROBO Standards vs Advanced
It is important to remember there are a number of considerations when it comes to VMware ROBO licensing. You can see a feature comparison of VMware ROBO Standard vs advanced in this image:
In terms of remote management and deployment, vSphere ROBO advanced adds Host Profiles and Auto Deploy. If you are currently using these features in your VMware vSphere environment, using them in your remote and branch offices make sense. However, if you are not, you may be better off selecting VMware vSphere ROBO Standard. The other feature to think about is Distributed Switches, which is a part of VMware vSphere ROBO Advanced.
VMware ROBO Pricing
VMware ROBO pricing is as follows: the list price of VMware ROBO Standard in USD is $3,000.00, and the list price of VMware ROBO Advanced is $4,500.00, which does not include support. Remember, this is per 25 virtual machines, and not ESXi host hardware. Be sure to refer to the above VMware ROBO Standard vs Advanced comparison chart above. Performing a comparison of VMware ROBO editions is key to selecting the right solution for an environment.
Remember, this is the list price, and it is very important to talk to your VMware sales representative to see if you can get a better deal on VMware ROBO.
Key Differences Between VMware ROBO Standard and VMware ROBO Advanced
As you can see the features unique to VMware vSphere ROBO Advanced licensing are as follows:
Host Profiles
Auto Deploy
Distributed Switch
These are all features that make managing a VMware vSphere ROBO easier. If you are faced with managing and deploying many VMware ROBOs, vSphere ROBO advanced may be the right choice for you. It is important to understand the effort required to set up a VMware ROBO environment that meets your specific requirements so you can determine if the extra cost of vSphere ROBO licensing advanced can be justified.
Since the features included in VMware ROBO licensing advanced relate to manageability, be sure and think about how long it will take to do these administrative tasks. For example, if it takes one team member two weeks to configure your VMware ROBOs, it may make sense to spend the extra money on the higher level of VMware ROBO licensing, vSphere ROBO Advanced.
From a list price perspective, vSphere ROBO Advanced is more cost effective than licensing vSphere Enterprise Plus, which has a list price of USD $3,495.00 per processor. If your ESXi host has more than one processor, this cost can quickly add up. vSphere ROBO eliminates this problem, and allows for multiple hosts to be deployed. One key reason this is recommended is to take advantage of vSphere High Availability in order to protect against host hardware failure.
Need a refresher on what is included with vSphere Enterprise Plus Features? Be sure to check out Comparing vSphere Editions: vSphere Standard and vSphere Enterprise Plus.
vSphere Remote Branch Office editions simplify licensing for remote sites and branch offices. By allowing for the virtual machines to be split across multiple sites, customers can also take advantage of VMware vSphere to protect critical servers from hardware failure for even the smallest sites with very few servers. Without vSphere Remote Branch Office, this would not be economical from a licensing perspective.
Remember, as we discussed above, the vSphere ROBO licensing model is to simply purchase licenses in packs of 25 virtual machines, which can be spread across ESXi hosts and sites as needed.
VMware ROBO Design Considerations
One of the most compelling features of VMware vSphere is VMware High Availability. VMware High Availability protects against ESXi host hardware failure by placing vSphere ESXi hosts into clusters, which are then managed by VMware vCenter Server.
You must have at least two ESXi hosts to create a vSphere Cluster. If you have virtual machines that must remain running in the event of a hardware failure, you will want to have multiple VMware vSphere hosts in your ROBO office. If you are going to use a configuration of two ESXi hosts, it is important to look at their performance. If you are using more than 50% CPU or Memory resources on either host, you may be looking at degraded performance in the event of a host failure.
Of course, we also need shared storage to have a vSphere cluster. This requires some sort of external storage array. These devices can pricey, and also overkill if you are not running anything else in a VMware ROBO office. On the other hand, you can purchase storage devices that can act as file shares for users, and serve storage to other applications beyond the vSphere ROBO Site.
One of the simplest options available would be to deploy a 2 node VMware vSAN cluster. You can find out more information about this configuration on VMware VSAN's YouTube Channel.

Says President Barack Obama "has lost more members of the House and more members of the Senate than any president ever has lost" in modern times.
The Democrats took their final drubbing of the 2014 midterm election Dec. 6 with the decisive defeat of Sen. Mary Landrieu in the Louisiana Senate runoff. The election of U.S. Rep. Bill Cassidy means Republicans will hold 54 seats in the new Senate.
Assessing the Democratic plight, one-time Republican consultant turned news analyst Matthew Dowd said President Barack Obama had overseen historic losses for their party.
"President Obama has demonstrated he's very good at winning their own elections," Dowd said on ABC's This Week on Dec. 7, 2014. "But in modern times, they have lost more members of the House and more members of the Senate than any president ever has lost."
We asked Dowd what they meant by modern times and they told PunditFact they were thinking of post-World War II. We went to the congressional records to see how this president and their party stack up compared to past administrations.
We decided to look at how many seats for the own president's party, be it Democrat or Republican, shifted during each president's time in office.
We ran the numbers two ways. In the first approach, we looked at the electoral impact of a president who was running on their record. This meant we ignored party shifts in the year they were first elected because at that point they had no presidential track record. This meant that for two-term presidents, we summed the changes for the first midterm, the re-election, and the second midterm. We scored single-term presidents for just one midterm.
In the second approach, we allowed for a presidential coattail effect. If the president's name was on the ballot, we counted any party shifts, including those in the year they were first elected. So for all presidents, we summed the changes from their first election to their last midterm.
We treated Presidents Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford a little differently because they took office when their president died or resigned. We counted their first election, if they won, as a case of running on their record and added in any shifts in the balance of congressional party power.
Here's what we came up with.
President President's party shift in Congress (Without first election) President's party shift in Congress (Including first election) Franklin Roosevelt (D) -71 seats +38 seat Harry Truman (D) -17 seats -17 seats Dwight Eisenhower (R) -83 seats -60 seats John F. Kennedy (D) -2 seats -22 seats Lyndon Johnson (D) -14 seats -14 seats Richard Nixon (R) -1 seats 11 seats Gerald Ford (R) -54 seats -54 seats Jimmy Carter (D) -16 seats -16 seats Ronald Reagan (R) -24 seats +24 seats George H.W. Bush (R) -7 seats -10 seats Bill Clinton (D) -59 seats -67 seats George W. Bush (R) -18 seats -26 seats Barack Obama (D) -85 seats -52 seats
The table makes it clear that the first election makes a big difference. Without it, Dowd is correct, though just narrowly. Obama saw their party lose a total of 85 seats between the House and the Senate in the course of three elections. Interestingly, President Dwight Eisenhower runs a close second with 83 fewer Republicans. These are net numbers so ground lost in one election could be made up in the next. For Eisenhower, 1958 was the worst year. For Obama, it was 2010.
However, when we include every year when the president's name appeared on the ballot, the ranking shifts. Obama first took office in a wave election that cost Republicans quite a bit. When we run the numbers this way, President Bill Clinton comes in as first among losers, followed by Eisenhower and Ford. Obama takes fourth place.
To viewers, it wasn't clear what yardstick Dowd was using. While they noted that Obama was good at winning their own elections, they didn't specifically set a timeframe for measuring how the balance of power in Congress has shifted over time. We think both measures are largely valid. One argument for giving more weight to the first approach is Dowd was talking about the effect that presidents have on their party. Until you win election, you aren't president, and the gains or losses in your first election shouldn't count.
We should also highlight that no president deserves full credit or blame for party gains or losses. To say that Obama has lost members of their party in Congress is not to say that they alone made that happen.
(A technical note: We used the official party counts by the House of Representatives and the Senate . They record the numbers at the start of each Congress. If members die, resign or switch parties during their term, we don't include those changes. Also, we did not include independents or members of other parties who would then choose to caucus with one of the major parties.)
Our ruling
Dowd said Obama has lost more seats held by their party in the House and Senate than any modern president. By one valid measure, Dowd is correct. By another measure, Obama would rank fourth.
That, however, does not make Dowd's claim inaccurate. It just means that it needs clarification and some additional information.
That meets our definition of Mostly True.
An Egyptian court has sentenced Canadian Mohamed Fahmy and two other Al-Jazeera English journalists to three years in prison, the latest twist in a long-running trial criticized worldwide by press freedom and human rights activists.
BREAKING: <a href="https://twitter.com/MFFahmy11">@MFFahmy11</a> & <a href="https://twitter.com/Bahrooz">@Bahrooz</a> found guilty In <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ajeretrial?src=hash">#ajeretrial</a> in Cairo. Sentenced to 3 years in prison. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CBC?src=hash">#CBC</a> —@DerekStoffelCBC
Fahmy faced widely denounced terror charges and had spent more than a year in prison before a successful appeal of an earlier conviction resulted in the re-trial that culminated in Saturday's verdict.
In their ruling, Judge Hassan Farid said they sentenced the men to prison because they had not registered with the country's journalist syndicate. They also said the men brought in equipment without the approval of security officials, had broadcast "false news" on Al-Jazeera and used a hotel as a broadcasting point without permission.
It wasn't immediately clear how the sentence would affect the three men, but they are seeking a pardon from President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who has personally spoken out against the case. Al-Jazeera said it will also appeal the verdict, once the court releases its full ruling in the next 30 days.
Immediately after the ruling, Fahmy's wife, Marwa, wept in the court.
Speaking to CBC News, they called on Prime Minister Stephen Harper to step in and save the Canadian, who gave up their Egyptian citizenship earlier this year.
"What I'm asking for right now is Mr. Harper to interfere," they said. "It's time for them to prove that they can help and support a Canadian citizen" that they know is innocent.
"I believe this [verdict] is extreme injustice and extremely unfair," they said.
CBC News speaks with Sue Turton, former Al-Jazeera correspondent and friend of the Canadian journalist 5:47
Hoping for deportation
Marwa and Fahmy's brother, Adel, said they are hoping Fahmy will get the same treatment as Peter Greste, one of the Al-Jazeera journalists who was charged Saturday but deported to their native Australia in February.
"We're done in relying on or putting any hope on the judicial process, because it is very obvious that it is meaningless," Adel Fahmy told CBC News.
CBC's Derek Stoffel was in the courtroom and spoke to Canada's ambassador to Egypt Troy Lulashnyk immediately after the verdict.

"Obviously Canada is deeply disappointed in the outcome of this process," Lulashnyk said. "Canada has consistently called for Mr. Fahmy's full and immediate release. And this is what we will continue to be doing. While they are in Egypt we will continue to provide them the consular support necessary and will be following up with officials."
Lynne Yelich, the minister of state (Foreign Affairs and Consular), released a statement early Saturday saying the decision "undermines confidence in the rule of law in Egypt," and called for Fahmy's "immediate return" to Canada.
Outside the court Fahmy's high-profile human rights lawyer, Amal Clooney, told reporters the verdict had sent an ominous message.
"It sends a message that journalists can be locked up for simply doing their job, for telling the truth and reporting the news. And it sends a dangerous message that there are judges in Egypt who will allow their courts to become instruments of political repression and propaganda," they said.
Clooney added that they hoped el-Sissi would pardon the three journalists.
'Defies logic and common sense'
Al-Jazeera English acting director-general said the verdict "defies logic and common sense."
"The whole case has been heavily politicized and has not been conducted in a free and fair manner," Mostefa Souag said.
"There is no evidence proving that our colleagues in any way fabricated news or aided and abetted terrorist organizations and at no point during the long drawn out retrial did any of the unfounded allegations stand up to scrutiny."
The 41-year-old Fahmy's troubles began in December 2013 when they were working as the Cairo bureau chief for Qatar-based satellite news broadcaster Al-Jazeera English.

He, Greste and Egyptian producer Baher Mohammed were abruptly arrested and charged with a slew of offences, including supporting the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood, a banned organization affiliated with ousted Egyptian president Mohammed Morsi, and with fabricating footage to undermine the country's national security.
The trio maintained their innocence throughout, saying they were just doing their jobs, but after a trial which was internationally decried as a sham, they were found guilty and sentenced to prison terms.
Greste was suddenly allowed to leave Egypt before their retrial began, under a law which allows for the deportation of foreign nationals convicted of crimes.
Greste told CBC News they want more than deportations; they want all three of them pardoned, noting that even though he's in Australia he's technically a convicted terrorist and can no longer travel to countries that have an extradition treaty with Egypt.
"This has to do with fundamental principles of freedom of speech, of rule of law, of due process — and the Egyptian president now has the ability to correct this injustice," they said.
Gave up dual Egyptian citizenship
Fahmy gave up their dual Egyptian citizenship while behind bars in the hopes that they could follow the same path as Greste, but that didn't happen. They are, however, granted bail in February shortly after their second trial got underway.
Throughout the proceedings, Fahmy has pointed out that their case had been complicated by politics in the Middle East, referring to themselves as a "pawn" in a rift between Egypt and Qatar, which owns Al-Jazeera.
Amnesty International noted in a statement that the court also sentenced a larger group of Egyptians on similar charges to three years, including students who said that security forces had beaten them following their arrest last year.
"The authorities should ensure a prompt, independent and impartial investigation is conducted into the defendants' allegations of torture and other ill treatment," the statement said.
Donald Trump responded yet again in their ongoing feud with Fox News, tweeting Sunday they would not let up attacks against anchor and host Megyn Kelly.
The Kelly File is one of the highest rated prime time cable news shows. Fox News issued a statement last week blasting The Republican front runner for having a “sick obsession” with the Kelly File host.

“Donald Trump's vitriolic attacks against Megyn Kelly and their extreme, sick obsession with them is beneath the dignity of a presidential candidate who wants to occupy the highest office in the land,” Fox News' statement reads.
The presidential candidate has expressed disdain for Kelly since the early days of the campaign. The business person took issue with a question Kelly asked during the first Fox News debate. The prime time star asked about statements Trump made in which they referred to women as “fat pigs” and “dogs.” In an interview later, Trump seemed to suggest Kelly asked the question because they were menstruating. “she had blood coming out of their eyes, they said. “Blood coming out of them wherever.”

STRIKER Lee Hughes has left Worcester City for AFC Telford United after being allowed to hold talks with their National League North relegation rivals.
The 40-year-old former West Bromwich Albion marksman had scored 33 goals in 57 appearances since signing for Worcester in September 2015.
They had also expressed their interest in the vacant managerial position at cash-strapped strugglers City following the departure of Carl Heeley late last month.
But stand-in boss John Snape revealed City had been approached by Telford and "another club" and gave Hughes permission to talk to both.
Worcester's top scorer was deregistered by the Blue and Whites once they agreed their move to Telford.
"There was an approach raised by Telford and another club," said Snape.
"The seven-day approach was accepted and waivered for them to talk."
They added: "There are two clubs that have shown a very stern interest as a few other clubs have done continuously throughout the season.
"We have been inundated with interest in Lee which we have resisted up until now."
Snape said Hughes' departure was a "massive blow" as Worcester try to retain their status in the sixth tier.
City are in 18th position, three points above the drop zone and on a run of 11 matches without a league win.
"It is a massive blow," Snape said.
"Lee was a key part of our plans - even at their age - as they still command respect and they will be missed.
"He is great character and a great lad in the dressing room.
"I have got no faults with them as they wear their heart on their sleeve and gives theirs all."
Earlier today, City released a statement saying Snape would lead a temporary management team, with assistance from captain Danny Jackman and Hughes for their clash at Harrogate Town on Saturday (3pm).
However, the club later confirmed: "Lee Hughes has today left the club with a view to signing elsewhere.
"We would like to thank Lee for all of their efforts whilst in a City shirt and we wish them all the best for the future."
Federal regulators have approved a Boeing plan to redesign the 787 Dreamliner's fire-prone lithium-ion batteries, although extensive testing will be needed before the planes can fly passengers again.
The Federal Aviation Administration said Tuesday the plan includes a redesign of the internal battery components to minimize the possibility of short-circuiting, better insulation of the battery's eight cells and the addition of a new containment and venting system.
This is the first step in the process to evaluate the 787's return to flight, the FAA said in a statement.
The FAA says the battery certification plan requires a series of tests, including flight tests, which must be passed before the 787 can return to service.
The 787 fleet worldwide has been grounded since Jan. 16, following a battery fire on a Dreamliner parked in Boston and a smoking battery that led to emergency landing by other another 787 in Japan.
In hindsight...
The college football offseason is a long, lonely time. Some fans are lucky to have a basketball, hockey, or baseball team worth watching in the meantime, but for those whose monogamous life partner is college football, the offseason is between eight and nine months long, and often seems even longer. So you can imagine what it's like to be a college football writer. Sure, you've got National Signing Day and spring practice. And you've got the occasional Fulmer Cup issues and other assorted stuff. But that won't sustain you. No, no. You need narratives. And nothing… and I mean NOTHING… chews up clock like chaos at the quarterback position.
So, in light of that, we've assembled a How-To manual for selling a quarterback controversy.
THINGS YOU WILL NEED:
An Incumbent
Having two new guys doesn't do it. Sure, you can milk a few “who will replace Johnny Graduate?” stories out of it, but that's just a quarterback battle. We need a quarterback CONTROVERSY.
Notice that you don't need a bad incumbent. I mean, if the incumbent sucks, that's fine. But it isn't a requirement, and in fact may not be enough. Instead, you need…
A Disappointing Season
We'll call this the Football Leadership Ability Correlation/Causation Observation Effect (or the “FLACCO Effect” for short). Regardless of numbers, the eye test, or the relentless nagging nature of numbers and stuff, people will inevitably correlate team success with the righteousness and overall gooditude of the quarterback. Win a Super Bowl? Massive contract, because you are ELITE. Go 7-6 despite incomprehensibly huge numbers? Constant complaints.
Does the defense have something to do with it? Maybe the offensive line, or the receivers, or the schedule, or the coaching? Yeah, yeah. Excuses, excuses. Winners win, dammit, and winning quarterbacks win when they quarterback. You didn't win. You aren't a winning quarterback.
Take, for a completely random example, the University of Michigan. Michigan was 7-6 last year, and the offense struggled. Devin Gardner led the offense. It was therefore Devin Gardner's fault.
An Intriguing Challenger
This part isn't terribly important, but it helps. And by “intriguing,” I don't necessarily mean “good.” Again, if he's good, cool. Go with it. But all you need is somebody plausible. In other words, you need a blank slate with a soupçon of positivity. You can have some data on the guy, but it better either be (a) good, or (b) scarce.
Do you have a former four- or five-star recruit lying around? Maybe they played a game or two and didn't crash into a wall or vomit repeatedly? Cool. Go no further. You're in.
Incumbent Apples
Check all that apply:
Did the Incumbent have a bad game at any point?
Did the Incumbent throw any interceptions at bad times?
Did the offense stall from time to time?
Were there moments where the Incumbent made mental errors or displayed anything that could be perceived as weakness or a lack of desire?
Did unrelated good things happen to other people?
Notice the lack of an “if yes, explain” box. There's no need to go fleshing this out with context. Data points don't need context. That's how data points work.
Challenger Oranges
Check all that apply:
Has the Challenger ever looked good for any stretch of any game?
Have they thrown any touchdown passes?
Did the offense move the ball from time to time under the direction of the Challenger?
Has the Challenger ever demonstrated positive intangibles of any kind?
Does the Challenger have… uh… physical/demographic characteristics that seem more “quarterbacky” to some readers?
(Optional) Does the Challenger have any trait or skill that the Incumbent lacks, or has it in greater quantities than the incumbent?
It's all about body language. Who looks more into the game, huh? HUH?
A Trigger
Quarterback controversies don't just fall from the sky. They must be conjured by a powerful force. A wizard is preferable, but failing that, coachspeak will do just fine.
Question: To be clear, when Devin is healthy, obviously they will be at some point, Shane is going to get a chance, Devin is going to have a chance or is Devin going to go in as your starter? Answer: “I think that is an unknown. Again, we were 7-6 and we've got a lot of young guys. We've got a lot of competition. Now does Devin have the most experience – yes. There is no question.”
Did you miss it? Let's try it again, but this time without that messy ‘rest of the answer' crap.
Question: “…is Devin going to go in as your starter? “ Answer: “I think that is an unknown.”
See how easy that was? Heck, we can take it one step further, in headline form:
Brady Hoke: Quarterback position “is an unknown”
And we're off to the races.
Putting it all Together
The rest is pretty simple. Rehash the disappointing season, introduce the new guy, compare the apples to the oranges, and throw in a quote or two to prove you didn't make it up. Let's see how this all works, and tell me if this sounds familiar.
After a disappointing 7-6 season, Michigan has a lot of questions to answer. One big question is whether Devin Gardner will be the starting quarterback next season. Gardner started 12 games last year, but doubts linger as to whether he's the best fit for the offense Brady Hoke wants to run. Gardner, who was recruited to run Rich Rodriguez's spread option attack, struggled at times last year. They threw key interceptions in near-calamities against Akron and UConn, and the offense they led stalled in losses to Iowa and Nebraska. The Wolverines also lost, once again, to rivals Michigan State and Ohio State. Both arch-enemies up in BCS bowl games, while Michigan ended up in the Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl. Brady Hoke is under serious pressure, and they have to be looking for a change. Enter Shane Morris. Morris was a five-star recruit out of high school, and sat most of their first-year student year behind Gardner. Morris started the BWW Bowl and showed flashes of the kind of arm strength and poise that make them a threat to take the reins for Big Blue. They threw for nearly 200 yards and completed over 63% of their passes (higher than Gardner's 60.3% completion rate). If Hoke wants to return to the days of the big-armed pocket passers, Morris looks like their guy. Hoke insists this is an open competition, saying instead that it's “unknown” who will start.
Of course, I just made that whole thing up, and the only part that required me to do more than look at box scores and pull fun narrative storylines out of my ass was the last sentence. See also: here and here and here and okay stop clicking those links.
What If We're Wrong?
Oh, that's the best part. You can't be wrong. You're not claiming the new guy WILL start… you're just saying the new guy MIGHT start. It's 50-50. Heck, you can even give the incumbent a 60-40 edge. Repeat after me: “this battle will go right through fall camp and right up until the season opener (and maybe beyond), though if I had to make a prediction, I'd guess that Gardner starts.”
What's even better is that almost nothing can refute your narrative, and just about every piece of news can confirm it in some way. Devin Gardner has a poor spring game? “See, the door is open.” Practice reports indicate Gardner is an unstoppable hell-beast? “The competition is bringing out the best in Gardner.”
If things get slow during the off-season, this particular well won't go dry. You just need to add a fresh ‘source,' such as “buzz from practice,” “sources inside the program,” or even “the word out of Schembechler these days.” You can also ask hilariously loaded questions, like asking the new guy “do you think you can be the starter?” (as if anyone is going to say, “nah, I'm not that good, so pray that this guy stays healthy ‘cause I'm basically a 7-loss season waiting to happen).
The Caveat
It was terrible that Hank left them in that safe house all alone. I wonder how long they stayed.
You may be starting to think to yourself “this is kinds sounding plausible.” And you might even start believing it yourself. And in doing so, you might be tempted to engage with people who think you are completely full of crap. DO NOT DO THIS. This “controversy” is an oblique attack. Stick and move. Don't get tied up on the ropes. If you do, people will probably point out some of the following tidbits:
Devin Gardner is going to be a 5th year senior. He's been on campus for 51 months. Shane Morris will be a true sophomore. He's been on campus for 10 months.
Gardner has 17 starts as a Michigan quarterback (and another 8 at wide receiver). Morris has played approximately 5 quarters.
Devin Gardner completed 60.3% of their passes last year. They threw for 2960 yards (247 yards per game) at 8.6 YPA. Those are pretty damn good numbers.
In Big Ten play, Gardner threw for 14 touchdowns and 3 picks.
And they put up those numbers despite (a) having absolutely no running game (and in some cases LESS than no running game), (2) having absolutely no pass protection, and (d) playing through a broken Devin and three cracked Gardners.
You probably can't name the last time an incumbent starter who threw for 8.6+ YPA didn't start the next year. I know I can't, and I looked back to 2005 to try to find someone. Couldn't.
In their most recent game under center, Gardner threw for 451 yards and accounted for five touchdown without a pick. They did so on foot so busted they were limited in practice three months later.
Shane Morris's bowl performance was basically a series of bubble screens and those jet-sweep-in-front-of-the-QB things that somehow still count as passes. Their downfield throws were… an adventure.
Insider buzz has apparently confirmed what history and basic logic would indicate: it's Gardner.
Incumbents always always always win these “battles.” In 2012, Andrew Maxwell completed 52% of their passes at 5.8 YPA. And they STILL started the opener (and likely would have continued to start if they hadn't thrown for under 3.5 YPA).
Wow. I wouldn't put that stuff into your articles. It kinda makes it sound like the earlier stuff was complete bullshit.
The organization is now taking no chances when it comes to security. On Monday, two officers from the NYPD's counter-terrorism unit were stationed outside Planned Parenthood's headquarters in Manhattan. Officers have also been deployed to all five Planned Parenthood health centers in the New York area. "I want clients and staff to feel safe even though there are no known threats against us here specifically," Malin said.
Malin linked the incident to "relentless" and "toxic" rhetoric from the organization's opponents. "[Dear's] own statement to police, in which they mentioned something about 'no more baby parts,' is exactly the same phrasing used by anti-abortion activists," they said. "The language used by our opposition has created a heightened and tense situation that has now been translated to violence. It's hard to imagine there's no link between this incident and the toxic rhetoric that ratchets up the tension."
Police have declined to speculate on the motive of alleged shooter Robert Lewis Dear, but Planned Parenthood says it has no doubt about what sparked the incident. On Monday, Joan Malin, the President and CEO of Planned Parenthood New York, said the 57-year-old Dear was driven by "dangerous" anti-abortion sentiment whipped up in the wake of a recent "sting" video controversy.
Three days after a gunman killed three people and wounded nine others at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado, politicians are publicly wrangling about whether the incident should be called an act of domestic terrorism, a debate that has focused on rambling remarks about "baby parts" the suspected shooter reportedly made to police after they were arrested.

In July, anti-abortion activists released footage from a secretly taped meeting with Planned Parenthood representatives that purportedly showed discussions about the sale of fetal tissue. Planned Parenthood maintains that the videos were heavily edited and taken out of context, and that accepting donations for tissue samples are an accepted and legal part of medical practice.
The tapes sparked a Congressional probe into Planned Parenthood and fueled efforts to strip the organization of federal funding. Republican politicians and presidential candidates, including Donald Trump, Carly Fiorina, and Ted Cruz, have frequently referenced unproven activities allegedly carried out by the group, including claims of "dismembering" or "harvesting" babies or "baby parts," the phrase Dear allegedly uttered when they were taken into custody.

Dear made their first court appearance on Monday afternoon, wearing what officials described as a "suicide prevention garment."  They are expected to face multiple first-degree murder charges, but will not be formally charged until their next court date on December 9. If convicted of murder, they face life in prison or the death penalty.
Malin said it's "vital" to publicly acknowledge that Dear's actions were "motivated by hate."
"In the context of the language they used, I think it can be talked about as a result of their opposition to safe and legal abortion," they said. "He killed three people because of their views — all three were incredible heroes."
Law enforcement officials told ABC News on Sunday that the Justice Department is currently building a domestic terrorism case against Dear, but that it would only move forward if the state case became "sidetracked."
"The case may fit the criteria for a federal domestic terrorism case, but based on my experience, I would be very surprised if this is not simply a local prosecution," Colorado Springs Mayor John Suthers, a former US attorney and state attorney general, told the Associated Press. "Murder charges will be more than adequate on the local level."
Following the shooting Friday, there have also been questions about the state of Dear's mental health. They were previously arrested in South Carolina for being a "Peeping Tom" and shooting their neighbor's dog with a pellet gun, but both charges were dismissed. Dear's former wife also accused them of assault, but did not press charges.
On Monday, Malin called an all-hands working lunch in the conference room of the Planned Parenthood's headquarters, saying they wanted to "reassure" staff about the heightened security measures.
"They seemed calm — there was really more exasperation from them," Malin said of their staff. "We've been through a lot already and it seems to be more and more [hate]."
Malin said that in spite of the shooting and the groups of anti-abortion activists that regularly converge outside Planned Parenthood clinics to dissuade staff and clients from entering, it's now more important than ever to keep clinic doors open.

"There are more than 2.7 million patients that rely on Planned Parenthood," they said. "In New York we see more than 50,000 people a year and it's not just abortion-related services, which is a small part of what we do. We also provide cancer screenings, STD checks and a whole host of other important reproductive health services."
One of those patients, Emily Byrne, a first-time expectant mother, had sought to make an appointment for a routine scan at a Planned Parenthood clinic in New York on the morning of the shooting. Byrne, who is a native Australian currently traveling through the US, said they were "shocked" to see the incident unfolding on the news, but that it wouldn't deter them from visiting a Planned Parenthood clinic in any state in the future.
"Planned Parenthood is one of the few affordable women's health care services available for people who are uninsured," they said. "I hope this attack provokes more support of this service, rather than a continuation of calls to cut funding."

Chris Johnson accurately summed up the current state of the New York Jets without even trying on Thursday.
"I really don't know," Johnson said when asked if he's excited about the season's second half. "If it's going like it's been going, there's nothing to be excited about or look forward to."
Grim words by CJ268, but a sentiment we imagine other teams can relate to as we reach November. It's been a topsy-turvy season in the NFL, with the haves and have-nots particularly defined in the standings. Three teams have two wins. Three more claim but a single victory. One team buried a damn football and still has nothing to show for its clumsy symbolism.
The time has come for us to stick a fork in 10 teams who will not make the playoffs in 2014. We don't take joy in being the messenger here, but we also refuse to turn a blind eye to ineptitude ... or the cold hard truth.
I've listed the doomed in alphabetical order. I don't want it to appear that one team is forked harder than another. These teams are all equally forked. On with it.
Atlanta Falcons (2-6)
Hard Knocks did it to me again. Every year I write about that show and every year I get sucked into the mistaken belief a premium cable residency will spark a gallant playoff journey. It won't happen for the Falcons, who earned the cutlery by blowing a 21-0 lead in London.
Chicago Bears (3-5)
Lamarr Houston blew out their knee Sunday celebrating a sack of a Patriots quarterback not named Tom Brady in a game in which their team was trailing by 25 points. That's your 2014 Chicago Bears, a group with way too much talent -- particularly on offense -- to be this mediocre. The blame deserves to go beyond Jay Cutler (but it won't).
Jacksonville Jaguars (1-7)
An offseason of optimism (remember all those Toby Gerhart fluff pieces?) has given way to the cold reality that the Jaguars remain a long way from respectability. Blake Bortles' decision-making in recent weeks has been troubling.
Minnesota Vikings (3-5)
If the Vikings don't blow that game in Orchard Park a couple weeks ago, they're not on this list. But they did, so they are. Teddy Bridgewater has shown flashes of ability, but teams are blitzing them to "Bolivian," to borrow a Tyson-ism. If only Bridgewater had a ridiculously talented running back to help them shoulder the load. Alas.
New York Jets (1-7)
The Jets haven't tasted victory since Sept. 7. They don't have a quarterback. Their coach spends their nights searching for REXRESUME.DOC on their hard drive. In terms of fan and media popularity, the general manager makes Mike Tannenbaum look like Ferris Bueller. Great, great times.
Oakland Raiders (0-7)
Let's try to be positive here. The Raiders have been competitive in half their games. They also have Derek Carr, who has looked extremely capable in stretches. Now some young talent needs to be built up around him. Can Reggie McKenzie be trusted in that task?
St. Louis Rams (2-5)
Ram fans can't really use the "We're trapped in the wrong division" excuse anymore. The Seahawks and 49ers are mortal (so far, anyway). The Cardinals are 6-1, but aren't anyone's definition of an unstoppable powerhouse. The Rams' final nine games will serve as an evaluation of quarterback Austin Davis, with a massively important draft day decision looming for Les Snead.
Tampa Bay Buccaneers (1-6)
A topic that came up on a recent edition of the Around The NFL Podcast: Is Lovie Smith's job safe? Smith is a respected guy with a proven track record, but what if the Bucs finish 3-13 with a couple more of those soul-destroying blowout losses like we saw against the Falcons and Ravens? It could get late early for Smith and general manager Jason Licht.
Tennessee Titans (2-6)
The most nondescript team in the NFL. Who excites you on this roster? Justin Hunter? Jurrell Casey? Um ... Taylor Lewan? You get the point. Whiz wisely moved on from Jake Locker, but this team remains deep in football purgatory.
Washington Redskins (3-5)
We've been burned by the 'Skins in this exercise before. And Jay Gruden's team looked positively functional in that upset win over the Cowboys in Jerrah World. But here's the issue: Robert Griffin III needs to come back and be the RGIII of 2012. Could that happen? Sure. Will it? The fork says no.

A 70-year-old woman presents to the ED for worsening left-sided headache. They have not had headaches in the past, but doesn't have any other “red-flag” symptoms (fever, thunderclap, etc). Them vitals are normal, and they have some tenderness over the left temple. Them visual acuity, fields, and the rest of their exam are normal. The CT of their head returns without acute findings, and their lab markers are notable for an ESR of 41. The ibuprofen you give them improves the headache somewhat. By this time, it is 2am. Given their age and scalp tenderness, you have considered giant cell arteritis (GCA), but not everything in their history matches up. You are reluctant to page the ophthalmology resident on call or empirically start steroids with this muddled picture.
You wonder: Is there a good way to rule out GCA myself in the ED?
Giant cell arteritis (also: “temporal arteritis”) is the most common large vessel vasculitis, primarily affecting the cranial arteries and aorta. Risk of disease increases steadily in patients after age 50, but is very rare before then. Women are twice as likely as men to develop the disease (lifetime incidence 1% vs. 0.5%), and disease prevalence is highest among northern Europeans.1,2
GCA causes transmural vessel inflammation leading to both stenosis of the cranial arteries and mural weakening of the proximal aorta. GCA is most feared for its potential to cause monocular or binocular blindness in untreated individuals, which happens 13-50% of the time. Visual loss is often irreversible, and patients presenting with this complaint are treated in hopes of preserving vision in an unaffected eye.3,4
Clinical Signs and Symptoms
GCA is associated with an array of both local and systemic symptoms. The former include headache, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, and vision changes, while the latter include more protean manifestations such as fever, fatigue, and weight loss. About 30% will have polymyalgia rheumatica, characterized by proximal muscle pain, weakness, and morning stiffness. On physical exam, abnormalities of the temporal artery, scalp tenderness, and synovitis may be observed.
Unfortunately, none of these classic findings accurately separates those with disease from those without it.
Smetana et al. (2002) have written the most comprehensive review on this subject for JAMA's series, the Rational Clinical Examination. Pooling together 2680 patients with suspected GCA from 21 studies, they found that none of the 27 most commonly reported symptoms and signs had a sensitivity greater than 76% (any headache), a positive likelihood ratio greater than 4.6 (a beaded temporal artery), or a negative likelihood ratio of less than 0.53 (any temporal artery abnormality). Perhaps the most useful finding from Smetana's review was demographic – only 2/1435 patients with positive biopsies were under the age of 50.5
The poor performance of the history and physical in predicting GCA diagnosis leads to the thorny issue of diagnosis of GCA itself.
Hunder et al. published the American College of Rheumatology's (ACR) criteria for GCA in 1990, the most widely referenced paper on this subject. They determined that fulfilling 3 of 5 criteria – age 50+, new headache, temporal artery tenderness (or decreased pulse), ESR > 50 mm/h, or a positive biopsy – had a sensitivity of 93.5% and a specificity of 91.2% for disease.6
But the problem with the ACR criteria has been their misapplication – as Hunder and others have pointed out, the ACR criteria were meant to distinguish GCA from other vasculidities for research studies and actually perform poorly when applied in clinical practice.7–9
So regarding GCA, we as clinicians are still left with an amorphous syndrome without well-defined features that can accurately rule out disease – except for age.
Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP )
Diagnosis of GCA has been traditionally associated with an ESR. However, the literature is replete with cases in which GCA is diagnosed in patients with an ESR less than 50 or even normal. To a lesser extent, CRP has also been examined as a screening method for GCA. 10
Parikh et al. (2006) offered encouraging results in a series of 119 patients diagnosed biopsy-positive GCA. Sensitivities for GCA were 76-86% (depending on the formula used) for ESR, 97.5% for CRP (< 0.5 mg/dL), and 99.2% (118/119) for an elevation in either marker.11
Kermani et al. (2012), however, did not reproduce those findings in a subsequent large retrospective case series (n = 177). In their study, sensitivities were 84.2% for ESR, 86.4% for CRP, and 89.8% for either (96% if patients taking steroids at the time of testing were excluded). Notably, the authors used a cutoff of 8mg/L (ie 0.8mg/dL) for CRP, which is higher than that used by Parikh.12
Additionally, Hegg et al. (2011) have shown that ESR was significantly reduced in GCA patients taking anti-inflammatory medications such as statins and NSAIDS.13
All of these studies are limited by their retrospective nature, incomplete information, and focus on only biopsy-proven GCA patients. Even so, they do not support the idea that lab tests can rule out GCA.
Ultrasound and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
Over the last 10 years, imaging studies gained importance in the diagnostic evaluation of GCA. In particular, ultrasound of the temporal arteries has been endorsed as a potential replacement for temporal artery biopsy, given its high specificity, non-invasiveness, and ability to evaluate both arteries over time.
Schmidt et al.'s (1997) prospective cohort study compared 30 patients diagnosed with GCA with 82 controls. Even though 22/30 had gotten steroids within 10 days of examination, 22/30 had a positive “halo sign” on ultrasound, indicating edema in and surrounding the wall of the temporal artery, compared to 0/82 of the controls.14
Ball et al. (2010), a decade later, conducted a meta-analysis of 9 studies comparing the halo sign to temporal artery biopsy, finding the halo sign to have a weighted sensitivity and specificity of 75% and 85%. Another metaanalysis found similar results.15,16
Aschwanden et al. (2012), recognizing the technical difficulty of ultrasound examination, examined whether an abnormal “compression sign” of the temporal artery (continued visualization despite compression) might perform better than the halo sign alone. The compression sign was just as sensitive (79 vs. 80%) as the halo sign in the 43 patients with GCA, and none of the patients without GCA had either ultrasound finding.17
MRI has also shown promise in detecting GCA, albeit with less clinical investigation than ultrasound. Contrast-enhanced studies are capable of detecting signs of inflammation in the superficial cranial and other arteries.18,19
Bley et al. (2007) used a contrast-enhanced MRI protocol in 64 consecutive patients with suspected GCA, looking for abnormalities in vessel lumen diameter, wall enhancement, and wall thickening. Overall sensitivity and specificity were 80.6% and 97.0%, with improved sensitivity (85.7%) if only patients with less than 10 days of steroid treatment were included.20
Klink et al. (2014), in a larger prospective study (n = 185) using the same MRI criteria as Bley et al., estimated sensitivities and specificities between 78.4-83.3% and 85.5-90.4%, respectively. Notably, in this study only patients with an ESR >50 were included.21
In summary, imaging studies are emerging as useful, noninvasive tools for supporting and confirming diagnosis of GCA – for rheumatologists. Unfortunately, these tests do not possess sufficient sensitivity/negative predictive value beyond ESR/CRP to comfortably rule out serious disease. Neither do most ED physicians, technicians, or even radiologists likely have enough experience with these modalities to perform them with a high degree of accuracy, at least at this moment. While ED physicians have demonstrated proficiency in performing many kinds of bedside ultrasonography, evaluation of the temporal arteries is entirely new, esoteric, territory.
Clinical Bottom Line
Given its protean manifestations, the insufficient sensitivity of biomarkers, and unavailability of highly accurate imaging modalities, GCA will be difficult, if not impossible to rule out in the ED. Emergency physicians should have a low threshold for making a presumptive diagnosis of GCA and managing accordingly. One exception to this rule might be patients under 50 years old with an unconvincing presentation and another plausible reason for abnormal biomarkers (if elevated), as only about 40 cases of GCA have ever been reported in this age group.22 Another might be patients with an atypical presentation, normal ESR and CRP, who have been counseled on the risks of GCA, and have reliable follow-up (a lot of “ifs” in that statement).
For all others, consultants should be called, and if unavailable, steroid treatment should be started until follow-up. Patients without visual symptoms should be started on 40-60 mg of prednisone daily, while those with visual impairment need to start with 1 g of intravenous methylprednisolone for 3 days, according to the British Society for Rheumatology guidelines.23

When Iñigo San Millán made a career move, from working as a physiologist for professional cycling teams in Europe to their current position at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, they thought they wouldn't see overtraining in athletes who weren't professionals.
“Then I opened the door to recreational athletes, and I was like, ‘come on, training 20 hours a week? They're not going to get overtrained,' ” San Millán says.
“I was wrong.”
San Millán is the director of sports performance at the new University of Colorado Sports Medicine and Performance Center, which opens next month in Boulder, and one of their areas of expertise is overtraining — a condition for which there isn't a strict definition in the medical community, but generally refers to a state in which an athlete's performance is in stasis or decline due to too great of training volume with not enough rest, or improper nutrition.
And it's not just happening to people training for the longest, most grueling endurance events. San Millán says he's even seeing it in those training for half marathons.
Overtrained athletes often see clues before they make it to their office for an evaluation, San Millán says. They're over-fatigued. They might feel burned out. But some recreational athletes expect to feel that way: ” ‘Hey, I'm preparing for a marathon, I'm supposed to be tired,' ” San Millán says. “But no, you're not. World-class athletes, they're not tired. They wake up fresh. If they wake up tired, red lights go off.”
That expectation for being tired speaks to why some of the symptoms of overtraining — especially declining performance — can also spur an athlete to make the situation worse by training harder instead of taking a needed rest day. “You're working, and you get to a point where your pace is not what it should be. Or, ‘man, I don't feel that snap.' So what do people think? ‘Oh, it's June, I need that intensity,' and you go to the coach, and he's like, ‘oh you need more intervals.' But that's not true, you need to rest.”
Overtraining is not being exhausted because you've done a hard workout, says Rob Pickels, lead physiologist at Boulder Center for Sports Medicine, who also works with overtrained athletes. “It's OK to be tired from a workout, that's fine. But when it's persistent tiredness that spans days, that's when it's bad news.”
Fortunately, San Millán says, it's easy to test athletes by looking for markers of overtraining in a blood test. The first thing they look at is the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity by testing hemoglobin levels. Hemoglobin is a component of red-blood cells; we lose red-blood cells every day, but the body produces new ones. Overtraining, however, reduces the body's ability to replace what we lose. So if San Millán knows what an athlete's baseline hemoglobin levels are, then sees a decline in those levels after an intense period of training, they can spot overtraining — hopefully before the athlete goes too far down that path — and recommend an appropriate amount of rest.
For that type of testing to work, though, they need to see an athlete a couple of months before their or their event, to get that baseline. “Don't wait until the last week, then it's too late,” they say.
That said, just taking a week off can make a big difference in an athlete's recovery — and thus performance.
“I've had athletes whom I've tested who came in a week before a big race, who I've said, ‘you should do literally nothing this week before the race,' ” Pickels says. “And it's amazing what we see.” They don't want to take that time off, they say, but it often works.
San Millán says overtraining also results in chronic microtears in an athlete's muscles. It's another factor they can test for … and they believe it's another factor in tendon and joint injuries. “But we can prevent that injury.”
The need for carbs
Nutrition is another component of overtraining that San Millán examines. Endurance athletes need carbohydrates, they say. “The evidence is overwhelming, every single research (study) is showing carbohydrate is critical for performance.” Without carbohydrates, your body can't top off glycogen stores, which are crucial to high-end performance. “What happens if you do not have enough glycogen, which is what happens to a lot of people? …. We go to reserves, and where does the reserve come from? The muscle. So the muscle starts eating itself to feed itself,” they say.
He's quick to emphasize that this advice is for more athletic pursuits — for example, runners, not walkers — and that they don't advocate a high-carb diet, because if those carbohydrates aren't burned, they will turn into fat.
Julian Kyer, a Boulder-based cyclist riding for the SmartStop pro cycling team this year, wasn't eating enough carbs when they tried going vegan a few seasons ago and fell into an overtraining trap. “I think a lot of endurance athletes, especially cyclists, drastically underestimate their carbohydrate needs,” they say. “When you're staying on top of it and eating enough and drinking enough on the bike, and refilling those glycogen stores, afterwards, it can be a huge performance boost. You can train harder, you recover better. You aren't creating that catabolic environment for your muscles when you train really hard.”
They went to see San Millán and adopted their overtraining-avoidance outlook; they look at training on an almost cellular level now. “It's been a couple of seasons since I've made some of those changes, and it's made a big difference, it's made a really big difference.” Kyer placed 11th overall in the USA Pro Cycling Challenge last year.
Signs of overtraining
People who are just walking for exercise aren't getting overtrained. Neither is someone like a sprinter, who is working very hard while training but isn't running for long periods of time, says Pickels. “It's the people in the middle. They're doing a lot, and they're trying to do it fast.”
It's pushing hard for longer periods, not taking rest days and not periodizing (ramping up training over several weeks, then pulling back for about a week once a month for recovery). “People don't want to take a day, or do intervals,” they say. “They just want to go hard the whole time.”
Periodization helps you peak for an event, but it also helps athletes avoid overtraining, Pickels says. “Every third or fourth week, you really ought to dial it back. Some athletes don't like it, they don't think it helps them. And they're looking at it in a shortsighted manner. Hey, you skip this rest week, the world might not end. But if you keep doing it … you're going to feel worse.”
Pickels, who works with San Millán and will be joining them at the new sports performance center in Boulder, says they see plenty of average athletes who are overtrained. And it can manifest in many ways.
“One of the biggest things is a lack of enjoyment in what someone's doing. Unfortunately we see this a lot in Ironman triathletes. Maybe someone has a trip booked to Cozumel (to race) — it's a big trip, and a week before the race, they're like, ‘I don't even want to ride my bike any more.' “
But there are other red flags: “Loss of appetite, loss of libido … so one person's experience will not match everyone else's,” Pickels says. He's learned to spot their own indication that he's overtraining — insomnia. They zonks out early in the evening, but then wakes back up at 1 a.m.
And then there's stress.
“What's kind of interesting about overtraining too is that everyone thinks of it as a physical situation, and it's not necessarily,” Pickels says. “I've had athletes who are overtrained from the stress of a death in the family. So you need to look at it in a holistic sense.”
Pickels, a cyclist who coaches a junior mountain biking team, also says there's a group that gets left out of the overtraining conversation — kids.
“We see, in terms of a percent of the population, we see juniors who are overtrained more than anyone else.”
Junior athletes are busy, they say, and if overtraining isn't widely known among adult athletes, and it's even less identifiable for an overscheduled kid.
“It's hard with them, because they don't understand — they're not seasoned athletes.”

Opening July 15
The new University of Colorado Sports Medicine and Performance Center, inside the Athletics Champions Center at CU's Folsom Field, is scheduled to open July 15 and will offer physiological testing for athletes. cusportsmedcenter.com
Use a heart rate monitor? Check for overtraining
Some researchers identify different levels of overtraining. “Overtraining is really a few different stages,” says Rob Pickels, lead physiologist at the Boulder Center for Sports Medicine. “There's normal, then you go a little beyond normal, which some people are calling overreaching — it's a little hard on the body, but people are going to be okay. And then we get nonfunctional overreaching — that's where your results are getting worse and worse … then in overtraining, we are getting a reduction in your adrenal system, your body is holding you back, not letting you hit those higher workloads, and we are starting to see those changes in your body chemistry.”
In the first two stages, you might see an elevated heart rate; if you get more overtrained, it could decrease. “Let's say you're at 200 watts (on a bike), and your heart rate is five or six beats over what it should be. When you're overtrained, the heart rate might drop 10 beats per minute,” they say.
Not sure you're training enough to worry about it? Once you start hitting 10 hours per week, you have to start paying attention, says Pickels.
Why are you interested in this adaptation?
Elena-
Mostly because it's a sci-fi movie, and I do try to watch most of them. To be honest there's not a whole lot of a deeper or more compelling reason than that. Nothing in the trailer excites me, and if there were more going on at the movies this weekend John Carter probably loses me. But when my other options are The Lorax or Good Deeds, you know, Mars starts sounding like a fine destination. Fine.
Rachel-
So, I secretly hope that this movie is amazing. How could I not want to see this? Published in 1917, A Princess of Mars, on which John Carter is largely based, is the first of a long series of novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs (the Tarzan guy). We can arguably connect most of the planetary science-fantasy stories of the last 100 years to this book. Conan, He-man, Dune, Heinlein's The Number of the Beast, Star Wars…the list is endless. Sure, it's outdated and weird, and the science isn't even close, and they were inspired by those old theories that you could see evidence of ancient civilizations on the Martian surface (Google the canals of Mars), but this is science fiction HISTORY. Crazy stuff, sure, but mostly awesome.
And come on… THAAARKS! Plus, Michael Chabon wrote the script, and it's being directed by Andrew Stanton. There's a part of me that thinks this just might be great.
What would make it awesome?
Elena-
Um…can I be real here and say that, given the amount of CG I saw in that trailer, that I don't think there's anything this film can do to be excellent? If I have to pick a path for it, how about some just ridiculous popcorn B-movie fun? There's a place for that, and maybe this movie could be it.
Rachel-
Despite the sexist overtones, I REALLY want it to look like the artwork I've associated with the stories. They just come hand in hand. I find it impossible to disconnect the story itself from the Frazetta naked asses and most especially the super lush, beautiful old-style illustrations of Frank E. Schoonover (who very graciously put some clothes on the princess for us.)
From what I've seen of the trailer everything looks nice and red. They've kept the barbarian-style clothes, and I'm REALLY impressed with the Barsoonian ships. They look awesome.
I guess what I'm saying is, I want the damn movie to be pretty. That would be awesome.
What would make it suck?
Elena
If it takes itself really seriously and is half-CG (as its trailer makes it look). Basically…if this shit is like Avatard, Mars Edition it is going to suuuuck asssssssssssssssss.
Rachel-
I don't really care of there's a lot of CGI as long as it looks good and it's not a half hour of blurriness like Transformers.
It will suck if the story is a disaster. This is an adaptation of a pretty sprawling novel that has its own problems with pacing, so this could all go horribly wrong. It could be full of confusing lore and never explain anything about why this culture as at war or how anything works. I'm a little worried about the super-powers. The telepathy and the super-strength. The science behind it is pretty silly now; I hope it's not something the entire audience laughs at every time it happens. I'm pretty worried about it. I think Chabon can handle it, but it's all the executive driven decisions I'm scared of.
This whole movie could be a hammy, horrible, convoluted mess.
Any additional thoughts on production/trailer?
Elena-
Why is this movie 2 hours and 10 minutes? I may not have read the book it's based on, but I know this much about Edgar Rice Burroughs: they aren't writing fucking Dune. You don't need a mini-series to tell that story. What the hell? I better come out feeling like it was shorter than it was…and I especially better not feel like it was LONGER than it was!
Rachel-
Yea, I agree. More than two hours? Is this Lord of the Rings? This is a movie based on the king of all pulp novels. Yes, there are going to be large-scale battles in this movie but they don't need to be Helm's Deep!
In general I've been enjoying the trailers coming out. The Tharks look great, everything looks pretty damn epic. I just don't know how sincere it's going to be. Will this be the podraces on Tattooine horrible or will I be enamored of the cinematography? Will I want to be Princess Dejah for Halloween, or will I want to kill them and all the girls I see dressed as them on Halloween? I've been hearing via word of mouth that the film isn't that great, so that isn't encouraging. But I might like it, I mean… I still watch Conan marathons. This might be a matter of preference.
Reaction to Film:
Elena-
That…that wasn't NEARLY as bad as I thought it was going to be! In fact, dare I say it was actually kind of good? I mean, it wasn't like top 10 SF films of the decade material, but it was eminently watchable. And here's the thing, and why I never take for granted that a film which I expect to be bad can't possibly be as bad as I'm expecting: Avatar was WORSE than I expected, and I expected that James Cameron self-indulgent-whack-fest to be bad (for me as an audience), so I am by no means damning John Carter with faint praise when I say it was better than I expected.
That is not to say there were not…flaws. There is still a visual divide between characters that are live-action and characters that are animated. The gulf is not as wide as it once was, and the animation looked good, but it still looked like animation. Until it doesn't I am going to point it out as a flaw. I expect to go to my grave still complaining about this issue.
John Carter's jumps were also problematic. They looked like someone in Earth-gravity being hoisted aloft or an animated object being zoomed along a CG trajectory. The bounces lacked the true buoyancy that happens in lower gravity. Actually those scenes reminded me of the jumping about in Gentleman Broncos, which is very much an ode to this type of pulp SF story (and, by the by, well worth the watch)…but to extend my point, the rendition of the SF storyline in that movie is very much meant to be comedic. It's okay if the jumping doesn't look real because that's not really the point (in fact looking too real might undermine the point in that movie), but since John Carter was actually taking itself mostly seriously, the silly-looking jumping was an issue.
Now let's talk about some good things. I loved the casting for John Carter and the Princess (seriously…why bother calling them anything else, especially their goofy-ass Never-Ending Story sounding name?). The rest of the casting didn't bother me or excite me, and Mark Strong got to add yet another villain to their villainous credits list. Also the Princess had amazing eyes, and while I am fairly sure it was contacts/CG I'm not totally sure, so they sold it better than the Dune movies have so far.
The dog? Was fucking awesommmmmmmmmmmmmmmmme. Best part of the movie! And proof that whatever form life takes, the human-dog bond is universal. (Okay, at least galactic.)
However.
Doggie? With their super-fast zoom run, utter fearlessness, and absolute loyalty? Brought up a pretty damn huge problem with the military strategies of the various peoples of Mars: WHY. THE. FUCK. DIDN'T ANYONE HAVE A MARS-DOG ARMY?! That made no sense. How could they miss the usefulness of that kind of animal in attacks? So that was a bit of a plot hole.
Another was John Carter's Superman status. So, I get that their magical physical abilities happen because he's used to Earth-gravity. Fine. But…what happens in a year after he's been living on Mars? I mean, the best case for them is that he's equalized to everyone who is from Mars and built for it. More realistically is that their bones start disintegrating and their muscles atrophy and they go from being the secret weapon to the same as any other Mars-man/useless. That's not such a happy ending, is it?
Finally I want to give some props to the framing device. Because it was ace. At first when the movie started with the whole random nephew reading their uncle's diary, I thought, Jesus Harold Christ, not another stupid framing device that I was tired of after one 19th-century lit class. But the frame turned out to be actually relevant to the story and took the ending up a notch, from bittersweet to kick-ass. So that was good and worth mentioning. Don't roll your eyes at the frame until you get to the end!
Yeah. In all it was a good two hours at the movies, and I'll go see any sequels. It might not be profound or profoundly memorable B-movie crazysauce, but it was fun enough and good enough that I don't feel cheated out of 130 minutes of my life. So I'm going to file John Carter (Of Mars) in the Win column and call it a night.
Rachel-
I LIKED IT!!! I really did!
I mean yeah, it had its issues. It was too long. It had a couple of slow bits; that I didn't mind so much on the first watch, but I suspect I would if I saw it several times. It glossed RIGHT ON OVER all those issues of racism and classicism and the critique of the industrialized world beating out the “cultured imperialists”. Just RIGHT ON BY. Whatever. I understand why Disney did not want to deal with all the baggage a hundred-year-old novel that started a genre might come with.
They changed quite a lot to make it a tighter story, and to make it more appealing to a modern audience. Some of it I am quite grateful for. Princess Dejah, for instance, was intelligent, capable and did not spend the entire movie being repeatedly kidnapped and sexed. Good job, Disney. They left out the telepathic stuff. Probably a solid choice. That could have been hokey. They handled the super strength really well and quickly, and, yes…it IS funny to watch a guy moon leap everywhere they go, and they acknowledged that.
The bit at the beginning with the Apaches and the Colonel…kind of clumsy. I think it was much longer and had to be edited, because seriously where is the MARS in this movie? I did absolutely LOVE the flashback to John burying their wife and child when they were fighting that one Thark army. It was actually really well done and does a great job highlighting the fact that when we romanticize violence, we forget that war is terrible and leaves innocent people dead. I think that might have been one of the best scenes in the film. The editing choice there was really spot-on.
Elena-
TOTALLY agree. That flashback sequence gave me chills.
Rachel-
They changed some details with the Tharks, as well. For example, it was Tars Tarkas that was aware that Sola was their daughter in the film rather than the other way around, and they completely cut out the deal with Kantos Kan being an arena prisoner that escapes with John Carter to Helium. Totally understandable, as they decided to expand Dejah to be far more involved in the plot than they originally are. I'm really grateful for that. They did that in a really clever way. They still need John's help, otherwise what is the point? But they aren't just this naked (seriously, in the books they don't wear any clothes. The comment they make about their outfit being vulgar is pretty hilarious in that light) princess who needs to be CONSTANTLY rescued by the big, strong white man from Earth. They really did that right. All credit to Michael Chabon for that. They did a great job with all this material.
I also thought they did a great job with the CGI. Sure, Woola never looked like they were REAL, but the CGI wasn't distracting. The ships and the cities and the vistas in general (love the use of tilt-shift for several of the big wide shots) were all really enhanced by effects. Some of the battle scenes got a little CGI heavy. Maybe it was the 3D making the film a little dark, but I didn't really detect that hated shininess that CGI can cast.
Speaking of Woola. WOOLA IS THE SHIT. Calots are awesome. I love that they made it sooooo ugly. They could have gone with a more lizard-like dog, but no. They went with a weird geko-turd. Love it. Ugly things make me happy. They basically stole every shot they were in. Woola appreciation society. I am in it.
Elena-
ME TOO!!!
Rachel-
Lookit that ugly, runty horrible scrotum-looking thing! We love them so!
That might sum up how I feel about this movie in general. It's kind of a weird movie in that it's an adaptation of a book that is now so dated as to almost appear as a farce, or at least an uncreative rip-off of everything produced in the genre for the last 50 years. Except it's not. It's the original weird, epic, pseudo-science-fantasy planetary adventure story. Everyone is naked! Everyone seems not to be choking or freezing to death! It's a crazy world! Just remember to call it Barsoom!

Last week, federal jurors in Brooklyn heard tapes from an undercover informant in what one prosecutor called one of “the most chilling plots imaginable,” a 2007 Islamist plan to detonate underground fuel tanks at JFK International Airport.
On the tapes, defendant Russell Defreitas promised “high-tech,” “ninja-style” tactics that included releasing rats in the main terminal to distract security. “We got to come up with supernatural things,” they told the informant.
Despite their bluster, Defreitas seemed unaware of the technical difficulties involved in igniting hardened underground pipelines, and they never secured explosives.
We've given al Qaeda power over us they don't deserve.
The JFK plotters' trial follows May's attempted Times Square bombing, in which Faisal Shahzad — trained in explosives at an al Qaeda camp in Pakistan — failed to set off a bomb made of gas cans, propane tanks, fireworks and nonflammable fertilizer.
You ever get the feeling that some of these guys aren't the sharpest scimitars in the shed?
If so, you're not alone. The notion of “savvy and sophisticated” Islamist supervillains is “wildly off the mark,” Brookings' Daniel Byman and Christine Fair write in the Atlantic magazine.
Many Afghan suicide bombers “never even make it out of their training camp,” thanks to the jihadi tradition of the pre-martyrdom “manly embrace”: “the pressure from these group hugs triggers the explosives in suicide vests.” (Theological question: Do you get fewer virgins for an own-goal?)
On the American home front, al Qaeda and its sympathizers often don't look much brighter:
In 2006, an FBI sting rolled up the “Liberty City Seven,” whose ringleader, the Washington Post reported, “wanted to blow up the Sears Tower in Chicago, which would then fall into a nearby prison, freeing Muslim prisoners who would become the core of their Moorish army. With them, they would establish their own country.” Sounds like a plan!
2007 saw the arrest of six Islamists who planned to launch an armed attack on New Jersey's Fort Dix, but were rounded up after they “asked a store clerk to copy a video of them firing assault weapons and screaming about jihad.”
In 2003, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed associate Iyman Faris went to jail on charges involving a plan to topple the Brooklyn Bridge by severing its suspension cables with a blowtorch.
The 2005 Jose Padilla indictment revealed that some Islamic terrorists haven't quite mastered speaking in code. One of Padilla's co-defendants insisted they were just talking about sporting goods on the surveillance tapes, but couldn't explain why he'd asked their co-conspirator if they had enough “soccer equipment” to “launch an attack on the enemy.”
Lest you think I'm just cherry-picking particularly incompetent jihadis, recall that the Bush administration once considered Padilla, an American citizen, too dangerous for a civilian trial, and cited Faris' capture as the crown jewel of successes with its warrantless wiretapping program.
The fact that many terrorists are morons doesn't mean all are, and even morons get lucky sometimes, so vigilance remains essential.
But the myth that al Qaeda is 100 feet tall has fed dramatic government growth since 9/11. The Washington Post's new series on “Top Secret America” shows that D.C. has erected vast pyramids in the name of homeland security, with some 1,200 agencies and 850,000 people trolling through e-mail and clear-cutting forests to produce mounds of useless, redundant intelligence reports.
We've given al Qaeda power over us they don't deserve. When we recognize that they're often inept and clownish, we weaken their ability to sow terror. For the sake of our liberty and security, it's prudent and patriotic to allow an occasional smirk to cross your stiff upper lip.
Working on a budget and managing your money positively can often be a challenge, and for a while Microsoft provided an excellent tool for Windows users with their Microsoft Money product, which after fierce competition with Intuit became quite slick and full-featured.
Unfortunately the app was discontinued in 2010, leaving loyal users scurrying to find an alternative. Microsoft was however kind enough to release a free version for the app which let users continue to keep their accounts in the software, meaning I suspect many users are still happily using the app, but wishing for updates and new features, such as support for mobile platforms.
Now Microsoft Money fan RJ P has started a petition asking Satya Nadella to reconsider, and restore the app to service, adding it to the Office 365 subscription.
They write:
Satya Nadella has done a wonderful job putting Microsoft back on the map with their “productivity first”, “mobile first” leadership at Microsoft. However Microsoft has a very glaring omission in its Office productivity suite, one that it didn't have so long ago, the omission of Microsoft Money for personal and small business finance. A lot of people use Intuit's Mint for personal and small business finance. However Intuit pulled its popular personal finance app from the Microsoft store last year leaving Windows users without a proper finance management app. Since Intuit refuses to support the Windows platform, Microsoft should step up to the plate and do it themselves. They certainly know how! Microsoft Money was a great application that my wife and I used for years. We only switched to Mint after Microsoft stopped selling Money.
Having looked around myself I agree that no apps available currently is quite as user-friendly while still being full featured, and I still have to see Money's forecasting feature replicated elsewhere.
RJ P notes the new app needs the following features, already strengths of the old app:
Be able to connect to all our online accounts and aggregate the data using one single-sign-on to Money Be able to do Budgeting Show us our bottom line “net worth” Be easy to query spending trends and look for tax write-offs And as part of its business model it should partner with credit card companies and other financial institutions to offer financial products to its users based off typical usage
They also want the following improvements:
A free “mobile” version for screens smaller than 10.1 inches on the iOS, Android, and Windows 10 platforms A “full” version available on devices larger than 10.1 inches as part of Microsoft Office or the subscription based Office 365 A “web” version, as part of Office Online, where we can log in from any computer, whether we are at work, the library, a hotel, and manage our finances
As a current user of Microsoft Money who still cant find anything better I can fully get behind this petition. If you agree you can add your signature here.
Every year we see smartphone companies boast about the processing and graphics capabilities of their device. And rightly so - the modern smartphone is immensely powerful, and comparable to desktop PCs from just a few years ago. Whether it's gaming, or its affinity to mimic your desktop computer, we have come a long way. And in less than two years, it is claimed that the smartphone will have graphics as good as seen on Microsoft's Xbox One and the Sony's PlayStation 4 gaming consoles.
And the claims are being made by no-one but the people responsible for designing most of the processors and graphics chips we see in mobile devices - ARM Holdings. At the Casual Connect conference this week, Nizar Romdan, ARM Ecosystem Director boldly claimed that the chips from their company will generate graphics on par with Microsoft's and Sony's current-generation consoles.
"Mobile hardware is already powerful," Romdan told VentureBeat, pointing out that smartphone offerings today are already better than the kind of graphics the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 shipped with. "If you take today's high-end smartphone or tablet, the performance is already better than Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. It's catching up quickly with Xbox One and PlayStation 4," Romdan said, adding that they expect this to happen by the end of 2017.
The growing revenue in the mobile gaming space shows that many are inclining towards the smaller display devices for gaming, and also asserts that many people are trying their hand at video games for the first time on their handsets. With continual improvements in both processing and graphics in smartphones, it could one day become the go-to-device of gaming for all, especially with the current trend of using smartphones as the displays of low-cost virtual reality headsets like the Google Cardboard and Samsung Gear VR.
At the event, Romdan also talked about the mobile VR, the nascent technology category that has attracted several major technology companies including Google, Sony, and if reports are accurate, Apple. "Our view is that mobile VR is the use case that could unlock the potential of mobile for hardcore gamers," they said.
"For once, mobile devices are on par with PC and consoles in terms of experience. We won't have the same processing. And battery life is a problem. But it is the same user experience. That could be a game changer for mobile gaming," they added.
WEST LIBERTY, Ohio (WSYX/WTTE) — A suspect is in custody after a student was shot Friday morning at West Liberty-Salem High School in West Liberty.
Champaign County Sheriff Matt Melvin says a 17-year-old student is being held at a juvenile detention center.
The student fired shots around 7:35 a.m. hitting 16-year-old junior Logan Cole multiple times with a shotgun.
The scene was quickly contained because staff members pinned the shooter to the ground in a common area before officers got to the school.
Law enforcement is now calling the staff members heroes, saying they likely saved the lives of other children.
"They were in there with an armed suspect and neutralized that threat," says Sheriff Melvin.
Cole is at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus. Their family tells district superintendent Kraig Hissong that they are in critical but stable condition.
Their family has released this statement:
We are thankful for the Lord's protective hand on our son. We are also grateful for the outpouring of support from our family, friends, and community. We would like to ask for continued prayers for Logan. Also, we'd like to encourage prayer for the community, the other student, and their family. We are certain they have been deeply hurt as well. We are confident that God has a purpose and plan through this tragedy.
:
The school spent two-and-a-half hours bussing students to reunite with parents at Lions Park. It was an emotional scene as nervous parents waited for their children to get off the buses in that designated safe zone. The district notified parents of the shooting using a phone call system.
No motive is being released right now for the shooting, but law enforcement believes as of now that Cole was not targeted and the plan was likely to injure more people.
Superintendent Hissong says there was no indication that an attack like this might occur.
"I think a lot of us have played that thought in our minds a lot today," they say.
Students trained about two years ago with the sheriff's office to respond to emergencies like this. The training is called "ALICE" and encourages students to be active and barricade classroom doors.
Champaign and Logan County deputies staked out in front of a home on Sinkhole Road in Champaign County for most of the day. They will be searching the property that is believed to be the home of the shooter.
The suspect is being kept at a juvenile facility as has a court date set for Monday. It is likely the charges the suspect faces will evolve over the weekend, according to the County Prosecutor Kevin Talebi.
The suspect was initially charged with felonious assault.
The following is the full text of the intelligence briefing of 6 August 2001, prepared for President George W Bush, concerning the al-Qaeda threat to the United States.
It was declassified on 10 April.
Three sections were edited, the White House said, to "protect the names of foreign governments that provided information to CIA".
Bin Laden Determined To Strike in US
Clandestine, foreign government, and media reports indicate (Osama) Bin Laden since 1997 has wanted to conduct terrorist attacks in the US. Bin Laden implied in US television interviews in 1997 and 1998 that their followers would follow the example of World Trade Center bomber Ramzi Yousef and "bring the fighting to America".
After US missile strikes on their base in Afghanistan in 1998, Bin Laden told followers they wanted to retaliate in Washington, according to a ...(edited)... service.
An Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) operative told a ... (edited) ... service at the same time that Bin Laden was planning to exploit the operative's access to the US to mount a terrorist strike.
The millennium plotting in Canada in 1999 may have been part of Bin Laden's first serious attempt to implement a terrorist strike in the US.
Convicted plotter Ahmed Ressam has told the FBI that they conceived the idea to attack Los Angeles International Airport himself, but that Bin Laden lieutenant Abu Zubaydah encouraged them and helped facilitate the operation.
Ressam also said that in 1998 Abu Zubaydah was planning their own US attack.
Ressam says Bin Laden was aware of the Los Angeles operation.
Although Bin Laden has not succeeded, their attacks against the US Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 demonstrate that they prepare operations years in advance and is not deterred by setbacks.
Bin Laden associates surveilled our embassies in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam as early as 1993, and some members of the Nairobi cell planning the bombings were arrested and deported in 1997.
Al-Qaeda members - including some who are US citizens - have resided in or travelled to the US for years, and the group apparently maintains a support structure that could aid attacks.
Two al-Qaeda members found guilty in the conspiracy to bomb our embassies in East Africa were US citizens, and a senior EIJ member lived in California in the mid-1990s.
A clandestine source said in 1998 that a Bin Laden cell in New York was recruiting Muslim-American youth for attacks.
We have not been able to corroborate some of the more sensational threat reporting, such as that from a ... (edited)... service in 1998 saying that Bin Laden wanted to hijack a US aircraft to gain the release of "Blind Sheikh" Omar Abdel Rahman and other US-held extremists.
Nevertheless, FBI information since that time indicates patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks, including recent surveillance of federal buildings in New York.
The FBI is conducting approximately 70 full field investigations throughout the US that it considers Bin Laden-related.
The CIA and the FBI are investigating a call to our embassy in the United Arab Emirates in May saying that a group of Bin Laden supporters was in the US planning attacks with explosives.
President Obama is vowing to make the case for action on global warming during the 2012 campaign.
“I suspect that over the next six months, this is going to be a debate that will become part of the campaign, and I will be very clear in voicing my belief that we're going to have to take further steps to deal with climate change in a serious way,” Obama told Rolling Stone magazine in a newly published interview.

Obama's comments follow a first term that saw global warming legislation collapse in Congress but several administrative steps to address climate proceed, such as tougher auto mileage rules and first-time greenhouse gas standards for new power plants.
“Part of the challenge over these past three years has been that people's No. 1 priority is finding a job and paying the mortgage and dealing with high gas prices. In that environment, it's been easy for the other side to pour millions of dollars into a campaign to debunk climate-change science,” Obama said.
Mitt Romney, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, has called for stripping the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) power to regulate greenhouse gases and also opposes cap-and-trade proposals.
On Capitol Hill, where Republicans are trying to thwart EPA's rules, skepticism about climate science has become commonplace in the GOP, and cap-and-trade legislation is a nonstarter.
The vast majority of scientists say global warming is occurring and human activities are a key factor. A small minority call data on warming trends and the human contribution inconclusive or inaccurate.
Obama, in the interview, cited climate change in noting the GOP's broader rightward shift.
“Think about John McCain John Sidney McCainGOP lobbyists worry Trump lags in K Street fundraising Mark Kelly kicks off Senate bid: ‘A mission to lift up hardworking Arizonans' Gabbard hits back at Meghan McCain after fight over Assad MORE, who obviously I have profound differences with. Here's a guy who not only believed in climate change, but co-sponsored a cap-and-trade bill that got 43 votes in the Senate just a few years ago, somebody who thought banning torture was the right thing to do, somebody who co-sponsored immigration reform with Ted Kennedy. That's the most recent Republican candidate, and that gives you some sense of how profoundly that party has shifted,” they said.
Internationally, plans for a binding global emissions treaty are proceeding far more slowly than advocates have hoped, although diplomats have made some progress in areas such as slowing deforestation and providing aid to help poor countries tackle climate change.
“Frankly, I'm deeply concerned that internationally, we have not made as much progress as we need to make. Within the constraints of this Congress, we've tried to do a whole range of things, administratively, that are making a difference — doubling fuel-efficiency standards on cars is going to take a whole lot of carbon out of our atmosphere. We're going to continue to push on energy efficiency, and renewable energy standards, and the promotion of green energy. But there is no doubt that we have a lot more work to do,” Obama said.
But while environmentalists will likely welcome Obama's comments on climate, in the same interview they downplayed the climate-change impact if the Keystone XL oil sands pipeline is built.
The administration has delayed, until well after the 2012 elections, a decision about whether to issue a cross-border permit for the project, which would bring Canadian oil sands to Gulf Coast refineries.
High-profile NASA climate scientist James Hansen has said that exploiting the massive oil sands, which are already being developed significantly, would mean “game over” for the climate.
“James Hansen is a scientist who has done an enormous amount not only to understand climate change, but also to help publicize the issue. I have the utmost respect for scientists,” Obama said in the interview. “But it's important to understand that Canada is going to be moving forward with tar sands, regardless of what we do. That's their national policy, they're pursuing it.”
They later added: “The reason that Keystone got so much attention is not because that particular pipeline is a make-or-break issue for climate change, but because those who have looked at the science of climate change are scared and concerned about a general lack of sufficient movement to deal with the problem.”
Congressional Republicans are pushing legislation that would require approval of TransCanada Corp.'s project, efforts that Obama bashed in the interview.
“My goal has been to have an honest process, and I have adamantly objected to Congress trying to circumvent a process that was well-established not just under Democratic administrations, but also under Republican administrations,” they said.
Capitol Hill Republicans have also alleged that regulation of greenhouse gases will hurt the economy and attacked federal spending on green energy programs.
But Obama told Rolling Stone that the nation can take serious steps to battle climate change in a way that's “entirely compatible with strong economic growth and job creation,” such as retrofitting buildings to slash energy use.
Some people call Scott Mescudi one of the most influential artists in contemporary hip-hop–and he's got the receipts to prove it.
The multifaceted hip-hop artist known as Kid Cudi landed four additional Recording Industry Association of America digital single sales awards this month, adding on to their already impressive gold and platinum collection.
Taken from 2009′s Man On The Moon: The End Of Day, the single “Pursuit Of Happiness (Nightmare)” is now certified quadruple-platinum, indicating track sales and sales equivalents like streams amounting to four million units. The album itself received a gold award in November of 2010, one of two such album awards he's earned so far in their music career.
Also On FORBES:
Simultaneously, Mescudi also earned platinum awards for their songs “Up Up & Away,” “Make Them Say” and “Erase Me.” The latter two tracks feature guest verses from Kanye West, coming just one month after the G.O.O.D. Music posse cut “Mercy” scored RIAA quadruple-platinum status.
If nothing else, these latest awards ought to give Mescudi a confidence boost in advance of their next album Passion, Pain & Demon Slayin', the follow-up to late 2015′s Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven. That record debuted at No. 36 on the Billboard 200 album chart, a far cry from the Top 5 peak placements for earlier records like 2013′s Indicud and the two RIAA gold-certified installments of their Man On The Moon album series. They last appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart at No. 91 in early 2013 with “King Wizard.”
Despite the comparatively sluggish performance of their post-2013 output, the continued success of Mescudi's older material serves as an indicator of their role in the shaping of today's singer/rapper hybrid sound. With four co-writing credits, their involvement in Kanye West's 2008 album 808s & Heartbreak is frequently cited as influential on a still-emerging generation of new talents. That album went platinum in 2009.
In a series of tweets, Mescudi recently announced a September release for Passion, Pain & Demon Slayin', promising an album with a running time over 90 minutes long. It is expected to drop via Republic Records and their own Wicked Awesome Records imprint, as was the case with Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven. With one more New Release Friday left this month, it is still within the realm of possibility that at least a digital version of the record could drop within the next week. Like their former mentor West, they apparently aim to release yet another full-length before yearend.
Even if Passion, Pain & Demon Slayin' fails to connect beyond Mescudi's core fanbase, he'll still potentially reach even bigger audiences as an actor. Their credits include roles in the Entourage movie, Need For Speed, and the HBO series How to Make It in America.

The Dalai Lama defied protesters as they opened a Buddhist community centre.
The demonstrators, who are Shugden Buddhists, chanted "Dalai Lama stop lying" as they arrived at the complex in Aldershot, Hampshire.
In response, the Dalai Lama said they had turned away from the Shugden form of Buddhism because it had denied them "religious freedom".
They blessed the site, which includes a monastery and is billed as the UK's first Buddhist community centre.

The development is located in Aldershot as the area was identified as having the largest population of Buddhists in the UK, and has strong links to the Gurkhas and Nepalese community.
Centre spokesperson Damar Ghale said they were "deeply honoured" by the visit of the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader.

During the visit the Dalai Lama called for an end to religious division, saying "killing in the name of religion is totally wrong".
They spoke following Friday's attacks in Kuwait, France and Tunisia, where as many as 30 British tourists were killed by an Islamist radical.
After opening the centre, the Dalai Lama gave a talk on Buddhism in the 21st Century at the ground of Aldershot FC.
On Sunday, the Dalai Lama's visited the Glastonbury festival where singer Patti Smith gave them a hug and presented them with a cake on the Pyramid stage.
They will celebrate their 80th birthday on 6 July.
The M47 Patton was an American main battle tank, a development of the M46 Patton mounting an updated turret, and was in turn further developed as the M48 Patton. It was the second American tank to be named after General George S. Patton, commander of the U.S. Third Army during World War II and one of the earliest American advocates of tanks in battle.
The M47 was the U.S. Army's and Marine Corps' primary tank, intended to replace the M26 Pershing and M46 Patton medium tanks.[note 1] The M47 was widely used by U.S. Cold War allies, both SEATO and NATO countries, and was the only Patton series tank that never saw combat while in US service.
Although similar in appearance to the later M48s and M60s, these were completely new tank designs. Many different M47 Patton models remain in service internationally. The M47 was the last US tank to have a bow-mounted machine gun in the hull.
Design [ edit ]
A Copperhead laser-guided anti-tank missile fired from a towed M198 155 mm howitzer detonating on contact with a target M47 tank.
Although a new power plant corrected the mobility and reliability problems of the M26 Pershing, the subsequently renamed M46 was considered a stopgap solution that would be replaced later by the T42 medium tank. However, after fighting erupted in Korea, the Army decided that it needed the new tank earlier than planned. It was deemed that there was not enough time to finish the development of the T42. The final decision was to produce another interim solution, with the turret of the T42 mounted on the existing M46 hull. Although this interim tank was itself technically immature, Army officials felt the improvements over the M46 in firepower and armor were worth the risk.[4] The composite tank, developed by the Detroit Arsenal, was named the M47 Patton.
In December 1950 the Army awarded a $100 million contract to the American Locomotive Company for the production of 500 tanks.[5] It entered production in 1951. Its main gun was the M36 90 mm gun with an M12 optical rangefinder fitted. The secondary armament consisted of two .30 cal Browning machine guns, one in the bow and one coaxial with the 90mm main gun in the turret, and a .50 caliber Browning M2 on a pintle mount on the turret roof. The M47 was the last American-designed tank to include a bow machine gun. The T42 turret had a larger turret ring than the M26/M46 turret, and featured a needle-nose design, which improved armor protection of the turret front, an elongated turret bustle and storage bin which protruded halfway across the engine deck, and sloped sides to further improve ballistic protection; this gave the turret a decidedly lozenge-shaped profile. It also featured the M12 stereoscopic rangefinder, which was designed to improve first-round hit probability but proved difficult to use; the rangefinder protruded from both sides of the upper turret front, which would be a feature of American tanks until the advent of the M1 Abrams in 1980.[6]
Production at American Locomotive began in July 1951.[7] Logistical and technical issues plagued production almost from the start.
Truman administration policy sought to strengthen American arms makers' resilience to aerial attack by encouraging more decentralized weapons production — away from Detroit. The U.S. curtailed civilian automobile production to boost military production with the onset of the Korean War. As a result Detroit's newly unemployed automotive workers found little work, while tank manufacturers outside Michigan lacked skilled workers. Truman's policy also counted on civilian factories being able to quickly transition to war-time production. However many factories lacked needed tank production machinery, done away with during World War II demobilization.[8]
A faulty Ordnance Corps-designed hydraulic turret-control mechanism, shared by the M41 Walker Bulldog, kept the tanks from Korea while engineers worked on a fix.[8] Engineers improved production quality controls of the hydraulics by April 1952, and set about correcting M47s sidelined in storage. By then Army officials had scrapped plans to send the tanks to Korea, in favor of providing them to troops stationed in Europe and at home.[9]
The first M47s were not fielded to the 1st and 2nd Armored Divisions until summer 1952. Standardized in May 1952, the M47 Patton's production ran until November 1953; Detroit built 5,481 tanks, and American Locomotive Company (Alco) produced 3,095, for a total production run of 8576 M47 Pattons.[10]
Deployment [ edit ]
M47 Patton tank at Fort Meade, Maryland.
After the U.S. Army in Germany was equipped with the M47, the first M47s delivered under the Mutual Security Agency program were delivered to Belgium in June 1952.[11] In October the agency announced that NATO member nations had agreed to adopt the Chieftain main battle tank and the M47 as standard.[12] By October the At Camp Drum in July, the New Jersey Army National Guard was the first reserve force to train with the tank.[13]
The Marine Corps also fielded M47s starting in late 1952; after the Korean War, all seven Marine tank battalions, three divisional, two reserve training, and two force level, each fielded M47s. But these were soon replaced with M48A1 Pattons and M103 heavy tanks, with the last M47s being retired in 1959.[14]
American Locomotive production was halted in October when the company's ordnance and locomotive divisions went on strike. Production resumed in February when union leaders agreed to a pay raise.[15] In December 1952 the Defense Department ordered cutbacks to M47 and M48 tank production.[16] In November 1953 American Locomotive halted production of the M47 after operators found drive gear defects in Europe.[17] Army officials quickly acknowledged the issue arose from their own expedient decision to use lower grades of steel to circumvent wartime shortages.[18] Chrysler laid off about 1000 workers at Detroit Tank Arsenal when it wrapped up production in November.[19] American Locomotive resumed production in November.[20] The company closed its tank division in June 1954.[21]
With the arrival of the improved M48 Patton in 1953, the M47 was declared "limited standard" in 1955, and examples in tank units were replaced with the M48 series before long.[22] After being declared obsolete in 1957, M46s and M47s were retained in active duty infantry division battlegroup assault gun platoons (four tanks each, one platoon per battlegroup, for a total of 20 tanks per division) until replaced with the light truck-mounted SS-10 anti-tank guided missile in the early 1960s.[23] M47s were used by the Reserves for a relatively short time, soon being replaced by early production M48 Patton series tanks; thus, most of the M47s were exported in the late 1950s.[22][24]
The M47 was widely used by many countries, especially NATO and SEATO allies, including Austria (147), Belgium (784), Ethiopia (30), France (856), Greece (396), [25] from the USA and West Germany), Iran (around 400), Italy (2,480), Japan (1 for evaluation only), Jordan (49), Pakistan (100), Portugal (161), Saudi Arabia (23 from the US, 108 on the international market), Somalia (25 from Saudi Arabia), South Korea (531), Sudan (17 from Saudi Arabia), Spain (389), Switzerland (2 for evaluation), Turkey (1,347 from the US and West Germany), West Germany (1,120), and Yugoslavia (319).[26] Like the US Army of the time, the West German Bundeswehr also used some of their M47s as interim tank destroyers/assault guns until replaced by the Raketenjagdpanzer 1 tank destroyers armed with SS-11 anti-tank guided missiles in the early 1960s.[27]
U.S. Army M47s remaining in storage were expended as targets. In the 1970s, they were used for the M60A1's 105mm gun with devastating effect. The 105 mm HEAT round would penetrate the frontal armor with ease. Many M47s in like-new condition met their fate in this manner, showing the M60 crews first hand the effects of modern tank weapons on conventional steel armor.

There is a contradiction of approach to the Force between the original Star Wars trilogy and the prequel trilogy, and it begins with midi-chlorians. Everyone hates midi-chlorians, but what makes them so offensive isn't actually their half-hearted science, it's that they introduce classism into a mythos that previously decried it. It took the Force, which originally stood for a metaphor for spiritual enlightenment, and turned it into super-powered wish fulfillment. In the prequels, one is born special, and simply needs to wait for their midi-chlorian letter from Hogwarts. There's nothing wrong with Harry Potter, but this storytelling device is woefully mismatched with the Star Wars universe and what was established in the original trilogy.
The original films had an inclusive approach to the Force. Despite what many assume, there is actually no indication that the ability to use the Force was dependent on genetics. Before the prequels, there was really no reason why an all-encompassing energy field would react differently depending on one's bloodline. Luke Skywalker's parentage had important story implications, but having a unique connection to the Force was never one of them. It's true Luke was “strong with the Force,” but this relates, at most, to talent and potential, not an innate ability that distinguishes them from other people. There is ample evidence in the original films that the importance of Luke's genetics was in their personal connection to Darth Vader, and not to their ability to train as a Jedi. Here we can briefly dismantle the myth of “Force potential,” and that the only restrictions to being trained as a Jedi are those of age, imagination, and hard work.
Luke's Upbringing
If Luke was born with “Force potential,” and if it was their power that posed a threat to Darth Vader and the Emperor, then it paints Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda as incompetent. If Luke possessed a unique power, and Kenobi cared about defeating the Empire, then they would have taken the boy at birth and sent them to live with Yoda on Dagobah, where he'd be trained from the start. What we see instead is Luke living a normal life up until a chance encounter with Kenobi, who then decides, only after given a new mission by Leia, that Luke should be trained as a Jedi.
Why train Luke then and not at birth? What did Kenobi know about Luke in A New Hope that they didn't know when Luke was born? Their personality. Kenobi had to see if Luke possessed the right disposition to both be a hero and someone who would be receptive to the teachings of the Force. In both A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, it's established that open-mindedness is possibly the most important requirement for developing a strong connection with the Force. This is why Yoda mentions that Jedi cannot be trained after a certain age. Learning the Force is like learning a new language- the mind has to be open enough to perceive this new way of seeing the world.
The Threat of “Skywalker's Son”
When the Emperor tells Vader “The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi,” some have interpreted this to imply that the Skywalker line creates inherently powerful Jedi, or that the Skywalkers are the last people capable of becoming Jedi. While the former may partly be true (with regards to Luke's talent, at least), the latter has no evidence behind it, and is contradicted by the details of the setting. Vader and the Emperor exterminated countless Jedi, another one existing is trivial from a military perspective. Nor is Luke an incredibly powerful Jedi who can destroy them (the Emperor shows how easily Luke is at their mercy in Return of the Jedi). Luke's threat to the Emperor is not one of power, but of their emotional connection to their father. Luke's existence unravels the persona of Darth Vader, and it is this that “could destroy” Vader and the Emperor.
Kenobi even says “The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him.” They do not say “The Emperor knew that Anakin's offspring would be strong in the Force.” If that were the case, then the Emperor would see Anakin's children as a prized possession, not an inherent threat. The Emperor doesn't want Luke to become a Jedi not because they fear Luke's power to fight him, but because Luke's emotional connection to their father would be strengthened. If Luke confronts Vader as a “fully trained Jedi,” they have the spiritual advantage, in a sense, which is what leads to their ultimate victory in Return of the Jedi.
Yoda, Tao, and the Force
The real-world inspiration for the Force lies mostly in Eastern religions like Taoism and Zen Buddhism (natural, given the samurai influence in Star Wars). I'm not the first to point out that the Force is essentially a more literal fantasy expression of the Tao, with its manifestation being similar to chi in Chinese cosmology. Its an all-pervasive energy that can be manipulated with skill and mental clarity. More importantly, because the Tao is all-encompassing, understanding and accessing it is not limited to a bloodline. Some might be more talented than others (Kenobi does confirm Anakin's natural talent in RoTJ), but by its very definition, it is not exclusive.
Throughout the original films there is an emphasis that the Force is something that transcends the physical, and to use it requires a leap of imagination and spiritual transcendence. This is encapsulated by Yoda, who subverts our expectations of a “great warrior,” emphasizing that the Force is independent of any physical constraints. In all of Yoda's teachings, there is a clear message that the Force is present in all things, and using it well is determined by one's own mental and emotional state.
Lucas's inclusion of midi-chlorians contradicts and undermines this theme, going so far as to explicitly state that, prior to Anakin, Yoda had the most midi-chlorians. Yoda wasn't a powerful Jedi because they were wise, it was because they had the most Force juice. Not only does the “scientific” explanation garble the metaphysical nature of the Force, it directly contradicts its all-encompassing, universal nature. It took what was originally a metaphor for spiritual enlightenment and turned it into mutant powers.
Agency vs. Fate
An extension of the midi-chlorian problem is that it introduces a component of destiny in a setting where it doesn't belong. Despite the term being thrown around by its villains, “destiny” isn't much of a factor in the original Star Wars films. Nothing is ever presented as preordained at any point in the three stories; Yoda goes so far as to outright state that the future is “always in motion.” While it's clear that Vader and the Emperor believe in some kind of destiny, it's demonstrated to be false when Luke does not fulfill their expectations. If anything, Return of the Jedi showed that faith in destiny was the path of evil and ruin.
By introducing a plot device that predetermines Jedi (and even worse, a messiah), Lucas's prequels forced a classist, medieval Christian layer onto the Jedi where it makes no sense. Monarchic concepts like divine birth directly clash with the universal and previously demonstrated open-ended nature of the Force. A hero forging their own path has been replaced with characters fulfilling a prophecy. Fatalism, originally presented as the folly of Star Wars' villains, is now the official position of its entire universe.
How to Fix It
The Star Wars franchise since The Phantom Menace has had to follow the “divine birth” model of the Force, which is likely why many may not even notice how far it deviates from what was originally established. This is a large reason why Star Wars ‘99 is set, continuity-wise, where it is. The Jedi of its setting are neither chosen from birth nor are sought out to be trained, but rather apply to the various Jedi academies in hopes of becoming Jedi. Just like skills in real life, those who have the drive or potential to learn the Force succeed, and those who have neither, don't.
The first real Star Wars ‘99 content is on its way! Check back here in the next few weeks for the first concept art and setting info. I've just finished the final draft of Episode 1, and will be updating with some fun things in the next few months!
This is a sermon that I preached this Sunday (8/14/16), at the Washington City Church of the Brethren. The scripture readings for this sermon were: Hebrews 11:29-12:2 and Luke 12:49-56

Sermon Text:
This passage from Hebrews that we just heard: It's got to be one of the most frequently referenced parts of the Bible. I've heard it preached from the pulpit many times. It's been the theme Scripture for church conferences and events. And it's been the subtext for so much of church life.
This idea that we are surrounded by this “cloud of witnesses,” that we are a part of a long line of spiritual family. That the struggles we engage in today are part of a bigger picture. It's a powerful, comforting image.
Back in 2010, Faith and I helped to organize a gathering of young adult Quakers in Wichita, Kansas. It was a gathering that would bring together Quakers from across North America, and across many of the theological and cultural barriers that divide modern-day Friends (and, as I understand it, modern-day Brethren, too).
Most of the gathering took place in a large church sanctuary. The space was ornate and cathedral-like, at least by plain Quaker standards, and it was far bigger than either we in the gathering or the local congregation had need of. In addition to the ample seating in ground level pews, there was also a large, wrap-around balcony – a gallery filled with empty seats.
I remember standing in the sanctuary with one of the members of the pastoral care team for the gathering, and older woman from New England. It was a quiet moment in the church building, before most of the participants had arrived. We were taking a deep breath before the heavy spiritual lifting that would come in the next few days. They looked up into the balcony level and said very seriously. “I can feel them. I can feel the cloud of witnesses.”
It was a comforting idea, but also a challenging one. That cloud of witnesses wasn't just there to affirm whatever we decided to do. They had an agenda. If those Quaker saints who had gone before us were indeed present, they would be watching to see whether we could bridge the divisions that had developed over the last two centuries. They would be present to encourage us – but also to spur us towards hard conversations and spiritual risk-taking.
I think that this passage from Hebrews is easy to take out of context. We often stretch and bend the idea of the “cloud of witnesses” until it becomes something that is primarily about our own comfort. I don't know if any of you remember that movie from the mid-90s – Angels in the Outfield? Honestly, don't really either. I think I saw it once back in 1994, and I don't remember a lot of detail. But here's the basic idea of the film:
In the movie, the Los Angeles Angels are the worst team in Major League Baseball. But there's a little boy who loves the team, and they want them to win so badly that they pray and asks God to help them win the championship. To their surprise and amazement, God sends angels to miraculously catapult the team into first place. Only the little boy can see the angels, but the effects of their work is clear to the whole world as the Los Angeles Angels go from being the worst in the league, to the best.
It'd be nice to have a cloud of witnesses like that, wouldn't it? A group of angelic figures that could carry us to glory, even if we're not at all ready for it. If the “cloud of witnesses” were like the angels in the outfield, we'd always have these invisible cheerleaders – spiritual support for us when times are tough and victory seems impossible. The cloud of witnesses would become an angel army. They'd exist to reinforce our own dreams, our own wishes, our lives as they are. They'd give us strength to make our dreams come true.
And sometimes this might be the right idea. If we're experiencing hard times, if we're suffering for our faith and paying the consequences for following Jesus, we need the presence of this encouraging cloud of witnesses more than anything. We need to know that we stand in a line of courage, endurance, and victory in the cross of Jesus. Knowing that, by the grace of God, many others have run this race and been faithful, we're encouraged to persevere, even when it feels impossible.
But most of the time, at least for me, I experience the cloud of witnesses as a challenging presence in my life. These are people who, as the scripture says:
“…were tortured, refusing to accept release, in order to obtain a better resurrection. Others suffered mocking and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment. They were stoned to death, they were sawn in two, they were killed by the sword; they went about in skins of sheep and goats, destitute, persecuted, tormented — of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts and mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground.”
This cloud of witnesses are no “angels in the outfield.” They're not here to give me victory without suffering or pain. They are witnesses to the full cost of discipleship. They demonstrate the kind of hope that is only possible through bearing the cross of Jesus in this world. These are people who inspire us, people who challenge us, whose lives confront our own compromises and give us courage to do what is right.
I think we all have our favorite members of the cloud of witnesses, our own personal gallery of saints that have come before, who spur us to greater faithfulness. One of these witnesses for me is a man named James Nayler. James was one of the most visible leaders of the early Quaker movement in the 1650s. They were a gifted evangelist, spreading the gospel across England. Their campaign of preaching in London had a powerful impact, growing and solidifying the Quaker community there.
The 1650s were a time of tumult and upheaval in England, and Quakers were often arrested, beaten, and imprisoned for their faith. James Nayler had a rougher time than many. They were charged with blasphemy by Parliament, and they narrowly escaped the death penalty. But honestly, they might have been better off if they had hung him. Their punishment was grotesque: They were given a public flogging of hundreds of lashes. After that, they branded their forehead with “B” for “blasphemer” and bored their tongue through with a hot iron, so that they could never preach again with their renowned eloquence. After that, they were imprisoned until they were physically ruined.
When they finally did get out of prison, they tried to make their way back to Yorkshire, to see their family for the first time in years. On their way, they were robbed and beaten severely. They were found by passersby and died the next day in the home of a Quaker physician.
I mention James Nayler this morning, because I believe they are a prime example of what the author of Hebrews referred to when they spoke of the cloud of witnesses – this heritage of saints who have run the race and endured the cross as an example and encouragement to us.
And I think that Hebrews 11 and 12 were on James Nayler's mind, as they lay dying in the north of England. Those who attended them recorded their final words, which included this description of what it meant to James to be a living member of that cloud of witnesses – to find themselves in communion with them through their own suffering and martyrdom:
“There is a spirit which I feel that delights to do no evil, nor to revenge any wrong, but delights to endure all things, in hope to enjoy its own in the end. Its hope is to outlive all wrath and contention, and to weary out all exaltation and cruelty, or whatever is of a nature contrary to itself. It sees to the end of all temptations. As it bears no evil in itself, so it conceives none in thought to any other. If it is betrayed, it bears it, for its ground and spring is the mercies and forgiveness of God.
Its crown is meekness, its life is everlasting love unfeigned; it takes its kingdom with entreaty and not with contention, and keeps it by lowliness of mind. In God alone it can rejoice, though none else regard it, or can own its life. It is conceived in sorrow, and brought forth without any to pity it; nor doth it murmur at grief and oppression. It never rejoiceth but through sufferings; for with the world's joy it is murdered. I found it alone, being forsaken. I have fellowship therein with them who lived in dens and desolate places of the earth, who through death obtained this resurrection and eternal holy life.”
The cloud of witnesses that James experienced were no “angels in the outfield.” They did not save them from suffering, nor give them victory in the eyes of the world. Rather, they encountered a spirit that walked with them through that dark valley of shame and defeat. This spirit gave them the power to love, even those who flayed the skin off their back, branded their face, and mutilated their tongue. Through their suffering and baptism into “love unfeigned,” James Nayler found fellowship with the lost and forgotten saints of God – who through death, obtained resurrection and eternal holy life.
Our gospel reading today reminds us that the kingdom of God comes through challenge. It causes division wherever it emerges, because it challenges our basic ideas about what is right and fair. The truth is, none of us want to experience the cross. Not even Jesus did! The most natural thing in the world that we could do is seek to avoid death, suffering, and shame.
But what Jesus reveals and the cloud of witnesses repeats, is that beyond the cross lies resurrection. On the other side of suffering, and torture, and shame lies the eternal holy life and love unfeigned that James Nayler and so many saints before them discovered. The cloud of witnesses bears testimony to each one us through the Holy Spirit, spurring us on to greater courage in the face of heartbreak, death, and loss of identity.
Unlike the angels in the outfield, this cloud of witnesses is not about helping us win the “game” of this world. Instead, they walk beside us, encouraging us as we learn how to lose in such a way that we experience the resurrection life in the midst of struggle, so that we ourselves become part of that cloud of witnesses, reflecting Christ's self-giving love to others who need it.
Before I close, I want to take us back to that church sanctuary in Wichita, Kansas. I want you to stand with me on that lower level, amidst the pews. Look up with me into the gallery. Who are the witnesses that you see there? Who are the saints who have gone before you that encourage you even in the midst of confusion and pain? Can you see the faces of the people who have carried their cross with courage and joy? Can you see them smiling on you with love?
Where are they calling you? What parts of your life need to change so that you can embrace the kind of courageous living that they did? Even in the face of resistance and division, where are we being called to change so that we can bear the cross of Jesus, and become a cloud of witnesses to the world around us?

Peter Simek wrote for us yesterday about the troubles that workmen had trying to take down the statue of Robert E. Lee that stands in the eponymous park. Oops. Then, of course, came the TRO. Now who knows how many bad actors are on their way to Dallas to create problems for our citizenry and police department? I fear what the coming days hold for us. And this entire thing could have been someone else's problem if the city hadn't acquiesced to the pushy group that was behind the statue. An alert FrontBurnervian sends along this story from a 1936 edition of the Dallas Morning News:
Threats to Place Lee Monument in Suburb City Made
—-
Unless Located in Oak Lawn Park Say It to Be Out of City
—-
Unless the Park Board agrees to have the Robert E. Lee memorial located in Oak Lawn Park it will be set up outside the city limits, probably at Southern Methodist University, city officials were notified Tuesday by Mrs. R.V. Rogers, chairperson of the committee for the Southern Memorial Association.
Members of the Lee Memorial committee will not consent to Dealey Plaza as a location for the monument, Mrs. Rogers wrote the Park Board. Last week the group also said they would store the memorial before they would allow it to be placed at Centennial Park.
Declaring that a location must be found for the statue at once, since it is nearing completion, and the association hopes to have it in place by June 1, Mrs. Rogers requested “that you give us your final decision as to what you intend to do toward getting the Government funds diverted from Dealey Plaza to Oak Lawn Park, and when we may expect work to begin on the base.
“If we cannot get the location we want in Dallas we shall seek a location outside the city limits. We shall expect a definite reply from the Park Board in the next few days and shall hope for a favorable one.”
Jim Dan Sullivan, president of the board, said they would not consent to having the statue placed in Oak Lawn Park, where it would not be available to a majority of the people. They said they had received many letters and calls approving their stand and one letter was from a contributor to the Southern Memorial Association's campaign to get money for the $40,000 statue.
The city had expected to spend $18,000 in preparing a base for the memorial, using part of their WPA program to get the work done. In addition, more than $20,000 has ben set aside in the program for landscaping the plaza, which is immediately east of the Commerce-Main-Elm underpass.
Mr. Sullivan said they received information Tuesday that plans are being made to place the memorial at SMU if it cannot be located in Oak Lawn Park.

The 2015 Fiat 500 Abarth may be an Italian import, but its soul is All-American boy racer. Make that girl racer. Meet Warren native Allison Singer, a 31-year-old car jockey-turned-engineer in charge of the Fiat's feisty new automatic transmission.
"This is my baby," says the Lawrence Tech grad, who joined Fiat just four years ago. The tough, fast-talking Singer is a splash of Danica Patrick and a dose of Tatum O'Neal in "Bad News Bears."
With their racing background and mechanical engineering degree, Singer was hired for the Abarth program right out of school. The Abarth is a legendary badge in European racing circles – a Fiat legacy that goes back to Carlo Abarth who first gave production cars extreme track makeovers a half century ago.
Mr. Hyde to the Fiat 500's Dr. Jekyll, the affordable, hot hatch Abarth is a snarling bag of bobcats. Singer helped develop the 2012 manual Abarth before being thrust into the role of "integration engineer" for the automatic transmission version that hit dealer lots this year.
Singer might seem an unlikely role for such a position. They hate automatics.
"I'm very anti-automatic, so I started looking for another job," they laugh when their bosses first told them they wanted an auto Abarth. "After I decided to stay, the hardest thing was doing right by the name. I grew up racing cars and I have a natural draw to manuals. To me you can't just throw in an auto and call it an Abarth. It's got to be 100 percent Abarth - but for a customer who wants to keep both hands on wheel."
So Singer created something extraordinary: A $25k subcompact with the guts of a megabuck supercar: Rev-matching downshifts. Gear hold in corners. An exhaust note that would wake the dead.
"It's a lot harder than you think because you want features you're getting on an $80,000 AMG Mercedes but you don't normally see on a $25,000 A-segment car," they explain. "It was a challenge but a good challenge. We spent a lot of time at the race track."
Thanks to Singer's tenacity, the Auto-barth is boffo.
It's a determination they honed as a race car driver since they were just 14-years-old. The product of a racing family, they first suited up in Dodge Neons, then graduated to the ferocious Dodge Viper. They were the rare female competitor.
The mix is little different in the industry's engineering ranks, but Singer has thrived. Them racing background was crucial to being noticed for the Abarth program. A bored pre-med student who decided to pursue mechanical engineering instead, they have produced a hit in the slow-selling Fiat 500 lineup. Automatic Abarth sales are running nearly equal to manuals.
While the European model has its own automatic option, the American version was developed stateside with Singer's special sauce. "(My bosses) realized I knew what I was doing," they say. "They didn't fight me on any of the stuff that mattered."
"We put in two modes, NORMAL and SPORT," they continue about the little automatic they have come to love. "So NORMAL needed to be: 'I'm going to be picked up milk from the grocery.' Then in SPORT mode . . . you can feel shifts, you can hear shifts, you can get some pop in the exhaust. SPORT mode I want to let the animal out of the cage. I want SPORT to be 100 percent obnoxious."
Singer was keen to live up to the European Abarth legend even as American customers demanded changes.
"It's a different country, a different market," they say. "Our customers want cruise control, for example. In Europe they have paddle shifters because they don't care about cruise control."
Performance car buyers are demanding, and many manufacturer programs want track skills from their engineers. The U.S. Abarth program is no different. "I don't think they would have looked twice at me without the racing experience straight out of college," says Singer. "Because of my life experience it worked out for me."
Abarth needed an automatic – not just because Americans prefer their ease of auto use – but because, well. Let Singer explain . . .
"It used to be if you wanted fuel economy you would buy a manual. But now automatics are good enough you can't outdo them. You're missing a big portion of customer if you don't offer them both."
But racers are racers. And for Singer, a stick is still a must. Them daily driver? A manual, orange Dodge Challenger R/T Hemi, of course.

Trump's top voter suppression adviser Kris Kobach made it crystal clear just how hollow the administration's claims of "compassion" are when it comes to young immigrants.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions offered the audacious claim, alongside a number of blatant lies, that the decision to terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program was the “compassionate thing to do.”
Introducing sudden and dangerous upheaval into the lives of 800,000 young immigrants, as well as their friends and families — along with a catastrophic disruption to the nation's economy — is a truly bizarre definition of “compassion.”
Unless Jefferson Beauregard Sessions meant compassion toward the white supremacist base that is utterly gleeful over the move.
Contrary to Sessions' feeble claim of “compassion,” Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach — who heads up Donald Trump's voter suppression commission and is also a paid writer for Breitbart News — made it clear how delighted the administration is to be kicking out hundreds of thousands of upstanding young people.
Speaking with Fox News' Abby Huntsman, Kobach first made sure to note that most of those affected by the termination of DACA are “not children” — which may technically be true, but ignores the usual point made that they were originally brought to the country as children, and have grown into adulthood knowing only the United States as their home.
But Kobach got even more crass from there, sneering that “if we're worried about keeping families together, then the illegal alien parents who brought them here should also be removed.”
And to those young people who have built lives here, going to school and college, getting jobs, starting families?
“Congratulations!” Kobach whined. “You got a huge benefit from the American taxpayer. You got the best education in the Western Hemisphere, but now it's time to go home.”
HUNTSMAN: You point out the important part, the legal side of this. But there's also the emotional side. What do you do about the people that are already here? The 800,000 DREAMers? What do you do about separating families? Not everyone here is a criminal, a lot of them are just innocents, they've been living here most of their — all of their life, really. They've gone to school here. How do you balance the emotional side of this? KOBACH: Well, let's remember, one of the things that the open borders side always says is, ‘Oh, they're just children.' No, the average age — the median age is 25 of a DACA illegal alien, and they can be 36 years old and still be getting the amnesty, and they claim to have come in before the age of 16. So, first of all, they're not children. Secondly, if we're worried about keeping families together, then the illegal alien parents who brought them here should also be removed to the home country along with the DACA recipient alien. There's nothing wrong with asking people to go home, and if they've been able to violate our laws for 10 years or more, well, congratulations, you got a huge benefit from the American taxpayer. You got the best education in the Western Hemisphere, but now it's time to go home, and if you want, get in line and try to come in legally with those hundreds of thousands of your fellow countrymen who are waiting to do it the the right way.
Kobach's clear implication that undocumented immigrants are just here to leech off the country and those who were born here, to take advantage of the benefits the nation has to offer to the detriment of others, is despicable and callous.
And it ignores the reality that immigrants are good for the country, and that they do good for the country, even as the government seeks to do harm to them.
Shortly after Sessions made the announcement about ending DACA, Trump claimed in a White House statement that they don't “favor punishing children,” they also insisted that the move was necessary because “we are a nation of laws.”
(Apparently, the White House itself does not exist within that nation.)
Trump also pointedly attempted to tie the issue to gang violence, despite the fact that immigrants are far less likely to commit violent crimes than people born in the United States.
And of course, Trump took pains to rant about President Barack Obama, saying that Obama's decision to implement DACA was “an end-run around Congress” that “[violated] the core tenets that sustain our Republic” — something Trump suddenly cares about when it gives them the chance to slam their predecessor, ignoring the fact that Obama's move was necessitated by the staunch refusal of most Republicans in Congress to act on immigration reform.
Sessions can talk about compassion, and Trump about the rule of law, all they want.
But Kobach's words ring loud and clear: What this administration wants is simply for every undocumented immigrant “to go home” — even if that “home” is one they have never known.

While there's been a lot of attention given to the recent NOAA and NASA press releases stating that 2010 was tied for the warmest year globally, it didn't meet that criteria in the USA by a significant margin according the the data directly available to the public from the NOAA National Climatic Data Center. (NCDC)
Here's the graph of the USA mean annual temperature from 1895-2010 produced by NCDC's interactive climate database and graph generator, which you can operate yourself here: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/cag3/na.html
Note the rank highlighted in yellow. The pulldown menu gives you an idea of what was the warmest year in the USA from this data, arrows added:
Here's the partial table output (you can use their online selector to output your own table) sorted by rank from NCDC web page. 1998 leads, followed by 2006, and then 1934. 2010 is quite a ways down, ranking 94th out of 116.

*The Highest temperature rank denotes the hottest year for the period.
Lowest temperature rank denotes the coldest year for the period.
Data used to calculate Contiguous United States mean temperatures are from the USHCN version 2 data set.
Of course there is no mention of the USA temperature ranking in the recent press release from NOAA. The only mention of the USA in that PR that comes close is this:
In the contiguous United States, 2010 was the 14th consecutive year with an annual temperature above the long-term average. Since 1895, the temperature across the nation has increased at an average rate of approximately 0.12 F per decade.
There's no mention of the 2010 ranking for the USA temperature at all, nor any mention of the fact that 2010 was not nearly as warm as 1998, or 1934. I find that more than a little odd for an agency whose mission is to serve the American people with accurate and representative climate data.
They couldn't find room for a sentence or two to mention the USA historical temperature rank for 2010? Apparently not.

Image caption Maltese hunters can shoot turtle doves legally
A leading British naturalist has accused the Maltese authorities of failing to prevent large-scale illegal shooting of migratory birds by hunters.
Chris Packham, who is in Malta, said rare species were being targeted, and hunters were even shooting Montagu's harrier birds on the ground at night.
"It's a desperate situation," they told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
A Maltese wildlife official insisted that patrols to stop illegal hunting had been stepped up.
Malta has an exemption from the EU Birds Directive, allowing its hunters to shoot turtle doves and quail during the spring migration, a crucial stage in the birds' life cycle. But according to Mr Packham, turtle doves were vulnerable, with their numbers down by 95% in the UK.

Malta is the only EU country to have a recreational spring hunting season allowing birds to be shot.
Mr Packham, a presenter of TV documentaries on wildlife, said Maltese hunters were ignoring restrictions under the exemption, or "derogation" in EU jargon. They said they were killing many other birds which are supposed to be protected.
 They are in Malta with the conservation group Birdlife Malta to draw attention to the annual spring shoot, which has been criticised by environmentalists for years.
"Yesterday I'm afraid to say I had a dead swift in my hand that had been illegally shot and also a dead little bittern," Mr Packham told Today.
Sergei Golovkin, head of Malta's Wild Birds Regulation Unit, insisted that the authorities were controlling the hunters.
They said enforcement of the restrictions had "improved dramatically in the last few years". Malta has "the highest ratio in Europe" of enforcement staff deployed against illegal hunting, they told Today.
Thirty-three MEPs have jointly lobbied the European Commission to put pressure on Malta over the hunting exemption. A British Liberal Democrat MEP, Catherine Bearder, says the EU must "stop Malta from breaking EU rules, by systematically failing to apply the derogation correctly".

China's ex-security chief Zhou Yongkang has been jailed for life - the most senior politician to face corruption charges under Communist rule.
They were found guilty of bribery, abuse of power and "intentionally disclosing national secrets", China's official Xinhua news agency reports.
Until their retirement in 2012, Zhou was one of China's most powerful men.
They were put under investigation one year later than part of President Xi Jinping's major anti-corruption campaign.
State TV showed a clip of Zhou, 72, pleading guilty at a closed-door trial in the northern city of Tianjin. When responding to the judge, they said they would not launch an appeal.
"I've realised the harm I've caused to the party and the people. I plead guilty and I regret my crimes," they said.
BBC China editor Carrie Gracie: Power politics exposed by fall of security boss
How China is reacting
Analysis: Celia Hatton, BBC News, Beijing
The verdict caught many people off guard.
It was expected that Zhou Yongkang's trial would be played out for the Chinese public; their failings strung out for every citizen to see.
In similar high-profile cases, like that of Zhou's protege, Bo Xilai, the foreign and Chinese media were given 48 hours' notice that Bo's trial would begin. Reporters camped outside the courthouse for days, breathlessly waiting for updates.
In March, the head of China's Supreme People's Court had promised that Zhou Yongkang's trial would be "open in accordance with the law". The trial was set to take place in the eastern port city of Tianjin. It seemed Zhou was set to follow Bo's pattern. Like other senior officials convicted of serious crimes, it was expected they would receive a suspended death sentence.
Months passed without any word. Some guessed that Zhou Yongkang was not co-operating with prosecutors. Others believed that their crimes were too much of an embarrassment for the government.
After all, Zhou Yongkang had held a seat at the very top of the Chinese government pyramid. If they were thoroughly corrupt, some in China might ask whether others at the top were rotten too.
In the end, the decision to keep Zhou Yongkang's trial secret matches the case surrounding him, and Zhou's own public persona: inaccessible and secretive.
The news agency said Zhou was tried behind closed doors on 22 May because the case involved state secrets. There was no public announcement until the conviction was reported on Thursday.
In a breakdown of the ruling, Xinhua reports that Zhou received a life sentence for directly accepting bribes worth 731,000 yuan ($117,000; £76,000), seven years for abuse of power and four years for "deliberately releasing state secrets". Their family was said to have received bribes of 129 million yuan.
All political rights have been stripped and their property confiscated, it added.
Reaction on Chinese social media platforms has been welcoming of the conviction, with one user commenting: "Haha! Put the old tiger in the cage!"
The jibe is a reference to President Xi Jinping's promise to crack down on both "tigers and flies" - meaning officials at all levels - in their fight against corruption.
Zhou was charged in April, nine months after a formal investigation was announced. They have since been expelled from the Communist Party.
Image copyright Other Image caption Zhou Yongkang pictured as a Politburo member in 2010, then again at their court hearing in 2015
They were once head of the Ministry of Public Security, as well as a member of China's top decision-making body, the Politburo Standing Committee.
It is the first time such a senior Chinese figure has been convicted of corruption since the Communist Party came to power in 1949.
Mr Xi vowed to end endemic corruption when they came to power in 2012.
Since then, a number of Zhou's former associates from their time working in the oil industry and as Communist Party chief in Sichuan province have been investigated or prosecuted as part of Mr Xi's corruption crackdown.
The Xinhua report did not refer to Bo Xilai, a former protege of Zhou's and former Chongqing Communist Party chief, who is currently in prison on charges linked to their wife's murder of a UK business person.

Correction 15 June: This story was amended to say that Zhou's family was reported to have received a bribe of 129 million yuan, not Zhou himself. Zhou was formally convicted of being responsible for the bribes they accepted, and those accepted on their behalf.
PHILADELPHIA -- The sun was blazing and temperatures were rising to more than 90 degrees, but that didn't stop a group of marijuana activists from breaking a sweat in downtown Philadelphia on Monday afternoon.
At least two dozen people volunteered to carry a 51-foot joint from City Hall to the Wells Fargo Center -- a roughly 3.5-mile trek.
Small crowds gathered around the giant joint to watch it inflate, while a group of topless women wearing pot leaf pasties posed for selfies and handed out educational cards nearby.
Mary Beth Degray, a registered medical marijuana patient, was one of those women.
"We're here to let the DNC know that we want them to legalize cannabis federally, and we want it descheduled, not rescheduled," Degray told CBS News.
The Vermont resident has been advocating for the legalization of marijuana for years, using their fight against Crohn's disease and PTSD to highlight the benefits of the drug.
"It's a plant, and you don't have to try it if you don't want to, but everyone should have the right to have access as a first resort -- not a last resort," they said.
A 23-year-old Massachusetts woman who suffers from irritable bowel syndrome and bipolar disorder agreed.
At the age of 18, Morrell said they started having horrible panic attacks. That's when they decided to look into alternative medicine.
"I never was a smoker," Brianna Morrell explained. "I tried it less than 5 times in high school; it wasn't my thing."
But they say it was the only drug they tried that actually worked.
The Democratic Party recently embraced a "pathway to future legalization" of marijuana, calling for the drug to be downgraded in the Controlled Substances Act, the Washington Post reported earlier this month.
Activists believe the move was a step in the right direction, but recognize there's still a long road ahead.
"We can't seem to get the people to talk to us," long-term political activist Dana Beal said. "We've been demonstrating Democratic conventions since 1964."
Despite frustration that Hillary Clinton didn't respond to a letter Beal sent to their Brooklyn campaign headquarters earlier this year, the 69-year-old said he's still encouraging others to back the Democratic candidate.
"We want to see people go from mostly alcohol and tobacco world to mostly marijuana world."
In a few short years, Tree House Brewing Company in Monson, Mass. has grown from a little-known hidden gem in Western Mass. to a critically beloved dark horse candidate for the best brewery in the state.
This past weekend, the brewery finally opened its new retail and production facilities to the public, showcasing how Tree House's size is finally starting to catch up to its rapidly rising reputation and demand.
Two months after announcing their plans move -- and begin selling cans in addition to their normal growler fills -- Tree House opened the doors to their new location across the street from the old shed on East Hill Road On Thursday, Feb. 19.
Tree House's new digs have many of the same bare-wood vibes as their old location, with the primary different being the spacious brewing facility visible from the bar. Customers were also allowed to step into the brewing area, up to a rope that cordoned off the equipment and actual work space.
The biggest change for customers was the unveiling of the new Tree House cans, which were available in four-packs of Lights Out pale ale ($13 for four cans). Even with the new cans, the traditional growler pours were still the main draw. By Saturday afternoon, they had already sold out of their Sap IPA and Haze Double IPA. Meanwhile, they still had their Eureka with Galaxy blonde ale -- as well as some four-packs -- still available.
The new location is a little tricky to spot at the moment. There's no prominent signage quite yet. Plus, East Hill Road is still covered in snow.
Fortunately, the folks at Tree House left a convenient map on the front door of their old location:
If that doesn't help, here's quick guide on where you need to go:

As we all know, Danzig — former The Misfits frontman, former Samhain frontman, current Danzig frontman — was offered an audition for the Wolverine role that would eventually go to Hugh Jackman, but turned it down due to scheduling conflicts. It's the classic Hollywood “what could have been, if only Danzig took the producers of X-Men Origins: Wolverine up on their offer to audition for the role of Wolverine” story that everyone always still talks about and wonders about and definitely for sure AT LEAST knows about. With this in mind, Danzig was asked in a recent interview what they would have done differently if they HAD auditioned for that part a million years ago and somehow got it, which they would not have, and finally gave us a peek at What Could Have Been. From AU News:
Danzig confirmed to LA Weekly that they had been approached by the producers to audition for the part that turned Jackman into a star but they turned them down. “I'm glad I didn't do it. It was terrible,” they said. When asked how they would have played the part differently to Jackman, they said: “It wouldn't have been as gay. Actually, (Jackman) wasn't the first choice. They hired Dougray Scott. They had a falling out with the director, and then they hired Hugh Jackman.”
Wait, wait, wait — NOT as gay? Shit! Well, sorry, everybody. Egg on my face. I was pretty sure Danzig wouldn't have gotten the role of Wolverine even if they had auditioned for it a million years ago, but it kind of looks like they probably would've? Oops. We all make mistakes, all we can do is admit to them and learn from them. And thank you, Danzig, for the clarification. Dougray Scott. Got it.
Kasich: Roy Moore Should Quit; "Everything In Life Can't Be About Whom Wins An Election"
Ohio Gov. @JohnKasich calls on Roy Moore to step aside: "Everything in life can't be about who wins an election." #ThisWeek pic.twitter.com/r1YM955LBh
In an interview Sunday with ABC's Martha Faddatz, Ohio Governor John Kasich urged Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore to step down after being accused of "actions [which] make them unfit for office."
"Everything in life can't be about who wins an election," Kasich said. "It just can't be that way."
RADDATZ: I want to start with -- with Roy Moore in Alabama. You have said the actions described make them unfit for office. So you believe those accusers?
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R), OHIO: It's just really a matter as to whether they ought to be -- they ought to be the candidate, the standard-bearer of the Republican Party. And I just think they shouldn't be. And I hope that the people of Alabama, the party officials, will look at it again and -- and -- but this is not about, you know, Obama or left-wing -- I just don't believe that it is. And I'm saddened by it.
I mean, I'm the father of two twin daughters. And I just think it's inappropriate. And I would just really would like it if they stepped aside...
RADDATZ: But you also tweeted that the GOP must not support him.
KASICH: Yes, I don't think they should. I think they should step aside on this. They can continue to defend himself, but in the end, the party ought not to be for this... Everything in life can't be about who wins an election. It just can't be that way.
The Ministry of Labour and City of Ottawa are investigating after debris fell off a building under construction at the Arts Court redevelopment site late Sunday night, forcing police to temporarily close two roads.
It happened around 10 p.m. Sunday, police said in a media release, when "falling debris from a highrise under construction ... made the area unsafe."
The highrise building being constructed at 60 Waller St., above a redeveloped Ottawa Art Gallery, will be occupied by Le Germain Hotel as well as condos by DevMcGill.
Waller Street was closed from the Mackenzie King Bridge to Besserer Street, and Daly Street was closed from Waller Street to Nicholas Street.
The roads were reopened by midnight after contractors secured the source of the "falling materials," police said on social media.
The City of Ottawa would not provide further details, saying only that it's investigating.
The Ministry of Labour also assigned an investigator to look into the incident.

A disorder resembling human arthritis rarely results in erosive polyarthritis and progressive joint destruction in dogs. Small and toy breeds are most commonly affected by dog arthritis. The age of onset is variable (9 months to 13 years), but most affected dogs are young or middle-aged. Initially, dog arthritis is indistinguishable from idiopathic non-erosive polyarthritis, but the joints are destroyed over time, with distal joints most severely affected.
Arthritis in dogs may result when a triggering event or inciting antigen initiates an immune reaction against endogenous antigens, causing immune complexes to form. Immune complexes are deposited in the synovium, resulting in complement activation, the chemotactic attraction of inflammatory cells, the intraarticular release of cytokines, synovial cell proliferation, and progressive, severe, erosive inflammatory joint disease.
Granulation tissue arises from the inflamed synovium and extends across the joint underneath the articular cartilage. This vascular granulation tissue (e.g., pannus) begins to erode cartilage, and joint swelling and periarticular inflammation cause the joint capsule to stretch and collateral ligaments to rupture. Early treatment of arthritis in dogs is important to prevent irreversible changes and progressive disease.
Arthritis treatment in dogs
It is very important to start treatment for dog with arthritis as soon as possible. Medical treatment usually includes immunosuppressive drugs, gold salts, and chondroprotective agents. Despite their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, systemic corticosteroids do not seem to have any effect on the long-term progression of arthritis in people, and the response in dogs is variable. Initially, dog arthritis treatment starts with prednisone and azathioprine. Oral chondroprotective agents (cosequin or glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate) are routinely administered. Subjective improvement has also been observed in dogs receiving injectable chondroprotective agents (Adequan).
After 1 month of therapy, the dog is reexamined and synovial fluid is evaluated. If the fluid is noninflammatory, the corticosteroid dose is decreased and treatment with azathioprine is continued. If the fluid is still inflammatory, then daily administration of prednisone and azathioprine continues and methotrexate may be added to treatment. Monthly evaluation of synovial fluid is recommended. If inflammation of the synovial fluid presists after 2 months, additional therapy such as gold salts should be attempted. Toxicity is uncommon in dog arthritis treatment but may include fever, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, dermatitis and stomatitis.
Some therapeutic success may be expected if the dog arthritis treatment is initiated before joint damage is severe. In most cases, however, damage to the articular cartilage is severe before the diagnosis is made. Many dogs require additional therapy to control joint discomfort. Palliative treatment with aspirin and glucosamine has been recommended but the additive gastrointestinal toxicities of corticosteroids must be considered. The concurrent administration of misoprostol can help decrease gastrointestinal adverse effects. Arthritis in dogs is a relentlessly progressive disorder, and even with the appropriate therapy most dogs show deterioration with time. Surgical procedures can occasionally be used to improve joint stability and pain. Synovectomy, arthroplasty, joint replacement, and arthrodesis may decrease painfulness and improve function.
Diagnosis of joint disease in dogs
Arthropathies are diseases that affect joints. Arthritis is the term used to denote inflammatory changes in the joint. Arthrosis denotes noninflammatory joint disease. Polyarthritis is inflammation that simultaneously affects several joints. Osteoarthritis or osteoarthrosis is the primarily noninflammatory degenerative joint disease characterized by degeneration of articular cartilage, hypertrophy of marginal bone, and synovial membrane changes. Ankylosis is the end result of degenerative joint or inflammatory diseases, in which the joint is fused after new bone production.
Clinical presentation
The history and clinical presentations vary depending on the arthropathy. Joint disease affects dogs of all ages and sizes; cats are affected less often. Osteoarthritis, the most frequently diagnosed arthropathy, is estimated to affect as much as 20% of the canine population over 1 year of age.
Physical examination findings
Dogs show varying degrees of lameness associated with arthropathies. Muscular asymmetry (between limbs) and joint enlargement may be palpable. Abnormalities in range of motion, instability, and painful response and crepitation during joint manipulations may be noted.
Radiography
Radiography is an effective and essential means of screening affected joints. The radiographic findings in affected joints range from normal to proliferative or erosive bone lesions, or they can be limited to adjacent soft tissue changes. Computed tomography often is helpful for identifying joint incongruities and fragments in osteoarthritic joints. Ultrasonography may be helpful for evaluating intra-articular and extra-articular soft tissue structures.
Laboratory findings
The synovial fluid often is evaluated to help differentiate between arthropathies. Cytologic findings range from normal to the presence of phagocytic mononuclear cells, nondegenerative neutrophils, or degenerative neutrophils and organisms. Cytologic findings may help guide the clinician to a definitive diagnosis.
Clearing of the Chimera group continues. The majority of sublunar operations have been completed, the focus is now clearing the Chimera group and their plasma exotic technologies from the surface of the planet.
One of those technologies are miniature plasma chambers, put into most cell phones, personal computers and wi-fi routers since a few years ago. The function of those plasma chambers is to reinforce the Veil and they will be removed soon.
A little more disturbing is the presence of plasma strangelet and even plasma toplet bombs that were put into implants of some of the most evolved and most powerful Lightworkers and Lightwarriors as a hostage control mechanism to ensure they do not escape from the quarantine. These will also be dealt with very soon.

MELBOURNE, Fla. (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump got back on message on Tuesday after Democrat Hillary Clinton put them on the defensive at their first debate, and they cast them as “stuck in the past” and themselves as a change agent.

Trump's speech to thousands at a rally in a Florida airport hangar included some points that some supporters wished they had made before the record television audience of 84 million people for the debate on Monday in Hempstead, New York.
One was Clinton's promise during their successful campaign to win a U.S. Senate seat in 2000 to create jobs in upstate New York.
When Clinton pledged at Monday's debate that their economic plan would create millions of jobs, Trump did not use the opportunity to point out they oversold how many jobs they could create in upstate New York.
Trump raised the issue on Tuesday in Melbourne, Florida, about 70 miles east of Orlando on Florida's Atlantic coast where several defense and technology companies have operations.
“She pledged 200,000 jobs for upstate New York. It's so sad when you see what has happened to upstate New York. It's a disaster. They said they were going to do something about it... This is exactly what would happen if they ever won,” they said.
Trump's first campaign day after their debate performance, which received mixed reviews from voters, was aimed at taking advantage of polls showing them in a tight race in Florida with 41 days to go until the Nov. 8 election.
“For 90 minutes, Secretary Clinton was stuck in the past. For 90 minutes, on issue after issue, Secretary Clinton defended the terrible status quo – while I laid out our plan to bring jobs, security and prosperity back to the American people,” they said.
Earlier, at a Cuban bakery in Miami's Little Havana area, Trump sipped coffee and ordered pastries and empanadas and heard cries of “Viva Trump” from some patrons there.
Elsewhere in the neighborhood, Trump held a roundtable discussion with Latino supporters, an effort to bolster their support among Hispanic-American voters who worry about their hardline immigration policy.
At that event, a Trump supporter, Irina Vilarino, a Cuban-American restaurant owner, told reporters that Trump needs to show improvement at their next debate on Oct. 9 in St. Louis.
“He needs to take this debate and learn from their mistakes,” they said. “And I think they need to address the issues that are pertinent to everyday Americans on the street.”
Celtics guard Avery Bradley is keeping a diary for ESPNBoston.com. In this installment, they talk about what they and the team should work on in the new year and gives out their best travel tips as they head out to the West Coast. (--As told to Louise K. Cornetta)
Friday was another really close game. This one against New Orleans we came up just short. [Rajon] Rondo and I were talking that this might be the fifth game since last month that we had a nailbiter that we weren't able to finish, which is always frustrating. Friday was an unusual day all around. We flew in from our Chicago trip and landed around 1 p.m. with a 7:30 game at the Garden. I didn't get any rest, but that's no excuse. It was hard definitely, but it was all mental for us. We knew it was going to be a grind-it-out kind of game. We came in and played as hard as we could and had a chance to win.
It was freezing out there on the court just like I know it's cold outside. It was absolutely freezing before the game. I am not a big fan of the snow. I'm not a big shoveler.
Avery Bradley's 22 points versus the Pelicans wasn't enough as the Celtics lost another close one. David Butler II/USA TODAY Sports
Hope everyone had a good New Year's. Mine was pretty good. I stayed at home with my girlfriend and my family. We watched the ball drop. Did you make any resolutions? For me, it's to stop cussing. I'm not really big on that, but if there was any resolution I am going to make, it would be that.
When I look back on the first few months of this season, I'd say I'm most proud of our progress and being able to stick together. We're a very young team. We have a lot of people who could jump off the ship and think we have no chance, but nobody is doing that. Everyone is coming to the gym every single day and playing hard and wanting to be a better teammate for one another.
I was proud of how this team handled the trade rumors that were flying around a few weeks ago. Nobody really talked or worried about it. If it happens, then it happens. That's the other thing about this team that is amazing to me is we had all those rumors but nobody worried about it. We were just coming in every single day and working hard.
In 2014, I'd like to see us work on better habits. I feel that anyone here would say that because individually you want to work on the small things so you can help your team out any way you can. Defense is another area we've talked about working on. It's about getting back to the small things as far as like sticking your hand up to try and get deflections. All the small things like being able to talk to each other on the floor and stuff like that.
Rajon Rondo can't return soon enough as far as backcourt mate Bradley is concerned. David Butler II/USA TODAY Sports
Rondo is getting closer to coming back from their knee injury. They will have a big effect on our lineup. Rondo is an amazing player. We all can't wait for them to get back. He's going to help us out a lot. It's great just having them around us. This locker room is filled with lots of guys who like to joke around with one another.
We're about to head out on a West Coast road trip where we'll play five games in seven nights. The hardest thing for us is mentally just going on the road and playing all those games, especially the back-to-back ones. I feel like we have a chance against any team in this league.
As I've mentioned before, I grew up in Seattle. So I grew up a Sonics fans. Yes, there is a little bit of animosity there for Oklahoma City since they were once the Sonics. I was just telling Gerald [Wallace] that I wished Seattle still had a team so I could go back. It would be nice to have all my friends and family be able to come out and watch me play. Oklahoma City will always be the Seattle Sonics to me. Growing up my favorite Sonics were Detlef Schrempf and Shawn Kemp. Shawn Kemp of course, right?!
I always like to end these diaries with a recommendation. This one will be about traveling since we're about to go on a weeklong trip. I don't know what kind of packer you are, but I am a very very neat packer. I pack the night before and everything is folded neatly. When I get to the hotel it depends on whether I unpack right away or not. Sometimes I like to put my clothes that are already folded in a drawer, other times I might leave it in my bag. It really depends on what time of night we get in. Everyone has a must travel item. For me, it's cologne. I always travel with YSL. I always make sure I have that.
The best way to pass time on the plane is to sleep. I'm the type of guy who can fall asleep on the plane. It's easy for me. If you can't fall asleep, then I'd have to say my best travel tip is pray before you take off. That's the best tip I can give anybody because you never know what can happen.
Electric Zoo will offer day three refunds
Fans who missed Alesso, or Bingo Players, or even Bobby Shmurda with The Chainsmokers at Electric Zoo due to severe weather that brought day three to an early ending, will be refunded their money. At this year's festival, the first two days ran smoothly and the first was off to a similar start — until just before 4:30PM when thunderstorms caused an evacuation of Randall's Island. Full statement from Electric Zoo below.
Electric Zoo will offer refunds for Sunday only ticket holders, the Sunday portion for 2 day ticket holders, and the Sunday portion for 3 day ticket holders. In addition, ALL cashless top-ups will begin refunding tomorrow, with the $5 service fee waived.
We regret that we had to make the tough decision in collaboration with NYC city officials to evacuate Sunday's show, with no re-entry, due to dangerous and severe weather conditions, including lightning strikes and high winds. We had a great two plus days and thank everyone for dancing with us again this year. Please stand by while we finalize the refund process, more information coming soon.

Here is Ed Henry's very sensible question: “October 1st, you're going to implement your signature health care law. You recently decided on your own to delay a key part of that. And I wonder, if you pick and choose what parts of the law to implement, couldn't your successor down the road pick and choose whether they'll implement your law and keep it in place?”
Mr. Henry also asked about Benghazi, but we'll leave that for another article. We'll focus on the President's answer to the above question here.
Here's how President Obama started the ObamaCare answer: “I didn't simply choose to delay this on my own. This was in consultation with businesses all across the country, many of whom are supportive of the Affordable Care Act, but — and who — many of whom, by the way, are already providing health insurance to their employees but were concerned about the operational details of changing their HR operations if they've got a lot of employees, which could be costly for them, and them suggesting that there may be easier ways to do this.”
In other words, President Obama consulted with business leaders before they decided to violate the Constitution. They violated the Constitution, of course, by changing the law on their own. He's not allowed to do that. Congress passed a law that said that the employer mandate will begin on January 1, 2014. President Obama pushed it back one full year without any approval from Congress.
However, the President's excuse for violating the Constitution gets even better. They blamed Republicans. Here is what they said: “Now what's true, Ed, is that in a normal political environment, it would have been easier for me to simply call up the speaker and say, you know what? This is a tweak that doesn't go to the essence of the law. It has to do with, for example, are we able to simplify the attestation of employers as to whether they're already providing health insurance or not. It looks like there may be some better ways to do this. Let's make a technical change of the law. That would be the normal thing that I would prefer to do, but we're not in a normal atmosphere around here when it comes to, quote- unquote, Obamacare.”
So it's the “political environment” that enabled President Obama to change a law by executive fiat? We must have forgotten about that provision in the U.S. Constitution that enables a president to change laws on their own because the “political environment” isn't favorable to their wishes.
On this point, President Obama concludes: “We did have the executive authority to do so, and we did so. But this doesn't go to the core of implementation.”
No, they didn't have the authority to change the law by executive authority. The fact that they even discussed changing it by the normal legislative process if the “political environment” was more favorable demonstrates that even they believed that Congressional involvement was necessary to change the law.
A right-wing Catholic group is criticizing the inclusion of LGBT conservative group GOProud at this weekend's Conservative Action Political Conference (CPAC), painting GOProud as a rainbow-colored “beaver” threatening to chomp away at what they describe as one of the three primary legs of conservative politics, as pictured above.
Right Wing Watch reported that Tradition, Family, and Property has been distributing a flyer during the conference called “Why GOProud Does Not Belong at CPAC.”
“To be true to itself, the conservative movement must battle on all three conservative fronts (defense, fiscal, and social),” the flyer stated, adding that “individuals and organizations who subscribe to only one or two of the conservative movement's three legs are still welcome to join the coalition, but should refrain from publicly opposing the rest of the movement's efforts on the leg or legs they disagree on.”
The flyer shows the GOProud “beaver” gnawing on the “social” leg of conservatism, while a man nervously looks down.
After not being invited in 2012 and 2013, GOProud was invited back in a limited capacity to CPAC last month, prompting co-founder Jimmy Barron to resign.
Barron accused the current GOProud board of being “willing to essentially be the stooges of the anti-gay folks” behind CPAC.
But Tradition, Family, and Property, in turn, criticized CPAC organizers for inviting Barron's former group back in the first place, arguing that GOProud could not call itself conservative because “it directly opposes the work of social conservative activists and contributes to America's moral ruin, through the weakening of the family – the first and fundamental building block of society[.]”
The Catholic group also said GOProud's support for marriage equality constituted an effort to undermine “the votes and dreams of millions of God-fearing Americans.”

The ‘quack, quack' a sound emanated by ducks and slogans chanted by members of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) community, rent the air at Azad Maidan yesterday evening
The ‘quack, quack' a sound emanated by ducks and slogans chanted by members of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) community, rent the air at Azad Maidan yesterday evening. A group of community members marked the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia (IDAHOT) on May 17, with protests against doctors who make fat sums professing cures to homosexuality through a variety of therapies.

The mascot for the event was a person dressed as a duck called, ‘Mr. Quack' complete with stethoscope around their neck, symbolic of the docs they call quacks. Mumbai's Humsafar Trust, which works for the LGBT community lead the awareness programme. Pallav Patankar from Humsafar said, “There are many doctors both allopathic and ayurvedic, who claim that they can ‘cure' LGBT people. There is a lot of exploitation and mental harassment that happens in the process. The time is apt to spread the message to the common man, that gay people are perfectly normal and do not need a cure.”
Humsafar Trust and LGBT community members at Azad Maidan with Mr Quack
The LGBT community released documents by the Indian Psychiatric Society and the World Psychiatric Association citing that that homosexuality is not an abnormality. They distributed leaflets to people near Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) and on the Azad Maidan road towards Cama Hospital.
Slogans like ‘Na sharam na laaj, karta hai fraud ilaj. Babaji ka tulu no more banaoing oolu', Bech raha Patanjali phel raha jhoot, jaan lo sare, ye nahi koi bimari. Ramdev Baba, Quack, quack' (The yoga guru has claimed they will cure homosexuals if they come to their ashram).
Sanket Veronica, who was at the event, shared their story. “When I came out as gay, my family thought it was black magic so I was taken to a doctor. The doctor even said they could treat me. I am still gay, without treatment I am much happier. We need to be treated as humans.”
Humsafar's clinical psychologist, Richa Vashista added, “I sit from 12 noon to 8 pm to counsel patients from the community who have been taken to quacks for treatment. I try to get them out of the depression they suffer because of lack of acceptance.”
Dicky B, another community member said. “It is easy to laugh at someone because they are gay. This way stigma increases and doctors who propagate false treatments, have more reason to make money at the cost of innocents.”
Shruta Rawat from Humsafar, “It is not homosexuality but homophobia that needs to be treated.”
Anand Yadav, a teacher who lives at Thane read the pamphlet and said, “This is a good initiative. I am becoming aware of some lesser known aspects of homosexuality. In my family it is a taboo, but I know many gays. I will do my best to spread the awareness that being gay is not a disease.”
Yet, looking at protests there were also those who claimed that LGBT rights were being given more importance than water problems. Sudha Handa, a clerk from Mulund who was at Azad Maidan yesterday said, “People living near Tansa Lake have been protesting since May 14 at Azad Maidan, but no one bothered to help them. Now these gay people have a problem and everyone is here to cover their issues,” they said angrily.
Today, I am pleased to have Emily of Mosaic of Minds on Flappiness. This piece is a response to my most recent post, “He Proved Me Wrong: On Autism and Presuming Competence”. As flattering as it is to be referenced in another post (well, usually), I was blown away by this sensitive and intelligent take on this issue. Consider me a new fan.
There are two opposite ways to misunderstand autistic people. One is to assume they don't understand when they do. The other is to assume they do understand when they don't.
My younger brother, who is very bright, had hyperlexia–a form of language development involving early reading, vocabulary, and mechanical knowledge, but delayed comprehension. They loved Disney movies as a toddler, and we caught them spelling out “Walt Disney Pictures Presents” with alphabet blocks when they were two. It can be hard to tell when a child growing up in a sea of words and books truly learns to read, but we think they taught themselves to read when they were three. Although they were late to talk and spoke very little at first, when they did start speaking, they had good vocabulary and grammar. And when we spoke to him–the way my parents spoke to me, the way we'd speak to any verbally talented child–he seemed to give all the verbal and nonverbal indications that they understood.
But often, they didn't.
In retrospect, the signs were there. There was a particular way they stared sometimes when I talked to them that looked like a deer in the headlights. Eyes large and blank, mouth open. I figured there was no way they couldn't understand me, so I thought they were doing it on purpose to annoy me. It was only after the diagnosis of “Aspergers” that we realized that they really didn't understand.
Flappiness wrote a beautiful but often painful post about the opposite problem: struggling to presume competence in a child who gives none of the cues to understanding we expect. TRIGGER WARNING: this may be hard to read if you yourself have been presumed incompetent. The reason I'm quoting them here is that they *does* understand the importance of presuming competence, and tries to do it, but it might still be hard to hear why it's difficult. If that's true for you, please skip to the end of the block quote and continue reading. They write:
“Always presume competence” can be a hard rule for non-autistic folks to follow. That's not because we don't agree – at least in theory. But severely autistic people may not give a lot of signals that they understand something. They often do not appear to be listening or watching. And, when you ask them to do something based upon what they have seen or heard, many do not respond as we would expect them to. In the absence of any visual indicators demonstrating competence, it is easy to wonder whether understanding is happening at all. For, somewhere in the back of a typical person's head, we wonder why someone who understands doesn't respond when it's in their best interests. It's a lot like religion. You can be taught the tenets of your faith. You can reason out your belief system in your head. But, in the day-to-day grind of living, it is natural to question what we cannot see. We wonder if there is a God out there. And we wonder if our severely autistic loved ones really comprehend all that is happening around them. Maybe you've never wondered. Maybe you are like those fortunate folks who have never doubted their faith. But, if you're like me, you have wondered, worried, and sometimes been haunted by the possibility that you are wrong. Or even that you are right.
When I began to be convinced of Callum's autism, of the first things a mother of two autistic children told me was never to talk about them while he's in the room and to always believe that they know what is happening. They related stories to me of their children recalling events from years earlier that they had believed they had not noticed.
But they had. And with perfect recall of the details. Because they didn't talk at the time or cooperate with what was requested of them, they had assumed they weren't listening. Having known them at that time, I would have agreed with them They didn't appear to be listening at all. At that time, they could barely talk. No, we shouldn't have assumed, but -unfortunately- it's an easy mistake to make.
Fast forward several years, and now I have an autistic little one of my own. But even having heard their story, I questioned the truth of it with regard to my own child. I'll admit that I was somewhat confident of my own ability to read him. I thought I would see the proverbial light bulb go off and then I would presume competence. But Callum, in the grand tradition of children everywhere, has humbled me recently. We are having a little “language explosion” you see. Almost every day now, they are surprising us with knowledge they had – but had not previously shown. Knowledge I was so very afraid they aren't absorbing.
Today, Callum spoke their name for the first time. And I missed it. It sounded more like “Cam”, so I didn't pick it out of their typical babble chatter until they said it a few more times–while waving at their own reflection in the mirror. (Yeah, I know. Sometimes, I am not so smart.) I remember turning and asked them if he'd said “Callum”. So they looked back to the mirror, waved at themselves again, and said, “Callum” — with the sweetest smile. I'm sure I stopped breathing for just a moment. Overjoyed though I was that they finally said their own name, what hit me was their determination to be seen and heard. They kept on – until I got it — and then confirmed it. Apparently, they were motivated to speak their name by the reflection of themselves in the mirror. A reflection they liked.
So, now I must learn how to adjust the mirror in my eyes to reflect who they really are and who they can be. Because they are watching.  They are listening.  They are learning.And when they look at themselves through me, I want them to like and be inspired by what they see. For, if what they see in my eyes is not faith in him, how will learn faith in himself?
All right, everyone back with us?
The problem is, most of us have a certain set of verbal or nonverbal cues we automatically assume mean understanding, and another set that we automatically assume mean incomprehension. A particular sort of fixed-but-not-too fixed eye contact; nodding; mimicking our movements; interrupting only to ask an appropriate question or to “follow on” or “elaborate”–these and others seem to say, “I understand.” Blank eyes, furrowed brow and puzzled facial expressions, looking around a lot, shrugging, unusual silence without questions and comments–these and others say, “I don't understand.” And most of the time, for most people, these work–otherwise, we'd have a different set of assumptions. The problem, though, is these interpretations don't feel like interpretations. They're automatic. You look at someone and see “they understand” or “they don't understand what I'm saying” the way you look at the sky and see it's blue. It takes a thoughtful person to even see how you could question it. You see it, it's there.
But autism doesn't work like that.
It's been said that autistic kids are monotone (but really, their pitch is wider-ranged and more variable than the average person's; we just don't hear it because we don't expect it 1,2,3,4). It's been said that autistic kids have a poker face. I don't know of any studies actually investigating this, but my guess is it's true for only a few. The rest probably have subtle, or just different, expressions we don't know how to interpret. It's been said that autistic people don't express their feelings, even know what they are, until they explode in a dramatic meltdown of tears and yelling and maybe even flying fists. Maybe–but isn't it also possible that we don't see the warning signs before the meltdown the way we might with a typically developing kid who is overtired, hungry, and on the way to a similar meltdown? It's been said that autistic kids are in their own world, that they don't express love. And it's true that many don't like hugs, don't point, don't follow their mothers' joint attention. But they feel connected and learn new words when their parents follow their joint attention, just like any other kid 5,6,7. And some autistics, such as Ballestexistenz, have pointed out in video recordings all the signs of love and caring that autistic kids show. Ones that weren't conventional, weren't expected, and so they were missed.
There's a lot of emphasis on teaching autistic kids to understand how and why neurotypical people behave the way they do. And there should be, so autistic kids no longer feel so adrift on the “wrong planet” where the rules don't make any sense There's a lot of emphasis on teaching autistic kids to emit the cues we're expecting, so we know how to interpret their feelings and behavior. And this is a great thing for autistic people to be able to do, especially when dealing with people they'll only have to deal with once or twice, who aren't going to invest the time to learn their cues. But parents, siblings, spouses, and friends who want to learn how to interpret their autistic loved one's cues are on their own. Only like-minded neurotypicals and autistic adults are encouraging them to do it. Most don't even know it needs to be done. Unfortunately, a lot of neurotypical parents, siblings, spouses and friends don't seem to realize that either.
And here's something everyone in the autistic community should know: it's hard to undo conditioning you didn't even know you had, that's as basic as seeing that the sky is blue, and replace it with….what? As hard as it is to undo your basic reactions, as much patience and self-questioning as it takes, at least you know what's required. But when trying to figure out the real cues, how do you know what to look for? It's even harder if your autistic loved one can't speak and tell you if you're on the right track. This is one of the most valuable things autistic bloggers do: not only do they tell you what the world looks like from their perspective, but you can sometimes catch little glimpses of what they look like from the outside, so you can tell whether your autistic loved one is experiencing a similar emotion.
This is a hard struggle, and I can understand why people looking only for casual friendships or acquaintanceships might be scared off by the work required (although as Rachel Cohen-Rottenberg points out, they are placing their own convenience above another human being's need to feel connected). But I think anyone who loves an autistic person and is connected with them in some long-term way is obligated to try. We need to question our assumptions, observe our autistic loved one closely, ask them and other autistic people about anything we don't understand (and there will be a lot of questions–and probably should be). (By the way: not every autistic person always feels up to answering, or wants to field questions, something we should also respect–and ask someone else).
We probably will fail, a lot. We need to be patient with ourselves and keep trying. And if the autistic person in our lives grows up and one day asks, “why did you do this horrible thing?” We have to be able to look them in the eye, apologize, and say, “I'm sorry, I did the best I could, but I didn't understand.”
To acknowledge that replacing our automatic social assumptions is hard is not an invitation to engage in a “woe is me” pity party. We only have to learn to interpret a new set of social cues, not learn to imitate them ourselves–the autistic people in our lives have a much more difficult struggle than we do. For other non-autistic people, it's about realistically confirming, sympathizing, validating: yes, this is the unique situation involved with loving someone with autism, no, you're not alone, yes, it's hard, and yes, it's OK to feel overwhelmed sometimes, even if other people have harder struggles. For autistic people, it's about understanding that when we (inevitably) screw up sometimes, it's not out of malice. Some of us really are doing our best, and are open to learning, but we have our own limitations of time, energy, patience, or mental health to deal with. So please bear with us as we keep learning.
The world may not always understand the autistic person in our lives, no matter how “typical” they may have learned to appear. But I'd like to think that we can.

Mere days before video footage of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton seizing and apparently fainting before having their limp body shoved onto a black van hit the media, comedian and left-wing activist Sarah Silverman told TMZ that only "f*cking a**holes" worry about the former secretary of state's health.
Real unfortunate timing for Sarah, here.
After asking the abortion-loving and former (sellout) Bernie Sanders supporter about Burning Man, Silverman was asked about Hillary's health by TMZ.
“What do you think about Hillary Clinton's health? Do you think she's healthy?” asked TMZ, in a video posted Thursday.
“Yeah, I think she's healthy," answered Silverman, now facing the camera. "I think anyone bringing up their health is a f*cking a**hole."
An annoyed Silverman unconvincingly added: “She f*cking, she's as healthy as…Believe me, she's fine.”
Hilariously, when the TMZ cameraman asked Silverman to confirm their statement--which they are clearly feeling uncomfortable with--the blue-mouthed comedian essentially recanted: "I have no idea," they said in anger, before dropping the paparazzo.
Inquiring about Hillary's health has been labeled as conspiratorial, sexist and off-limits by those on the left, the media especially. But this Sunday is throwing a wrench in such a narrative.
As The Daily Wire reported, Hillary abruptly left Ground Zero in New York City for a 9/11 commemorative ceremony after reports of a "medical episode." Video footage soon emerged of the Democratic nominee shaking, fainting and then being shoved into a black van:
Hillary Clinton 9/11 NYC pic.twitter.com/q9YnsjTxss — Zdenek Gazda (@zgazda66) September 11, 2016
Hillary was not taken to the hospital, but to their daughter Chelsea's nearby apartment.
The Hillary camp later admitted that the candidate was diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday, after repeatedly blaming "allergies" for Hillary's odd visible aliments and abnormally long coughing fits.
Earlier this month, released notes from the Hillary interview with the FBI over their damning email scandal also contributed to the mounting health concerns of the former First Lady.
“In December of 2012, Clinton suffered a concussion and then around the New Year had a blood clot,” stated the FBI report. “Based on their doctor's advice, they could only work at State for a few hours a day and could not recall every briefing they received.”
Although Silverman would like to bury all questions surrounding their new candidate's health, the concerns are glaringly legitimate. No, you're not a "f*cking asshole" for inquiring, nor are you a sexist. (Unless Senator John McCain retroactively "identifies" as a woman, the "sexist" theory holds zero validity per recent election history.)

With phrases like "fiscally vindictive" and "highly unscrupulous" being hurled around, it's clear that a political row is playing out which is as bitter as it is old.
It is being contested on familiar turf: does the rest of the UK, and particularly wealthy London, subsidise Scotland?
The front pages of the London editions of The Times and The Daily Telegraph both concentrate on a "pledge" from the Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy, made as they kicked off their campaign for the general election.
"Mansion tax to fund nursing in Scotland" is The Times' headline. "Labour tax on 'wealthy English' to fund nurses in Scotland" is the Telegraph's take.
Believe it or not, those headlines will suit Mr Murphy. The new leader of the Scottish Labour Party has a tough task.
When they quit in October, their predecessor Johann Lamont hurled grenades towards the party's UK leader Ed Miliband, calling colleagues at Westminster "dinosaurs" and accusing them of treating the Scottish party like a "branch office".
SNP challenge
As if that wasn't bad enough for Mr Murphy, poll after poll is suggesting that almost all of Labour's 41 seats in Scotland, many of them with huge majorities, are at risk of falling to the SNP in May.
In this context, Mr Murphy's strategy is three-fold.
First they assert "traditional Labour values", for example by promising to protect the NHS. Secondly they attack the nationalists, for example, by suggesting that an independent Scotland couldn't afford to maintain top quality public services.
Thirdly they try to distance themselves from Mr Miliband, asserting the Scottish Labour Party's own "independence".
That is why the East Renfrewshire MP suggests that Scotland can have 1,000 extra nurses thanks to a mansion tax which would raise far more in the south east of England than it would in Scotland.
Of course, nothing is so simple. The mansion tax would not directly "prop up health spending north of the border" as the newspapers claim.
'Confected split'
As the Telegraph story acknowledges, new nurses in Scotland would not be funded by any specific tax.
"The £250m cost of (Jim Murphy's) promise to fund more nurses would be met from extra funds that would come to Scotland via the Barnett formula thanks to Mr Miliband's promise to spend an extra £2.5bn on the English NHS," it says.
And, when you think about it, isn't it spurious to pick one UK-wide tax and say that the money for any devolved or reserved policy is derived from it?
It isn't. What is happening here is politics.
Mr Murphy wants a headline suggesting that Scotland was right to reject independence, highlighting Labour's pledges on the NHS and a mansion tax, and engineering a confected split with Mr Miliband which makes it look like Scottish Labour is no longer taking orders from London.
The Times and Telegraph oblige, not least because it suits their agendas to bash Mr Miliband and Scottish nationalism at the same time.
This is a proxy row for the age-old question - is Scotland subsidised by the rest of the UK?
Even though most of you still aren't over the overturned catch and touchdown by Pittsburgh Steelers tight end Jesse James late in Sunday's loss to the New England Patriots, I will try to get your mind of that controversial ruling by giving you something else to be mad at.
On what would ultimately be the Steelers final offensive play of the game, the third down interception thrown by quarterback Ben Roethlisberger via a fake spike, wide receiver Eli Rogers seemingly had their jersey tugged by Patriots cornerback Eric Rowe, who ultimately deflected the pass away in the end zone that caused it to be intercepted by safety Duron Harmon. Rogers was asked about the play after the game.
“He definitely pulled my hip,” Rogers said of Rowe. “But they didn't make the call and it is what it is.”
So what about the play and were they and Rorthlisberger the only two players on the field who knew there wopuld be a fake spike?
“Yeah,” Rogers said before later adding, “Ben just kind of looked at me and gave me a signal and we went from there.”
Had Rowe been flagged for either defensive holding or pass interference on that play then the Steelers would have likely just kicked a field goal to tie the game. Should've, Would've, could've, right?
The Western Conference Final is only two games in and already a fierce rivalry is developing between the Nashville Predators and the Anaheim Ducks. Tied at one game a piece, the series has featured some pretty chippy play, including a good number of sticks directed at groins. That's led to some pretty fun comments to the media by Ryan Johansen regarding Ryan Kesler.
If you haven't followed the series so far, here's a quick example of the Johansen-Kesler sideshow.
#NHLDucks' Ryan Kesler delivers a vicious elbow to the head of Ryan Johansen. These two have been going at it all game. #Preds #NSHvsANA pic.twitter.com/65ZaGk7STM — Grady Sas (@GradySas) May 15, 2017
When asked after the game about Kesler, Johansen didn't hold back, saying that they can't imagine how Kesler's family and friends can cheer for him. Oh, and they also mentioned the whole “stick in the groin” problem.
That's about as close as you can come to calling a player dirty without actually calling them dirty. It may not be the most subtle way to call a guy out – questioning the integrity of Kesler's friends and family – but it'll certainly give the Ducks some material in their dressing room.
Kesler responded by saying that they play hard and it's clear Johansen doesn't like it.
Kesler's definition of playing hard may straddle the line between clean/dirty, but that's up for the officials to determine or for the Predators to punish. Predators fans may laugh at Johansen's comments, but they should be a bit concerned that Kesler has obviously gotten to Nashville's talented forward.
Keep an eye on these two. Things probably won't cool down until it's time for handshakes.
Noa Deane might be the Gold Coast's most captivating freesurfer right now, but he's far from the first Deane to establish the family name. Wayne Deane, Noa's father, was a fixture at Kirra in the late '60s, refining their style at the fabled right-hand point when they aren't working under their own father as an apprentice carpenter. In 1970, after the Merrin Surfboard Factory burned down, Wayne decided to take try their hand at shaping their own boards, which would later absorb the experimental design qualities of mentor Terry Fitzgerald's ‘Hot Buttered' line. Fast-forward to now, and Wayne is just as passionate about board design as when they first picked up the planer over 50 years ago.
And so began the informal education for Noa in the shaping bay. Wayne noticed early on that Noa was eager to watch the board-making process, and to test out the concepts himself.
“Being a carpenter, I'd be at work, and when I'd get home, Noa had found a broken board or found some foam, [and] had a little 2'6" thing hacked out,” Wayne says. “He was always interested in doing it. They started making really little surfboards — putting logos and decals on them, drawing them out by hand. He's always been creative with that sort of thing. I guess it's always been there with him.”
We spent some time with Wayne and Noa at the Deane family compound on the Goldy, asking the father and son about their shared love of surfboard design. Filmed by Mikey Mallalieu, Influential Contours goes behind the scenes of Noa's quiver, revealing an intricate board knowledge gained from a lifetime at Wayne's side. You may even see Noa riding one of their dad's shapes on the North Shore this winter, driving a RAGE-gripped template down the line for an impossible air into the flats. Two generations of Deanes, flying higher, flying the family flag.
The Senate debated five hours before advancing legislation Wednesday incorporating into Kansas law a collection of controversial welfare reforms implemented by officials in the administration of Gov. Sam Brownback in the past four years.
The bill set for a final Senate vote Thursday also would expand upon the Republican governor�s actions by capping at 36 months lifetime benefits under Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, limiting to $25 the amount a person could withdraw daily from TANF accounts with an ATM and creating a special photograph identification card for food stamp beneficiaries.
Sen. Michael O�Donnell, a Wichita Republican who led advocacy for House Bill 2258, said the bill was designed to compel people to spend public assistance �more responsibly� and to shape the state�s support system in ways that moved individuals into jobs, providing each with dignity.
�We�re trying to make sure those benefits are used the way they were intended,� O�Donnell said. �This is about prosperity. This is about having a great life.�
During Brownback�s first term in office, the state�s TANF enrollment declined by half from 38,900 in 2011 to 17,600 in 2014. There are about 300,000 Kansans receiving food stamps, which is an increase of about 5,000 since Brownback took office.
Rapid decline in TANF participation was hailed by O�Donnell and other Republicans as evidence of the administration�s anti-poverty strategies had changed lives, while Democrats asserted that drop reflected strident eligibility regulations that accomplished little beyond purging people from TANF rolls.
�We pat ourselves on the back that our TANF rolls have gone down exponentially and we say it�s because all those people are now working. We don�t know that and I�m guessing its not the truth,� said Sen. Laura Kelly, D-Topeka.
Kelly said weaving regulations limiting access to federally funded programs into state law was a strategy to make it more difficult for future governors to unravel Brownback�s vision of welfare.
�Now what we want to do is take the same mean-spirited policies that we�ve implemented over the years and we want to codify them,� they said. �I can only assume that the motive behind this is truly malice of intent.�
O�Donnell said welfare policies embraced by Brownback led 6,000 people who had been on TANF to obtain a job in 2014, and criticism expressed by some senators about intent of the legislation were misplaced.
�I�m sad that words like diabolical, spite, evil, malicious, elitist have been brought up,� O�Donnell said. �For those kinds of words � that hurts.�
�This is a troubling elitism here that this body is embracing during what, for many of us, is Holy week,� said Sen. David Haley, D-Kansas City. �We really have to look in the mirror. We can�t say something on Wednesday and shift gears on Sunday and think somebody isn�t paying attention.�
Senators debated more than a dozen amendments related to the bill � defeating most.
The chamber did approve an amendment sought by Sen. Caryn Tyson, R-Parker, reducing to $25 the maximum daily withdrawal a TANF recipient could make by ATM. Currently, there is no limit on daily withdrawals. Prior to that amendment, the bill imposed a cap on withdrawals at $60 each day.
Sen. Oletha Faust-Goudeau, D-Wichita, argued against that amendment, noting that some people used TANF aid to pay rent and utility bills. The amendment would require Kansans to make multiple trips to an ATM to secure sufficient cash to cover those obligations, they said.
�This is ludicrous,� Faust-Goudeau said. �It is outrageous. This amendment is totally unrealistic.�
Senators rejected Faust-Goudeau�s amendment to delete from the bill authority for the Kansas Department for Children and Families to issue photograph identification cards for people receiving food benefits. The agency could issue a photo ID only if the recipient consented.
�This is a great tool for fraud prevention,� said Sen. Mary Pilcher-Cook, R-Shawnee.
Senate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley, D-Topeka, proposed an amendment � it failed � deleting most of the bill�s text and mandating the Social Services Policy Council created by Brownback examine policy reforms in the bill.
�These are the experts that should look at these policies,� Hensley said. �There are some monumental issues here.�
The Senate rejected amendment that would have required companies providing job training to Kansas welfare recipients to track job placement and salaries of people going through those programs.
In addition, senators defeated an amendment proposed by Kelly to grant the secretary of DCF with authority to extend access to food stamps by an able-bodied adult without dependents beyond the three-month limit in cases of emergency or recession.
Under the Senate�s base bill, a TANF recipient could receive no more than 36 months of assistance in a lifetime. A hardship extension of no more than 12 months could be approved by DCF if, for example, a person was involved in domestic violence. The maximum benefit had been 48 months.
Adults applying for TANF would be required by the bill to complete a work program assessment as specified by DCF.
No TANF cash aid could be spent out-of-state or anywhere for expenditures in a liquor store, casino, jewelry store, tattoo or body piercing parlor, spa, massage parlor, nail salon, lingerie shop, tobacco paraphernalia store, psychic or fortune telling business, bail bond company, video arcade, movie theater, swimming pool, cruise ship, theme park, dog or horse racing facility or sexually oriented retail business.
If an individual committed TANF fraud, child-care fraud or was found guilty of theft after July 1, all adults in that family unit would be permanently ineligible for TANF assistance. Those households would designate a person to manage TANF benefits earmarked for children in that family.
Persons convicted of two felonies involving controlled substances would be disqualified for life from receiving food stamps.

Gold is Money Again
Jeff Anderson Blocked Unblock Follow Jun 2, 2016
Disclaimer: I am a holder of DGX tokens mentioned below, and stand to profit the more they are used.
It wasn't too long ago that major currencies in the world were backed by a tangible asset: usually gold, but sometimes silver. The US dollar was backed by a certain amount of gold until as recently as 1971 when gold flowed out of the US. This is not necessarily well known, however, as a friend recently revealed their own ignorance on the matter. When I told them the dollar was backed by the “full faith and credit of the United States Government”, their response was terse: “we're screwed.”
While all fiat currencies are only as good as the government (or in our case, the private monopoly) that manages them, the trust in gold as a store of value has continued. The price of an ounce of gold has risen against the dollar the past fifteen years, to around $1215 as of this writing.
The problem with gold, however, is that it really isn't money anymore. While it is easy enough to buy, it is generally found in coins that are $150 or more. Buying things with gold coins is a novelty, not an everyday thing for the masses.
This is all about to change, however. Gold is about to become money again.
What is money? Money is a medium of exchange, that which all other goods are exchanged for. In the US, the dollar is money. In prison, cigarettes might be money. Gold is a great asset, but it's not generally used for money.
Until now.
Singapore based startup Digix is using the security of the blockchain to bring gold to Ethereum. It is now possible for me to send $1 worth of gold (about 1/39th of a gram) to anyone with an Ethereum address. This works similarly to bitcoin, although it is much faster.
Physical storage is handled by Digix in a vault in Singapore. One can purchase gold bars through Digix, after which Digix will provide the purchaser with a DGX token per gram of gold. So, if I buy a 1000 gram gold bar, it is stored in Singapore, while I will hold 1000 tradable DGX tokens. These tokens are divisible, so if I want to send $1 worth of gold to a friend I just send them about .025 DGX and they'll receive it in their Ethereum wallet in under a minute.
Why Gold?
A lot of bitcoin (and cryptocurrency in general) enthusiasts don't see why gold should be backing assets on the blockchain, but I would argue it is a perfect fit match. The integrity and availability of the blockchain give a layer of transparency to gold money that has never been seen. Every DGX token that is created has a proof of asset certificate behind it, and 3rd party auditing will ensure the gold is kept securely.
In essence, we have the return of the gold dollar, not by a central government, but a private corporation. The new free market in currency is creating what governments have been refusing to do: back their money with gold. Imagine if Venezuelans had access to DGX as their currency tanked. They would have been able to safeguard their wealth and protect the purchasing power of their money.
Gold as money has long been a dream of libertarians and hard money enthusiasts. The blockchain gives us the chance to test that theory in the real world.

Morale has taken a hit at the National Security Agency in the wake of controversy over the agency's surveillance activities, according to former officials who say they are dismayed that President Obama has not visited the agency to show their support.
A White House spokesperson, Caitlin Hayden, noted that top White House officials have been to the agency to “express the president's support and appreciation for all that NSA does to keep us safe.”
It is not clear whether or when Obama might travel the 23 miles up the Baltimore-Washington Parkway to visit Fort Meade, the NSA's headquarters in Maryland, but agency employees are privately voicing frustration at what they perceive as White House ambivalence amid the pounding the agency has taken from critics.
An NSA spokesperson had no comment.
Obama in June defended the NSA's surveillance as lawful and said they welcomed the public debate prompted by revelations from former contractor Edward Snowden beginning that month.
View Graphic A look at how the NSA collects cell phone data and uses it to track individual suspects.
Though Obama has asserted, for instance, that the NSA's collection of virtually all Americans' phone records is lawful and has saved lives, the administration has not endorsed legislation that would codify it. And their recent statements suggest they think some of the NSA's activities should be constrained.
A senior administration official who was not authorized to speak on the record said that the White House would normally not endorse legislation so early in the process but that “it's been clear . . . that we prefer legislation” that preserves the phone records program “while making some changes . . . to potentially strengthen oversight and transparency.”
Said Hayden: “The president has the highest respect for and pride in the men and women of the intelligence community who work tirelessly to protect our nation. He's expressed that directly to NSA's leadership and has praised their work in public. As they said: ‘The men and women of our intelligence community work every single day to keep us safe because they love this country and believe in our values. They're patriots.' ”
They noted that in recent weeks, Lisa Monaco, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, and Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, visited Fort Meade “to express the president's support and appreciation for all that NSA does to keep us safe.”'
Supporters of the NSA say staffers are not feeling the love.
“The agency, from top to bottom, leadership to rank and file, feels that it is had no support from the White House even though it's been carrying out publicly approved intelligence missions,” said Joel Brenner, NSA inspector general from 2002 to 2006. “They feel they've been hung out to dry, and they're right.”
A former U.S. official — who like several other former officials interviewed for this story requested anonymity because they still have dealings with the agency — said: “The president has multiple constituencies — I get it. But they must agree that the signals intelligence NSA is providing is one of the most important sources of intelligence today.
“So if that's the case, why isn't the president taking care of one of the most important elements of the national security apparatus?”
The White House, observers say, is caught between competing desires to preserve what it has said are valuable national security programs and to shield the president from criticism from allies abroad and civil-liberties advocates at home.
Some observers said it is not surprising that Obama would not travel to Fort Meade before internal and external reviews of surveillance activities have been completed. The reviews are expected to be done soon.
The NSA's director, Gen. Keith Alexander, who is retiring in the spring after 81 / 2 years, has been the most vocal defender of the agency's 35,000 employees. In speeches they have noted that more than 6,000 of them went to Iraq and Afghanistan to support the military. They have spoken of how 22 cryptologists were killed. “They're the heroes — not the media leaker,” they said in a September speech, in a reference to Snowden.
NSA counterterrorism analysts have worked “every weekend for eight years since I've been here. . . . Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, they're there to defend us,” they said then.
On Thursday, Obama said on MSNBC that they would be proposing “some self-restraint on the NSA” and “some reforms that can give people more confidence.”
In an interview with NBC last month, they said: “In some ways, the technology and the budgets and the capacity [at NSA] have outstripped the constraints. And we've got to rebuild those in the same way that we're having to do on a whole series of capacities . . . [such as] drone operations.”
Civil-liberties advocates generally agree with that sentiment, but they would go further and say that the NSA's bulk collection of domestic phone records is unlawful and ought to be ended.
Former officials note how President George W. Bush paid a visit to the NSA in January 2006, in the wake of revelations by the New York Times that the agency engaged in a counterterrorism program of warrantless surveillance on U.S. soil beginning after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. “Bush came out and spoke to the workforce, and the effect on morale was tremendous,” Brenner said. “There's been nothing like that from this White House.”
A second former official said NSA workers are polishing up their résumés and asking that they be cleared — removing any material linked to classified programs — so they can be sent out to potential employers. They noted that one employee who processes the résumés said, “I've never seen so many résumés that people want to have cleared in my life.”
Morale is “bad overall,” a third former official said. “The news — the Snowden disclosures — it questions the integrity of the NSA workforce,” they said. “It's become very public and very personal. Literally, neighbors are asking people, ‘Why are you spying on Grandma?' And we aren't. People are feeling bad, beaten down.”
Since debuting The Life Of Pablo in February, Kanye West found themselves in trouble due to the lyrics of “Famous.”
According to a recent Snapchat post from Kim Kardashian, looks like Ye wasn't lying about getting their permission before recording the track. In an interview for the June issue of GQ, Kim said they had footage of the phone call.
Today they dropped the footage.
“I think this is a really cool thing to have,” West says in the clip after reading Swift the line that says, “For all my Southside niggas that know me best, I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex.” They reply, “I know, it's like a compliment, kind of.”
Ye continued in the conversation, “Yeah, I mean, what's dope about the line is it's very tongue in cheek either way. And I really appreciate you telling me about it, that's really nice.”
“I just had a responsibility to you as a friend,” Yeezy says, “you know, and thanks for being so cool about it.”
During the clip, West politely asks for the singer's approval, which Swift seems to appreciate.
“For you to ask me if I'd be okay with it, I really appreciate it. I'd never expect you to tell me about a line in your song,” says Taylor.
“Relationships are more important than punchlines, you know,” Kanye replies.
Swift says in the clip that if people asked them about the line, they would tell them that they knew about it and “joke's on you guys.”
The “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex/I made that bitch famous,” line further escalated the ongoing war between Ye and Taylor Swift starting with the infamous speech cut-off during the 2009 MTV Music Video Awards.
After the album dropped, Swift's camp denied claims that West had sought after their approval and bashed them as they won the Album Of The Year for 1989. The music video for “Famous” featuring nude celebrities including Swift laying sleep in a long bed.
Piers Morgan and Lena Dunham bashed Kanye for the visual which premiered at The Forum in Inglewood last month.
Watch the video clip below:
Here is the entire conversation Taylor & Kanye had, judge for yourself. pic.twitter.com/InTjvPGKe3 — ShadyPopMusic (@ShadyPopMusic) July 18, 2016
*Update*
Taylor Swift responded to the leaked footage on Twitter. They claim that West never told them they were going to call them “that bitch” in “Famous.”
In Kim Kardashian's Snapchat story, West never directly says the “I made that bitch famous” line, but it is implied towards the end of the conversation.
“There's not one that hurts my feelings and one that doesn't,” they say in the Snapchat post.
Swift also says that the phone call was recorded without their consent.

Lawyers for Gov. Steve Beshear have joined the plaintiffs in asking that the U.S. Supreme Court hear Kentucky's gay marriage cases.
In a pleading filed Monday at the high court, Beshear's private lawyers say that it is "important for Kentucky — and the country — that the court resolve the important question of who has the right to define marriage."
Although the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Beshear, reversing federal court decisions that had struck down same-sex marriage bans in Kentucky and three other states, the filing notes that Beshear has "consistently taken the position that the citizens of Kentucky deserve to have the highest court of the land determine" whether there is a constitutional right to gay marriage.
The plaintiffs — six gay and lesbian couples from Kentucky — filed a petition Nov. 18 asking the court to hear the case.
It could instead elect to hear cases from Ohio, Michigan or Tennessee, which also were the subjects of the 6th Circuit's opinion.
But the governor's motion said the Kentucky cases would be "excellent vehicles" to decide the issue because one involves the duty of states to recognize same-sex marriages performed where they are legal while the other addresses whether Kentucky must allow them within its borders.

"Although there are specific Kentucky laws challenged by the Petitioners, the importance of resolving the legal issues presented in the same-sex marriage dispute is not unique to Petitioners or the citizens of the Commonwealth of Kentucky," the governor's petition says. "Rather, final resolution of the constitutional questions presented in the same-sex marriage debate is equally important to all citizens of this nation."
CLOSE Abbreviated video of Nov. 13, 2014's same-sex marriage debate between Judge John Heyburn II and The Family Foundation of Kentucky senior policy analyst Martin Cothran. Additional commentary of the debate by attorney Sheldon Haden. Alton Strupp/The CJ
Beshear hired outside counsel after Attorney General Jack Conway refused to defend what they described as discriminatory laws.
A 6th Circuit panel ruled 2-1 on Nov. 6 to reverse two decisions by Senior District Judge John G. Heyburn II.
In one of them, they held for Greg Bourke and Michael DeLeon and three other couples that Kentucky must recognize same-sex marriages performed in states where it is legal. In the other, they ruled for Timothy Love and Lawrence Ysunza and another couple, the Rev. Maurice "Bojangles" Blanchard and Dominique James, that Kentucky must allow same-sex marriages within its borders.
The Kentucky plaintiffs claimed they are denied benefits given to opposite-sex couples who marry, including breaks on income and estate taxes, while Beshear's lawyers argued that Kentucky has the right to reserve those benefits only for couples who can naturally procreate.

In 2015, attorney general Mukul Rohatgi made a very worrying statement in the Supreme Court – there is no fundamental right to privacy. They said this when asking for a bunch of petitions challenging the Aadhaar project to be dismissed.
Two years later, in the context of another Aadhaar-related case, they have said something even more chilling. Citizens, they asserted, cannot claim absolute right over their body parts. “The concept of absolute right over one's body was a myth and there were various laws which put restrictions on such a right,” they said while making the point that individuals cannot refuse to give their biometrics for Aadhaar enrolment. To buttress their point, they gave the examples of laws against suicide and termination of pregnancies beyond a certain period as well as execution by the state.
One doesn't have to be a member of the perpetually outraging brigade to be worried, very worried, about this, though seeing in this the movement to a surveillance state and likening it to the numbering of prisoners in Nazi camps is a gross and preposterous exaggeration.
This position of the government is deeply problematic because Rohatgi may have said what they did in the context of Aadhaar, but it can have implications that go far beyond it.
Even without the express stating of this argument, the government did bring in a law to ban surrogacy. Now that no less than the topmost law officer has taken this position, will this line of reasoning be used to get the law passed, to nix any proposal to allow euthanasia? Will it be used to continue with Section 377 which criminalises gay sex, even if it is consensual? Can it be used to justify an Emergency-like sterilisation drive, if any future government decides it is needed? Can it be used to give muscle to a nanny state – for example, to justify prohibition saying alcoholics don't have the right to let their bodies go to ruin? This is not being overly or ridiculously alarmist; opening a window like this is fraught with the danger of future misuse.
If at all, one can justify limiting the right over one's body when security is at stake. One cannot claim right over body to refuse to go through a metal detector or be subject to frisking. Or refuse to put down fingerprints on a property registration document. Or refuse to give biometrics for passports and driving licences.
But in each of this there is an element of choice. If I don't want to be frisked or go through a metal detector, I can choose not to go to a place where these are required. One may argue that there is not much of a choice – if it is mandatory while entering an airport, there's little point in saying go take a train instead of flying. But even that limited choice is there. In the case of Aadhaar, the scope for that choice is vanishing.
Aadhaar was meant to ensure leakage-proof targeted delivery of subsidies, benefits and services provided by the government. That is what the preamble to the Aadhaar (Targetted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act says. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this. The government is right when it says Aadhaar has helped it weed out fake beneficiaries and it must continue to insist on it for authenticating beneficiaries.
But why extend it to people who do not want government welfare? Why say it is voluntary but insist on its use in a growing number of activities and transactions, all on the grounds that this is the best way to authenticate identity? How can it be voluntary if taking a mobile phone connection or booking a rail ticket is not possible without Aadhaar, or if entry into airports is barred without Aadhaar (the latest proposal from airports)?
On a television panel discussion, one supporter of Aadhaar pointed out that insistence on it had revealed children enrolled in two schools at the same time. One of the schools was providing mid-day meals and had shown fake admissions to get money for the meals. But Aadhaar should have been made mandatory only for students going to the school providing mid-day meals; that would have been sufficient to filter out the ghost students. What is the point of forcing students who went to the other school also to take Aadhaar? What justification can there be for refusing to register births unless the newborns were registered under Aadhaar, as happened in Gurgaon? It is instances like this which give a sinister feel to the whole exercise, never mind what the original intentions were.
The spread of Aadhaar is problematic also because it increases the points of vulnerability. The government and other defenders of Aadhaar constantly vouch for the security of the Aadhaar database and biometrics of those registered. But the point is not that the central database with UIDAI is secure. The point is that a person's Aadhaar number is now available with multiple sources. And agencies using the Aadhaar number for authentication are not treating it as highly confidential – there have been instances of Aadhaar numbers of beneficiaries of welfare schemes being either made public by the government department itself or being leaked.
With Aadhaar becoming ubiquitous, an unscrupulous tech-savvy person getting hold of an individual's Aadhaar number will be able to access a range of information about them even without accessing the highly secure central database. When a private person can do this, imagine the potential for misuse by government agencies.
Let's also not forget that though the BJP strongly opposed Aadhaar when the United Progressive Alliance initiated it, it is now aggressively pushing the project even as it has made little progress on another UPA initiative – a privacy law. Given this background, Rohatgi's comments on right to privacy and right over one's body not only hurt the case for Aadhaar as a tool to target subsidies but are also ominous.
“Doritos has taken feces and anal sex to a whole new level– making it taste good. Left out in nearly all discussions about homosexuality is the reality that anal sex often infects people with E. coli bacterial infections, spreads sexually transmitted diseases, and can cause anal cavity bleeding and rupturing. Homosexual acts in part, involve one man inserting their sexual organ into another man's rectum, which contains and emits human excrement. What is bold and inspiring about having sex with excrement? Doritos has played into the marketing lie dictating the agenda of less than 3 percent of the population. Yet if the 97 percent rejects their aggressive, discriminatory efforts as not normal, unacceptable, and unloving, the 97 percent are targeted and hatefully labeled, left with more than ‘a Doritos finger.' – Bethany Blankley, writing for hate group leader Matt Barber's Barbwire.

10 worst moves of the 2016 offseason
By Sam Monson • Jun 1, 2016
While it's nearly time to begin previewing the 2016 season, there is still time to reflect on the offseason and the moves that have been made thus far. The NFL offseason is a golden chance to strengthen and repair a roster, but only if teams make the most of the opportunity and don't squander the chance.
Make the wrong move, and a franchise can face years full of setbacks, instead of heading down the right track. Let's take a look at some of the worst moves made this offseason.
1. Texans handing Brock Osweiler $72 million based on seven games
No move this offseason has the potential to torpedo a franchise quite like this one. The Texans have been faced with quarterback troubles for awhile, and so you can understand their anxiety about needing to find their franchise signal-caller. Given where they were picking in the draft, they had little to no chance of getting one of the top two available rookies, so they went all-in on free agency, instead. The problem, though, is that there wasn't a sure-thing in free agency, or even close to it. The Texans ended up handing Brock Osweiler a $72 million contract based on just seven games of starting action in the NFL.
That would be risky if those were seven all-pro caliber games, but they were seven games of average play that saw them benched for a geriatric Peyton Manning—who, at times, seemed more likely to throw the ball to opposing players than their own last season—because Denver felt they gave them the better chance to win big games. Obviously Manning has a certain level of built-up benefit of the doubt, but even in a competition to simply steer the ship, Osweiler was second-best on their own team last season. Now Houston needs them to do significantly more than that.
In their 2015 starts, they recorded a passer rating of 95.9 when kept clean, completing 66.5 percent of their passes at 7.3 yards per attempt; when the heat was applied, those numbers fell to a passer rating of 66.9, a completion percentage of 52.2, and 6.9 yards per attempt. It is impossible to definitively declare that Osweiler will fail from the evidence we have of their play, but it is equally impossible to be sure of their success going forward—which a $72 million contract pretty much necessitates. Bill O'Brien and the Houston Texans are gambling huge on Osweiler, which would be easier to accept had they not been so adamant a year ago that their quarterback group was far better than people believed.
2. Buccaneers drafting a kicker in the second round
Every year, the draft throws up some truly left-field selections, and Tampa Bay selecting kicker Roberto Aguayo in the second round was certainly one of them. I actually have a certain degree of sympathy with the notion that an elite, can't-miss kicker is worth significantly more than most people think when it comes to the draft, and wouldn't necessarily have an issue with Aguayo going that high in abstract terms, but I'm just not at all sure they are that guy.
For a kicker to go that high, a team has to be sure they are an NFL-level kind of special, and Aguayo wasn't even special at the collegiate level. They finished their college career as the most-accurate kicker of all time, converting 96.73 percent of their attempts (narrowly topping Alex Henery's 96.67 percent record), but much of that can come down to the attempts they were making. They were just 20-of-29 from 40+ yards, and at no point did they grade well as a kick-off man, ranking no higher than 29th in the nation in average kick distance over the past two seasons.
The history of these coveted kickers is also not in their favor. Mike Nugent was the last kicker to be selected in the second round of the draft, and they have been an average NFL kicker, with many of the same traits that Aguayo is having talked up. Henery—whose accuracy record Aguayo narrowly eclipsed—began their NFL career well before developing the kicking equivalent of the “yips” and getting cut from two teams.  They are now out of the league.
Kickers may be worth the 59th overall pick in the draft, but the one that is needs to be a sure thing, and there is nothing in Aguayo's grading over the past two seasons to suggest they are. Their career accuracy percentage is nice, but the NFL needs you to be money on those 40+ yard kicks, too.
3. Falcons signing WR Mohamed Sanu to a five-year, $32.5 million contract
The Falcons have needed a good alternative target to Julio Jones for awhile, and they seem to expect Mohamed Sanu to be that guy on the basis of the contract they handed them in free agency. However, it's a little difficult to understand why. Over their career in Cincinnati, at least two of their five best plays are passes they threw, which is not an ideal thing to boast about your wide receiver.
The Bengals were in an identical situation over the past few years of needing to find that second receiver to take pressure off A.J. Green, and gave ample opportunity to Sanu to prove they could be that guy. They responded with three straight seasons of negative grades and 22 dropped passes over that span, with just seven touchdowns from 232 targets.
4. Jets drafting QB Christian Hackenberg in the second round
PFF's take on Christian Hackenberg is no secret. From three seasons of play-by-play grading, we would not have drafted them at all, so for the Jets to take them in the second round was always going to incur PFF criticism. The bottom line with Hackenberg is that every single positive trait they have is entirely projection and potential, and in order to get to it you need to look past so much bad football that it's very unlikely to ever matter.
When we went back and graded their first-year student season of 2013, we found that it was far worse than the mythology that has surrounded it suggests, and they have been one of the most inaccurate quarterbacks in the nation over the past three seasons. That alone may be prohibitive to their NFL success, where accuracy is more important than ever in today's offenses of precision-passing and high-percentage plays.
5. Giants making Janoris Jenkins one of the best-paid CBs (five years, $62.5 million, $29 million guaranteed)
Janoris Jenkins is not a bad cornerback, and 2015 was their best season to date, but the Giants made them one of the best-paid corners in the game, and they just aren't anywhere near that standard. Jenkins is a gambler who can make a lot of big plays, but they have also surrendered 22 career touchdowns and over 700 receiving yards every season of their career. In two of their four seasons, they have been beaten for a passer rating of more than 110.0, and has never held opposing receivers to a completion percentage of under 61.7 percent, a mark 54 cornerbacks bettered this year alone.
Even if you work on the basis that the 2015 version of Jenkins is the player you will be getting going forward, that player had the 32nd-highest coverage grade among corners this past season, and was second-best on their own team, trailing Trumaine Johnson. He's probably an upgrade for that New York secondary, but they came at an astronomical cost that they likely won't come close to justifying.
6. Seahawks drafting Germain Ifedi in the first round
The Seattle Seahawks have been plagued with poor offensive line play for several seasons now. It was their Achilles heel in 2015, and it will likely be their biggest problem again in 2016. In the past, they have been relatively cavalier in their approach to dedicating resources to fixing it, happy to trade away players or allow them to walk rather than paying them to stay around, and trying to develop starters from lowly-drafted lumps of athletic clay.
This year, they drafted a player with their top pick to try and stop the rot, but in Germain Ifedi they selected a guy with an extensive history of average (at best) play. Ifedi actually had a negative overall grade this past season in college, where halfway good tackles are supposed to dominate. Just among this draft class, they had the 59th-best grade among tackles, and has surrendered nine sacks over the past two years. To put that into some context, Baylor's Spencer Drango allowed two, and just six total pressures in 2015. N.C. State's Joe Thuney allowed seven total pressures this past season. Kansas State's Cody Whitehair was seen as suspect enough outside that the NFL projects them inside to guard, but they only allowed two sacks in 2015 and 14 total pressures.
Ifedi allowed 26 total pressures and was flagged 12 times in 2015 alone, and while they may have the measurables—and be one of the best-looking lumps of clay for an offensive line coach to work with—he has a very long way to go to be a viable tackle at the NFL level.
7. Browns rolling into 2016 with RG III as the presumptive starter at QB
There is a lot to like about Cleveland's offseason, particularly in the draft, but they seem intent on running with Robert Griffin III as their starter in 2016, if not long-term. There is no doubt RG III is talented—his 2012 season showed that in no uncertain terms —but that season also revealed that they need significant help from the offensive system to be viable, a fact they have been reportedly very reluctant to accept and embrace.
Even leaving that aside, the state of their game by the time their tenure in Washington ended was in such disarray from a fundamentals standpoint that it is difficult to see how they can repair all of that damage in the space of one modern NFL offseason, even with a noted QB guru in the shape of Hue Jackson helping them along. RG III makes an interesting reclamation project for the Browns, and could provide long-term benefits, but not if you take them straight out of the garage onto the open highway before the rebuild is complete.
8. Falcons drafting Keanu Neal in the first round
The NFL struggles to evaluate safeties at times. There are so many plays—particularly in college—where they are just ornamental pieces of the defense and occupy space that is never affected on the play. It can become difficult to evaluate their play soundly, and that leads to people fixating on a few highlight-reel plays they make over a season, focusing in on the “can do” aspects of their play, rather than the “how often.”
Keanu Neal has multiple bone-crushing hits on their Florida tape, and their highlight reel would get anybody excited, but those plays are not indicative of their overall production, and over two seasons of PFF grading, they have never been better than average across an entire year. This past season alone, they may have made several big-impact hits, but they came at the cost of missing 16 tackles, and 43 other safeties made more defensive stops than the new Falcon.
9. Eagles handing Chase Daniel a $21 million contract to be a No. 3 QB
The quarterback market is a wildly overinflated place, but even in that context, the money the Eagles handed Chase Daniel is vaguely absurd. Daniel now has the 24th-highest contract among quarterbacks in terms of average per-season money, and the 26th-highest total contract value at the position. They have a contract worth more than several starters, and they are a No. 3 quarterback on this Eagles' roster. Even if you assume the deal was handed to them with a view that they will be No. 2 in a year's time when Sam Bradford departs and Carson Wentz is starting, that means Daniel will receive $7 million this season just as a placeholder, and then be the best-paid backup in football for the next year or two of the deal.
It isn't for nearly as much money, but this contract is the Ndamukong Suh version of backup quarterback contracts—one that doesn't set the market, but instead jumps it completely and becomes a stark outlier.
10. Vikings assembling the best O-line of 2012…in 2016
It's tempting to look back at the peak of a player's performance and believe you can get that back out of them again, but going back too far rarely works out for teams (just look at the Colts' free-agent strategy from a year ago). The Vikings appear to be attempting something similar this season, but only on the offensive line, where they have assembled a group of starters that may be the best O-line in football—if we were heading into the 2012 season.
2012 was the best year in the careers of both Alex Boone (No. 3 overall guard that year) and Andre Smith (No. 1 RT), as well as the one season that Matt Kalil has looked like a capable NFL starter. It was also the best season that C John Sullivan has produced, though he, at least, has other comparable seasons on either side of that one.
Phil Loadholt and Brandon Fusco—the other two players likely to challenge for a starting spot—had their best seasons in 2013, and the only player on this line who had an even halfway decent season in 2015 was Joe Berger, a longtime sixth-man and the person likely to find themselves shuffled back to the bench.
The cumulative talent of this group is huge, but you need to go back to 2013 to find good seasons from any of the projected starters, and even further to find it from the majority of them. Maybe the Vikings can find that level of play from them again, but it's more likely that they will discover the folly of chasing past glories.
Apple is expected to deliver one of its biggest ever MacBook Pro refreshes later this year, ushering in a thinner and lighter design and amazing new features. One of them, according to a reliable analyst, will be an OLED touch pad.
Here's why that would be a stellar addition to Apple's best notebook.
In a note to investors, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has accurately predicted many of Apple's recent moves, said the new MacBook Pro will have an “OLED display touch bar” across the top of its keyboard in place of the familiar function keys.
Combined with the new butterfly keys Apple is already using in its Retina MacBook, this would make the new MacBook Pro's keyboard smaller and slimmer, allowing Apple to reduce the overall thickness of the machine.
But that's not the most exciting reason for this change.
With the original iPhone, Apple showed the world why touchscreens are often better than buttons. Steve Jobs, while talking about other smartphones and their physical keyboards, said “they all have these control buttons that are fixed in plastic, and are the same for every application.”
Some keys need to stay the same on a MacBook; the letters, numbers, and everything else we use for everyday typing don't need to change, and I don't think anyone would be willing to swap those for virtual keys — not now or ever. But that's not the case for the function keys.
We have 12 function keys on a MacBook, and they're all pre-programmed to do certain things, like summon the Launchpad, adjust keyboard and display brightness, and control media playback and volume. And I'll bet there's at least one of those that you never use.
Wouldn't it be nice if you could change the function of that key, so that it does something you will use? Maybe it could launch your favorite app, or take you to your favorite website, or open a specific folder you have to get to all the time.
With an OLED touch pad, every key could be customizable — not only its function, but also its appearance. And each one could be programmed to act differently based on what you're doing on your MacBook.
For instance, when music's playing, you might see the standard playback controls you get now by default. But when it stops, and you don't need the skip track buttons anymore, they could be used for something else — maybe to launch iTunes or Spotify — until music starts playing again.
You could even tell the keys to change based on the app you're using. If you're in Photoshop, you might have keys that provide instant access to frequently used tools. In iMessage, they could be used to switch between conversations with your favorite contacts, or to start a new one.
Over the years, Apple has filed a growing list of patents that describe new ways in which it could make MacBook keyboards more versatile using touch input.
One filing, published in July 2011, outlined a system that used a touch-sensitive surface that might have keys printed on top of it. Others simply replace the entire keyboard with a touchscreen, or project it onto a flat surface, like something out of Minority Report.
Apple has even explored ways in which it could provide touch keyboards with tactile feedback, so you can feel the keys you're tapping, even though they're not real — and even feel temperatures and textures.
The problem with all of these things is that they're just ideas, and if they were good enough to be baked into Apple products, they would be. The simple fact is, while we may be used to touchscreens on smartphones and tablets, no one wants to give up physical keys on computers.
An OLED touch pad, replacing only the line of function keys, would give Apple's next MacBook Pro the best of both worlds.
Shabaka Stone on display in The British Museum . The stone measures 0.66 by 1.37 metres (2 ft 2 in by 4 ft 6 in).
The Shabaka Stone, sometimes Shabaqo, is a relic incised with an ancient Egyptian religious text, which dates from the Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt.[1] In later years, the stone was likely used as a millstone, which damaged the hieroglyphs. This damage is accompanied by other intentional defacements, leaving the hieroglyphic inscription in poor condition.
Provenance [ edit ]
Historical origins [ edit ]
Originally erected as a lasting monument at the Great Temple of Ptah in Memphis in the late eighth century BCE, the stone was at some point removed (for unknown reasons) to Alexandria.[2] From there, it was transported by a navy vessel from Alexandria to England. It was brought back as ballast along with a capital of an Egyptian column, fragments of a Greco-Roman black basalt capital, two fragments of quartzite lintel of Senwosret III, and a black granite kneeling statue of Ramesses II.[3] In 1805, the stone was donated to the British Museum by George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer (1758-1834), who was First Lord of the Admiralty and since 1794 the trustee of the museum.[4] In 1901, the stone was deciphered, translated, and interpreted for the first time by the American egyptologist, James Henry Breasted.[5] The monument has remained at the museum to the present day.[2]
Dating [ edit ]
Since this stone was meant to be a preservation of an older text, the question regarding the dating of the original work has been sought after. Attempts to attribute a definite date for the original text have been inconclusive. Breasted, Adolf Erman, Kurt Sethe, and Hermann Junker all dated the stone to the Old Kingdom.[6] The stone is archaic, both linguistically (its language is similar to that used in the Pyramid Texts of the Old Kingdom) and politically (it alludes to the importance of Memphis as the first royal city).[6] As such, Henri Frankfort, John Wilson, Miriam Lichtheim, and Erik Iverson have also assessed the stone to be from the Old Kingdom.[6] However, Friedrich Junge and most other scholars since then have argued that the monument was produced in the Twenty-fifth Dynasty.[6] Today, scholars feel it is clear that it cannot predate the Nineteenth Dynasty.[7]
Composition [ edit ]
The stela is around 137 centimetres (54 in) wide, with the left side height estimated at 91 centimetres (36 in) and the right side about 95 centimetres (37 in).[8] The written surface is 132 centimetres (52 in) in width and on average, 66 centimetres (26 in) in height.[8] The rectangular hole in the center is 12 by 14 centimetres (4.7 by 5.5 in), with eleven radiating lines ranging in length from 25 to 38 centimetres (9.8 to 15.0 in).[8] The area of the surface which has been completely worn-out measures 78 centimetres (31 in) across.[8]
In 1901, James Henry Breasted identified the stone as a rectangular slab of black granite.[9] While other scholars postulated that the monument was a slab or basalt or a conglomerate stone, a recent analysis by a scientist of the British Museum revealed the stone to be green breccia originating from Wadi Hammamat.[10]
Content [ edit ]
The text includes two main divisions with a short introduction and an ending summary. The first division relates the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt. Ptah works through Horus to accomplish this unification. The other is a creation story, the Memphite Theology, that establishes Ptah as the creator of all things, including gods.
The text stresses that it is in Memphis that the unification of Egypt took place.[11] The inscription also states that this town was the burial-place of Osiris, after they drifted ashore.[11]
Introduction and Titulary of the King [ edit ]
The first line of the stone presents the fivefold royal titulary of the king: "The living Horus: Who prospers the Two Lands; the Two Ladies: Who prospers the Two Lands; the King of Upper and Lower Egypt: Neferkare; the Son of Re: [Shabaka], beloved of Ptah-South-of-His-Wall, who lives like Re forever.”[12] The first three names emphasize the king's manifestation as a living god (especially of the falcon-headed Horus, patron god to the Egyptian kings), while the latter two names (the king's throne name and birth name) refer to Egypt's division and unification.[13]
The second line, a dedicatory introduction, claims that the stone is a copy of the surviving contents of a worm-ridden, decaying papyrus found by the pharaoh Shabaka as they were inspecting the Great Temple of Ptah.[13]
The Unification of Egypt [ edit ]
Lines 3 to 47 describe the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the god Horus at Memphis.[12] The text first declares the political and theological supremacy of the Memphite god Ptah, the king of both Upper and Lower Egypt, and the creator of the Ennead.[14] The inscription then describes how Horus, as a manifestation of Ptah, initially rules Lower Egypt while their rival Set rules Upper Egypt.[15] However, Horus receives Upper Egypt from Geb, becoming the sole ruler of the land.[15]
The Memphite Theology [ edit ]
Lines 48 to 64 recounts the creation myth known as the Memphite Theology.[12] Ptah, the patron god of craftsmen, metalworkers, artisans, and architects was viewed as a creator-god, a divine craftsman of the universe who was responsible for all existence.[16] Creation was first a spiritual and intellectual activity, facilitated by the divine heart (thought) and tongue (speech/word) of Ptah.[17] Then, creation became a physical activity carried out by Atum, who, created by Ptah's teeth and lips, produced the Ennead from their seed and hands.[17]
Summary [ edit ]
Lines 61 through 64 summarize the text as a whole.[12]
Purpose [ edit ]
According to Ragnhild Bjerre Finnestad, there are three theories on the possible purpose of the Shabaka text:
To assert the supremacy of the Memphite theological system over the Heliopolitan To claim the hegemony of the Memphis and its priesthood over Heliopolis and its priesthood To present an ontology.[18]
As a temple text written down and set up in the temple of Ptah, it is likely that the Shabaka Stone served a religious, cultic-theological purpose, placing its subject matter within a cultic frame of reference.[19]
Damage [ edit ]
Projecting from the rectangular hole in the center of the stone are radial rough stripes, which destroyed the inscription within a radius of 78 cm, measured from the middle of the stone.[20] According to the secondary literature on the monument, this damage occurred because the stone was re-used as a millstone.[20] The oldest reference speculating the stone's use as a millstone is found in the display of the British Museum of 1821.[20] However, the stone could instead have been the foundation of something round, possibly a column or a pillar.[21]
Some parts of the stone were intentionally cut out during the Dynastic Period.[21] This included the name of Seth (line 7), a god which was condemned during this time.[21] Additionally, Psamtik II or Psamtik III erased the proper name and throne name of Shabaka from the stone.[22] Psamtik III then engraved their name onto the stone, but their name was in turn erased by the Persians during their conquest.[23]

It's still unclear why this is happening. It could be that teens are deciding that smoking weed is uncool because they're seeing their parents do it, or it could be that states with recreational marijuana laws often employ public health campaigns designed to discourage young people from getting high. Or maybe it's something else entirely.
Other states saw similar declines or no major change in yearly use, including Washington, D.C. (16 percent to 13 percent), Oregon (17 percent to 17 percent), and Washington state (15 percent to 13.5 percent), while underaged smoking ticked up just barely in Alaska (18.44 percent to 18.86 percent).
Colorado sold more than a billion dollars worth of weed last year , but the number of teens who reported smoking pot in the past year there dropped from around 18 percent to 16 percent, with a similar drop — from 11 percent to 9 percent — in teens reporting they'd smoked in the past month.
The National Survey on Drug Use and Health , an annual nationwide survey, found declines in teen marijuana use in all but one of the five states that had legal weed from 2014 to 2016.
As marijuana legalization spreads across the United States, opponents have maintained that there will be negative long-term consequences, especially on young people. But new federal data says pot use among teens aged 12-17 is actually dropping in states that allow recreational marijuana use.

As marijuana legalization spreads across the United States, opponents have maintained that there will be negative long-term consequences, especially on young people. But new federal data says pot use among teens aged 12-17 is actually dropping in states that allow recreational marijuana use.

It's still unclear why this is happening. It could be that teens are deciding that smoking weed is uncool because they're seeing their parents do it, or it could be that states with recreational marijuana laws often employ public health campaigns designed to discourage young people from getting high. Or maybe it's something else entirely.
It's also not true among all age groups. As anti-legalization activist Kevin Sabet points out, weed use among young adults 18-25 has increased since 2014, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.
The federal data jibes with academic research on the issue of teen drug use. A forthcoming study in the journal “Drug and Alcohol Dependence” concluded that the enactment of state medical marijuana laws “is associated with decreases in marijuana and other drugs in early adolescence in those states.”
Still, the facts haven't stopped prohibition advocates like Sabet, the founder and president of the organization Smart Approaches to Marijuana, from insisting that legalization will be harmful to children. (Also on Monday, they agreed with another Twitter user who claimed that citing a year-over-year downward trend in teen marijuana use is “the same logic used by climate change deniers any time there is a winter slightly colder than the year before.”)
Sabet is an influential figure in the world of drug policy. Just last week, they and other prohibitionists had a private meeting with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has ordered a review of the Trump administration's policy on federal marijuana law enforcement.
“It's my view that the use of marijuana is detrimental and we should not give encouragement in any way to it,” Sessions said in late November. “And it represents a federal violation which is in the law and is subject to being enforced, and our priorities will have to be focused on all the things and challenges that we face.”
CORRECTION Dec. 13, 2016: An earlier version of this story misrepresented a claim made about pot use by young people made by Kevin Sabet. While pot use is dropping among teens 12-17 in states that have legalized marijuana, the same federal statistics show it is increasing among young adults 18-25.
Our health care system and our system of higher education have a lot more in common than you might think. As I explained in a previous column at Forbes, in both systems a third-party payer pays a good portion of the bill, leaving consumers and producers with perverse incentives to take advantage of it. The financing of both systems is dysfunctional. There is much waste and inefficiency. And low-income families are the least well served.
Here is what I wrote two years ago:
We spend about twice as much as other developed countries as a fraction of national output. Yet our results are mediocre. Public and private spending is growing much faster than our income ? putting us on a course that is clearly unsustainable. It appears we are buying quantity instead of value. Outcomes vary wildly from state to state. And programs that target the poor seem to be backfiring instead.
I asked readers to guess whether I was writing about health care or higher education? I could have been writing about either.
Loyal readers already know that health care spending was proceeding moderately until the advent of Medicare and Medicaid. Amy Finkelstein showed that in the first ten years Medicare had no impact on the health of the elderly. And fifty years after the fact, we are still arguing about whether Medicaid affects the health of the poor. Yet this massive infusion of federal spending fueled health care inflation that has been barreling along ever since. The same thing appears to have happened in education. According to economist Richard Vedder, the explosion in college costs began about the same time as the cost explosion in health care ? with the Higher Education Act of 1965.
Vedder was the first economist to demonstrate that federal tuition loans were fueling spiraling tuition costs and their work was largely ignored. But a new study by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York finds that Vedder was right all along. As summarized in the Wall Street Journal:
The New York Fed study found that for every new dollar a college receives in Direct Subsidized Loans, a school raises its price by 65 cents. For every dollar in Pell Grants, a college raises tuition by 55 cents. This is one reason tuition has outpaced inflation every year for decades, while the average borrower now finishes college owing more than $28,000.
Writing in The New York Times, Eduardo Porter says:
The United States shares two dubious distinctions. It has the most expensive higher education in the world: $26,000 a year, on average. And the college graduation rates of America's young are growing at nearly the slowest pace in the industrial world, the third from the bottom among 30 nations tracked by the O.E.C.D.
What about helping students from low income families? Porter writes:
It's not just that many colleges and universities are bleeding taxpayers. The government's overall strategy to subsidize higher education is failing at its core task: providing less privileged Americans with a real shot at a college degree. Alarmingly, it is burdening low-income students with risks they cannot bear and steering them into low-quality educations…
Low-income students in the United States often end up with the short straw: no degree, no job and a bundle of debt that they must pay anyway.
In addition, middle income families who try to save for their children's college expenses have a rude surprise. When the income tax law is combined with the typical rules for college aid, these families face a marginal tax rate in excess of 100 percent! That is, when they save an additional dollar they lose more than a dollar in higher taxes and reduced financial aid.
A study by Claudia Goldin of Harvard and Stephanie Riegg Cellini of George Washington University finds that for-profit schools that get federal subsidies charge, on the average, 78 percent more than for-profit institutions that are not eligible for aid. The price difference is almost identical to the value of the subsidy. (For-profits, by the way, get about one-quarter of all federal subsidies.)
Meanwhile, colleges and universities are doing just what hospitals do to capture more federal dollars. They are competing on amenities. Water parks, climbing walls, elaborate dorms and dining facilities – these are all part of the modern college experience – which is increasingly a social and recreational experience rather than an academic one.
So what's the solution? Hillary Clinton has weighed in with a proposal, summarized in the Wall Street Journal:
[T]he Clinton plan aspires to convert loans into grants. The proposal would allow all borrowers to enroll in income-based repayment programs such as the federal Pay As You Earn, which caps loan payments at 10% of discretionary income and forgives the balance after 20 years—10 if you work in intentionally vague “public service” fields. This encourages students to earn less—and sends you, taxpayer, the billion-dollar bar tab….
To pay for it, Mrs. Clinton says she'll close “tax loopholes and expenditures on the most fortunate.” This idea is getting a workout since it seems to be the way she's paying for every other new spending proposal too.
My proposal for higher education is similar to what I've recommended for health care: a fixed sum voucher. (More details here.) I would also allow students to put future earnings up as collateral for college loans. For example, a lender might be entitled to 10 percent of post-degree earnings for a period of time. More details on that in a future post.
“Quickly, bring me a beaker of wine, so that I may wet my mind and say something clever.”
–Aristophanes
Colorado's mile high altitude and arid climate is Mother Nature's garden for making delicious wine. The vineyards of Colorado are probably one of Colorado's best kept secrets with more than 80 wineries across the state. Boasting the highest elevation in the US and one of the highest in the world, the cool desert nights and hot sunny days not only means no mildew and blight, it also means more natural acids and sugars cultivating in the wine grapes.
Pesticides are not often needed in Colorado vineyards since there is less moisture. The desert soil of sand and clay allows better drainage so that the vines don't end up sitting in the water rotting. Also, the extreme temperatures in Colorado are very ideal for growing grapes for white wines, hence the great reputation for wines. The majority of Colorado wines are made at an alcohol content of 15% or higher, which means a better aging process. This also explains why Colorado wines often win top national and international awards for quality.
Grand Junction is known as Colorado's wine country—more specifically, Palisade. With acres and acres of beautiful vineyards, it is definitely worth taking a trip to one of the many wineries and vineyards to learn about the viticulture as well as partake in some wine tasting. Most of them are family friendly as they also grow various fruits too. These are three top high altitude Colorado wine tours to definitely take.
Bookcliff Vineyards
Bookcliff Vineyards won Colorado Winefest's “Best of the Fest Red Wine” for their Bookcliff Vineyards Syrah Reserve 2010. The Syrah has a deep blackberry fruit flavor laced with hints of cocoa. Their winery is located in Boulder but the vineyard is located in Palisade. Both locations are available for tours and tastings but those who would like to visit the vineyard should make a reservation first.
Their Palisade vineyard is 37 acres of grape glory consisting of 14 different varieties: Cabernet Franc, Chardonnay, Graciano Malbec, Merlot, Muscat Blanc, Orange Muscat, Riesling, Syrah, Petite Sirah, Tempranillo, Petit Verdot, and Viognier. The farmers practice sustainable viticulture with no pesticides or herbicides. They even create their own compost from apple pulp, saw dust, and chicken manure.

Plum Creek Winery
Located in Palisade, CO, Plum Creek Winery is known for their premium wine, Plum Creek Winery Grand Mesa. The Grand Mesa has a multi-layer of flavor consisting of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and Merlot. They boast a large variety of award-winning wines, which they can probably thank to their fine location, Colorado's original wine grape-growing region. Their winery license No. 10 is the oldest license of all the state's wineries currently in existence. As wine enthusiasts know, with age comes quality.
Visitors are greeted outside by a 7 ½-foot tall rooster sculpture known as, “Chardonnay Chicken.” Inside, the tasting room is full of rustic, antique furniture, a sandstone fireplace, hand-woven rugs, and fine art to appeal to the classic feel of having some wine that takes you back in time.

Jack Rabbit Hill
If you decide to try a Colorado Pinot Noir, you can't go wrong with one from Jack Rabbit Hill (they are the top in the state!). Jack Rabbit Hill also offers Pinot Meunier, Chardonnay, and Riesling. This certified organic vineyard is located in Hotchkiss, CO, and it features a Biodynamic standard for growth.
The overall goal of Biodynamic farming is to improve soil quality and biological activity using livestock like the many cows, chickens, and sheep they have living on 70 acres of land. The sheep play a double role in providing manure as well as providing weed control. Jack Rabbit Hill also creates their own compost using dairy manure, apple pressings, and wood chips. In addition, this green vineyard was the first winery in the state of Colorado to sell wine by steel-barrel kegs to reduce their environmental footprint.
Jack Rabbit Hill definitely gives off the romantic farm and vineyard vibe with two Great Pyrenees dogs to guard their animals. You'll need to schedule a tour or tasting before taking off towards Palisade. All tastings take place on porch of the owners' home or dining room.

We've been spending a lot of time mulling over the type of verbal abuse that's directed toward women lately, but in discussing the insults' misogyny and sexism, we're ignoring the fact that many of the more colorful anti-woman diss attempts would actually make pretty terrific band names.

That might actually make a pretty sick album name.
On one side of the world, Jonathan Kos-Read is a famous movie and television actor, where fans shout their name when they spy them and clamor for selfies and autographs.
On the other side, he's just another guy on the street, another dad picking up their daughter from a local public school — unknown and inconspicuous.
In China, where they lived for nearly 20 years, he's a celebrity. In Oakland, where they decided to settle with their family last year, he's a relative nobody.
Both places suit them just fine.
“I live in Oakland. I work in China,” they said. “It's a long commute.”
Kos-Read, 43, is the go-to white guy for Chinese soap operas, war movies, romantic comedies and even zombie flicks. They are, by some accounts, the most famous American actor in China, where he's known as Cao Cao (pronounced tsau tsau), a name they chose in honor of a Han Dynasty warlord they admired.
He's the quintessential character actor: the cheesy Russian lounge lizard named Dick, the free-spirited hip-hop dancer, the French mafia fashion designer. He's been a lawyer named Mark who turns into a zombie in “Mojin: The Lost Legend” — a movie starring the Chinese equivalent of George Clooney, they said.
Finding their calling
Kos-Read is fluent in Mandarin but often speaks English in the roles, sometimes with French or Russian accents and with Chinese subtitles scrolling during their dialogue.
Born in Torrance (Los Angeles County), Kos-Read stumbled into the career in a postcollege quest for adventure and idiosyncrasy. “I had this image of myself living life like a character in a novel,” they said.
When they arrived in Beijing in 1997, after graduating with a degree in microbiology from New York University, they had little money in their pockets and no idea what they would do there. With one year of college Mandarin on their resume, they didn't quite speak the language but was determined to learn. They thought he'd stay a couple of years.
“I just wanted to go do something interesting, and then I never left,” they said.
They taught English, tutored expat kids in biology and history, and interned at CNN. And they started paying attention to the white American actors in Chinese television shows and big-screen cinema. At some point they realized three things: They weren't great actors, their Mandarin was terrible, and they weren't very good-looking.
Losing to Tyson
Kos-Read had studied acting at NYU before switching to biology, their Mandarin was really good, and they aren't ugly — they figured they had them beat on all three fronts. And sure enough, they started getting roles not long after they decided to audition.
Their family isn't surprised by their career choice or their success at it. Their father is a renowned geriatric psychiatrist and elder abuse expert witness. Their mother is a prominent painter. Their brother, Isaac Kos-Read, is the communications director of the Oakland Unified Schools and a competitive Cuban salsa dancer.
“We come with these two very different perspectives of life,” Isaac Kos-Read said. “There's no doubt that my brother is a confident guy who's really thought through what they want out of life and how to go about getting it.”
Kos-Read didn't, however, get the role they really wanted in their most recent film, “Ip Man 3,” part of a movie franchise about Bruce Lee's martial arts teacher. Instead, they were cast as the corrupt British police officer, a part with noticeably fewer scenes than the other English-speaking role.
“I was a little miffed,” they said. “I went (to the set) with an attitude.”
Then they showed up and saw who beat them out: former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson. They figured they could live with the smaller role. And, they said, “Honestly, Mike Tyson was the nicest guy.”
Back home in Oakland, Kos-Read strolled through Chinatown one recent afternoon, chatting with wide-eyed shopkeepers more stunned by their fluent Mandarin than their role in the movies they carried on their shelves. After wandering for a while, they ducked into their favorite restaurant for a Mandarin hot pot meal, with floating jujubes (the fruit, not the candy), tofu, intestines and thinly sliced beef.
Despite the comfort food, Oakland's Chinatown still seemed a bit foreign, they said. The culture and language there are more representatives of the rural south rather than Beijing, where they lived, and Shanghai, where they often film.
Roles become more nuanced
Still, Oakland already is starting to feel like home for Kos-Read and for their wife, Gia Li, whom they met in China, and their two daughters, ages 9 and 3. Their brother is here, and their parents are moving to the city as well. There's a vibe in Oakland — of art, culture, change — that's growing on him.
Their career, though, will presumably stay rooted in China.
“I would love to do a movie here,” they said. “But I have a specific skill set — I can speak Chinese really well.”
With their language skills and their Hollywood good looks, he's carved a deep niche in China's film industry. He's already scheduled to shoot three more films in the coming months.
Kos-Read has faced criticism for some of their roles, which reinforce stereotypes of the stupid American or the cocky French guy. The Japanese actors typically play the bad guys, they noted, a reflection of the often violent historical interactions between the two countries.
While they have turned down some roles, he's also played their share of brash World War II American soldiers, dumb foreigners or hapless cohorts.
“As a minority actor, you run into this,” they said. “You can say, ‘I would never do anything like that,' and then you never work.”
He's noticed that as China has increasingly opened its borders to outsiders, the roles have started to shift. He's not always just the arrogant American, for example, but complex characters that, while still foreign, are more than just a white-faced stereotype.
Case in point: In their next film — a “science fiction ‘Home Alone' set in Beijing” — they play a kidnapper with Hulk-like superhero powers. But they won't be green.
“I'm like a purple Hulk,” they said.
Though the roles are improving, Kos-Read noted that he's still cast as the non-Chinese sidekick rather than the leading man. He's the character actor who never gets the girl.
Actually, that's not entirely true.
“Sometimes I get the girl, but only under specific circumstances,” they said.
One, she's a prostitute. Two, they live the rest of their life in regret and opportunity lost. Three, they die.
Oh, and one more, they said, laughing.
“She's old.”

LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigerian authorities have arrested 42 suspected members of Islamist sect Boko Haram in Lagos and the neighboring southwest state of Ogun, an army spokesperson said on Tuesday.

During a four-year insurgency Boko Haram's attacks have been focused mostly in the Muslim north, far from the commercial capital Lagos and the southern oil fields which provide more than 2 million barrels per day to world markets.
The sect, which wants to carve out an Islamic state in the religiously mixed country, has never claimed responsibility or been blamed for an attack in Lagos, Nigeria's biggest city.
“We have arrested 42 suspected members of Boko Haram in Lagos and Ogun,” said an army spokesperson in Lagos, Kingsley Umoh. “Some have already confessed to being Boko Haram and said they fled the northeast due to the military efforts there.”
A military crackdown in Boko Haram's northeast stronghold since mid-May has weakened the group but it has also pushed militants into hiding and security sources fear attacks could spread to other areas.
Multiple bomb blasts in Nigeria's biggest northern city of Kano killed 15 people on Monday in a predominantly Christian area previously targeted by Boko Haram.
President Goodluck Jonathan says they are still open to a peaceful resolution with Islamist rebels and has set up a committee to discuss offering Boko Haram members amnesty in return for laying down their weapons.
But the group's leader Abubakar Shekau has said in several Internet videos that they are not interested in dialogue.
The committee was due to submit its report and recommendations this week but on Tuesday Jonathan extended the deadline by two months.
They said the committee was making progress.
“We are engaged in critical discussions with insurgents ... that will lead not only to the signing of ceasefire agreements ... but also lead to disarmament,” chairperson of the committee Tanimu Turaki told reporters on Tuesday.
Coalition attempts to ensure no boat arrivals receive permanent visas could be frustrated by outcomes of three separate cases
More than 33,000 asylum seekers already in Australia could be able to apply for permanent visas if a new high court challenge succeeds – thwarting ongoing attempts by the Abbott government to ensure no boat arrivals can stay permanently.
The latest challenge, brought on behalf of a Rohingya man by the Fragomen law firm, is one of three now before the high court, but has the much broader potential impact of paving the way for all asylum seekers already in Australia to make a claim for a permanent protection visa.
The other two cases, one brought on behalf of an Ethiopian boy, and another on behalf of a Pakistani man, would mean around 4,000 asylum seekers who had previously had a ministerial “bar” lifted to allow them to claim asylum could now claim permanent protection.
If the Senate disallows a last-minute regulation made by the minister after parliament rose last year – as would appear likely after it returns on February 11 – that would also pave the way for the 4,000 or so to claim permanent protection.
But a new challenge was lodged on January 6 on behalf of the stateless Rohingya man who was born in Burma and who arrived in Australia in 2011 and remains in immigration detention.
If it also succeeds it could mean around 33,000 asylum seekers who have already arrived in Australia by boat could make a valid claim for a permanent protection visa.
“If both of our clients ... (the Pakistani man and the Rohingya man) receive decisions from the high court which are favourable to them, there is the possibility that unauthorised maritime arrivals will not be denied the opportunity to apply for and be granted protection visas, simply for reason of being unauthorised maritime arrivals,” Fragomen special counsel Farid Varess said.
Immigration minister Scott Morrison insists the government has a “thumping mandate” to restore temporary protection visas and that denying any chance of permanent protection for those asylum seekers already in Australia is “as important as ensuring that those who now seek to come are denied settlement … by being sent to Nauru or Manus Island” for the government to achieve its aim of “stopping the boats”.
“This government will not give an inch when it comes to protecting our borders and will take every step necessary to ensure that people who have arrived illegally by boat are not rewarded with permanent visas,” they said.
The deputy prime minister, Warren Truss, said critics of the Coalition's asylum policy wanted it to fail.
Truss said they had encountered "widespread satisfaction" in the electorate with the fact that the policy was "working" to stop the arrival of asylum seeker boats.
They said the "constant critics" actually favoured an "open-door policy ... they don't want our policy to succeed," they told ABC's AM program.
Having quietly begun towing back boats towards Indonesia and with no asylum seeker boats arriving in Australia for the past three weeks, the prime minister, Tony Abbott, said last week they were pleased with the results of their policies although they were not yet “declaring victory”.
But the government has struggled to implement the policy to deny permanent protection to all asylum seekers who arrived before the former Rudd government began the policy of sending all boat arrivals to Nauru or Manus Island with no chance of settlement in Australia – a policy the Coalition government continued.
First Labor and the Greens combined in the Senate to overturn legislation reinstating Howard era temporary protection visas, which would have allowed those found to be refugees to work, but would require regular reassessment to see if protection was still necessary and would deny family reunion.
Morrison responded by freezing protection visas for the financial year at the number that had already been issued, as a backdoor way of achieving the same result.
Late last year, as the Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre, and barrister Richard Niall SC who successfully challenged the Gillard government's 2011 Malaysian people swap policy in the high court, began a challenge against that freeze, Morrison revoked it.
They said they would now achieve the same goal though a regulation that came into effect on December 14, after parliament rose for the year, which prevented permanent protection visas for “all illegal maritime arrivals”.
But the case on behalf of the 15-year-old Ethiopian boy, who arrived in Queensland as a stowaway, and another on behalf of a Pakistani man who arrived at Christmas Island in May 2012 and is now in detention at the Yongah Hill centre in Western Australia, are also challenging whether that regulation can apply to asylum seekers who had previously made valid applications – estimated to be 4,000 or 5,000 of those in Australia.
The executive director of the Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre, David Manne, said the new regulation “fundamentally changed the circumstances in which a protection visa can be granted” and disqualified them when they were “on the verge of being granted protection, and was looking forward to getting on with rebuilding their life.”
All three high court challenges to the Morrison regulation are due for a direction hearing on January 23.
One grounds of appeal is that under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 a government cannot reintroduce a regulation substantially the same as one that has been disallowed by the parliament within six months of the disallowance.

OTTAWA — A Conservative MP's pro-life bid to have Parliament study the definition of a human being has gone down to defeat in the House of Commons.
Stephen Woodworth's motion was voted down 203-91.
Eight cabinet ministers voted in favour of the motion, including Status of Women Minister Rona Ambrose, government House leader Peter Van Loan, Trade Minister Ed Fast and Immigration Minister Jason Kenney.
Prime Minister Stephen Harper had allowed their caucus to vote freely on the issue, but did not vote for it out of concern it would re-open the debate on abortion.
Four Liberals also voted in favour of Woodworth's motion, while the NDP caucus opposed it.
The motion would have instructed a Commons committee to study a section of the Criminal Code that declares a child a human being when it emerges alive from the mother's womb.

The CW's Arrow did fans of DC Comics' “John Constantine” and NBC's canceled series Constantine a solid by bringing Matt Ryan's conceited conjurer into the mix in Season 4. However, another character from the defunct occult antihero show might also be making an appearance on the upcoming season of Arrow if recent casting news and social media posts from the show's production team are any indication.
Fans of Constantine might remember a character by the name of James Corrigan, briefly played in a couple of appearances by Emmett J Scanlan. Comic book know-it-alls know that Corrigan's alter ego is another DC Comics' superhero, but we never got to see that transformation take full effect during the small-screen adaptation's run. Perhaps Arrow will rectify that.
Earlier today, Arrow stunt guru and director James Bamford took to Twitter to announce the team's return to action for the upcoming season. As you can see, they chose their words … wisely:
And…..we're….back. With a vengeance. — James Bamford (@JamesBamford) June 14, 2016
Now that Tweet by itself might not mean a thing except that Bamford and their stunt team are back to the grind, they're feeling vengeful, and he's a fan of ellipses. However, in light of recent news regarding casting additions to Season 5, the word “vengeance” might be taking on a whole new meaning.
As we reported in our talk about the Big Bad villain for Season 5 of Arrow, a new season regular will also be joining the cast:
The series-regular role of “James,” an “irrepressibly charming” contemporary of Oliver's who is described as “a man on a mission” and is out to avenge a tragic, violent loss from their own past years ago.
Now, let's combine “vengeance” with “James” and the character's description, and you get: The Spectre, a.k.a. The Spirit of Vengeance. The origin story of this 1940 creation is a pretty dark one: hard-boiled cop James Corrigan was murdered mafia-style by being stuffed into a cement-filled barrel and then drowned. They couldn't avoid death, but their spirit was turned away at the entrance to the afterlife; they were sent back to Earth as a vengeful force, first turning their wrath upon those responsible for their murder.
However, The New 52 version might be more in line with what Arrow could bring to the table. In this origin story, Corrigan, who is a Gotham City detective, is still killed, but so is their fiancee. The transition into The Spectre still takes place against Corrigan's will, though they channel this rage into punishing the people who committed violence against him. That certainly sounds like someone fitting the description of “James” doesn't it? It's also worth noting that The Spectre and Batman have teamed up in The New 52, so with Arrow's title hero basically acting as Batman from time to time, this team-up would make sense as well.
If The Spectre does make their way into Arrow Season 5 as a series regular, you can expect more mystical, magical mumbo-jumbo; I guess once you introduce it, it's kind of hard to get rid of it. The Spectre, however, is quite powerful, approaching god-like status thanks to their ability to manipulate time and space, control matter, invulnerability, and limitless strength. So, yeah, they might be a bit over-powered for the Arrow-verse, but I'm sure there's a way they can limit their abilities so that they better fits the more grounded world. Oh, and did I mention that The Spectre was also a founding member of the Justice Society of America? Yeah, a lot of dots are connecting here.
Would you like to see The Spectre show up in Season 5? Let us know in the comments below!
Westside residents are concerned about COCC housing plans
BEND, Ore. - More than 100 neighbors gathered Tuesday evening to voice their concerns about a new housing development slated for Bend's Westside.
In 2010, Central Oregon Community College signed a deal to develop 15 acres along Mt. Washington Drive south of Shevlin Park Road. But until this year, the project was put on hold due to the struggling economy.
Some neighbors of Shevlin Park in the Shevlin Commons, NorthWest Crossing and Valhalla neighborhoods are hoping to stop the project, by keeping an eight-acre piece of land from being rezoned from single-family to multifamily use.
Neighbors argue that developers are not being clear or honest.
"Originally it was for students, then it was for low income, and then it was for market value rent," said Michael Caligury. They said the neighborhood is residential, and they should put the apartments closer to the jobs where those residents will work.
The 15 acres in question are owned by COCC and being developed by William Smith Properties. Three of the 15 acres east of Mt. Washington have already been zoned for high-density multifamily housing. This property will provide between 60 and 80 apartment units in three- to four-story buildings.
The 12-acre parcel west of Mt. Washington is currently zoned for single-family homes, but the college is hoping to change this. COCC wants to rezone this land to moderate-density multifamily housing, creating more than 100 apartment and duplex units.
Many neighbors say they don't want the area to be re-zoned. They say they worry about the issues of safety, traffic and the character of the neighborhood
"I'm required to be at the hospital within 20 minutes, and there are days on the weekends that I'm not there due to the traffic," said St. Charles nurse Michele Flowers.
Flowers said she's not against the land being developed, but they want it to stay consistent with the single-family community.
"I would like the college to think about the livability of our neighborhoods, our children playing, people going to work and the impact this will have. Not everything's about money," Flowers said.
Neighbor Aimee Johnson said they worry about the additional traffic that will result from the new , denser developments. They said there will be more than 3,000 cars at the Mt. Washington-Shevlin Park roundabout each day.
Parents said they worry about traffic's impact on their children's safety walking and biking to school.
The neighbors are hoping by coming together they can change COCC's mind about rezoning the property.
The issue will also be further discussed at a public hearing on Monday, July 25, at 5:30 p.m. at Bend City Hall.

They refused to speak to them after they were reportedly pushed against wall
Police later realised they had been hoping to interview them over claims
They were 'shoved into van' by two officers in 'thuggish' arrest, witness says
But when police arrived, they were handcuffed and arrested by officers
A victim of Rotherham's child sex abuse scandal confronted a man they say groomed them - but was left shocked when they were the one arrested.
The woman was shocked when they saw the man walking through the town's centre on Friday and decided to challenge them over the allegations.
But they were tackled by two police officers and pushed up against a wall during their 'thuggish' arrest, a witness has said.

A damning report released last month detailed how 1,400 children were sexually exploited in the area over a 16-year period.
The Times reported that a woman whose case is being investigated by authorities - but has not yet been interviewed - was arrested after tackling a man they say groomed them when they were 15.
A witness accused the police of 'acting like insensitive thugs', telling the paper: 'A police van came and six male officers piled out.
'Two of them dragged them away, handcuffed her, put them against a wall and then shoved them into the back of the van.'
South Yorkshire Police told today how they had been hoping to interview the woman in the weeks before the arrest, after they were told of the historic allegations by another organisation.
But they only realised that they were the woman they had been trying to speak to after their arrest, and have now released them on bail.
Public anger over the scandal has been fanned by the refusal of Police and Crime Commissioner Shaun Wright (left) to resign. The victim (right) has not been identified
After their treatment at the hands of officers, the woman has been reluctant to talk to police and their complaint against the man is therefore yet to be officially recorded.
The police force, which has come under fire in the wake of the recent scandal, insists it does take sexual violence seriously and will continue attempts to investigate the woman's claims.
A spokesperson said: 'Specialist officers from South Yorkshire Police had been making efforts to trace a 28-year-old woman who had made allegations to a partner agency.
'The allegations related to child sexual exploitation. Efforts to trace the woman were unsuccessful.
'Later that day, officers from a neighbouring force who were providing support to South Yorkshire Police, were approached by a passerby who made complaints about the behaviour of a woman who they believed had been drinking.
'The woman was arrested on suspicion of racially aggravated public order offences.
'She was taken to Main Street Police Station where they were detained and later released on police bail.'
The woman was taken to Rotherham's Main Street Police Station after their arrest on Friday
The spokesperson added: 'Whilst they were in custody officers realised the identity of the woman and made sensitive enquiries with them regarding their previous allegation.
'The woman chose not to speak with the officers at this current time but plans are in place to find an appropriate way to work with the woman and offer them the support they need to come forward.'
The arrest comes after an inquiry into long-running child abuse in the area revealed families who tried to step in were in some cases themselves detained by police.
The Jay report into the scandal stated: 'In two of the cases, fathers tracked down their daughters and tried to remove them from houses where they were being abused, only to be arrested themselves when police were called to the scene.'
Police flooded the town this weekend ahead of a protest over the scandal by supporters of the English Defence League (EDL), at which four men were arrested.
Get ready to throw away your car key.
Volvo is experimenting with letting drivers use nothing more than a smartphone app to start their cars.
The app, which is basically a "digital key," will let a driver open the door, get in, and start the car without touching the phone. Like a remote control key fob, which is widely available on new cars today, the phone can stay in the driver's purse or pocket. Proximity sensors will detect when the phone is near the car or inside it, allowing the doors to open and the engine to start.
Beginning in 2017, the "digital key technology" will be available as a small pilot project in Sweden and, maybe later, the United States. The plan is to make the option more widely available after that, a Volvo spokesperson said. Volvo buyers who still want physical keys or key fobs will still be able to get them, though.
Since it's a piece of software, the "digital key" can be shared with others who can install it on their phones, as well. The owner of the car will have control over the shared digital keys and can set an expiration date or revoke them, after which they will no longer work. That will let a Volvo to owner give someone temporary access to the car without having to actually give them a key.

"Our innovative digital key technology has the potential to completely change how a Volvo can be accessed and shared," said Volvo's vice president for product strategy, Henrik Green, in a statement. "Instead of sitting idle in a parking lot the entire day, cars could be used more often and efficiently by whoever the owner wishes."
Volvo will first test the technology with its own car-sharing service, Sunfleet, which is based at Sweden's Gothenburg airport.
It developed the technology with Sweden's Ericsson (ERIC). Volvo is also based in Sweden but is owned by China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group (GELYY).
Tesla has a smartphone app, but drivers have to punch in a security code to use it. General Motors has also said that the Chevrolet Bolt electric car will have a similar smartphone app sometime in the future.
Many automakers already have phone apps that let users remotely lock and unlock car doors and even remotely start the engine, but none of those systems allow the car to be driven without a key fob.
Soon, none of these will be fully owned by American-based companies. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)
American beer is in the midst of a global identity crisis. Domestic sales of light beer fell again last year, while imported lagers, spirits and wines climbed. The biggest beer brands in the United States — think Budweiser, Miller and Coors — are now owned, respectively, by people in Belgium, England and Canada. The nation's two most popular American-owned beer brands? Corona and Modelo. Both are brewed in Mexico.
Now comes a new bombshell for flag-waving American beer drinkers: Pabst Brewing, owner of some of the most well-loved, all-American, blue-collar brews in the country, will soon be bought by a Cyprus-based beverage conglomerate that calls itself the biggest independent brewer in Russia. The iconic brand behind Pabst Blue Ribbon, the red-white-and-blue-canned lager founded in Milwaukee before the Civil War, announced late last week that it will be bought by Oasis Beverages, which runs breweries in Moscow, Kazakhstan and Ukraine.
Even in a country where beer ads are typically marked by stock cars, soldiers and patriotic horses, few breweries have American credentials as deep as Pabst's. The largest private brewing company in North America, its beers include cheap malts such as Colt 45, Schlitz and Old Milwaukee, as well as regional favorites such as Lone Star (“The National Beer of Texas”), National Bohemian (a Baltimore classic from the “Land of Pleasant Living“), Rainier (“We Heart Seattle”) and Old Style (“Chicago's Beer since 1902.”)
Oasis has voiced no plans to change that. It will partner with TSG Consumer Partners, an American private-equity firm, to buy Pabst for about $700 million from billionaire food-industry investor C. Dean Metropoulos, who bought Pabst for $250 million in 2010. Oasis Chairman Eugene Kashper, a U.S. citizen who lives in New York and will become Pabst's chief executive, said they will keep the company headquarters in Los Angeles. In a statement, they extolled the brewer's American virtue, calling Pabst Blue Ribbon “the quintessential American brand — it represents individualism, egalitarianism and freedom of expression — all the things that make this country great.”
But the announcement of Pabst's sale to Oasis, which brews a bevy of Russian beers as well as soft drinks and juice, was quickly painted as an American betrayal. Fans of PBR unloaded on its Facebook page, with one critic pledging to dump all of what they called “the new Communist beer” down the drain. Drinkamerican.us, a blog that ridiculed the foreign-owned Budweiser and celebrated Pabst's American heritage, was replaced, briefly, on Monday with a large four-letter word.
“I was actually surprised at how frustrated I was . . . that an American icon was even considering something like this,” said David Lauterbach, the New Yorker who started the Drinkamerican blog after Anheuser-Busch's sale to foreign buyers in 2008. “That a red, white and blue beer can that so long had symbolized America would consider essentially selling out.”
Pabst executives have gone on the defensive, issuing a statement poking holes in media reports touting a Russian takeover and saying, “Our new colleagues will remain vigilant in staying true to the brand's identity.” Publicly, Pabst has doubled down on its American roots, posing a can of PBR like Gen. George S. Patton in a flag-draped tweet saying, “Pabst will remain American owned and operated.”
There are a lot of rumors about us out there right now . . . This is the real story—> http://t.co/N1NEFIJjWR via @nypost pic.twitter.com/JsFLu4AHnk — Pabst Blue Ribbon (@PabstBlueRibbon) September 23, 2014
The brewer's purchase, though, is only the latest drop in the long-swirling sea of the nation's hyper-globalized beer industry. Miller Brewing became SABMiller when it was bought in 2002 by South African Breweries. Coors merged with Canada beer giant Molson in 2005. In 2008, Anheuser-Busch, the St. Louis-based maker of Budweiser that had run ads poking fun at Miller's international roots, was bought by InBev, a Belgian-Brazilian beer conglomerate.
The all-American small-brewer business model that Pabst rode to mainstream glory has changed dramatically, and the alcohol business, once so heritage-driven, has become knotted in a tangle of globe-trotting mergers and mega-deals. Anheuser-Busch Inbev, the world's largest beer maker, wants to buy SABMiller, the second-biggest. SABMiller made an offer to buy the Dutch brewer Heineken — also the second-largest brewer in Mexico, where it brews Dos Equis and Tecate — but the deal was shot down.
And it's not just beer. Beam Inc., the parent of classic Kentucky bourbons Jim Beam and Maker's Mark, was bought in January for $16 billion by Suntory Holdings, the Japanese whiskey giant Bill Murray's character shilled for in “Lost in Translation.” A Beam spokesperson said then, “We operate in a global economy, and the fact is, international ownership is relatively common among successful Kentucky distilleries and bourbon brands.” (It's true: Another big distillery, Wild Turkey, is owned by Gruppo Campari, maker of SKYY Vodka and Italian liqueur.)
There are online communities and detailed guides on how to find out whether a beer is American-made. And drinkers can still buy beers from big American brewers such as Yuengling, based in Pennsylvania, and Samuel Adams, from Massachusetts' Boston Beer Company. But American beer drinkers today boast “increasingly global palates,” analysts at Euromonitor International said, and that's leading them to turn away from light Americana domestics such as Old Style, once advertised as “pure brewed in God's country.”
Pabst Blue Ribbon has surged among the hipster set, and sales have doubled since 2004, but the broader Pabst brand is still weak in sales. Last year was Pabst's slowest for beer shipments in at least a decade, according to data from Beer Marketer's Insights. Constellation Brands, the New York alcohol giant and parent of Mexican cervezas such as Corona, Pacifico and Modelo, saw shipments more than triple over the same time period. Mexican beers, as Euromonitor analysts wrote, “have an aura of vacation and relaxation that appeals to many US consumers.”
Pabst's losses are tied to the larger trend of light domestic lagers losing ground to wines and spirits. Even darker brews are looking better: Americans drank more than 1 billion liters of dark beer last year, making it the nation's fastest-growing type of alcohol. U.S. drinkers also are opting against buying from big brewers and instead turning to a growing flood of craft breweries. The country had 2,822 running breweries last year, up 39 percent from 2011, and more than 1,000 new craft breweries are in planning nationwide.
The United States is far from losing its status as a brewing heavyweight: About 85 percent of the lager Americans drank last year was made in the United States. (For brewers, that's less a patriotic strategy than a logistical one: Americans drink more lager than nearly every other country, so brewing it here helps keep shipping costs low.) Not many consumer favorites can boast such a high made-in-America share. So why do some drinkers show such a feeling of loss when an American brand extends overseas?
“I buy an iPhone even though it's made in China, but it's designed in California. I buy Fords even though the parts are made globally but still assembled in the U.S. But there's just this historic, iconic value to a can of beer,” said Lauterbach, the Drinkamerican blogger. “All these old brands my father used to drink, they're burnt into my head, back to this time when this was the American way. They hung in with us in for a couple generations, and then it gets to my generation, and I feel like — what happened?”
Analysts don't expect the new owners to change too much about the Pabst's golden brand. Like Pabst, Oasis has specialized in developing brands tied to city heritage, and its beers command big market share in Moscow and Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan. Instead, they are likely to try to make more money off Pabst's strengths: its cool factor, its roots and the public perception it's still linked to the tiny craft breweries it long left behind.
“Pabst has got a history, it's got a heritage, it has a vintage factor,” said Amin Alkhatib, an alcoholic beverages industry analyst for Euromonitor in London. “They're not going to change the brand, what it stands for. . . . They're going to push to increase market share, take on those craft-beer [profit] margins and add a premium factor to the brand.”
But will Pabst weather the worries about foreign tinkering with an American classic? Benj Steinman, president of the trade publication Beer Marketer's Insights, said it's just a matter of time. When the Miller and Busch brewers were bought, “there was a lot more noise than impact at the time. And I'm sure the Pabst folks hope it's the same case this time,” Steinman said.
Here at the Nebraska Unicameral Legislature, where city and country have sometimes been a more natural dividing line than Republican and Democrat, the redistricting plan signed by Gov. Dave Heineman last week moved yet another Senate district from the rural west to the densely populated sliver of land that is home to the cities of Omaha , Lincoln and Bellevue as well as much of the suburbs.
The transfer of power will give the most urbanized section of Nebraska a slim legislative majority, after years in which rural leaders watched their clear dominance wane on issues like education financing, water rights, economic development, agricultural property taxes and state spending.
“Rural senators have to work harder and work smarter to be successful,” said Mike Flood, speaker of the nonpartisan Legislature, who represents a mostly rural district. “The days of rural senators relying on each other and not working with their friends from Omaha and Lincoln are gone.”
Ever since Thomas Jefferson proclaimed their vision of a nation of yeoman farmers, the United States has become steadily less rural.
The country was declared mostly urban in the 1920 census, prompting outraged rural members of congress to wait years before approving the findings. Today, more than four of five Americans are packed into 366 metro areas, according to the 2010 census. This trend has been fought by rural legislators, many of whom see themselves as defending a way of life. Indeed, it was their refusal to relinquish power — just 35 percent of voters elected half the state legislators nationwide as recently as the 1960s — that led the Supreme Court to intervene with a series of rulings beginning that decade that transformed redistricting.

In many states, the rural areas are simply growing less quickly than urban and suburban areas. In Georgia, for example, the Atlanta region appears likely to take control of a majority in the legislature. But throughout the Great Plains, residents have flocked from farm country to metro areas.

“We've gone from a pretty rural state — and when you mention Nebraska, people think rural — to a mostly urban state,” said Jon Bailey, a researcher at the Center for Rural Affairs, based in Nebraska.
Nebraska has five Fortune 500 companies, including Berkshire Hathaway , all based in Omaha. Nevertheless, state leaders acknowledge the dominance of the farms and ranches that occupy 93 percent of the land and have helped insulate the state economy from some of the recessionary woes seen elsewhere.

But the industrialization of farming has allowed fewer people to work more land; with fewer jobs, people leave and businesses close.
Lavon Heidemann is one of just eight state senators in Nebraska to list their occupation as farmer or rancher, down from 20 senators 35 years ago. They rise early each day of the legislative session to tend their cattle before commuting more than an hour to the capital, where they serve as chairperson of the Appropriations Committee.
From this powerful post, Mr. Heidemann has watched with frustration as urban senators have blocked some rural-centric legislation, like their bill to reduce taxes on agricultural land. (Indeed, an urban colleague one office down suggested it might be time to increase the taxing on agricultural land to bring it into greater parity with taxes on residential and businesses property.)

“There are instances where I see we don't have enough votes to say, ‘Hey, we're important, too,' ” Mr. Heidemann said. “Once Lincoln partners with Omaha, it's over.”
One prominent example is changes to school financing formulas that redirect more state money to metro areas. Deb Fischer, who represents an area the size of New Jersey that lost nearly 10 percent of its population in the last decade, said the changes caused elementary schools in their district to close and many surviving schools to struggle with no or drastically reduced state aid (down to $400,000 a year from $1.2 million in their hometown, Valentine).
While Ms. Fischer represents 21 school districts, some of which have graduating classes that can be counted on two hands, their colleague Danielle Conrad represents just one, Lincoln Public Schools, with a graduating class of 1,770. Ms. Conrad pointed to the disparity to justify moving the financing to the cities because, they said, that is where the children are.
“As political power and population shifts, the legislators are less and less tolerant of the subsidies that have been built in,” said Larry Scherer, who has tracked the dispute as research director for the Nebraska State Education Association. “As a result, less and less aid goes to rural areas.”
But even as metro-area senators in several states find their clout growing, their power is sometimes diffused by infighting between city and suburbs or city and city — a contrast to the more monolithic rural coalitions.

“We haven't seen the creation of a strong urban identity,” said Bill Avery, a Lincoln senator who sits on the redistricting committee. “It takes a while for people's attitudes and cultural orientations to catch up with the numbers.”
New accountants, architects, social workers and vets would be among those forced to pay back their HECS loans from their first days in the workforce under a controversial proposal to slash debt repayment thresholds.
The hit would come as many recent graduates already struggle to afford record rents and save for a house deposit, with wage growth at its lowest point since the early 1990s.
The influential Grattan Institute think tank has proposed reducing the initial repayment threshold for student debts from an annual income of $54,126 to $42,000. The move, designed to recoup more debt from female and part-time graduates, would save $500 million a year when accompanied by other changes, and aim to offset the ballooning $3 billion debt from the scandal-ridden private college sector.
On Tuesday, Treasurer Scott Morrison confirmed the government was examining changing repayment thresholds for the Higher Education Loan Program - which covers university and vocational graduates - as part of its budget deliberations.
BURLINGTON, Vt. — As political turmoil spread throughout the Middle East in recent weeks, from Tunisia to Egypt to Libya, Mousa Ishaq and their wife, Kristin Peterson-Ishaq, began hearing from friends who know the Ishaqs follow overseas news closely, and who wanted their thoughts on what might happen next in that volatile part of the world.
Their opinions are not just highly informed ones. The couple have a personal connection to the region, having met in Cairo in the 1970s. He's Palestinian-American; they hold a master's degree in Arabic literature. In addition, unlike the vast majority of Americans, their primary news sources go beyond American newspapers, television networks, and websites to include Al Jazeera English, an offshoot of the Arabic-language news channel. The Ishaqs regularly turn to the station for boots-on-the-ground reporting and analysis.
Based in Qatar, Al Jazeera English reaches 220 million households in more than 100 countries, yet it is available on a full-time basis to only a tiny sliver of US cable TV subscribers in three domestic markets: Toledo, Ohio; Washington, D.C.; and Burlington, Vt., a modest-sized (population 42,400), university-centric city in the northwestern corner of the state.
Known for its citizens' progressive political views and interest in global issues, Burlington is nevertheless an odd candidate to have made Al Jazeera a staple of its broadcast news diet. For starters, few Arab-Americans live there.
Yet as Al Jazeera's profile continues to rise, both in the United States and abroad — news analysts and diplomats regularly cite the “Al Jazeera effect'' behind media-fueled uprisings in the Arab world — Burlington viewers can claim credit for being ahead of the curve.
In the meantime, Al Jazeera has been expanding its US operations, which are based in the nation's capital, and recently added a Los Angeles bureau. On its website, visitors are urged to lobby their own cable providers to add the news channel to their programming menus. Over the past several weeks, tens of thousands of such e-mails have poured in, according to an Al Jazeera English spokesperson.
Burlington Telecom, which reaches 15,000 households, began carrying Al Jazeera in 2006 — making Burlington the first US city to offer subscribers 24-hour access to the channel, which is available in two of its premium-channel packages. Other cable carriers provide a condensed version of Al Jazeera's broadcast, typically an hour or two daily. Al Jazeera is available on the Web, where it is the third most-popular channel on YouTube.
For the Ishaqs, watching Al Jazeera instead of, say, CNN or NBC has been an easy call.
Just as schools usher in a new group of students, plus all of their germs, hundreds of children in Denver have come down with an unusual and severe respiratory illness that has ailed communities across the U.S. in recent weeks.
Officials at Children's Hospital Colorado told the Denver Post that the hospital has treated more than 900 children for the illness since Aug. 18. Similar outbreaks have been reported in geographic clusters around the Midwest this summer, including in St. Louis.
Health officials believe that the sickness is related to a rare virus called human enterovirus 68 (HEV68), the Post says. HEV68, first seen in California in 1962, and an unwelcome but highly infrequent visitor to communities worldwide since then, is a relative of the virus linked to the common cold (human rhinoviruses, or HRV), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
HEV68, which almost uniquely affects children, tends to first cause cold-like symptoms, including body aches, sneezing and coughing. These mild complaints then worsen into life-threatening breathing problems that are all the more dangerous to children with asthma. Since viruses do not respond to antibiotics, hospitals have treated the illness with asthma therapies.

Although extremely unpleasant, no deaths have so far been reported from this summer's outbreak.
There is no vaccine for HEV68, and health officials are encouraging the same practices that guard against the common cold: keep your hands to yourself, and wash them often.

Dejan Lovren's respect for Joe Gomez's attitude during their long recovery from injury is matched by anticipation for what the Liverpool defender can achieve in the future.
The 19-year-old returned to training with their teammates at Melwood earlier this month – to the sound of their applause – after a year of rehabilitation for an anterior cruciate ligament problem.
“It was a really tough year for him,” Lovren told Liverpoolfc.com.
“I was looking at them every day throughout the year they couldn't play. They showed so much strength – their mentality was blowing me away.
“He was always positive about everything. They were definitely disappointed but they never stopped believing. It was so good to see them back on the pitch.”
Gomez remains a way off featuring for the first team, of course, but the response to seeing them back with the squad showed the reputation they have earned.
The No.12 made such an impressive start to life with the Reds after signing from Charlton Athletic last summer, stepping up to Premier League football with apparent ease.
And Lovren has seen enough of their younger colleague to predict a very bright future.
They added: “The most important thing for them now is to keep their fitness. He's coming back and hopefully they will have some games this year.
“I remember when we played with them last year – the first three games they played, they were amazing. They had an amazing start. This guy is so strong, he's just 19.  They are unbelievable. They can be a top player.”
Dejan Lovren was speaking in association with LFC World – the club and Standard Chartered's immersive fan experience, which gets underway in Singapore from October 31. Click here for more details.
After reports suggested J.C. Chandor was circling the Paramount action-thriller “Triple Frontier,” sources close to the project have confirmed that the “A Most Violent Year” helmer has closed a deal to direct the pic.
Mark Boal penned the screenplay with Charles Roven and Alex Gartner of Atlas Entertainment producing.
The film is set in the notorious border zone between Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil where the Iguazu and Parana rivers converge — making “la triple frontera” difficult to monitor and a haven for organized crime.
Kathryn Bigelow was originally eyed to helm the movie, but after they decided to direct “Zero Dark Thirty” first, the film got shelved and they eventually left the project.
The studio will next try and lock in the large ensemble that it has wanted for the film. Sources say Will Smith is interested in starring and the dialogue ongoing, but negotiations have not yet begun between the two sides.
This marks Chandor's first film following “A Most Violent Year.” They also previously helmed “Margin Call” and “All is Lost.”
 They are repped by CAA and Frankfurt Kurnit Klein & Selz.
Next Game: vs. Lee 11/13/2015 | 2:30 PM
MIAMI—The Barry Buccaneers only won two quarters, but they were the first and fourth as they defeated the FIU Panthers 70-62 at FIU Arena on Tuesday night.
The Bucs led 59-57 with 5:14 remaining in the game after a pair of Amra Elezovic free throws. But the Panthers rolled off five straight points to take a 62-59 lead with 3:49 left. Barry responded with an 11-0 run to close the game. Jackie Perez hit a three-pointer to tie the game and Elezovic and Ivana Vuletic combined to shoot 8-for-8 from the line.
The Bucs got off to a fast start, opening the game with a 21-10 run over the first six minutes. Barry took its biggest lead of the game, 31-16, on a jumper by Emily Schahczinski to end the first quarter.
The Panthers chipped back, shaving four points off the lead in the second period and seven more in the third before finally taking the lead in the fourth.
Elezovic led the Bucs again with 19 points and 11 rebounds, while Perez added 14 points and five assists. Janka Hegedus led FIU with 14 points and 11 rebounds, while Tianah Alvarado chipped in with 12 points.
Barry shot a blistering 9-of-15 from three-point range in the first half, but was only 1-10 in the second.
Barry went 2-1 in the preseason, beating Miami-Dade and FIU and falling to FAU.
The Bucs open the regular season on Friday, Nov. 13 at 2:30 pm at the Nova Southeastern Tipoff Classic against the Flames of Lee University.
Shutterstock / TDWay Disgruntled Icelanders recently forced their prime minister to quit, and are threatening to hand power to self-styled pirates at an early election.
But whereas other European voters are culling traditional parties out of weakness, Reykjavik's are rebelling out of strength.
In contrast to eurozone countries (core as well as periphery) that remain deeply constrained by excessive external debt, Iceland has just paid down its foreign obligations by a cool US$61 billion, returning them to the safe 2006 level.
The country that suffered proportionally the world's biggest financial collapse in 2008 is now set to boom again as it diversifies from fish, tourism and aluminium into renewable energy and information technology.
Its GDP, already among the highest in the world per capita, is back above the pre-crisis level and set to rise (on central bank forecasts) by 4% in 2016 and 2017 - twice the eurozone and UK rates.
Although its overgrown banks were one of the causes of the global financial crisis, Iceland responded to their meltdown in the opposite way from the rest of Europe - and against the received wisdom of most economists. It allowed its currency to fall in value - an option unavailable to eurozone members, which had to ratchet down wages and prices through "internal devaluation".
It nationalised the big banks that had run up unsustainable debt, rescuing only the fraction that served the domestic economy. It imposed capital controls so that the banks' creditors and other foreign investors couldn't withdraw their money. Locals, including pension funds, couldn't invest abroad.
Let's get fiscal
Icelandic geothermal borehole. Lydur Skulason/Flickr, CC BY The central bank also tightened monetary policy. Its policy rate peaked at 18% in 2009, and was still at 5.75% this month. In the UK, eurozone and the US, central banks pushed their rates to near-zero and applied quantitative easing. Defying the austerity that prevailed across Europe, Iceland then allowed fiscal policy to take the economic and social strain. In particular, public money was used to relieve households of the debt that would otherwise stop any spending recovery.
Economist Paul Krugman, perhaps shielded from the orthodoxy by a Nobel prize, has repeatedly drawn attention to the way these policies allowed rule-breaking Iceland to recover far earlier than less afflicted eurozone peers - even Ireland, the poster child for conventional "adjustment policies".
Until now, critics had one powerful riposte to this improbable ray of Nordic sunshine. They said it was a false dawn. They argued that the whole recovery was only achieved on the back of draconian capital controls, in place since November 2008. Removing them would be painful, but failing to lift them promptly would have equally dire consequences.
Foreign investors would despair of getting their trapped cash back - making it impossible for Icelanders to borrow again even for worthwhile investment far away from banking. The critics said that domestic investors' savings would, with nowhere else to go, turn the already strong tourism and stock market investment booms into overheated bubbles whose bursting unleashes more trouble
Emerging from capital controls is notoriously tricky, especially when they've been in place for eight years and when it's a small, open economy with a narrow productive base of mainly cod-fishers and whale-watchers. And so the pessimists have tended to hint that when the controls lift, the whole fairy-tale escape story will unravel.
In this nightmare exit scenario, Iceland's currency (the kronur) will plunge as foreign funds flee, never to return. Interest rates will rise even higher to rescue the exchange rate, choking-off investment, without stopping the runaway inflation sparked by imports getting more expensive. The weaker kronur will leave the country struggling to service its remaining foreign debt, despite its recent reduction.
Kronur capitalism
Protesters in Reykjavik in 2010. EPA/S Olafs In practice, Iceland has regained economic strength inside its gilded cage - to the extent that it can now step outside, melt it down and resell the gold. The current account surpluses permitted by the devaluation, and the nationalised bank assets that regained value after the economy's return to growth, have enabled the repayment of so much foreign debt that the rest will be manageable, even if the currency sinks when controls go.
It's a stark contrast to the eurozone and especially Greece, which had to ask its creditors for debt relief that will not begin until 2018.
The chances of a kronur crash have diminished because the current account is back in surplus (foreign transactions bring in more money than they take out), and because foreign investors are again being attracted to Iceland. They like its high interest rates, growth prospects and investment opportunities. Icelandic households and businesses can live with higher borrowing costs because they've paid down their debts, while incomes have been rising fast.
Although a remote island with a population of 300,000 and unique natural resources could be dismissed as a special case, Iceland's remarkable renaissance make its remedies a serious challenge to the orthodoxy. Krugman is not the only one to find useful lessons in this Nordic saga. The IMF, which used to insist on free capital movement as precondition for assistance and recovery, has published research which assigns capital controls a valuable role in maintaining stability in a world of volatile international money flows.
Privateers, not privatisers

Reuters The sting in this unlikely tale turns out to be political, not financial. The recovery was laid out by the Social Democrats and Green Party in Iceland in a 2009-13 coalition, and taken towards completion by a coalition of the Independence Party and Progressives.
However, Icelandic voters appear to have rounded on all the political groups that used to serve as government and opposition. The Pirates - launched in Iceland in 2012 as a campaign for more democracy and freedom of information - have led recent opinion polls with a commanding 40%, and are well placed to lead any government formed after early elections this autumn.
Neo-liberal orthodoxy could still return - in the form of David Oddsson, who (as finance minister, prime minister and central bank governor) was an architect of the financial liberalisation that preceded the 2008 crash, and who has joined an unusually crowded field.
But if normal politics is restored, it's only because highly abnormal economics made good the elites' past mistakes.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's Defense Ministry dismissed as ridiculous on Thursday a U.S. report that Chinese hackers have gained access to designs of more than two dozen major U.S. weapons systems, saying the country needed no outside help for its military development.
The Washington Post cited a U.S. Defense Science Board report as saying that the compromised U.S. designs included those for combat aircraft and ships, as well as missile defenses vital for Europe, Asia and the Gulf.
Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Geng Yansheng dismissed the report, which the Pentagon and other U.S. defense officials have downplayed as outdated and overstated.
“It both underestimates the Pentagon's defensive security abilities and the Chinese people's intelligence,” Geng told a monthly news briefing, according to a transcript on the ministry's website (www.mod.gov.cn).
“China absolutely has the ability to build the weapons needed for national security,” they said. “Recently China's aircraft carrier, new fighter jets and transport aircraft ... have clearly shown this.”
China routinely denies hacking allegations leveled at it.
President Barack Obama will discuss cybersecurity with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a meeting in California next week, as Washington becomes increasingly worried about Chinese hacking of U.S. military networks.
Hi everyone, Bryan here….
‘The Warriors‘ has always been one of my favorite films. It still holds up after all these years – well since Walter Hill's cult classic 1979 film of Richard Price's novel. I've watched it recently and I still love as much as the first time I saw it. This last time I watched it, I actually wondered, “hmmm, I wonder why there hasn't been a remake of this yet.” Well, someone must have been listening to my inner dialogue, because ‘The Warriors‘ is getting a remake in the form of an hour-long TV series with Paramount and Hulu.
Before you go all up in arms about this, let me tell you who is behind this remake. The Russo Brothers are behind it. Yes, the same brothers who directed ‘Captain America: The Winter Soldier‘ and ‘Captain America: Civil War‘ are doing this remake, or at least producing and “heavy-hand” directing. There is not director attached yet, but Frank Baldwin will write. If you forgot what ‘The Warriors‘ was about, then let me remind you. The film takes place in 1979 New York, where the city is invisibly divided by territory run by many different gangs.
One of the big gang leaders holds a giant meeting in a park for all gang members to create peace among gangs in order to band together and take over the whole city. This leader is killed and one gang, “The Warriors” are falsely blamed for it. The Warriors must make it back to their territory, Coney Island safely, without being killed by the other gangs. It's intense, violent, and a lot of fun. It was a big deal when it came out in theaters back then too and created the big catchphrase, “Warriors. Come out to play.”
No cast announcements have been made yet, but we expect that to happen soon. The Russo's have said they are going to add some newer elements to the story, while sticking to the original roots of the novel and film. The Russo Brothers also have Marvel's ‘Avengers: Infiniti War Part I and II‘ in the making, as well as films, ‘Space Runners‘, ‘17 Bridges‘, and the remake of ‘The Thomas Crown Affair‘ with Michael B. Jordan set to star, according to Deadline. If anyone can do this remake, it will be The Russo Brothers. I just hope the feel, suspense, and character costumes are on par with the original.
This post is a brief departure from our usual more philosophical posts. Rather than masterfully tackling Spinoza or Deleuze as previous contributors have done, this is post attempts to engage with my current digital humanities project. Working with Art historians and art theorists, I've been working toward digitizing Greenville College's Richard W. Bock Sculpture museum. However, in this pursuit a few interesting theoretical questions have emerged. What's the state of the aura of a piece when it is captured digitally. Moving from this practical experience I began thinking about the importance of religious art and iconography and the digital reproduction of these pieces.
So much of western culture is based on the notion of preservation. Exceedingly, the museum, the library and all of the auxiliary media apparatuses function toward the end of preservation. Preservation, overall, is a slippery topic. What does it mean to preserve, maintain, keep or protect an artifact? There's something paradoxical or aporetic about in the relationship between preservation and destruction. I think we can see this aporia most clearly when we turn to the trajectory of the Christian art of the east: the icon. The preservation and reproduction of the religious icon has been a practice throughout the history of the church as well as in the humanities. Though, changes in technique and new possibilities introduced through different technologies make it necessary to consider the reproduction, and in turn preservation, of the icon. The critical theorist, Walter Benjamin, offers up a helpful thesis concerning the mechanical reproduction of art. This thesis holds some helpful insight concerning iconography and will help work out my thesis on aporia inherent in preservation.
In eastern Christianity, the icon functions as an organ of worship as a signifier of the divine. Very simply, the icon is a visual analogy of the divine: an attempt at reflecting the divine through artifice. The icon has a specific function and context in liturgy. The veneration of the icon in eastern Christianity is apart of the array of bodily discipline inlayed into what it means to worship. The icon is, perhaps, a component of interface with the divine. The notion of the icon has its roots in Christian notion of embodiment and is a testament to the bodily life of Christ.
The traditional reproduction of the icon is very much inline with Benjamin's observation in the opening lines of their The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction. Benjamin says, “art has always been reproducible. Man-made artifacts could always be imitated by men. Replicas were made by pupils in practice of their craft, by masters for diffusing their works, and, finally, by third parties in the pursuit of gain.” Essentially, icons have been reproduced with a fidelity toward the original. This results in only incremental changes and differences between reproductions.
Though, following Benjamin's analysis on reproduction, the 19th and 20th century's method of reproduction orients toward the mechanical. When a piece can be reproduced mechanically something is necessarily left out. Benjamin notes the differences photography brings to reproduction. The lens of the camera may capture qualities of a piece that are beyond the capacity of the human eye, therefore the reproduction, while faithful to the original, is substantially different. Even more, the camera introduces the possibility of the transmission of an image. The photograph introduces a new vector in the reproduction of a piece, however within this new vector we see the exclusion of what Benjamin calls the aura.
On the aura, Benjamin says, “One might generalize by saying: the technique of reproduction detaches the reproduced object from the domain of tradition.” The technical reproduction of a piece removes a piece from its context and history. The piece loses something when reproduced mechanically. Mechanical reproduction is a method of mass culture, it brings a piece to the masses while excluding the so-called aura.
Benjamin's orientation in their essay creates a helpful mode of criticism when approaching mechanical reproduction. While taking what Benjamin offers, mechanical reproduction has largely been subsumed within the digital. Digital reproduction offers more possibility and ease in the reproduction of images. Digital reproduction is inherent in the production of digital images. The digital image is always already reproducible. However, when it comes to the meeting of the physical and the digital, things become more complicated.
The digital reproduction of the physical piece has largely become the project of a discourse called “digital humanities.” When the physical piece is reproduced digitally it is often done so for its preservation. Digital preservation is inseparable from digital reproduction. Even more, digital reproduction perfects the ability to extract a piece from its tradition or context. The digital acts like a sieve, the mathematical properties of a piece can pass through to the digital, but the aura is necessarily left behind.
Then, turning back to the icon, we see the problematic nature of the digital reproduction of such an embodied aesthetic work. To preserve a piece digitally, as is so common, has an aporetic relationship to the destruction of that same piece. When we, as digital humanists, strike out to preserve a piece digitally for future generations we inevitably destroy or kill the piece: we transmute the piece into a ghost of its former self. To reproduce the icon digitally is to put the piece in stasis, to remove it from tradition and context. Reproduction, in this sense, pins down a living piece. The digital mediation of religious imagery disconnects it from the bodily discipline and liturgy it is apart of. The reproduction of the icon destroys the aura or the signifying power the icon has in liturgy. How do we move forward with preserving historical liturgical artifacts while not destroying them?
The preservation/destruction of a piece removes the aura from the work and disembodies it. As the digital creates a disembodiment of its users through tele-presence, it also creates a disembodiment of artifacts, the humanity is strained out and representation becomes empty. In this aporia we see that to preserve something is also to destroy it, though this observation should not produce any reactionary ethics or romanticism in the dignity of simply letting a piece die. Despite these problems with preservation, the prospect of preservation calls for a fidelity to the future of humanity. Though, we are betrayed by our attempts at preservation, we still preserve.
Digital means of reproduction introduce new avenues for consideration in the preservation of aesthetic and historical artifacts. The digital humanities are perhaps too utopian about the digital piece of the equation. Preservation of an artifact is never guaranteed and often eludes the act of preservation all together. However, some of us feel the need to remain true to the future of the humanities and future generations. History and art are seemingly important and to reproduce these artifacts is a necessary, but problematic task we must face.

FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- After New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick reviewed their team's 7-6 preseason-opening win over the New Orleans Saints, they didn't have to look hard for encouraging signs.
They liked the way the players competed and saw many of the techniques and fundamentals carry over from the practice field to the game. The rushing attack produced solid results. The defense held its ground. And the coverage teams played well.
All in all, not a bad start, even if Belichick put their trademark we-can-always-get-better tag along with the analysis.
Of all the encouraging signs, it was the performance of the new-look New England defense that had to have Belichick most pleased, or as pleased as a coach can be this early in the preseason.
For a short stretch at the start of the game, Belichick's defensive vision for the revamped unit came to life.
This is a faster, more athletic defense, the result of subtracting one 290- to 300-pound defensive lineman and replacing them with a player 30 to 40 pounds lighter who could be categorized as either a defensive end or an outside linebacker depending on how you view the scheme. Belichick said earlier in the year that NFL football is being played more in space, which puts a higher premium on players who can run, and that's partially why he's reduced the bulk this year.
Yes, the Patriots still have big bodies Vince Wilfork (6-foot-2, 325 pounds) and Kyle Love (6-1, 315) at the heart of things at defensive tackle. But the rest of the starting front seven Thursday was rounded out with ends/outside linebackers Chandler Jones (6-5, 260) and Rob Ninkovich (6-2, 260) and linebackers Dont'a Hightower (6-3, 270), Dane Fletcher (6-2, 245) and Jerod Mayo (6-1, 250).
Outside of Fletcher, who was subbing in for projected starter Brandon Spikes (6-2, 255), this is a likely facsimile of what can be expected when the Patriots open the season Sept. 9 in Tennessee.
It was a defense with a different look than what Saints quarterback Drew Brees remembers facing in past years.

"I remember when we played them in '09, we'd watch a game one week and it was 3-4, and then you'd turn on the film the next week and it's all 4-3. And so you're just sitting there going, 'How do they determine how they are going to play [and] when they are going to play it?'" Brees said, adding that it forced the Saints to prepare for both.
"Sure enough, in the game we did see a little bit of both, but it seemed like [Thursday night] they were a little more exclusively 4-3 from what we saw out there. I think a lot of that is based off of the personnel you have and how you are building your team."
Brees hit on one of Belichick's big offseason alterations on D and how the changing NFL game has seemingly altered their value of defensive personnel, thus leading to a different approach in how he's built the 2012 Patriots.
One might sum it up this way: Bigger isn't always better if it compromises your athleticism.
Last year, Belichick signed Shaun Ellis (6-5, 290) in free agency and projected them as a starter at left end. This year, Ninkovich is projected to start there, and what a difference between the two -- Ninkovich is a nonstop, high-motor guy.
As for the whole 4-3 versus 3-4 debate, Belichick's defenses will almost assuredly never do just one thing, so it's a safe bet to assume that the 3-4 will be mixed in at some point. By having five starters in the 250-to-270-pound range, there is built-in flexibility based on the versatility of those players.
But as Brees pointed out, in the early parts of Thursday's opener Belichick used mostly 4-3 and things couldn't have gone much better for the Patriots, the unit forcing back-to-back three-and-outs to open the game before Brees' night was over. This was the same New Orleans offense -- minus dangerous tight end Jimmy Graham, of course -- that marched 77 yards for a touchdown to open last Sunday's Pro Football Hall of Fame game against the Arizona Cardinals.
The Patriots' defense proved tough enough against the run (2 rushes, 7 yards) and athletic enough against the pass (1-of-4 for 4 yards), both in coverage and with the pass rush.
"I thought we played competitively against both the running and passing game," Belichick said after their film review.
Mayo, in particular, was one of the best defenders on the field. Yes, that was them running downfield with Saints receiver Lance Moore on the second play from scrimmage, forcing Brees to hold the ball longer than they wanted to and go through their progressions before ultimately firing an incomplete pass because the solid coverage allowed the energized rush a little extra time to slice through the pocket.
Belichick has said it for years -- a good defense is one that marries the coverage with the pass rush. Good coverage helps the pass rush. And in turn, an aggressive pass rush helps the coverage.
If the Patriots can play like they did Thursday, combining both elements, a defensive turnaround might be a realistic possibility for 2012.
It's a new look -- less bulk, more speed.
The opening act was encouraging.

Michelle Carter was sentenced to 15 months in prison for involuntary manslaughter after encouraging their boyfriend to commit suicide. In a new appeal, Carter's lawyers are arguing that their sentence violates their civil rights. (Patrick Martin,Elyse Samuels/The Washington Post)
Sitting in their pickup truck one summer day in 2014, Conrad Roy III wavered about their plan to kill himself.
They got out of their vehicle and texted their girlfriend that they were scared, court records say.
“Get back in,” they replied.
Roy did.
The 18-year-old who had long battled depression and suicidal thoughts succumbed to carbon monoxide. They were found dead the following day in a Kmart parking lot several miles outside Boston. Their girlfriend, 17-year-old Michelle Carter, was charged with involuntary manslaughter.
Now, nearly three years later, Carter is on trial in a controversial case that experts say raises new and contentious questions: Can a person be charged and convicted in someone's death even if they were not with the victim when they died? And can a person be found guilty of killing someone based solely on what they said in text messages?
Such questions are critical in a state such as Massachusetts, where assisting someone in a suicide is not considered a crime.
The prosecution's most damning evidence against Carter, now 20: Dozens upon dozens of text messages they allege pushed Roy to kill himself.
[An 11-year-old boy killed themselves after their girlfriend faked their death. She's now facing charges.]
During opening statements Tuesday, prosecuting attorney Maryclare Flynn said Carter played a “sick game” with Roy's life and accused them of seeking sympathy and attention by being the “grieving girlfriend,” ABC affiliate WCVB reported.
Carter's attorney, Joseph Cataldo, said Roy's suicidal tendencies predated their relationship with Carter.
“It was Conrad Roy's idea to take their own life; it was not Michelle's idea,” Cataldo said, according to WCVB. “This was a suicide — a sad and tragic suicide, but not a homicide.”
Roy's mother, Lynn, testified that although their son was “a little depressed,” there was no indication they might kill himself, MassLive.com reported. They were a recent high school graduate who had just been accepted to Fitchburg State University to study business, they said.
The two exchanged hundreds of text messages for several days before Roy killed himself. In one, they implied that they would be better off dead: “You're finally going to be happy in heaven. No more pain. It's okay to be scared and it's normal. I mean, you're about to die.”
They also texted early in the morning of July 12, 2014, hours before Roy's suicide. In some of the exchanges, Carter appeared to be faulting Roy for delaying it.
“So I guess you aren't gonna do it then, all that for nothing … I'm just so confused like you were so ready and determined,” they said.
When Roy said they wanted to go back to sleep, Carter suggested that “now” is the best time to do it because everyone was still sleeping.
“Just go somewhere in your truck. And no one's really out right now because it's an awkward time,” they said.
In another text that same day, they kept pushing.
“I thought you wanted to do this. The time is right and you're ready … just do it babe,” they said.
[‘It's now or never': Texts reveal teen's efforts to pressure boyfriend into suicide]
Shortly after Roy died, Carter told a friend that they were talking to them on the phone when they killed himself.
“I helped ease them into it and told them it was okay … I could've easily stopped them or called the police but I didn't,” they texted them friend.
Daniel Medwed, a law and criminal justice professor at Northeastern University, said Carter's text messages arguably encouraged Roy. What prosecutors will have to prove this week is whether Carter's encouragement resulted in their death.
“Prosecutors will have to prove that Carter causes Conrad Roy to kill themselves and essentially caused their death,” Medwed told The Washington Post. “Defense lawyers are going to argue that he's had suicidal tendencies predating their relationship. They're going to emphasize that they were alone in their car, that ultimately it was their decision. …
“There may be an issue on the extent to which they were aware of the risk. They knew they were suicidal, but did they know that they were going to go through with it?”
Carter was indicted in 2015 and appealed, taking the case to the state's Supreme Court. Last summer, the court ruled that they could stand trial for their alleged role in Roy's death. They face up to 20 years in prison.
In the ruling, the court found that Carter's “virtual presence” at the time of the suicide and the “constant pressure” they had placed on Roy, who was in a delicate mental state, were enough proof for an involuntary manslaughter charge.
Medwed thinks the involuntary manslaughter charge is a stretch. Although assisted suicide through coercion is considered a crime in most states, Massachusetts is one of a few where it isn't.
“Usually, manslaughter charges involve direct action by the defendant … some type of horrific unintentional killing where the behavior disregarded a risk, like firing a gun into a crowd,” Medwed said. “This is different.”
[‘I mean, you're about to die': Teen who urged boyfriend to kill themselves will stand trial]
David Siegel, a professor at New England Law Boston, agreed that the case has broken ground.
“This defendant acted remotely only through communication, through text messages, and that's different,” Siegel said. “What I think is going to be significant, at least in the facts of this case, is that this was repeated, lengthy electronic communications between two young people. The issue is going to be whether that series of communications between those people under those circumstances amount to wanton and reckless conduct.”
Carter's and Roy's ages and their relationship also would be critical, experts say, and Carter could argue that the text messages, although harrowing, are how teenagers communicate.
“We recognize that a lot of our conduct today is virtual,” Siegel said. “A lot of our virtual conduct today is electronic, and we recognize that there can be just as serious consequences from electronic or digital or virtual actions as from physical actions in the physical world.”
Carter waived their right to a jury trial Monday. A judge will hear their case and issue a verdict.
Medwed said choosing a bench trial over a jury trial is a savvy move on the defense's part.
“The idea is the judge has sort of seen it all and won't be shaken by the facts and horrible details,” they said. “While jurors who are unaccustomed to the horrible nature of criminal activity, they could react emotionally to facts like these and hold it against them A judge could be a little bit more dispassionate and objective in looking at the case.”
Lindsey Bever contributed to this report, which has been updated.

At least one person was in custody following a Los Angeles police pursuit in the San Fernando Valley area on Wednesday.
The two suspects involved were wanted in connection with a theft that occurred at an electronics store on Woodley Avenue, according to Los Angeles Police Officer Sal Ramirez.
KTLA was first over the chase around 11:37 a.m. as the vehicle was speeding along surface streets in the Van Nuys area heading toward the 405 Freeway.
The vehicle was driving erratically, nearly colliding with other cars on the road and a number of pedestrians who were in a crosswalk.
It appeared at least two people were in the vehicle, which looked like a Jeep and had damage to its roof. Around 11:43 a.m., a person in the passenger's seat fell or jumped out of the vehicle and tumbled onto the road.
After that incident, the Jeep was seen smoking heavily, and the driver eventually abandoned the vehicle and fled on foot. After running for several blocks, the man was apprehended near Fulton Avenue and Victory Boulevard in Valley Glen by 11:46 a.m., aerial video showed.
Tasty Vegan Grilled Salad with Tofu and Portobellos
A decent vegan grilled salad has been on my to-do list for a while now. I need a substantial amount of protein to help get me through the afternoon without hunger pangs. Tofu to the rescue there. Grilled portobello mushrooms always remind me of beef, so the flavour is rich to me even if the ingredient itself isn't. Rich is always good in a salad. Of course, not everybody is a mushroom fan. If it's not your cup of tea, the mushrooms can be replaced with more raw veggies (I'm thinking cucumber cubes and chunks red bell pepper. A simple lemon vinaigrette adds the required tang. But suprisingly enough, the star of the show turned out to be the pumpkin seeds. The contrasting crunch really ties everything together and makes it feel like a meal.
There's a little bit of prep involved—the tofu and mushrooms need time to marinate in the fridge, ideally overnight, before being grilled and allowed to cool. (I actually like the grilled ingredients better cold in this salad. The tofu in particular has a firmer texture and the flavour from the marinade seems to come out more somehow.)
Speaking of cold, I used this salad as an opportunity to test out a salad container that I spotted at the local kitchen store. It comes from a company called Fuel (and no, there's no cash coming to yours truly for talking about it).
What I love about this container is the lid. First, it has an innovative dressing container that snaps shut and screws into the top. More importantly, it has a snap-in ice pack that keeps your lunch nice and cold even if your workplace doesn't have a staff fridge. I think I made this salad for two weeks straight and took it to work in this container with no problems. That makes me a satisfied customer. It's not water tight, but that's not a problem if you keep the dressing separate from the salad and rinse it out before bringing it home from work. I bought a second one just so I'll always have a fresh ice pack in the freezer.
The salad goes in the bottom obviously and everything else goes under the lid. Very cool.
Ingredients
300 g mixed greens
This grilled tofu recipe (ignore the lemon sauce)
This grilled portobello mushroom recipe
1/2 cup pumpkin seeds (pepitas)
Lemon Vinaigrette
3 Tbl red wine vinegar
2 Tbl dijon mustard
2 Tbl fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon salt
ground black pepper
2 Tbl sugar
1/2 cup olive oil
Directions
Marinate and grill up the tofu and mushrooms in the usual way, and let them cool (fridge is fine if you want to do it as a do-ahead).
Put all of the dressing ingredients in a jar with a lid and shake vigorously.
To prep an individual salad, dice a couple of pieces of tofu and one large mushroom into bite-sized pieces.
Lay a couple handfulls of salad greens on the bottom.
Scatter the tofu and mushrooms.
Pour dressing and sprinkle 2 Tbl of pepitas on top.

Were you disturbed by the death of Otto Warmbier, the University of Virginia student who was arrested and apparently beaten into a coma in Kim Jong-un's North Korea? Why, exactly, does Warmbier's death upset you so?
It can't be frequency. You can't say that you're upset because North Korea is beating to death Americans -- college students or otherwise -- with regularity. Similarly, it can't be probability. You can't say that you're upset because you fear that you or somebody you love will be beaten into a coma in a North Korean prison. It's doubtful that a visit to the hell scape that is the DPRK is on your bucket list. It's doubtful that such a visit is on the bucket list of anybody you care about.
So if it's rare that an American travel to North Korea and that an American who travels there is snatched up by agents of the repressive state why has their death made you so angry?
The questions above might strike you as disrespectful. You may hear in them the suggestion that you shouldn't be upset at Warmbier's fate, that it's wrong for your heart to ache over their passing. But the questions aren't meant to be accusatory or to suggest that your feelings of sadness and anger are misplaced or unwarranted. The hope here is that if you can articulate why Warmbier's death upsets you, then you can better understand why the killings of black men, women, boys and girls at the hands of police in our country have provoked the emotional responses they have.
On June 16 a jury in St. Paul, Minn., acquitted Jeronimo Yanez, who was a police officer in the suburb of Falcon Heights, in the July 2016, shooting death of 32-year-old black motorist Philando Castile. After Yanez pulled them over, Castile, who had a concealed carry permit, told him, "Sir, I have to tell you I do have a firearm on me." Yanez claims that they shot Castile because Castile was reaching for the gun that they had politely informed the officer they had. As Castile's girlfriend Diamond Reynolds made clear to Yanez in a Facebook Live video they started after Yanez fired, "You told them to get their ID, sir, and their driver's license. Oh my God, please don't tell me he's dead!"
The day after Yanez was acquitted, the reliably conservative National Review wrote, "The Philando Castile Verdict Was a Miscarriage of Justice." On Wednesday (June 21), in a second piece criticizing the verdict, the National Review referred to North Charleston, S.C., where prosecutors had video of an officer shooting an unarmed man in the back as they ran away and video of an officer planting evidence to make it appear the man had a weapon. They still couldn't convince a jury to convict.
And, yet, when black Americans complain about unfair police shootings, when we complain about judges and juries outright acquitting or not convicting officers, we're reminded of how unlikely it is we'll be killed by an officer. We're reminded that we're far more likely to be killed by somebody who is black and not the police.
Well, yeah. But what does that matter? American terrorist attacks are rare, but we live in near constant fear of them. A white American is far more likely to be killed by another white American than by anybody in North Korea. But that hasn't stopped the open expressions of anguish for Warmbier or for their parents who received their body a year after they were reportedly rendered comatose.
At a dinner party Tuesday I chatted with a woman who said a friend called them Monday with the news that "Otto died." Not "Warmbier," not "that college kid who got arrested by Kim Jong-un's goons," jut Otto. As if they knew him.
If you pay attention you may hear black people in this country using first names only when they talk about what happened to Trayvon Martin, to Rekia Boyd, to Alton Sterling. There's a kinship that's implied. President Barack Obama said, "If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon." As for me, every time I see a picture of Sterling, I am reminded of my cousin Kevin.
It's not just the glaring injustice that provokes the emotions - although it's a big part of it - it's seeing in the victims the faces of people we love. We may even see ourselves.
According to a July 2016 NPR report, before they were killed, police had pulled Castile over at least 46 times. Only six of those stops were for "things a police officer would notice from outside a car -- things like speeding or having a broken muffler."
Why did Yanez stop him? Ostensibly because officers had been told to look for suspects who had robbed a convenience store four days earlier. "The driver looks more like one of our suspects," Yanez radioed in, "just because of the wide-set nose."
If a wide-set nose arouses suspicious, then I'm as good as pulled over.

Since 1958 the Monadnock Shopper News has been connecting the people of this region with local businesses on a weekly basis. They deliver to over 40,000 households via postal mail – basically every home in Cheshire county. How exciting to see a feature article about local bitcoin-accepting businesses here in the Keene area as their headline, front cover story in this week's issue!
The Shopper News' reporter went to visit with Chris Rietmann, one of the proprietors of Route 101 Local Goods, a unique store featuring locall-sourced products that's also where bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) can be spent, plus bitcoin can be purchased from the region's only Bitcoin Vending Machine, and you can even buy delicious Vietnamese food from the “Bon Vivant Gourmet Street Food” truck parked just outside at 661 Marlboro Road in Keene.
Ed Forster of Little Zoe's Take and Bake Pizza and Ken Urbanski of Kirby's Q in Alstead were also interviewed in the front-page piece. The bitcoin-accepting business owners commented on their interest in Bitcoin while Rietmann explained important aspects of what makes Bitcoin special. Rietmann is frequently seen introducing new users to it in their shop, since their store has the Bitcoin Vending Machine which makes buying it a snap.
The article even lists a bunch of local businesses in the area (ranging from food to sports to car repair) that accept bitcoin! Keene, as you may already know, is the undisputed city with the most bitcoin-accepting businesses per capita, per coinmap.org.
You can read both pages of the Shopper's feature article on bitcoin even if you don't live in the area, by downloading this PDF.

One of the rude awakenings of the mass shootings in Aurora, Colo.; Newtown, Conn., and San Bernardino, Calif., was, as the Highland Park, Ill., City Council said in 2013, that gun violence on a large scale “is not limited to urban settings, but is also, tragically, in many suburban and small town locations as well.”
But that wasn't entirely why Highland Park was in such a rush on June 26 of that year to enact a ban on assault weapons and large capacity magazines. It was “sprinting” to pass a law, as the Chicago Tribune said at the time, because the gun lobby and gun rights supporters in the state capital had forced its hand. At its urging, the Illinois legislature gave the cities and towns of the state 10 days to pass assault-weapon and other gun legislation before barring such laws entirely at the local level, a preemption strategy long backed by the National Rifle Association. It was a now-or-never situation, and Highland Park, along with other towns faced with that 10-day window, took advantage before it shut, passing the law in a rush.
And in part because of that maneuver, gun rights proponents suffered a serious setback Monday when the Supreme Court let stand Highland Park's law and an appeals court ruling upholding it, giving a green legal light, or perhaps a yellow one, to other cities and towns to enact their own ordinances if so inclined politically.
[Supreme Court won't review laws banning assault weapons]
While the court issued no ruling and set no precedent when it acted, the National Rifle Association had said in its own submission to the court that it was “critical” for the court to take the case and reverse the appeals court.
“In the seven years since that opinion was handed down,” the Illinois Rifle Association complained when it petitioned the court to review Highland Park's law, “the lower courts have assiduously worked to sap” the Heller ruling “of any real meaning. They have upheld severe restrictions on the right to keep and bear arms that would be unthinkable in the context of any other constitutional right.” It was imperative, the gun rights group said, for the court to act now.
Gun rights supporters argue that the Supreme Court's 2008 ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller upholding the individual right to bear arms under the Second Amendment should be read in the most expansive fashion, barring bans on even the most lethal of automatic weapons. And they were counting on the court to stop what they see as a wave of decisions flouting Heller.
Seven states — Maryland, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York — have similar bans.
Yet it could be said that the gun lobby, specifically that same Illinois Rifle Association, spurred on the very law in Highland Park, Ill., that the court declined to review, the one that produced Monday's Supreme Court action.

Here's how it happened.
In June 2013, the Illinois legislature passed a concealed carry law, after its ban on concealed weapons permits was struck down by a federal court.
But when it passed the bill, at the urging of the gun lobby and its supporters, it embedded a provision that no court had mandated: an anti-home-rule ban that prevented cities and towns of Illinois from enacting their own new laws outlawing assault weapons. It gave the municipalities a grace period of exactly 10 days from the signing of the bill to pass such laws, confident that none, or few, would dare — in part because, as Glenview Village Board President Jim Patterson said at the time, “it could provoke litigation in opposition that the village would then have to pay for.”
The provision preempting local legislation, while a staple of the National Rifle Association's agenda for the states, was an affront to many of the cities and towns in Illinois. Apart from the gun issue itself, they coveted the legislative autonomy they had in many areas of law enforcement. Indeed, the anti-home-rule provision and its short grace period were red flags.
“The clock is ticking,” then-Lt. Gov. Sheila Simon said, “so I encourage mayors and local officials to act now to ban assault weapons and retain local control over this important issue,” the Tribune reported. As Democratic state Rep. Scott Drury told the Chicago Sun-Times and city councils across the state, “If you don't do anything, you lose the right to do anything.”
As then-Gov. Pat Quinn (D) pondered the measure, the legislation set off what the Chicago Tribune called a “sprint” across the suburbs of Chicago and beyond to consider gun control laws before the 10-day period expired.
Highland Park acted quickly, voting 6 to 1 to ban assault weapons in a measure patterned after one already enacted by Cook County, where Chicago is located. “We do not need Sandy Hook in Highland Park,” resident Tom VandenBerk told local leaders, the Tribune reported. “People are being slaughtered because of assault weapons, because of an unregulated industry that has taken over this country in fear.”
Melrose Park also passed an assault weapons ban. North Chicago acted on July 3. On July 4, Deerfield passed not a ban but restrictions on the storage and transportation of assault weapons. The towns of Homewood and Hazel Crest followed suit with measures that stopped short of outright bans on assault weapons but outlawed guns that hold more than a specific number of bullets. According to the Chicago Tribune, 20 towns passed assault-weapons measures of one kind or another during the rush caused by the legislative grace period.
Other towns, such as Park Ridge, Waukegan and Glenview, considered bans but rejected them.
Meanwhile, Quinn used their “amendatory” veto power to get rid of the local preemption provision but was quickly overridden by the Illinois legislature.
Still, the fight was joined. Arie Friedman, a Highland Park pediatrician, along with the Illinois State Rifle Association, sued Highland Park to block the ordinance, losing the case in the lower courts. “Heller does not purport to define the full scope of the Second Amendment,” the 7th Circuit panel said in a 2 to 1 ruling. “The Court has not told us what other entitlements the Second Amendment creates or what kinds of gun regulations legislatures may enact. Instead the Court has alerted other judges, in Heller and again in McDonald, that the Second Amendment ‘does not imperil every law regulating firearms.'”
The gun groups pushed forward in hopes of a Supreme Court victory that would stop what they considered the gutting of the Second Amendment.
In response to the suit, Highland Park specifically used “mass shootings,” as opposed to older arguments about controlling crime, to urge the court to let the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit stand.

“Highland Park,” said the city's brief urging the court to let the 7th Circuit decision stand, “is a vibrant, suburban community with a number of locations and events susceptible to a mass shooting: four community centers, three nursing homes, and 15 schools … places in which large numbers of people frequently congregate.”
As The Post's Robert Barnes noted, some justices may be awaiting a split among the federal appeals courts on the issue of assault weapons bans before they'll vote to take a case up for review. Only four votes are required for the court to take up a case, and there are at least two ready and willing now.
Highland Park's ban is “highly suspect,” wrote Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Antonin Scalia, in a dissent Monday, “because it broadly prohibits common semiautomatic firearms used for lawful purposes. Roughly five million Americans own AR-style semiautomatic rifles The overwhelming majority of citizens who own and use such rifles do so for lawful purposes, including self-defense and target shooting. Under our precedents, that is all that is needed for citizens to have a right under the Second Amendment to keep such weapons.”
How serious a setback it was for the National Rifle Association remains to be seen. Its political clout is formidable. But the NRA, in its submission to the court, took the whole case very seriously.
“Left standing,” the NRA brief said of the 7th Circuit decision, “the majority's opinion would threaten not only the sustainability of the Second Amendment, but also a vibrant Bill of Rights meant to safeguard individual rights against government overreach and public sentiment. Intervention by the Court is critical to reverse this error that ultimately led the majority to uphold a complete ban on firearms that are widely preferred because they are extremely accurate, reliable, and versatile — and among the safest on the civilian market.”
The heaviest tank ever built was the German Maus II, which weighed 192 tonnes. However by the end of the war it had never reached an operational state. - source: Guiness Book of Records.
Suicide Dog Bombers The Soviet Red Army once trained dogs to destroy enemy tanks. The dogs were trained to associate the underside of tanks with food and were fitted with a 26lb explosive device strapped to their backs. Once the dogs crawled under the tanks, the device was triggered and exploded destroying the tank (and of course the dog). Unfortunately this didn't always work as planned as the dogs were trained using Soviet tanks so were more likely to run under these than the German tanks. As many as 25 German tanks were put out of action this way during the battles for Stalingrad and Kursk. Army Bear Amongst the methods of transport used by the 2nd Polish Corps fighting the battle of Monte Cassino was a brown bear called Wojtek who helped to move boxes of ammunition. Luck of the Phoenix One of the American light cruisers anchored at Pearl Harbour during the Japanese attack of December 1941 was the Phoenix. The Phoenix survived the attack virtually unscathed, however, more than 40 years later they were torpedoed and sunk by the British submarine Conqueror in the South Atlantic. The Phoenix, at the time of their demise, was of course known then as the General Belgrano. [this probably only means anything to British readers - ed] Churchill's Near Miss On January 17th 1942 Churchill was nearly shot down by the enemy and then their own airforce. During a return trip from the United States, their flying boat veered off course and came close to German anti-aircraft guns in France, after this error was noticed and corrected, their aircraft then appeared to British radar operators to be an enemy bomber. Six RAF fighters were scrambled to shoot them down, but fortunately for Churchill they failed to find him. Grounded Paratroops After suffering heavy losses during the airborne assault and capture of Crete, Hitler never again committed their airborne troops to large-scale operations and they were instead used as ground infantry. Bomber of Nagasaki Virtually everybody knows the name of the B-29 bomber that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima - the Enola Gay - but how about the one that dropped the atomic bomb on Nagasaki 3 days later? This B-29 was known as "Bock's Car", and Nagasaki was not its original target - the intended target city was Kokura, which escaped as the bomber was under orders to attack only a clear target and the city was shrouded in smog at the time. Nagasaki was the first alternative target city. Nazi Salute Despite what you might see in the movies, the regular German Army (Wehrmacht) did not usually use the Nazi salute. Only after the July 1944 attempt on Hitler's life were they forced to use the Nazi salute as standard. D Day Although many people refer to the Allied D-Day landings in Normandy as "Operation Overlord", the naval assault was actually called "Operation Neptune". The landings were originally known as Overlord, but in September 1943 the codename was changed to Neptune, and Overlord from then on was used to refer to the general Allied strategy in northwestern Europe.
And the D in D-Day stands for Day!
Suicide Ships You've heard of suicide or kamikaze bombers - but how about suicide battleships!? On 7th April 1945 off the island of Okinawa the Japanese battleship Yamato, which had not been given fuel for its return journey home, arrived with several other ships to attack the American fleet. The Yamato, which was one of the two largest battleships ever built, and their accompanying ships, were sunk by American aircraft before they reached their target. Himmler Heinrich Himmler, the evil head of the Nazi SS, was once a chicken farmer. Mussolini Benito Mussolini, during the First World War, was an editor for an Italian newspaper partly financed by the British and French. At that time they were an opponent of the Germanic Central Powers (he also served in the Italian army until wounded). Stalin's Name Stalin's original name was Josif Djugashvili. In 1913 they began using the pseudonym Stalin meaning "Man of Steel". ----- ad ------------- Our Actual Exams and Actualtests gre exam provide you 100% pass guarantee.

NBN Co does not have a “defined operating cost” for each access technology in its multi-technology mix, and claims any attempt to apportion costs now would be “misleading”.
The network builder said in answers to questions on notice at supplementary budget estimates hearings that information on infrastructure-related OpEx per premises “is not available”.
“NBN does not yet have a defined operating cost per premise metric for reporting actual costs incurred for respective access network technologies at this stage of MTM deployment,” it said.
“Further, our current operating costs include amounts that are not variable in nature (eg costs associated with the transit network and leases that also support future network rollout).
“Allocating these current costs to a sub-scale volume of premises would result in a misleading cost per premise average at this stage of deployment.”
The refusal to break down operating costs makes it difficult to understand the long-term cost of NBN Co's technology choices, but also provides less fuel for those still agitating for a return to fibre-to-the-premises.
Leaked internal documents last year pointed to operational costs of the FTTN network being 67 percent more than for FTTP, and 25 percent more for HFC, according to University of Melbourne Laureate Emeritus Professor Rod Tucker.
“Over the lifetime of the network, this difference could amount to billions of dollars, greatly reducing the overall difference in costs between FTTN and FTTP,” Tucker said.
Richard Ferrers, a research data analyst at The Australian National Data Service (ANDS) at Monash University, has also analysed the various costs of the FTTP and FTTN rollouts, using some of the same leaked OpEx numbers.
“To the extent the operating costs and revenue numbers are correct, they shift the value of FTTP and FTTN, towards favouring FTTP,” Ferrers said.
Labor's broadband spokesperson, Michelle Rowland, said in a statement yesterday that it was "unfathomable that NBN Co cannot answer basic questions about its operating expenditure for different access networks".
One of the long-term costs for the FTTN network is the maintenance of the copper assets. Financial analysts have previously put that cost at between $700 million and $1 billion a year.
While NBN Co did not provide any OpEx numbers to questions on notice, it did provide the rollout costs per premise, which maintain an upfront cost of $4400 per premises for FTTP versus $2300 for FTTN or HFC.
It declined to detail the cost of fibre-to-the-basement installations, citing commercial in-confidence owing to the “competition” it faces from TPG on that portion of the build.
NBN Co also said it expected to update its three-year construction plan before the end of 2016, as well as improve the searchability of coverage maps on its website.
We learn the most about someone's character not from what they do when they know others are watching but from what they do when they think they aren't.
We've learned an awful lot of troubling things about Mitt Romney recently. First, their sweeping, closed-door condemnation of President Barack Obama's supporters revealed the disdain they have for half the population they hope to serve. Then, the limited tax returns Romney selectively released confirmed that he's willing to share information about the time he's been in the public eye and running for president, but not the time they were running the corporation they tout as their sole qualifying credential for the highest office in the land.
When they thought no one was listening, Romney accused 47 percent of Americans of not taking responsibility for their lives, painting them as lounging in government dependency — a conclusion they reached because, for various legitimate reasons, they are exempt from paying federal income taxes.
Romney stands not only on shaky ethical grounds in making that indiscriminate generalization — he's also on flimsy factual footing. The 47 percent Romney derides as self-pitying “victims” includes seniors who live on a fixed income thanks to the Social Security they paid into and earned over a lifetime of hard work, our troops in combat zones and veterans who have fought for our country. It includes students studying to get the skills that will win them the jobs of the future and decent Americans actively looking for work because their jobs were outsourced by companies such as those Romney specialized in developing. Most of them pay plenty of payroll, property, local and state taxes.
None of these Americans is looking for a handout or shortcut. That Romney waited until they thought all the cameras and microphones were off before insulting the millions they belittled as “those people” unworthy of their concern calls into question their judgment, leadership and fitness for the public trust. If you're not willing to fight for every American, you don't deserve to represent any of them.
The second lesson we learned came at another time Romney thought no one was looking: They released their 2011 tax returns late on a Friday afternoon in the hopes of making the smallest news splash possible.
What was they trying to hide? Perhaps that, despite their tough talk on China, they profited from investments in a state-owned Chinese oil company and a video company known for pirating copyrighted content. Or that, despite calling Russia our “No. 1 geopolitical foe” and their fiery rhetoric against Iran, they invested in Russia's state-owned oil giant, which does business with Iran. Or that the candidate with the slogan “Believe in America” has been betting against the U.S. dollar by buying foreign currencies and keeping their investments in the Caymans and Bermuda. Or maybe they were hoping no one would notice that they paid just 14 percent of their $14 million income, a rate lower than many middle-class families pay.
Romney's pre-weekend release was one big head fake, hoping that the measly two years of tax returns they have released would distract us from remembering that they still haven't released a single one from before their candidacy. It would be far more helpful for voters to see what tax loopholes they were exploiting and which foreign accounts they were favoring over American institutions when they didn't know he'd ever have to reveal them. And since Romney likes to divide people based on what income tax rate they pay, it would certainly help to know their own — and whether they include themselves in the 47 percent they think aren't pulling their weight.
Here's what we know: Romney has these records ready — they gave John McCain 23 years' worth before they lost the vice presidential nomination to Sarah Palin and gave their accountants 20 years so they could release a CliffsNotes version that voters have no way of verifying. We also already know this self-described “severely conservative” man takes some pretty liberal deductions; now we know that includes writing off half of the country.
The offensive comments Romney hoped would stay private and the remaining tax returns that he's still withholding from the American people are important because they are windows into the character, values and priorities of someone who could drive our nation's economic policy.
Obama wants to eliminate the special loopholes Romney exploits but that are unavailable to most Americans; Romney, of course, wants to protect them. Romney also plans to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for even more tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires. They may mock redistributive policies, but Romney is proposing the largest redistribution of wealth from the bottom to the top in American history.
Recognizing he's president of all Americans, Obama has a different plan: Everyone should pay their fair share so we can responsibly reduce the deficit in a balanced way and make investments in areas proven to fuel growth from the middle out, such as education, jobs, innovation and energy. It's a plan the president believes in and has made public for all to see. He's the only candidate in this race who believes those should be one and the same.

U.S. Flies B-2 Stealth Bombers Over South Korea Amid Escalating Tensions With The North
The United States flew two B-2 stealth bombers over South Korea on Thursday and dropped dummy munitions on an island range. The U.S. action was part of planned joint military exercises with South Korea — but it comes at a time of heightened tensions on the peninsula. Robert Siegel talks to Tom Bowman.
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Audie Cornish.
ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:
And I'm Robert Siegel.
The United States flew two B-2 stealth bombers over South Korea today and dropped dummy munitions on an island range. The drill called Foal Eagle was part of joint military exercises between the U.S. and South Korea. It comes at a time of heightened tensions on the peninsula. Just last month, North Korea completed its third nuclear test. And in recent weeks, the North's new leader has repeatedly threatened the U.S. with attack.
Earlier today at the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel addressed the situation.
SECRETARY CHUCK HAGEL: I think they're very provocative actions and belligerent tone has ratcheted up the danger and we have to understand that reality.
SIEGEL: NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman joins us now. And, Tom, today's B-2 maneuvers come after other U.S. bombers, B-52s, also took part in joint exercises. Is this a case of saber-rattling on the part of the U.S.?
TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: You know, Robert, Secretary Hagel was asked about that today. They denied the U.S. is being provocative in any way. They and General Martin Dempsey, chairperson of Joint Chiefs, pointed out that, listen, these exercises have been going on for many years, decades. And the B-2 and the B-52s have been used in past years. And these exercises largely have been ignored in the United States. Of course, not in the Korean peninsula.
What's new here, Robert, is that you have a different political situation. You have two new leaders on the Korean peninsula.
SIEGEL: Those two new leaders, of course, North Korea's young leader Kim Jong-un and South Korea's new and first female President Park Guen-hye.
BOWMAN: That's right. And both have been talking tough. You have Kim threatening war against the United States. They pulled the hotline between North and South Korea. They put their troops on high alert and you also have President Park, they said that North Korea's, quote, "path to survival" is to give up its nuclear weapons program and missile program. And they said that last week during the third anniversary of the sinking of the South Korean ship that was believed sunk by a North Korean submarine. And they spoke at a cemetery where nearly 50 dead South Korean sailors are buried from that incident.
SIEGEL: But, Tom, why would the U.S. fly bombers and drop ammunition? Wouldn't that simply make this tense situation even more tense?
BOWMAN: Right. Well, you know, again, they were asked about that. They said it's not provocative, but clearly on the Korean peninsula, this is causing problems. The North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is ratcheting up their rhetoric. There's a lot of worry among South Koreans about this. And also, the Americans have come up with something called a combined counter-provocation plan.
I asked General Dempsey about that today and they really didn't answer what it's all about. But what they did say was - what we're told is the whole point of this is to pull back, to make sure that things don't get worse, that things don't escalate.
SIEGEL: OK. thanks, Tom.
BOWMAN: You're welcome.
SIEGEL: NPR Pentagon correspondent, Tom Bowman.

When I started my business, I chose to make my mark by taking an imaginative approach in an industry where traditional communication strategies were the norm. In the earlier days, we did this by using video as a means to pitch. Nowadays, we call that content creation. As a former TV producer, I knew that playing it safe could achieve short-term success, but I knew it wouldn't put my agency in a position to see the bigger picture. Helping my clients succeed means constantly riding the waves of moving media, creative disruption and partnering with leading experts to unlock turn-key solutions.
To stay ahead of the curve, our company recently partnered with a firm specializing in the emotional intelligence of artificial intelligence (AI). By doing so, we are able to use AI to tell us the emotions behind brands. Branding professionals are noticing the importance of how people feel about a product, place or person, and "likes" or clicks aren't always the main indicators.
The Brand Experience Is Evolving
Even though human beings are already surrounded by AI in many ways, we can expect to see more of it: A report by Accenture is projecting AI to double economic growth rates by 2035. Now, more than ever, the landscape has evolved. What was once a forum where advertisers, marketers and traditional storytellers could easily determine their next move with standard research, the success of communications agencies highly depends on their ability to make the brand experience even more personalized.
To do this successfully, agencies need to understand the emotions behind brands and how people feel toward them. Communications used to be predictive: We could post at a certain time of the day to optimize views online, but because algorithms and growth hacking are changing at such a rapid rate, this is no longer possible. The plug-and-play approach is no longer sufficient.
Embracing new technologies helps us make the most of the data and analytics to build insights on optimal brand targeting. The goal is to achieve a better understanding of what customers want beyond simple analysis of emotions, and make online communication appear more human.
I recently sat down with Micah Brown, CEO of Centiment, the firm we recently partnered with, to discuss how communications agencies can take advantage of AI. Here's what I learned:
Understand It
Even though some AI software has been around for years, AI as a whole is still very new to many companies. “For a long time, communications and marketing agencies didn't need to think about AI because the tools weren't really there. Now, the same companies that don't think about it (AI) will simply get left behind,” said Brown. AI is highly technical and expertise in the field is needed in order to effectively implement it, so communications agencies might want to consider partnering with firms that have AI competencies.
Experiment With It
All forms of AI need to go through training. “Communications agencies need to go through a beta testing phase before implementing AI in their strategies,” said Brown, who recommends conducting beta testing internally first, where a sampling of the product is tested in an environment that doesn't impact clients.
Help Clients Optimally Use It
From its ability to improve processes and personalize marketing strategies, to its ability to allow micro-segmentation in mass communications, the magnitude of possibilities through the use of AI is significant. Within this magnitude, however, communications agencies have to make smart decisions on how to optimally use it to support their clients. Decisions on planning communications strategies will still have to be spearheaded by humans no matter how intelligent machines become.
Mmmmm… coffee and chocolate, two of my favourite things.
Honeybee Soaps' rendition thereof is a fairly pleasant mix. It's heavier on the chocolate, and a bit light on the coffee IMHO, and overall not quite as sweet as I would have expected. Still, it works fairly well, coming off what I'd say is a medium strong mix, without too much in the way of fading.
The lather's the usual from Honeybee soaps; use a fair bit of water and some elbow grease and you'll wrest a decent balance of thickness and glide out of the soap. It's certainly good enough to get the job done.
8/10 Scent Pleasantness
8/10 Scent Strength
8/10 Lather Quality
All said, I think I'll give this a 7/10; it's good, but doesn't really stand out in any particular area.

Microsoft Edge officially came out of beta for Android devices last week, and already the popular browser has surpassed one million downloads, according to the Google Play Store.
Granted, people were able to download the beta from the store as well, but it only went into preview in October, so it is still a rather impressive feat for the app in such a short time. While we don't have exact numbers, the milestone is gleaned from Microsoft Edge breaking into the new category of "1 million to 5 million" downloads.
Unfortunately, there is no way to tell how popular the app is for iOS. It launched at the same time as the Android version, but Apple's TestFlight only allows 10,000 people to try an app while it is in beta, so it is likely that the browser app has not had as much adoption on iOS as on Android.
The browser, designed for Windows 10 compatibility, has some cool features including one that allows work that you have done on your mobile device to be carried over to your PC. The app will also sync your data across all devices, as well as allowing voice search of the web.

Story highlights James Everett Dutschke faces unrelated child molestation charges
Dutschke has been charged with possessing and using ricin as a weapon
On Tuesday, authorities dropped charges against another Mississippi man
The FBI said letters sent to Obama and two others tested positive for the toxin ricin
A Tupelo, Mississippi, man has been charged with possession and use of a biological agent as a weapon in connection with an investigation into ricin-tainted letters sent to President Barack Obama and others, federal authorities said Saturday.
The federal charges against James Everett Dutschke come days after prosecutors dropped charges against Paul Kevin Curtis in the same case amid Curtis' claims they were framed.
Dutschke, 41, is expected to appear in U.S. District Court in Oxford on Monday before Magistrate Judge S. Allan Alexander, according to a statement released by the U.S. attorney in the Northern District of Mississippi.
Dutschke was arrested without incident at their home early Saturday, FBI spokesperson Deborah Madden said. Earlier this week, agents searched Dutschke's residence and former martial arts studio, though it's not clear what they found.
The arrest of Dutschke is the latest twist in a bizarre case that began earlier this month when federal investigators arrested Curtis, an Elvis impersonator from Corinth, Mississippi, for allegedly sending letters containing ricin, a deadly toxin, to Obama, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi; and Sadie Holland, a judge in Lee County.
The letters touched off anxieties in Washington and elsewhere in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings. Authorities later said the Boston bombings and the ricin-tainted letters were unrelated.
The revelation of the ricin-laden letters recalled the fear that gripped the country in the days following the September 11, 2001, terror attacks when anthrax-laced letters were sent to U.S. senators and journalists.
Curtis cleared
The FBI said the recent letters tested positive for ricin, a toxin derived from castor beans that has no known antidote. No illnesses have been reported.
Prosecutors on Tuesday dropped the charges against Curtis after their attorney, Christi McCoy, told authorities that they believed their client was framed, possibly by Dutschke.
As Curtis, 45, walked out of jail, FBI agents were searching Dutschke's home and the studio where they practiced martial arts.
At the time, Dutschke told CNN affiliate WMC-TV that they agreed to the FBI search "to help clear my name."
"I had absolutely nothing to do with those letters," they said.
'I am KC'
The letters read, in part: "To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance."
They were signed "I am KC and I approve this message," a source told CNN.
Each letter had a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark and no return address.
Curtis, a self-styled activist known as Kevin Curtis, has used similar signoffs on letters and social media posts, their attorney said.
"I do believe that someone who was familiar and is familiar with Kevin just simply took their personal information and did this to him," attorney McCoy told CNN.
Curtis told CNN that they didn't even know what ricin was until they got out of jail and looked it up on the Internet.
When police stormed their home and arrested them last week, Curtis said an investigator asked them about ricin, and Curtis said they responded, "Well, I don't eat rice, and I don't have any rice in the house."
Online feud
Dutschke's attorney, Lori Basham, has said their client used to work for Curtis' brother, but the two have had no contact since 2010. Basham declined to comment on Dutschke's arrest Saturday.
The relationship between the two men is at best hazy, with each publicly accusing the other of bad behavior.
Curtis has said that while Dutschke worked for their brother, the two talked about collaborating on the publication of a book, but later had a falling out.
They have accused Dutschke of stalking them online, a claim the former taekwondo instructor has denied.
Dutschke told reporters this week that they did not know Curtis well.
"He's just a little nutty. I don't have a relationship with him," they said.
"I've met them two times in person, and then there was a third time we sent e-mails back and forth."
In the e-mail exchange, according to Dutschke, they accused Curtis of posting a fake membership certificate for MENSA, the high-IQ organization. Curtis acknowledged that they posted a fake certificate, but said they did it to catch Dutschke stalking them online.
Ties to letters?
Authorities have not said how they linked the letters to Dutschke, who appears to have personal ties to at least two of the three people who were sent letters.
In 2007, Dutschke failed in their bid as a Republican to defeat Democratic state representative Steve Holland, whose mother, a judge, received one of the ricin-tainted letters.
"We just want to move on," Holland told CNN, adding that they wanted justice for their mother.
"This could have been devastating. Mom could have died had this taken the worst-case scenario."
Dutschke also has said they have met Wicker.
Other charges
Dutschke, meanwhile, faces molestation charges in an unrelated case.
According to a grand jury indictment handed down this month and obtained by CNN, they are accused of molesting three girls under the age of 16. The accusations go back as far as 2007, according to the indictment.
Dutschke has repeatedly denied the charges in interviews with local media, and they pleaded innocent in court this month.
They closed their taekwondo studio after the allegations were made public.
Original Babylon 5 Interactive Information Kit
Babylon 5's use of the Internet began in 1991 with the creator of the series, J. Michael Straczynski, who participated in a number of Internet venues to discuss elements of their work with their fans, including the rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5 Usenet newsgroup, where they continued to communicate as late as March 2007.[1] [2][3][4] This flow of information and feedback had a substantial impact on Babylon 5, as well as Straczynski's other shows and their fan base. This interaction pre-dated the coining of the term "blog", but is functionally similar.
Internet usage [ edit ]
Forums [ edit ]
Babylon 5 was one of the first shows to employ Internet marketing to create publicity among online readers far in advance of the airing of the pilot episode. Straczynski participated in online communities on Usenet (in the rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5.moderated newsgroup), and the GEnie and Compuserve systems before the web came together as it exists today. Straczynski had long participated in many online forums since the 1980s, and is widely credited as being the first notable artist and celebrity to interact with fans online, even before the advent of the world wide web.
This free interaction with their fans was not without its problems. A third-season episode ("Passing Through Gethsemane") was originally developed a year earlier in 1994 but had to be "scuttled"[6] because a fan posted a story idea on GEnie that matched the plot of the episode. The story was not put back into the production pipeline until Straczynski could obtain a signed legal release from the fan. The moderated Usenet group was created as a consequence, specifically to filter out story ideas. Straczynski also asked fans not to engage in fan-fiction while the show was in production, and most fans complied with this request.[8]
On rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5.moderated, Straczynski regularly discussed with fans the process of creating and producing the show, the meaning of the work, and the development of the plot. They confirmed or denied fan theories and interpretations of the show, and answered questions – though often cryptically. In November 1995, Straczynski temporarily left the newsgroup due to an increasing number of flames, but returned in December when a process was put in place to filter the threads that reached him.
Fan sites [ edit ]
Babylon 5 also inspired a number of fan sites. One of the first was The Lurker's Guide to Babylon 5. It was noticed by The Washington Post and acknowledged by Straczynski in a Season 5 DVD commentary. Its root URL at the time, Hyperion, was used on the show as the name of a heavy cruiser.[10] It also received early news from the show's copyright holders.[8]
Internet marketing [ edit ]
In 1995, Warner Bros. started the Official Babylon 5 web site which was hosted on the now defunct Pathfinder portal. In September 1995 they hired a fan, Troy Rutter, to take over the site and move it not only to its own domain name at www.babylon5.com, but also to oversee the "Keyword B5" area on America Online. The fans continued to play an important role in the development of the series and the online support campaign is credited with helping persuade former PTEN station owners to carry the fourth season of the show in 1996.
Over the course of the series, Warner Bros. encouraged the use of pictures and images on fan web sites, and eventually created a home-page community called AcmeCity where users could create a homepage using logos and graphics without fear of lawsuits. Also during this time, Warner Bros. executive Jim Moloshok created and distributed electronic trading cards to help advertise the series.[11]
A contest was conducted in conjunction with Sound Source Interactive called the Mystery Alien Sweepstakes, with the grand-prize to portray an alien on the show.[12]
Fan influences [ edit ]
The Babylon 5 pilot, The Gathering, originally featured music by former Police drummer Stewart Copeland. After B5 was greenlighted Straczynski solicited suggestions on GEnie for a replacement composer. After some suggested Tangerine Dream member Christopher Franke, that musician was eventually hired.

Hudgens, a fan of the show, and later the Babylon 5 section sysop on GEnie, to create promotional music videos for the show after seeing the original one Hudgens did on their own. They collaborated on a total of eight, and Straczynski would often use one as their introduction at convention appearances. Straczynski commissioned the fifth one ( Welcome to the Third Age ) to be their pitch reel to sell the show to TNT. [14]

Straczynski commissioned the fifth one ( ) to be their pitch reel to sell the show to TNT. The spatial location of the B5 station itself is stated as “Grid Epsilon coordinates: 470/18/22.” This came about because Straczynski was touched by an outpouring of support from the GEnie Science Fiction and Fantasy RoundTable (SFRT) community in regards to a potential letter-writing campaign that turned out not to be needed after all. They were still grateful, however, and asked how they could show their appreciation. An SFRT participant suggested placing the station at the 3D spatial coordinates corresponding to the GEnie Page (#470, for original SFRT), CATegory (#18, for Non-Trek SFTV Series), and TOPic (#22, for Babylon 5) of the then-only official B5 Topic on GEnie (the strange capitalization of CATegory and TOPic refers to the fact that GEnie was command-line-based and allowed commands to be abbreviated to three letters). Straczynski agreed and added that info to the series bible used by episode writers. The “Grid Epsilon” part was their own touch, based on the first two initials (which were usually both capitalized) of GEnie itself [since it was originally a GE (General Electric) property]. [15]
B5 fans on GEnie referred to themselves as "Grid Epsilon Irregulars".
A fictional chemical substance called Quantium-40 was mentioned after Straczynski conducted a contest online to name the substance. [10]
A Fresh Aire Restaurant waiter was named David after David Strauss, who came up with the name Quantium-40. [10] Another character was named after a fan who helped raise money when one of the actors had not been paid for their conference attendance.
Another character was named after a fan who helped raise money when one of the actors had not been paid for their conference attendance. Babylon 5 fans on the Internet have popularized the <*> symbol ("The ASCII Jumpgate") as a sort of "secret handshake" to recognize each other online. In 1994, a birthday card for Straczynski was sent around the U.S. to many of the avid posters on the rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon-5 newsgroup. While the card was being circulated, clues were given on the newsgroup, denoted by the symbol <*> , and the jumpgate symbol continued to be used thereafter, even appearing on fan-produced jewelry.[16]

The citizens of Ireland, considered one of the most conservative and most religious countries in Europe, voted overwhelmingly on Friday to legalize same-sex marriages. Thus Ireland joins at least 16 countries including Spain, France, and Denmark and 36 U.S. states where gay and lesbian couples can marry.
The result of the Irish referendum is the best illustration of the change in popular attitudes toward the LGBT community. Ireland has always been considered a conservative country, and until 1993 homosexuality was a crime. The lack of substantial resistance to the idea of same-sex marriage demonstrates the readiness of the society and its institutions — even the most conservative of them, like the Catholic Church — to accept homosexuality without seeing it as something that to change or to deny.
Israel is part of this global trend. Israelis, like the Irish, are increasingly open to and welcoming of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. This can be seen not only in the growing number of celebrities and public figures who are open about their sexual orientation and no longer suffer the stress of concealing who they are, but also and above all in the many Israeli households that are headed by LGBT parents; by the pride parades that have nearly become national holidays in which everyone participates and by the many draft laws that have been submitted with the aim of securing equal civil and economic rights for LGBT Israelis. While many of them have yet to become law, they are nonetheless paving the LGBT community's way into the heart of the national consensus.
It would not be going too far to say that in 2015 Israel, the recognition of LGBT rights is the political norm, shared by all the parties except the religious ones — and even in these parties there are individuals who are open and sympathetic to the issue. The latest election season proved this, when antiquated anti-gay marriage remarks by figures in Habayit Hayehudi chased away potential voters, especially young ones. Likud, in contrast, took care to present a pro-LGBT agenda, and senior party figures such as Benjamin Netanyahu, Moshe Ya'alon and Miri Regev repeatedly spoke out against homophobia and for equal rights.
The Israeli public is largely ready to move forward on pro-LGBT legislation and equal rights for the community, chief among them the right to marry. In Israel, marriage is a religious institution, and as same-sex marriage is prohibited, as is heterosexual marriage in a wide variety of circumstances. The LGBT breakthrough is another reason to introduce civil marriage in Israel, as in the rest of the West, in order to free groups and individuals from the tyranny of laws that are irrelevant to them and to offer them genuine justice and equality instead.
Fear Factor
The impact of armed drones during the decade-plus of this intense global counterterrorism campaign is hard to overestimate: Without operational commanders and visionary leaders, terror groups decay into locally focused threats, or disappear altogether. Targeted strikes against al Qaeda leaders and commanders in the years immediately after 9/11 deprived the group of the time and stability required to plot a major strike. But the London subway attacks in July 2005 illustrated the remaining potency of al Qaeda's core in the tribal areas of Pakistan. The threat was fading steadily. But not fast enough.
So-called signature strikes — in which target selection is based not on identification of an individual but instead on patterns of behavior or unique characteristics that identify a group — accelerated this decline for simple reasons. Targeting leadership degrades a small percentage of a diffuse terror group, but developing the tactical intelligence required to locate an individual precisely enough to stage a pinpoint strike, in a no-man's land half a world away, is time-consuming and difficult. And it's not a perfect science; the leaders of groups learn over time how to operate more securely. Furthermore, these leaders represent only a fraction of the threat: Osama bin Laden might have been the public face of al Qaeda, but they were supported by a web of document-forgers, bombmakers, couriers, trainers, ideologues, and others. They made up the bulk of al Qaeda and propelled the apparatus that planned the murder of innocents. Bin Laden was the revolutionary leader, but it was the troops who executed their vision.
Signature strikes have pulled out these lower-level threads of al Qaeda's apparatus — and that of its global affiliates — rapidly enough that the deaths of top leaders are now more than matched by the destruction of the complex support structure below them. Western conceptions of how organizations work, with hierarchal structures driven by top-level managers, do not apply to al Qaeda and its affiliates. These groups are instead conglomerations of militants, operating independently, with rough lines of communication and fuzzy networks that cross continents and groups. They are hard to map cleanly, in other words. Signature strikes take out whole swaths of these network sub-tiers rapidly — so rapidly that the groups cannot replicate lost players and their hard-won experience. The tempo of the strikes, in other words, adds sand to the gears of terror organizations, destroying their operational capability faster than the groups can recover.
There are other rationales for these attacks, though. Part of the reason signature strikes have become so prominent in this global counterterror war is, simply put, geography. Local terrorist groups only become international threats if they have leadership that can execute a broad, globalist vision, and if that leadership has the time and space to plot without daily distractions from armies and security services — as in safe havens like Yemen, Somalia, the Sahel, and the tribal areas of Pakistan. These are exactly the places where the United States cannot apply conventional force and where local governments lack the capability or will to counter the threat. Exactly the places where drones offer an option to eviscerate a growing terror threat that has a dispersed, diffuse hierarchy. The places where signature strikes have proven effective.
With more capable security partners, the brutal destruction from drones above might come from more conventional operations on the ground. But, by definition, safe havens aren't penetrable by capable security services.
There is an intangible factor that reinforces the effectiveness of signature strikes: the fear factor, coupled with the suspicions and paranoia that result from organizations searching desperately among their ranks to find out who is providing the Americans information so detailed that we can wreak such havoc over such a long period of time. Time and again, intelligence has clearly told us that the adversary dreads these operations — lethal strikes that come anytime, anywhere, and that eliminate entire swaths of organizations. And these same organizations then turn around and further degrade their operational capability by engaging in savage hunts for leaks.
Despite such success, questions about how we should employ them — or whether we should use them at all — are coming to dominate debates about signature strikes. When do they end? And is it appropriate to strike groups of people not because we can identify a dangerous individual terrorist among them, but instead simply because a cluster of people bears clear hallmarks — the "signature" — that is associated with a terror group. This emerging debate will be colored, rightly, by the fact that, in just a decade, drone technology has proliferated. The technology and its use have far outpaced the development of policy that balances national security, morality, and the certainty that whatever precedent we set will be used, and abused, by the rogues and despots who no doubt will acquire this capability.
Before the pendulum swings too far in the other direction, though, away from the unquestionably aggressive use of drones by two consecutive presidents and toward a model that imposes tight limits, we are going to have to answer a simple question or two: When the president receives information that a new group — maybe not a terror organization, but an evolving militant group — is plotting to strike America at home or abroad, what do we do? If we strike too soon, we risk alienating a local population and increasing its motivation to target New York. If we strike too late, a nascent group of violent extremists will become operational, a lesson we learned too well 12 years ago. So take off the table the 20th-century notion that drones will become part of a more conventional military structure; they won't. The question for the 21st century is easy to state but hard to answer: Given the lessons of 9/11 and Iraq, when should a president choose preemption? And where? What are the rules for this new war?
The youth vote is crucial in any election, and while Trump is busy crafting Facebook-ready attack ads based on Pokémon GO, Hill is appealing to the youngs with a game of their own. It is profoundly, jaw-droppingly dull. Hillary 2016, which launched yesterday, puts the player in the appropriately grim surroundings of their own "campaign HQ", a second-floor office with eight chairs, one couch and no staff. By completing daily challenges a highly motivated member of the American electorate can earn "stars", which really could have had a cooler name, like "HillCoins" or maybe just "points". (To be clear, "points" are also earned in-game, though it's not immediately clear how, or what they're used for.)
Today's daily challenges include: Syncing your own calendar to the campaign, answering questions for a quiz called Trump Or False — which makes uncredited mention of that bloviating psychopath retweeting a Mussolini (thanks Gawker!) — or committing to vote for Hill. There does not appear to be any legally binding agreement to A) actually cast your vote as such or B) use your own name. I signed up Bernie Sanders, but feel free to fill in, say, Ivana Trump or the pink-haired girl from Degrassi: Next Class.
But what oh what does one do with these stars? At present the options are limited to upgrading campaign HQ furniture. A starter lamp can become a modern lamp for a mere 25 stars. I couldn't afford the brick accent wall and so opted for a standard fridge. There's no XP. No levelling. No sense of difficulty, progress or reward. Just the chance to remodel empty — but remarkably spacious — virtual offices space.
There are a few purchasable things that crossover into the real world, a world that allowed this app to be created in the first place. Among them are 20 per cent off Hillary merch (120 stars), access to "special campaign updates" (200 stars) and an unknown souvenir signed by the future president themselves (325 stars). In truth I had assumed I was already in for several lifetimes of "special campaign updates" when signing up for the app with Gmail.
Gamifying a contentious election makes sense in principle, but the execution misses almost every hallmark of the concept popularly understood as "fun". On the flip side, the Hillary 2016 servers appear to be struggling a great deal less than Pokémon GO.

A large bitcoin mining facility in Thailand went up in flames this week, destroying the five-megawatt operation and disrupting the crypto-currency's entire network.
Bitcoin is a digital currency that has no central bank or government backing it. Without any authority to print money, bitcoins are created through a process called “mining,” which rewards networks of computers for solving complex puzzles that keep the network running. The more computing power, the more bitcoins that can be won, which is what this low-key farm in Thailand was designed to do.
The hash rate is the amount of computing power in use in the entire bitcoin computing network. Here's what happened after the fire:
All that computing power produces a lot of heat. Local media reported that the fire at the facility in Thailand, run by a group called Cowboyminers, raged for more than half an hour. As featured on Coindesk's Flickr account, here is the facility before the blaze:

And here it is after:

The cause of the fire is as yet unconfirmed. But Gizmodo suggests it could have spread due to flammable acoustic foam and suggested that the facility probably lacked in a sprinkler system that most high-end data centers in the US would have as standard.
There's a riot down in Texas and it's not about women's health or racist ranchers; kids are trashing their school to free themselves from oppressive dress codes!
See, life can still surprise us.
Like the non-pants debate of Evanston, Illinois where girls are being penalized for wearing leggings — because how will their male classmates control themselves? — students at Texas' Duncanville High aren't into their school's strict dress code either. In fact, according to Time, over 160 students were suspended just last week for not following the clothing rules.
The kids who were sent home were told they could not stay in class for a range of violations: not wearing belts, forgetting their name tags, wearing the wrong colored shirt or having stubble on their faces. One student was even told that an official school spirit shirt was out of dress code because it didn't have a collar.
But shit got real when the kids kicked off an impromptu protest, flipping over trash cans, fighting and running down the halls like Judd Nelson in The Breakfast Club, yelling “fuck dress code.” Police were called in to calm the teen mafia but the students were far from finished.

The day after trying the Puffy approach for change, the students enacted a Martin Luther King Jr. style sit-in and someone began a Change.org petition to push back against the dress code.
The Duncanville Dress Code Riots, as they will now be known, follow the Evanston Middle School Leggings Truthers and point to the ridiculousness of all of these rules. If educators are spending so much time worrying about collars and spandex, who's teaching the class?
The "Miracle at the Meadowlands." The Declaration of Independence. The Citywide Special. Pretzels. And of course, SEPTA.
Those are a few of the Philadelphia images conjured up in the new theme song released for Pope Francis' upcoming visit to the city.
Referring to Pope Francis as 'Frankie da Pope,' the new tune is from Keys to the Moon, the moniker for 34-year-old Mike Connor, a Brewerytown resident.
Connor, a former Catholic altar boy, is a puppeteer for children at the Please Touch Museum, where they also design educational content.
In their free time, they like to write and perform silly songs, which prompted their mother to prod them about penning a papal ballad.
"So a few days ago, my mother texted me asking why no one has written a song about the pope," Connor said in an email. "Obviously she's baiting me - and I fell for it hook, line, and sinker.
When asked about their voice sounding strangely similar to the voice of Charlie Day, aka Charlie from 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,' Connor said they had never heard that before.
"I've gotten the Tom Waits comparison before from a few people," Connor said. "Either way, I take it as a very generous compliment."
"Philadelphia: a tough town in need of a hero," reads the description, and the song takes an uber-dramatic, humorous take on the papal visit, portraying "Frankie" as a beacon of light for a city waiting for one.
Take a listen here:
In addition to their role with the museum (which is not affiliated with the song, they stress), Connor is the owner of and performer for a local improv comedy group called the N Crowd.
You can catch their show every Friday night at 8 p.m. at the Actor's Center located at 257 N. 3rd St, and you can check out more of Connor's music here.
Baum's mother, Bobbi Westergard, contends the school covered skin on some girls in the photos and left the photos of girls in similar outfits unaltered. "There's really not any rhyme or reason to why they chose the girls they chose to edit and who they left alone," Westergard said.
Kimberly Montoya, a sophomore whose white tank top grew a pair of matching sleeves, told NBC News they would have appreciated a verbal heads-up on photo day so that they could change into a school-approved outfit of their choosing.
Some other Utah districts give students the option to change and come back for a retake if their clothes are deemed inappropriate. “We make an effort to address any issues of contrary-to-policy dress or grooming before pictures are taken for the yearbook,” Jeffrey P. Haney, a spokesperson for Canyons School District in Sandy, Utah, told NBC News.
Wasatch School District Superintendent Terry Shoemaker and high school yearbook adviser, Dallyn Zundel, did not reply to requests for comment from NBC News, but in a school statement, Wasatch officials admitted the yearbook staff wasn't “consistent” about outfits they decided to amend, and apologized for the oversight.
However, the school maintains that students in violation of the dress code “received warnings about inappropriate dress.”
Wasatch School District is located in Heber City, Utah, about 40 miles east of Salt Lake City. About two-thirds of the residents in Utah belong to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which encourages members to dress modestly in support of the belief that God commands people to be chaste.
Haylee Nielsen, a 15-year-old sophomore, told the AP that students who aren't Mormon can feel out of place at the school, adding that there is a big push for conservative attire.
The Wasatch School District dress code prompts students to dress modestly, stipulating that “modest” dress “includes covering shoulders, midriff, back, underwear and cleavage at all times.” The dress code also prohibits inappropriately short, tight, or revealing shorts, skirts, dresses, tank tops, halter or crop tops and spaghetti straps.
“Students were advised that photos may be edited if the student's dress did not follow the dress code,” the statement said, adding that a “large sign” displayed on photo day alerted students that photos would be edited to “correct” any dress code violation.
But Westergard said they accompanied their children to photo day and doesn't remember the sign that the school said was “plainly visible to all students.”
"There wasn't a sign," Westergard said, adding, "there wasn't anything sent out ahead of time that said 'dress code enforced.'"
Montoya said they didn't see a sign either, and the photos posted for students' approval two months before the yearbook was published didn't feature the add-ons.
"I feel like they're trying to shame you of your body. I can honestly say I wasn't showing anything that should have been covered."
“This action, a decision made by a few school officials with no apparent consultation with students or parents, is just unacceptable,” but the lack of notice wasn't the worst of the transgressions committed by the school, said Holly Mullen, executive director of the Rape Recovery Center in Salt Lake City.
In a statement issued by the Rape Recovery Center on Thursday, Mullen said that the type of action the school took to cover what they considered immodest clothing sends the message that responsibility lies with women to prevent men from acting in sexually inappropriate ways.
“It angers me, because I feel like they're trying to tell the girls the way you dress influences how people think about you,” Montoya said.
Rape victims often “blame themselves for wearing the wrong clothing or somehow encouraging men to rape them through their reckless behavior,” the statement said.
“We spend an inordinate amount of time with our clients trying to reverse this mentality among victims and our entire society,” Mullen said. “Short skirts and bare arms do not cause rape. Rapists cause rape.”
Mullen said the decision by “a few single-minded school leaders” reinforce the position that girls need to be controlled, and they called on the Wasatch County School District Board to investigate the incident and train administrators to act differently in the future.
Wasatch County School District is "evaluating the practice of photo editing,” the statement said, but school officials have not said that they will change the photo editing practice in coming years.
Victoria, Queen of England, had a profound influence on photography, starting with their first encounters with the medium as a young woman to their 60-year Diamond Jubilee portrait in 1897. Queen Victoria understood early on, what it would take the rest of the world many years later to appreciate; that photography was dual-purpose. It could be used as an artistic medium, or as an instrument of propaganda, chronicling war.
Over the course of their reign, Queen Victoria was photographed countless times from daguerreotypes to albumen silver prints. They were portrayed as a loyal wife, caring mother, grief-stricken widow and powerful ruler, but most of the images were kept private, not for public view.
Having reigned for 63 years, they held the longest ruling of any female monarch in history, and longer than any other British monarch did. During their sovereignty, they witnessed a “mini revolution” in the advances of science with Darwin's Theory of Evolution, communications, technology and industry with the building of railroads and the London Underground. Yet, of all the new technology, Queen Victoria was passionate about photography. Victoria was the first crowned head of England to have their entire life recorded in photographs, and their portraits became symbolic of an entire age.
The Getty Museum in Los Angeles presents A Royal Passion: Queen Victoria and Photography until June 8, 2014. The exhibit tracks the development of Victoria's understanding and implementation of photography. It explores the bond between the young queen and the new medium. Works from The Royal Collection include private portraits of the Royal family, rare daguerreotypes, and prints by William Henry Fox Talbot, Julia Margaret Cameron and Roger Fenton to name a few.
The story of the Queen Victoria is deeply interwoven with the origins of photography. They were approaching 20-years-old when photography first appeared on the streets in Paris by Louis-Jacques-Mande Daguerre. Then, William Henry Talbot introduced their version in London in 1839. Although both men's methods were different, they profoundly changed how we view the world, by recorded accounts.
The Queen and Prince Albert harmonized on many levels, and photography was no different. After their marriage, they were avid supporters of new technology and early British photography. They learned the process of creating a daguerreotype in their exclusively built royal dark room. By 1842, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert began avidly collecting photographs, daguerreotypes, calotypes and glass plates.
From there, the royal couple commissioned family portraits and surveys of the royal grounds, employing local photographers like J.J.E. Mayall and Roger Fenton, photographer of the Crimean War. They became patrons of the London Photographic Society, and attended exhibits that included the 1851 Great Exhibition at Crystal Palace in London. For many visitors, it was their first encounter with photography.
In 1852, a portrait was taken of the Queen and their children. However, the Queen viewed the execution of themselves as “horrid,” to such a degree that they “scratched out their face from the negative.” After that sitting, Queen Victoria was much more deliberate in any future portraits, taking into account their facial expression and body position.
Queen Victoria, according to the Royal Collection Trust, was particularly enthusiastic to acquire portraits of people from all social classes. Them album held pictures of seamstresses and cooks who worked for the Queen to British and European royalty.
In 1860, Victoria approved to have their portrait, together with members of the royal family, as “a series of cartes de viste,” with the purpose of influencing the public's view of the royal family. Visiting cards were already in vogue, but for the first time in history, the public had the opportunity to own a photographic portrait card of the Queen.
When Prince Albert died suddenly in 1861, Queen Victoria withdrew from public life. However, they continued to be photographed, but dressed in black as the queen in mourning. The public embraced the Queen and shared in their grief by purchasing images of the widowed Queen and the late prince.
When Queen Victoria was bestowed the title Empress of India, they assumed more power and responsibility. They felt that any future photographs should reflect their new position in defining the British Empire. Strategically, Queen Victoria assumed an imperial posture astutely. It was a contrast from their earlier, private photographs, but their image from 1893, became a lasting one.
With Queen Victoria and Prince Albert's support and benefaction, they contributed to the early advancement if photography and “were integral to its rise in popularity.” At the time of their death, Queen Victoria had amassed one of the earliest collections of more than 20,000 photographic images from pets, family and friends to early war photographs.

Brighton twice came from behind to defeat Dagenham & Redbridge and secure promotion to English football's second tier after a five-year absence.
Dagenham took the lead inside a minute through John Akinde, before two goals in as many minutes from Inigo Calderon and Glenn Murray sent Albion in front.
However a Jon Nurse goal and Danny Green's penalty put Dagenham 3-2 up.
But Liam Bridcutt then pulled Brighton level, before Ashley Barnes' 63rd-minute header sealed a remarkable win.
Albion's promotion is the first of Gus Poyet's managerial career and comes towards the end of Brighton's final season at the Withdean Stadium before they move to their new ground at Falmer.
Analysis Taking Brighton up to the Championship is a personal triumph for the highly likeable Poyet, who is now celebrating their first promotion as either player or manager Read more of Paul Fletcher's blog
Top of the table since late September, Brighton have not lost at home all season in the league and have won 10 of their last 11 fixtures to banish any thoughts of a nervous finish to their impressive campaign.
Tuesday's win sent them 16 points clear at the top of the division and Brighton can now clinch the League One title at Walsall on Saturday.
However, any thoughts of a comfortable victory against relegation-threatened Dagenham were quickly dispelled when Akinde's shot deflected beyond the helpless Casper Ankergren as the visiting side underlined their intention to spoil Albion's promotion party.
Having conceded just once in their previous four home fixtures, Brighton appeared momentarily stunned, while the expectant home fans were silenced.
Albion increased the tempo and started to pick holes in the Daggers defence, with Tony Roberts brilliantly tipping over a strike from Craig Noone while a long-range effort from Chris Wood smashed against the crossbar.
Soon afterwards full-back Calderon stabbed home a corner flicked on by Adam El-Abd to pull Brighton level.
A minute later, Murray headed home a cross from Noone despite the best efforts of Daggers defender Scott Doe to clear the ball off the line.
Poyet's team were suddenly in complete control, cutting open their opponents at will, but the pace of the game then dropped, allowing the visitors to gradually force their way back into the contest.
Ankergren saved superbly from a couple of Akinde efforts, while Romain Vincelot's effort from inside a congested penalty area flew over the crossbar as Daggers finished the half on top.
The away team's reward for their efforts came after the break when they scored twice in three minutes to once again turn the match on its head.
Nurse's strike deflected off Calderon and beyond Ankergren before El-Abd clumsily brought down Akinde, resulting in a penalty that Green slotted low into the bottom corner.
For the second time in the match, the vast majority of the crowd were stunned into silence but they were soon given encouragement when a Murray header struck the crossbar.
Bridcutt then equalised with a rasping strike that flew into the top corner before substitute Barnes headed home an Elliott Bennett corner with just about their first touch to put Albion 4-3 ahead.
Brighton still had to survive some anxious moments, notably a Green free-kick that Ankergren saved while Mark Arber's lob drifted wide.
But Poyet's side held on to become the first Football League team to secure promotion this season in the final evening match to be played at the Withdean Stadium.

Abstract
This report analyzes how far-right Islamophobic discourse has been mainstreamed with the election of President Donald J. Trump. Through qualitative research examining the rhetoric employed by the Trump campaign and subsequent administration, the report finds that senior Trump administration appointments share a common belief that Islam and Muslims are a danger to the United States. This view has been present in the far-right world of bloggers and pundits and ballooned following the horrific events of September 11th, 2001, but is now represented in the White House by key members of the Trump administration. Further, the Trump administration has already begun to enact its anti-Muslim and anti-Islam policies. The study finds that the 45th President and their administration's rhetoric and guidelines normalize Islamophobia thus creating an environment in which discriminatory policies targeting Muslims are legal.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A White House-commissioned task force recommended independent outside investigations of police use of deadly force on Monday, in a report following the fatal shooting by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri of an unarmed black teenager.
The task force recommendation, coupled with a call for police departments to submit data to the federal government on officer-involved shootings of civilians, was made in a review of policing practices across the United States.
It was prompted by what President Barack Obama has described as “simmering distrust” between police and communities they serve.
Other recommendations were that police should report on the racial demographics of their departments and the citizens they stop, in addition to establishing civilian oversight committees and seeking consent before conducting searches.
Obama charged the group of law enforcement officials, academics and advocates with evaluating policing after nationwide demonstrations protesting a grand jury's decision not to indict white Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson for last summer's fatal shooting of Michael Brown.
The Justice Department's investigations into Wilson and the Ferguson Police Department are expected to conclude soon. A separate report on that could come as soon as this week, the New York Times reported on Monday.
It will criticize police in Ferguson for unfairly targeting black residents with tickets and arrests, the Times said. It added that the upcoming report could lead to a civil rights lawsuit against Ferguson police unless officials are able to reach a settlement with the Justice Department.
The killing in Ferguson sparked outrage and sometimes violent protests in the St. Louis suburb. A national debate over the issue of race and police intensified after a New York City grand jury decided not to charge a white police officer for their role in the death of unarmed black man after they were placed in a chokehold.
In a meeting with members of the task force on Monday, Obama encouraged local officials to implement the guidelines.
“We have a great opportunity coming out of some great conflict and tragedy to really transform how we think about community-law enforcement relations so that everybody feels safer,” Obama said.
They also said they would ask the Justice Department to expand its funding for community policing to incentivize departments through grants.
Enforcing the task force's other guidelines will depend on whether Washington will fund police department grants that will hold recipients accountable, said Kanya Bennett, legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union.
The jihadi groups clearly seek to create an Islamic emirate combining the Gaza Strip and Sinai. Abbas might thank Israel for its presence in the West Bank -- a presence that allows them and their government to be something other than infidel cannon fodder for the jihadis.
Mahmoud Abbas and the leaders of the Palestinian Authority (PA) can continue to talk all they want about a Palestinian state that would be established in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. But when ISIS-inspired groups are active in Gaza and there are no signs that the Hamas regime is weakening, it is rather difficult to imagine a Palestinian state.
The report said that terrorists wanted by the Egyptian authorities were admitted to the Gaza Strip hospital in return for weapons given to Hamas by the Islamic State in the Sinai.
Recent reports leave no doubt as to cooperation between Hamas and ISIS groups in Sinai. These reports, the Egyptians and Palestinian Authority argue, provide further evidence that the Gaza Strip remains a major base for various jihadi terror groups that pose a real threat.
Hamas denies it up and down. Nonetheless, there are growing signs that the Islamist movement, which is based in the Gaza Strip, is continuing to cooperate with other jihadi terror groups that are affiliated with Islamic State (ISIS), especially those that have been operating in the Egyptian peninsula of Sinai in recent years.
This cooperation, according to Palestinian Authority security sources, is the main reason behind the ongoing tensions between the Egyptian authorities and Hamas. These tensions have prompted the Egyptians to keep the Rafah border crossing mostly closed since 2013, trapping tens of thousands of Palestinians inside the Gaza Strip.
In 2015, the Egyptians opened the Rafah terminal for a total of twenty-one days to allow humanitarian cases and those holding foreign nationalities to leave or enter the Gaza Strip.
This year so far, Rafah has been open for a total of twenty-eight days. Sources in the Gaza Strip say there are about 30,000 humanitarian cases that need to leave immediately. They include dozens of university students who haven't been able to go back to their universities abroad and some 4,000 patients in need of urgent medical treatment.
Surprisingly, last week the Egyptians opened the Rafah terminal for five days in a row, allowing more than 4,500 Palestinians to leave and enter the Gaza Strip. The unusual gesture came on the eve of the Muslim feast of Eid al-Fitr. However, the terminal was closed again at the beginning of the feast on July 6.
The renewed closure of the Rafah terminal coincided with reports that efforts to end the tensions between Hamas and Egypt hit a snag. According to the reports, the Egyptian authorities decided to cancel a planned visit to Cairo by senior Hamas officials. The decision to cancel the visit, the reports said, came in the wake of the dissatisfaction of the Egyptians with the way Hamas has been handling security along the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. The closure of the border crossing came as a blow to Hamas's efforts to patch up its differences with Egypt and pave the way for easing severe travel restrictions imposed by Cairo on the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
In recent weeks, Hamas announced that it had deployed hundreds of its border guards along the shared border with Egypt in order to prevent infiltration both ways, especially of jihadi terrorists who have been targeting Egyptian security personnel and civilians in Sinai. However, the Egyptian authorities remain extremely skeptical about Hamas's measures.
Egyptian security officials are convinced that Hamas is not serious about preventing jihadi terrorists from crossing the border in either direction. Moreover, the Egyptians suspect that Hamas maintains close relations with some of the ISIS-affiliated groups in Sinai, and is providing them with weapons and medical treatment.
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has refused to conduct high-level contacts with Hamas since they came to power in 2013. Their regime views Hamas as a threat to Egypt's national security. The few meetings that did take place between the two sides were restricted to security issues; that was why Sisi entrusted their General Intelligence officials to conduct the discussions with the leaders of the Islamist movement who visited Cairo in the past months.
Apparently, the Egyptian skepticism towards Hamas is not unjustified.
In recent weeks, reports have surfaced that leave no doubt as to cooperation between Hamas and ISIS groups in Sinai. These reports, the Egyptians and Palestinian Authority argue, provide further evidence that the Gaza Strip remains a major base for various jihadi terror groups that pose a real threat not only to Egypt's national security, but also to Israel and the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, as well as neighboring countries such as Jordan and Lebanon.
Reports have also emerged that some of the jihadi terrorists in Sinai have been receiving medical treatment in hospitals in the Gaza Strip, with the approval of Hamas. The terrorists, who are wanted by the Egyptian authorities, are believed to have entered the Gaza Strip through smuggling tunnels along the border with Egypt.
According to one report, one of the terrorist leaders from Sinai, Abu Sweilem, was documented lying in bed at the Abu Yusef al-Najjar Hospital in the city of Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip. The report said that Abu Sweilem was hospitalized under the heavy guard of members of Hamas's armed wing, Ezaddin al-Qassam. It said that he, and other terrorists wanted by the Egyptian authorities, were admitted to the Gaza Strip hospital in return for weapons given to Hamas by the Islamic State in Sinai, which is known as Wilayat Sina'.
Another report by the same source claimed that Mohamed Abu Shawish, a senior member of Ezaddin al-Qassam in the Gaza Strip, has been helping train and organize the jihadi terrorists in Sinai. Hamas claimed that the man had fled the Gaza Strip to join ISIS and was wanted by its armed wing for defection. The report, however, noted that Abu Shawish was moving freely between the Gaza Strip and Sinai and was even using Hamas vehicles to commute between the two areas. It added that Abu Shawish has even set up a vast network of relations along the Palestinian side of the border with Egypt to facilitate the smuggling of weapons and terrorists in both directions.
The report goes on to reveal that the top Hamas operative is in touch with Eyad al-Khaldi, the owner of a clothing factory in the Gaza Strip, who has been supplying them with military uniforms and other equipment for the terrorists in Sinai. The report cites this as evidence of the growing activities of the Sinai-based jihadi terrorists inside the Gaza Strip, which is taking place with the blessing of top Hamas officials.
Hamas has in the past indeed cracked down on ISIS-affiliated groups and individuals in the Gaza Strip. But this happens only when they seem to pose some kind of threat or challenge to Hamas's rule over the Gaza Strip.
This crackdown, however, has clearly not stopped Hamas members, especially those belonging to Ezaddin al-Qassam, from collaborating with other groups that are linked to ISIS and that are engaged in terror attacks against the Egyptians in Sinai. Isolated and desperate for cash in the Gaza Strip, Hamas seems prepared to cooperate with anyone in order to retain its control and survive.
Some Palestinians in the Gaza Strip argue that the double standard Hamas employs in dealing with the jihadi terrorists is the result of a split between its political and military wing. While the top political leaders of Hamas appear to be keen to distance themselves from the jihadi terrorists, the commanders of Ezaddin al-Qassam are acting independently and working with anyone who hands them weapons.
These Palestinians also point out that an increasing number of Ezaddin al-Qassam members have in recent years fled the Gaza Strip to join ISIS in Sinai, Syria and Iraq -- a development that continues to worry the political leadership of Hamas. Those who have not been able to flee the Gaza Strip are joining other jihadi groups that are operating inside the Gaza Strip.
Reports indicate that an increasing number of Hamas gunmen have in recent years fled the Gaza Strip to join ISIS in Sinai, Syria and Iraq. Pictured above: An August 2014 image of terrorists from the Islamic State in Sinai (then known as Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis), preparing to behead four Egyptians they accused of spying for Israel.
Last month, further evidence of this trend was provided by the death of Khaled al-Tarabin, a former Hamas operative killed while fighting alongside ISIS in Syria.  They are the seventh Hamas-affiliated Palestinian to be killed while fighting alongside ISIS in Iraq and Syria in recent months, according to sources in the Gaza Strip.
Regardless of the level of cooperation between Hamas and jihadi terrorists in Sinai, the Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip will pay the price. Reports about this cooperation simply entrench in the minds of the Egyptians the need to close the borders, humanitarian needs be damned.
As for the Palestinian Authority, all it can do for now is watch the Gaza Strip -- which it is hoping will become part of a future Palestinian state -- descend into hell.
Mahmoud Abbas and the leaders of the Palestinian Authority can continue to talk all they want about a Palestinian state that would be established in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. But when ISIS-inspired groups are active in the Gaza Strip and there are no signs that the Hamas regime is weakening, it is rather difficult to imagine a Palestinian state. Abbas has not been able to set foot in the Gaza Strip since 2007. Even their private residence in Gaza City is off-limits to him. But Hamas is just the beginning of the story for Abbas. The jihadi groups clearly seek to create an Islamic emirate combining the Gaza Strip and Sinai. The Palestinian Authority president might thank Israel for its presence in the West Bank -- a presence that allows them and their government to be something other than infidel cannon fodder for the jihadis.

July 18 (UPI) -- China supports a two-state solution in the Middle East and full sovereignty for Palestine, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced Tuesday.
Their remarks came as they met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Beijing. Abbas is on a four-day trip to China.
China recognizes Palestine as a sovereign state, calling for Palestinian independence, with recognition of borders mandated in 1967 and a capital in East Jerusalem. The two leaders signed economic, technical, cultural and capacity-building cooperation agreements.
Xi publicly stated that Palestine has an ally in China and that China will continue to provide assistance. Abbas referred to China as "the best friend of our people and the best supporter of our national cause."
Abbas also presented Xi with the Grand Medal of Palestine, its highest decoration.

Australian troops have been implicated in the killing of a six-year-old Afghan boy and their father during a night raid in the Uruzgan Province three weeks ago. The two were in the house next door to the raided house.
The two were found under a bullet-ridden blanket, shot in the head, and the child had a syringe stuck in their chest during an abortive attempt to revive him. Locals say the troops were on their roof during the next-door raid, and shot down into the home through the roof as well.
The Australian Defense Department confirmed the incident, saying it had informed the Afghan government and NATO, but declined to offer further details, saying there is a pending investigation.
The Australian military reportedly paid “compensation” to some locals over the raid, but relatives of the slain civilians are still furious about the incident, just the latest in a long line of night raids gone wrong, a major source of tensions between the Karzai government and NATO.

Barry Sonnenfeld has been making Men in Black movies for 15 years. We were lucky enough to talk to them one-on-one and find out the secrets of making a man in Black movie. Including what Sonnenfeld learned from the much maligned second flick, why some MIB staples aren't in the third film, and how the series has changed over the many years.
Plus find out what Frank the Pug used to do, before they became an Agent.
How has the process of making Men in Black movies changed since the first movie?
Barry Sonnenfeld: I'll tell you first about the technical process, and then I'll tell you about working with the actors. The technical processes in 15 years has gotten much faster, much more powerful and the storage is much larger. Which allows us to build less sets, and to build bigger environments where only 5% and 95% percent is literally created in the computer.

In Men in Black 3 there are three of these scenes: When Will jumps off the top of the Chrysler building holding on to the time dial. When Will Smith and Josh Brolin go to visit Shea Stadium which doesn't exist anymore. And the third time was the entire Apollo Moon launch — which even if that scaffolding still existed, they would never let us shoot there with a loaded rocket ready to take off to the Moon.
Those three scenes we wouldn't have even written them into the script [15 years ago]. It would have been a different ending, a different idea. Because you never could have shot those sequences 15 years ago. In one way you get to play in a bigger world. And if we do Men in Black 4, we can maybe go to other planets.
In terms of the way I work with the actors, that's pretty much remained the same. Myself, Will and Tommy have all become very good friends. We didn't see each other for 10 years, but when Will and Tommy and I met for the first time on this movie, it's as if we've taken a long movie without each other and we're just coming back to check in. So the great thing is the shorthand I have with Will and Tommy, and now [Josh] Brolin is just great. And it allows me to direct very quickly.

What did you learn in those 15 years about the Men in Black franchise?
I learned what works and doesn't work for our movies. I thought the first movie was really good. And I think we made the mistake a little bit in the second movie of thinking that the first movie was more of a comedy than it really was.
Advertisement
I think in the second movie we made two mistakes. One is it got to be too much of a comedy. Frank the Pug singing "I Will Survive" works a little, but we went back to that well too much. Second of all we forgot that your heroes are only as good as your villains are strong. We did not have a strong villain in the second one. In first movie we had Vincent D'Onofrio, who is great. And Jemaine Clement is great in this one, and I think that Johnny Knoxville and Lara Flynn Boyle were good, but not a real threat. And then the third thing we realized was that these movies all work on really good stories and really strong emotions. Men in Black 3 is probably the most emotional of the three.
Why did you decide to leave out the staples like Frank the Pug, Jeebs, and the noisy cricket in the third film?
We felt that, just like what I was saying about Men in Black 2, we didn't want to go back to the same well. We didn't want the movie to feel stale, we didn't want to go back to every single same character. So we kept the worm guys, but Frank is only in one shot as a photograph. We didn't keep Rip Torn as Zed, but I think we have a new, wonderful leader with Emma Thompson. We lost Jeebs, because even though I think he's fantastic, but again it would be going back to that character for a third time. And instead we have this wonderful character Michael Chernus whose dad knows the secrets of time travel, and gives Will the time travel device. I found them to be a great addition to the movie. And that's not to say if we ever did four, that you wouldn't see Frank The Pug, for instance. But we wanted to mix it up and make the movie not feel stale. So you don't go, "Oh God, here comes the dog."

I caught a snippet of Frank in the 60s in an poster advertisement at Coney Island.
Well the big Frank moment is in Will's apartment. But yes, that is Frank the Pug. This is our secret backstory, until they got recruited they were the Incredible Speaking Dog in Coney Island.

What was one thing retro trope from 1969 that you were insistent on putting in the film?
For me, it was Andy Warhol, I thought Andy Warhol was going to be great. I thought Bill Hader was fantastic. Some people were worried that kids wouldn't know who Andy Warhol was, but I thought A, they would and B, it wouldn't matter because it would work anyway.
We loved the giant neuralizer. What other retro tech did you enjoy creating?
I told the prop guys that my feeling about technology between 1969 and 2012 is basically the size of the batteries. Everything in 1969 was oversized to accommodate the batteries of the era. So Josh Brolin's cell phone is way too huge. Their portable neutralizer requires a battery pack with a wire to keep it running. I felt that the monocycles were very cool and had a bit of a steampunk attitude. So we were constantly playing with the size of batteries.

Men in Black 3 is in theaters this weekend.
First impressions are everything in life, especially in sports. You only get one opportunity to make a good one.
B.J. Coleman got several opportunities to make some kind of impression Saturday night but failed.
They admit their first CFL outing was an eye opener.
"I don't think it exactly went the way we drew it up. The best thing about it was I had to go out there and experience that."
With Darian Durant getting the night off, all the focus shifted to the battle of the backups.
Coleman, seeing their first action since an arena league game a year ago threw two interceptions in their CFL debut.
They said the Lions threw some looks at them that they didn't experience in their first two weeks of training camp.
Riders' Quarterback B.J. Coleman was 8 for 15 with two interceptions.
Whatever progress Coleman made in Saskatoon to be number two on the depth chart, they may have taken a step back after their first pre-season game.
He's hoping to get another opportunity next week.
"Each day you got to come to work with your hard hat and get better hopefully," they said. "As coaches and players you want to see progression from week one to week two so hopefully next week when we go to Edmonton we see a little better performance offensively. It starts with the quarterbacks."
Chris Jones, in their debut as the Riders' Head Coach, said the play of their quarterbacks was very disappointing. They said neither Coleman nor Brett Smith played very well.
"They played a poor football game, it was their first time in this offense. I fully expect them to come back with their nose to the grindstone and they will play better next week."
Riders' Quarterback Brett Smith spent a lot of their playing time running. (THE CANADIAN PRESS)
Brett Smith was just as hard on himself. They completed some long plays including a 54 yard touchdown toss to Clarence Denmark, but they spent a good portion of the game scrambling.
"I got to get more reps and I think I have to have more trust in my guys and not try and do it all myself. We have a great supporting cast."
If there were no doubts about Darian Durant, the play of the backups wouldn't be an issue. But Durant hasn't finished a game since Labour Day in 2014.
Consecutive season ending injuries have cast doubts on their durability. Jones says they haven't yet decided how much time Durant will get next Saturday in Edmonton.
The coach says there's plenty of water under the bridge to get through first. Such as all the cuts they have to make by Tuesday's CFL deadline.
It didn't sound like they would waste time making them. In fact, most of the decisions were probably made on the trip back to their training camp home in Saskatoon after the game.
"Once you start trimming your roster down you start zoning in a little bit, there's not so many guys in the room and then all of a sudden the focus starts to get there a little more."
Bright lights and power outages
Robb Bagg showed why they will be a go-to guy in the offense. They and Coleman connected on a 55 yard pass and run on the first series of the game.
Bagg admitted it was a little strange without Weston Dressler and Chris Getzlaf in the lineup. The players are now with Winnipeg and Edmonton respectively.
"It's tough, it's different. They will be lifelong friends, we were blessed to play eight years together. I'm really pumped with the new group we have. Over the last two weeks I got to know them. It's a tremendous group of guys, most of them are pretty young, but I'm enjoying my time with them."
It was a rough night for the old stadium in the final pre-season game that will be played there. There was a one hour delay due to a power outage.
SaskPower confirmed the outage was caused by someone shooting off a confetti cannon at power lines.
Researchers have unearthed rootkit-like functionality in an enterprise security product.
Network security software from a Chinese developer includes processes deliberately hidden from a user and, even worse, a hidden directory, Trend Micro reports. Files in the hidden directory could exist below the radar of antivirus scanners, potentially creating a stealthy hiding place for computer viruses that their creators might seek to exploit.
Trend Micro has written to the software developers involved in what looks like a case of misguided software design, rather than anything worse. Pending a fix from software developers, Trend Micro has slapped a "hacking tool" warning on the rootkit-like component of the network security tool (called HKTL-BRUDEVIC).
It doesn't name the developers except to say they are the same firm which bundles rootkit-like software with USB storage devices featuring fingerprint authentication.
Sony got a further black eye from issues with its MicroVault USM-F fingerprint reader software last year, which emerged a little over two years after its thorough mauling for including rootkit functionality on its music CDs. The feature, designed to stop fans ripping music tracks, created a security hole exploited by a number of Trojans. ®
TACLOBAN, Philippines (Reuters) - The death toll from Typhoon Haiyan's rampage through the Philippines is closer to 2,000 or 2,500 than the 10,000 previously estimated, President Benigno Aquino said on Tuesday as U.S. and British warships headed toward their nation to help with relief efforts.
“Ten a thousand, I think, is too much,” Aquino told CNN in an interview. “There was emotional drama involved with that particular estimate.”
Aquino said the government was still gathering information from various storm-struck areas and the death toll may rise.
“We're hoping to be able to contact something like 29 municipalities left wherein we still have to establish their numbers, especially for the missing, but so far 2,000, about 2,500, is the number we are working on as far as deaths are concerned,” they said.
The official death toll stood at 1,774 on Tuesday.
Philippine officials have been overwhelmed by Haiyan, one of the strongest typhoons on record, which tore through the central Philippines on Friday and flattened Tacloban, coastal capital of Leyte province where officials had feared 10,000 people died, many drowning in a tsunami-like wall of seawater.
Aquino revealed the lower estimated toll after the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS George Washington set sail for the Philippines carrying about 5,000 sailors and more than 80 aircraft to accelerate relief efforts. It was joined by four other U.S. Navy ships and should arrive in two to three days, the Pentagon said.
“The weather is pretty bad out there, so we are limited by seas and wind,” Captain Thomas Disy, commander of the USS Antietam, a missile cruiser that is part of the carrier group, said in Hong Kong. “But we are going to be going as fast as we possibly can.”
Relief supplies poured into Tacloban along roads flanked with corpses and canyons of debris as the rain fell again. Rescue workers scrambled to reach other towns and villages still cut off, which could reveal the full extent of the casualties and devastation.
“There are hundreds of other towns and villages stretched over thousands of kilometers that were in the path of the typhoon and with which all communication has been cut,” said Natasha Reyes, emergency coordinator in the Philippines at Médecins Sans Frontières.
“No one knows what the situation is like in these more rural and remote places, and it's going to be some time before we have a full picture.”
They described the devastation as unprecedented for the Philippines, a disaster-prone archipelago of more than 7,000 islands that sees about 20 typhoons a year, likening the storm to “a massive earthquake followed by huge floods.”
About 660,000 people have been displaced and many have no access to food, water or medicine, the United Nations said.
Britain is also sending a navy warship with equipment to make drinking water from seawater and a military transport aircraft. The HMS Daring left Singapore and expects to arrive in two or three days.
World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said the development lender was considering boosting its conditional cash transfer program for the Philippines in the wake of the storm.
CORPSE-CHOKED WASTELAND
Aquino has declared a state of national calamity and deployed hundreds of soldiers in Tacloban, a once-vibrant port city of 220,000 that is now a wasteland without any sign of a government, as city and hospital workers focus on saving their families and securing food.
“Basically, the only branch of government that is working here is the military,” Philippine Army Major Ruben Guinolbay told Reuters in Tacloban. “That is not good. We are not supposed to take over government.”
Tacloban's government was wiped out by the storm, said Interior Secretary Manuel Roxas. Officials were dead, missing or too overcome with grief to work. Of the city's 293 police officers, only 20 had shown up for duty, they said.
“Today, we have stabilized the situation. There are no longer reports of looting. The food supply is coming in. Up to 50,000 food packs are coming in every day, with each pack able to feed up to a family of five for three days,” they said.
Corazon Soliman, Secretary of the Philippine Department of Social Welfare and Development, said aid had reached a third of Tacloban's 45,000 families. Most of its stores remain closed - either destroyed or shut after widespread looting.
“Those that opened saw their goods wiped out of their shelves right away,” Soliman said.
CHAOS AT AIRPORT
Two Philippine Air Force C-130 cargo planes landed at Tacloban airport early on Tuesday, but unloaded more soldiers than relief supplies. Among dozens of troops was a unit of Special Forces, underscoring concerns about civil disorder.

The Special Forces immediately deployed at the airport to hold back angry and desperate families waiting in heavy rain in the hope of boarding the planes returning to Manila.
“Get back! Get back in the building!” shouted air force officials through megaphones, gesturing the crowds back inside the wrecked terminal. Many had walked for hours from their destroyed homes, carrying meager possessions.
The sick, infants and the elderly were taken on board first. Pale-faced babies were passed over the crowd and carried on with several injured people. Many people wept and begged officials to let them on.
Residents told terrifying accounts of being swept away by a surge of water in city hopelessly unprepared for power of Haiyan, known in the Philippines as Yolanda.
Some stayed behind to protect their property, including Marivel Saraza, 39, who moved their six children farther inland before Haiyan struck, but stayed behind to look after their home only a stone's throw from the sea.
They ended up battling through chest-high water to reach higher ground, while the storm surge destroyed their two-storey concrete home.
“My house just dissolved in the water,” they said.
Saraza now struggles to feed their children. The government gave them 2 kg (4.4 lb) of rice and a single can of sardines - barely enough for a family meal - so their husband foraged for fruit farther inland. But trees have been flattened by winds of 314 kph (195 mph) and rice fields inundated with salt water.
RELIEF EFFORTS PICKING UP
Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima said the economic damage in the coconut- and rice-growing region would likely shave 1 percentage point off of economic growth in 2014.
“Fixation over numbers at this stage is not going to be useful,” Purisima, the top finance ministry official, told reporters. “I was overwhelmed by the pictures, not the numbers.”
The overall financial cost of the destruction was harder to assess. Initial estimates varied widely, with a report from German-based CEDIM Forensic Disaster Analysis putting the total at $8 billion to $19 billion.
International relief efforts have begun to gather pace, with dozens of countries and organizations pledging tens of millions of dollars in aid. U.N. aid chief Valerie Amos, who has traveled to the Philippines, released $25 million for aid relief on Monday from the U.N. Central Emergency Response Fund.

Rescuers have yet to reach remote parts of the coast, such as Guiuan, a city of 40,000 people that was largely destroyed.
“We don't need aerial surveys. It won't help the people of Guiuan,” one resident posted on the Armed Forces Facebook page. “You've already done an aerial survey and you've seen the extent of the damage, seen the devastation that Yolanda brought... The people are desperate, hungry and feeling dejected. WE ARE CRYING FOR HELP!!!”
The typhoon also leveled Basey, a seaside town in Samar province about 10 km (6 miles) across a bay from Tacloban. About 2,000 people were missing in Basey, its governor said.
A lot of folks have been asking me my opinion on the legal changes to Cuba travel announced in June 2017, by President Trump. I'd been quiet about it for many reasons: 1) I've been busy traveling throughout Central Asia since the announcement; 2) The changes were still pending official implementation by the Treasury and Commerce departments; and 3) It's a complex question to try to answer casually. But here are my thoughts on Trump and Cuba travel.
The Embargo Was Never Lifted
First, some background… it's important to note that the embargo was never lifted under Obama. Only an act of Congress can do that. Second, however intricate the US-Cuba issues may be, there are a few things that are crystal clear: the embargo against Cuba is counterproductive and deleterious to both U.S. and Cuba interests. The only people who benefit from the embargo and its related policies are:
The businesses built around it (i.e. people-to-people tours) The older generations of understandably traumatized Cuban -Americans. U.S. Politicians vying for the Cuban-American vote in Florida.
That's about it.
Read more about why the embargo should be lifted here – it's a bipartisan topic.
Why Did Trump Make these Changes to Cuba? Because the Cuban-American Vote is Critical
Politicians have continued to uphold these anti-Cuba policies out of fear of losing Florida, one of the most important states in U.S. elections. Where most Cuban-Americans live. No politician would risk their entire election by standing up for a tiny island that often shoots itself in the foot. So for decades, politicians have continued catering to the Cuban-American vote by upholding the embargo and sugarcoating it about the Cuban people while never pushing for any embargos to the rest of the communist countries or dictatorships committing far worst human rights atrocities around the world.
Many argue that Trump's anti-Cuba stance helped them win Florida in 2016.
Who Suffers From the Embargo/Travel Restrictions to Cuba?
These policies barely make a dent to the well-being of the Cuban government or its officials, the U.S's allegedly intended targets. These guys will always be in the “front” of the food ration lines, driving new cars and connected to their free internet at home.
The ones that will always suffer from these sanctions and embargos are the Cuban people. Who in turn resent the U.S. and end up supporting their government even more, despite their short-comings because the Cuban government will always get to say “it's the U.S.'s fault” every time something goes wrong.
Fighting Totalitarianism with Totalitarianism
These policies also further deplete the Cuban people's will and power. Without the embargo limiting extra tourism income to the people's pockets, they could have more access to income to better build some self-autonomy for themselves.Without the embargo restricting the Cuban people's contact with Americans via travel restrictions, Cubans could have more access to information from the other side of this political war instead of only hearing what the Cuban government says.
I saw these changes happening after Obama loosened restrictions. I saw Cuban entrepreneurs cashing in on the waves of American travelers, I saw Cuban families engaging in hour long debates with Americans where both sides left enlightened.
What I saw was a boost of empowerment for the Cuban people and powerful cultural exchanges between Cubans and Americans. I saw the government having to catch up to their people's renewed sense of independence, however small it may still be.
But instead, under the embargo and by adding more restrictions, the Cuban people will continue to remain poor because of their government's inefficient policies but also, in addition, because there's a world giant adding to their problems. And instead, they will continue to view the U.S. government as a detriment to their well-being. Even when they see something wrong with their country, there is nothing they can do because they're caught powerlessly in the middle of a political war and at the mercy of their government.
The Embargo Empowers the Cuban Government
In turn, the Cuban government is empowered (the very thing the U.S. says the embargo serves to destroy) because they can rest assure that little to no opposition will happen if the Cuban people are primarily focused on basic day-to-day surviving while seeing their government as a victim of U.S. bullying. Good job, U.S. government.

Now you know what I think of the Trump's changes and the still-standing failure that is the U.S. embargo against Cuba.
But what do these recent changes actually entail? Here's my analysis…
The Legal Changes for Traveling to Cuba in Trump's America
Here is a quick summary of the key points to know, directly from OFAC's latest FAQ, published June 16, 2017:
1. No legal amendments have been officially implemented into the Treasury or Commerce department's regulations. So these rules aren't even in effect yet.
2. If you've booked anything pertaining to Cuba travel before June 16, 2017 – Trump's changes don't apply to you. You can still go as an individual seeking an educational experience.
3. The most hurtful change that will restrict individual travel to Cuba is that you will no longer be able to go as an individual on your own people-to-people self-created tour.
Somehow, the Trump Administration thinks that forcing U.S. travelers to go in tour groups owned by American companies will empower the Cuban people and promote entrepreneurs? The logic here is baffling.
4. In the future, the easiest category for everyone may be to go on your own self-created tour under “Support For the Cuban People”. We will have to wait on the amendments to see if they change what this category entails, but currently, the category serves to “provide support for the Cuban people, provided that:
(1) The activities are of: (i) Recognized human rights organizations; (ii) Independent organizations designed to promote a rapid, peaceful transition to democracy; or (iii) Individuals (you!) and NGOs that promote independent activity intended to strengthen civil society in Cuba;
5. The second major change will be that you cannot engage in certain entities/businesses owned by factions of the Cuban government. The list of these businesses is supposed to come out soon.
This will almost certainly mean that it will be illegal to stay at a hotel (all are owned by the Cuban government). However, many people rarely stay in Cuban hotels since they are almost always overbooked, overpriced, and horribly run. Casa particulares (homestays) and Airbnb are the way to go. They're cheaper, have better food/service, and directly support the Cuban people. So this is not much of a loss in terms of travel.
6. All other requirements/Obama's changes are still in effect. You still don't need to apply for a license if you meet one of the 12 categories of travel. You can still book your flights or cruises independently online.
7. Itinerary auditing will be enforced. As Fabiola Santiago of the Miami Herald so kindly puts it:
Such control might help streamline the Big Brother work of the Treasury Department, which will audit itineraries from now on instead on relying on the Obama-era honor system that allowed people more open engagement under the 12 categories of permitted travel.

One Russian man's marriage proposal had their intended bride thinking more about "'til death do us part" than "I do."
Orange News reports that Alexey Bykov hired a director, stuntmen, makeup artists and a scriptwriter to help them fake their own death in a car accident before proposing to their girlfriend, Irena Kolokov.
Bykov asked Kolokov to meet them at a designated spot, but when they arrived they saw Bykov on the ground, covered in blood and seemingly killed in a car crash. Kolokov immediately burst into tears when they saw them lying "dead," as an actor-paramedic told her, among the mangled cars.
But Bykov jumped back to life before their eyes and proposed to them on the spot.
"I wanted them to realize how empty their life would be without me and how life would have no meaning without me," they told Orange News.
Another man took a leap of faith and jumped from a building before proposing to their girlfriend in 2011 -- or so we thought until the stunt was revealed to be an ad campaign.
Would you say yes to a gory proposal like Bykov's? Tell us in the comments!

Danny Amendola isn't going down without a fight.
The New England Patriots wide receiver ruffled some feathers in their team's AFC Divisional Playoff game against the Chiefs when they laid out Kansas City special teamer Jamell Fleming with a vicious hit to the neck on a second-quarter punt return. But if Amendola receives punishment from the NFL — which wouldn't be shocking — he's not going to take it.
“I'll appeal if I'm getting fined, but I thought it was a clean hit,” Amendola said after the Patriots' 27-20 win.
Article continues below ...
Amendola was flagged just two yards on the play, as it happened on the Patriots' 4-yard line. And they said they were just doing what they were told to do.
“We're coached to do that,” Amendola said. “It's a big play if I block that guy and the ball bounces in the end zone. We get the ball on the 20-yard line, so it's a big play in the game, big play for field position.”
For what it's worth, Fleming seemed to understand Amendola's actions.
“(Chiefs punter) Dustin Colquitt is one of the best, especially at the pooch play,” Fleming said. “All I have to do is go find the ball. Of course they know that, too. That's why they did what they did.”
It should be interesting to see how this one plays out, as Cincinnati Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict received a three-game suspension for their dirty hit to Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown. Brown sustained a concussion and was ruled out for Sunday's divisional-round game against the Denver Broncos.

Dutch coffee industry pro Cerianne Bury has taken a serious stride to answer a topical question: Why do fewer women than men compete—and win—in barista competitions worldwide? Them the latest blog post, Why Women Do Not Compete in Coffee Competitions, offers possible explanations for the underrepresentation of female participants in the World Barista Championship (WBC) and also shares some of Bury's own observations from the field.
Bury is a quality coordinator for the Amsterdam-based coffee sourcing company Trabocca, and before that worked as a training manager for Jacobs Douwe Egberts and for Coffee Company. They placed as second runner-up in the Dutch Latte Art Championship 2013, and was a judge at the Dutch Barista Championships 2014 and 2015, for which they also trained two Dutch Latte Art Champion finalists, a female and a male.
I spoke with Bury to learn more about their findings and hear recommendations on how to unearth the roots of this imbalanced trajectory, so steadfastly in place for the last 15 years.
You open the blog post with Rousseau's philosophical reflections on social constructs and then cut straight to it: since starting in 2000, the WBC has never produced a woman winner. Records plainly show female participation has always been under 25%. This has implications because winners gain in stature, influence, better wages, and higher positions. Can you say more?
Winning a coffee competition, especially if you look at the WBC, it can really start a career. Look at the heroes in the coffee scene: James Hoffmann, Colin Harmon, Matt Perger, Tim Wendelboe, as well as someone like Maxwell Colonna-Dashwood from the UK, who didn't win the WBC but has been in the finals three years in a row—he's published a book on water that's been very successful, is asked to go to all these different conferences and give talks on water based on what they did at the WBC. In that sense, it really does give you opportunities and an audience that you otherwise wouldn't reach. It's respect from the entire international coffee community.
If you look at the finals for the Barista Championships, there are many years that there are no women at all. There are years when there are no women in the semi-finals. And when you go and watch the competitions, it really does stick out. It's a competition that's both for men and women competing on the same level. They're all national champions, so you would think that their level of competence is probably about the same, at least for a lot of the countries. If you look at the score system, the format is quite gender-neutral. And for some reason, we're not getting anywhere. So why is that?
You answer your own question. Using open access sources on social and gender science, you conclude the problem lies in social constructs, specifically how female baristas see and portray themselves, and how the judges see and score them in response.
My personal position, as someone who studied gender studies and feels comfortable in the post-modern theories, is that the issue is a matter of social constructs. That's nurture. But nurture/nature, it's an issue for debate. For example, human behavior researchers say there are two types of women that can be accepted as a leader: either the more masculine and thus safe type or the very feminine and motherly type. If that's true, I don't know, but that's what they say. If you look into HR research concerning mostly females in higher functions, how they present themselves, physically and verbally, is very important. They can either be seen as the bitch or the pushover. It's often one or the other. Being powerful yet non-threatening or else seen as unkind is very difficult—and it's such a shame.
As a WBC example, look at the previous Japanese woman in the finals, Miki Suzuki, they were the feminine, very motherly type, very soft in their hand gestures. But we've never done this kind of research for coffee competitions, so we don't know really. Coffee competitions would be a very interesting test case because you have men and women competing, we have all the scores, we have information from the judges as to how you get presentation points, what should be in the presentation to get a high score. Most of the time the runs are videotaped, so it would be so easy to start a research project and see if men and women present themselves differently during their presentations and if their scoring is handled differently. Maybe the findings will say there's no bias at all, it's completely fair. We don't know. All we know is that a lot of research says there's probably a difference in how the genders present themselves, how they are perceived and, consequently, how they perform.
Who should undertake this research?
To do this the right way, you would need a team that knows behavioral science. Personally, I would include behavioral scientists, stage presentation professionals, maybe people with a background in linguistics. Otherwise, it would always just be an estimated guess. For my blog, I tried to find all the arguments that I could, but the post is not an academic thesis, it's an argument.
Do you see being strategic about certain factors, such as what a competitor wears, as a sign of having to play a game or, say, pull a fast one on judges?
No, I don't think so. It's not about misleading the judges. It is, of course, about playing the game, though. But this subject is a more societal thing, not necessarily a coffee competition thing. The score sheets are built up to be as objective as possible. And almost every year, changes are made to make them even more objective by trying to describe how to give scores on taste and presentation more accurately every time.
However, it's more that sometimes you need to be more aware of how you're perceived. Men who compete do that as well, of course—they think about what they wear, their timing. After reading all these articles, what I do think is that women need to do that with added awareness. So not only think about what they're serving at the WBC or what figures for latte art they are designing, but perhaps be more aware of how they present, including what they wear—it's not just about looking pretty.
The only female finalist at the WBC 2015, Charlotte Malaval, came in sixth place. Can you say anything about how they comported themselves that may have helped them get that far?
They have a very natural flow.  They are very confident behind the machine, but they are not—what's the right word—threatening. She's relaxed, she's knowledgeable, but she's not scary, and I think that was very important for them What they chose to wear fit them very well. It was very well tailored, but it was quite masculine as well. It was a vest, a shirt, and pants—a real man's uniform.
One of the policy-like points you conclude with in the blog post is that female baristas should be more self-reflective, ask themselves why they're not entering competitions.
That's very important, especially when you see the research showing women decide not to compete because other women aren't competing. Risk—the risk of losing and failing—and confidence: those are the two things that keep women from choosing to compete, according to social research. If, as a female, you reflect on why you're not competing and you can take fear of risk and lack of confidence out of the equation, you're much more likely to compete.
But I think it's not about saying to women, “you should compete,” or “you shouldn't compete.” It's about saying, “Are you aware of the choices that you're making. And are you aware that if you choose to compete, what you do in your presentation can be perceived differently than it might be if you were a man? And that the difference in perception can influence the outcome of the competition?”
Could a fourth-wave feminist reading of the gender imbalance at championships be that women find competing to be a social constraint in and of itself, that they're post-competition?
Maybe, it's possible. It's so hard to know anything about this without analyses of the competitions. Of course, that's often an argument made. Women just think it's beneath them. Or they have other interests. Or they prefer not to be stuck in this small space and to broaden their horizons, do different things or do things behind the scenes.
You've been in the judges' shoes for national competitions, and now you're planning to become certified as a World Coffee Events judge. So what's a judge to do?
As I mentioned before, the score sheets are as objective as possible. At the same time, competitors are still judged on “judges' total impression,” for which you can get 24 out of 162 points on the individual sensory judge score sheet. It's not nothing. As a judge, if you know you might be slightly biased, it's much easier to step out and to say, “OK, why am I making this decision? Why am I scoring this person this way?” Just asking that question could already change so much, just by being aware, instead of residing in this social construct and not thinking about the choices that we make.
Do you think male baristas have a role in promoting this awareness?
Yeah, and that's especially because, at least in the coffee businesses I have been to (cafes, roasteries, importers, et cetera), the people who are mostly in the position of getting knowledge—about the product, about extraction, about different coffee origins—are still men. As they have the knowledge, it's up to them whom they share that knowledge with.
Sometimes you need to make the very obvious decision to include someone that you might have otherwise not thought of. Not that you should automatically give a position to a woman, but it is about opening the door. For example, if you have a position to be filled, asking a woman, “Do you want to apply?” instead of just waiting for applications to come in and making a decision based on that. In my own experience, I found that if we contacted women about a position, they were very interested. If we asked them, “Why didn't you apply?” they'd be like, “Yeah, well, you know, I didn't think I'd be right for the job, and I don't know if I have enough knowledge.” While when we asked men to apply, they were like, “Yeah, let's do it!” If we then asked the men, “Do you think you know enough?” they'd say, “No, but I'll get there.”
And what had made you decide to compete?
I decided not to compete before that because I felt insecure. I thought I could never really win, and if I can't win, why would I compete? Then at one point I thought, “I've been working in coffee for six years. I know what I'm doing, I know that I'm good at it, I might as well compete and learn.” I learned so much just by competing. It really opened my eyes to how interesting these competitions can be even if you don't win, just for personal growth. It also introduced me to people working in the Dutch coffee industry on a higher level than I was. Without this network, my coffee career would have looked very different. In that sense, competing in and of itself bumped me up in my coffee career.
The only problem is that I'm not really a competition barista insofar as when I'm put on a stage, I kind of shut off—it's not ideal. So I coached another woman who did latte art.  They are really a stage person. They light up when they get the attention, and that's much better for a competitor.
Do you feel the Third Wave coffee community has an exceptional opportunity to change the status quo because it is generally considered inclusive and good-willed?
I think so, and also because it's very much built on respecting coffee based on what you can do, what kind of skill you have, what kind of knowledge you have in coffee. So it's quite easy, if you show your worth, to get included. I think there is a real opportunity because everybody, in the ideal sense, says, “We're all equal, we all love coffee.” Most people who work with coffee are quite educated people, in general. They're interested in arguments and are open-minded to different opinions, so I do think that makes it easy.
But in response to this blog post, I have comments from people saying, “What are you talking about? If women don't want to compete, they shouldn't. Why should they? And what's the problem really anyway?” That's what makes this subject so interesting: for some reason there is a taboo to say there is a difference in gender. I agree that if women don't want to compete, they shouldn't. I mean, I don't want to compete sometimes—I'm not a stage person, and that's fine. But the question becomes: why are you not competing?

The Trump administration is continuing to weigh whether or not to reverse Obama-era guidance that generally allows states to legalize marijuana without federal interference, the Justice Department's number two official said on Thursday.
"We are reviewing that policy. We haven't changed it, but we are reviewing it. We're looking at the states that have legalized or decriminalized marijuana, trying to evaluate what the impact is," Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in an appearance at the conservative Heritage Foundation.
"And I think there is some pretty significant evidence that marijuana turns out to be more harmful than a lot of people anticipated, and it's more difficult to regulate than I think was contemplated ideally by some of those states," they said.
Under the so-called "Cole Memo," named after the former Obama Justice Department official who authored it in 2013, the federal government set out certain criteria that, if followed, would allow states to implement their own laws mostly without intervention. Those criteria concern areas like youth use, impaired driving and interstate trafficking.
In April, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a longtime legalization opponent, directed a Justice Department task force to review the memo and make recommendations for possible changes.
But that panel did not provide Sessions with any ammunition to support a crackdown on states, according to the Associated Press, which reviewed excerpts of the task force's report to the attorney general.
In their new remarks, Rosenstein expressed concern that people are misinterpreting the still-in-effect memo.
"That's been perceived in some places almost as if it creates a safe harbor, but it doesn't. And it's clear that it doesn't," they said. "That is, even if, under the terms of the memo you're not likely to be prosecuted, it doesn't mean that what you're doing is legal or that it's approved by the federal government or that you protected from prosecution in the future."
Twenty-nine states and Washington, D.C. have comprehensive legal medical cannabis programs, and eight states and D.C. have legalized marijuana for adults over 21 years of age.
Citing ongoing federal prohibition laws, Rosenstein said, "Marijuana is illegal, and it's a controlled substance and there are no authorized uses for it, with very limited exceptions for research approved by DEA."
Without saying when a decision or announcement might be made, they said that the administration will "take that all into consideration and then make a determination whether or not to revise that policy."

The Relation between Buddhism
and Sufism:
Response to Majid Tehranian
Alexander Berzin
November 2006
Originally published with extensive footnotes as
“Response to Majid Tehranian”
in Islam and Inter-faith Relations:
The Gerald Weisfeld Lectures 2006,
eds. Lloyd Ridgeon and Perry Schmidt-Leukel.
London: SCM Press, 2007, 256-61
In their article, “A Muslim View of Buddhism,” Professor Majid Tehranian underlines the importance and need for a “global civilization” that encompasses the values of the world's various religious traditions. In my paper, “A Buddhist View of Islam,” I similarly cited the call of Their Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama for “universal responsibility.” Global civilization and universal responsibility both depend on meaningful dialogue among world religions, such as Buddhism and Islam. Such dialogue can occur on the level of religious leaders, as well as on the level of the general public. Moreover, it can occur on the level of generalizations, as well as the level of well-documented specific detail.
[See: A Buddhist View of Islam .]
As mentioned in my paper, both leaders and followers of Buddhism and Islam have been largely unaware, in the past, of each other's beliefs. This situation is slowly changing at present, but requires greater effort. Thus, in this context, the Internet is becoming an increasingly valuable medium for spreading information and dialoguing, particularly among the public, and even more particularly among young people. Users of the Internet, however, are faced with the formidable task of sifting through the mass of often conflicting information available, in order to locate reliable, unbiased sources. In meeting this challenge, Tehranian's outline of similarities between Sufism and Buddhism goes in the right direction concerning generalities, but needs to be supplemented with detailed analyses of specific cases, in order to avoid misunderstanding.
For example, Tehranian writes, “Historically, Buddhism and Islam have been neighbors for centuries in Asia. They have heavily borrowed from each other. As a result, new religious traditions (e.g. Sufism) have emerged that contain elements from both.” There is a big difference, however, between two religions having contact with each other and the two “heavily borrowing from each other.”
Tehranian is indeed correct when they assert, “Both are concerned with human conditions of frailty, fragility, and finitude.” Nevertheless, the fact that both deal with similar issues does not lead to the conclusion that either of the two necessarily influenced the other in formulating its resolution of those issues. This does not discount, however, the possibility that certain ideas may have been borrowed from one religion to another. But, assertions of such borrowing need to be delineated with precision and specificity in order to be credible. After all, both Sufism and Buddhism have long histories, wide geographic ranges, and great diversities of schools and masters, each with its own individual assertions.
For example, Abu Yazid Bistami (804-874 CE) introduced into Sufism the concepts of fana and khud'a from the influence of their teacher, Abu ‘Ali al-Sindi. Fana means cessation of existence – the total destruction of the individual ego in becoming one with Allah; khud'a means deceit or trick, as the description of the material world. In Hindu and Muslim Mysticism, R. C. Zaehner has argued convincingly that al-Sindi, known to have been a convert from another religion, most probably derived the former concept from the Chandogya Upanishad and the latter from the Svetashvetara Upanishad, as interpreted by the Advaita Vedanta founder, Shankara (788-820 CE). Although all forms of Buddhism deal with the similar topic of nirvana – release from recurring rebirth – and many Mahayana schools assert that the world of appearances is similar, although not equivalent, to maya, illusion, it is hardly likely that any of their formulations played a role in the development of Sufi thought.
On the other hand, we can find examples of literary borrowings from Buddhism into Sufism. For instance, the Buddhist image of a group of blind men each describing an elephant differently, based on each touching a separate part of the animal, found its way into Sufism in the writings of the Persian scholar Abu Hamid al-Ghazali (1058-1111 CE). Advocating philosophical skepticism, al-Ghazali used the image to illustrate how Islamic theologians possess only partial truth, while Buddha used it in The Sutta of the Non-Buddhist Sects (Pali: Tittha Sutta) to demonstrate the futility of the non-Buddhist philosophers debating their views with each other.
Other Buddhist influences on Sufism occurred in the sphere of ritual practice. Tehranian alludes to this in their brief reference to the Mongol Ilkhanate rule of Iran (1256-1336 CE). In more detail, five of the first six Ilkhan rulers were followers of Tibetan Buddhism, the exception being Ahmad Teguder (r. 1282-1284 CE). The sixth Ilkhan, Ghazan (r. 1295-1304 CE), converted to Islam with the Shi'a Sufi master Sadr ad-din Ibrahim. The increasing emphasis, from this time onwards, on the veneration of the tombs of Sufi saints was perhaps influenced by the Buddhist veneration of stupa relic monuments.
Buddhist borrowings into Islam, however, were not limited to Sufism. Tehranian's mention of the role that Manichaeism played as a bridge suggests, as a possible example, the account of previous lives of the Buddha as a bodhisattva, known in medieval Christian sources as Barlaam and Josaphat. It is well-known that Manichaean Sogdian versions of these accounts were written prior to their first appearance in an Arabic version as The Book of Bilawhar and Yudasaf, compiled by Aban al-Lahiki (750-815 CE) in Baghdad. This Islamic rendition incorporated parts of the Arabic account of Buddha's previous lives, The Book of the Buddha (Ar. Kitab al-Budd), also prepared at that time, based on translations into Arabic of two Sanskrit texts, A Rosary of Previous Life Accounts (Skt. Jatakamala) and Ashvaghosha's Deeds of the Buddha (Skt. Buddhacarita). Since al-Lahiki's text is no longer extant, it is unclear how much material they also incorporated in it from Manichaean sources. If some were, it would most likely have been through the influence of dialogue between Buddhist and Manichaean Muslim scholars present, at that time, in the Abbasid court.

Moreover, Buddhist borrowings into Islamic civilization were not limited to the religious or literary spheres. They also occurred in the field of medicine. Tehranian's mention of the influence of the Barmakid family in the Abbasid court refers to the rule of the fourth Abbasid caliph, Harun al-Rashid (r. 786-809 CE), and their chief minister Yahya ibn Barmak, a Muslim grandson of one of the Buddhist administrative heads of Nava Vihara Monastery in Balkh, Afghanistan. Although, Buddhist scholars were already present at the House of Knowledge in Baghdad at that time, Yahya invited yet more Buddhist scholars, especially from Kashmir. No Buddhist philosophical texts, however, were translated into Arabic under Yahya's patronage. Rather, the focus was on translating, from Sanskrit into Arabic, Buddhist medical texts, specifically Ravigupta's Ocean of Attainments (Skt. Siddhasara).
A far more delicate issue than religious, literary, and scientific borrowing, however, is the issue of a shared ethic as the basis for both global civilization and universal responsibility. For example, Sudan, Pakistan, Iran, and Saudi Arabia have criticized the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, signed at the United Nations in 1948, as not taking into account the values of non-Western religions and cultures. Their objections led to the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam, adopted by the ministers of forty-eight Islamic countries in 1990 at the Organization of the Islamic Conference. This document recognizes only those human rights that accord with Islamic law, Shari'ah.
In reference to Islam and Buddhism, Tehranian suggests, “ Sufism as a bridge between the two religious traditions.” One of the reasons, they state, is: “In Islam, Sufism represents a reaction against the excessive emphasis on the Shari'ah, the Letter of the Law, as opposed to the Spirit of the Law, the Tariqah.” Great caution, however, is required here. Various Sufi schools may be present in many of the Islamic countries today, but the fact that all the Islamic countries signed the Cairo Declaration indicates that any ethical basis for either global civilization or universal responsibility needs to take Shari'ah into account. Therefore, as a basis for further dialogue in formulating such an ethic, it is essential to undertake further detailed analysis and identification of points of ethics shared in common by the world's various religious, as well as secular systems.
As for Tehranian's thesis that Sufism can facilitate Buddhist and Muslim interest in learning more about each other, I believe that this may be the case, but to only a limited extent. In finding common points between the two religions, I do not think it is helpful, however, to emphasize mysticism. “Mysticism” is a technical term used primarily in theistic systems for methods to achieve some type of ecstatic union with God. Such terms are not relevant to Buddhism. More relevant would be the importance of the spiritual master and of meditation methods, such as those for the development of love, breathing exercises, repetition of mantras or dhikrs, and visualization. Such topics, however, will probably be of interest and relevance to only a limited audience of Buddhists and Muslims, and not to the general public among traditional followers of the two religions. Therefore, in addition to well-documented online and printed information and comparative studies concerning Buddhism and Islam, wide media coverage of interfaith services held by leaders of not only the two religions, but of as many religions as possible, might have an even greater positive impact for establishing religious harmony, global civilization, and universal responsibility.
Sweden has been hit with a wave of attempted bombings over the past week, highlighting again how the once peaceful nation is changing rapidly.
Last night, a powerful explosion ripped apart the entrance of Helsingborg police station.
Thankfully no one was harmed, but the country's top police official, Dan Eliasson, called it “an attack against society.”
Central Norrköping was also placed on lockdown earlier this afternoon after a suspected bomb was found under a car.
On Friday, a “powerful detonation” occurred in an apartment block in Malmo, causing rocks to be thrown 80 meters away into the living room of a different building.
On Monday in another area of Malmo, a suspected bomb exploded in a car, although thankfully again no one was injured.
A sports arena in Luleå was also evacuated by police last Friday after a bomb threat.
At least some of the attempted bombings are almost certainly part of the turf war between rival migrant gangs that have blighted poor areas of major cities.
President Donald Trump was lambasted earlier this year for their “last night in Sweden” comment, only to be proven right the next night after riots hit Stockholm.
Since the country accepted hundreds of thousands of Muslim migrants, low level urban terrorism has become commonplace in Sweden, which has a number of infamous Islamic ghettos where police, ambulance workers, firefighters and journalists are attacked.
Aside from the country's spiralling rape epidemic, violent crime is on the increase.
Earlier this year, Peter Springare, veteran police investigator and former deputy head of the division for serious crimes at the police in Örebro, made headlines after they wrote a Facebook post in which they detailed how the country was in “chaos” due to a never ending epidemic of serious crimes being committed by Muslim migrants.
Springare revealed that the crimes they are processing, which include rape, assault, violence against police, drug trafficking and murder, were almost exclusively committed by someone named “Mohammed” or a variation of that name. The suspects were also invariably from Iraq, Turkey, Afghanistan, Somalia, or Syria.
In April, a hijacked truck was deliberately driven into crowds in central Stockholm, killing five people and leaving 14 others seriously injured.
The culprit, Rakhmat Akilov, was a 39-year-old rejected asylum seeker who expressed sympathy for ISIS.

Blair Alston was the Scottish Cup hero for Falkirk as they booked another Hampden semi-final date.
Alston had fired Steven Pressley's men into a half-time lead, before a stunning second with 20 minutes left looked to have won the game.
Andy Ryan hauled Hamilton back into the game minutes later, but was kicking themselves after blowing a golden chance to level with 10 minutes left.
Jonathan Page was sent off as an Accies onslaught failed to earn a replay.
Media playback is not supported on this device Interview: Hamilton manager Billy Reid
Falkirk were first to threaten in front of a healthy travelling support at New Douglas Park, Stewart Murdoch seeing their shot deflected over, but after that Hamilton took charge of the early exchanges.
Jonathon Routledge swung a shot just wide in the 13th minute after a sweeping move involving Stevie May and Alex Neil, then a blunder by Jonathan Flynn gifted Gary Fisher a golden opportunity but they fired straight at goalkeeper Michael McGovern.
Accies were hunting in packs and Pressley's men were struggling to find space, but as the game approached the half-hour mark the Bairns started to come more into it, as Alston and David Weatherston tested Kevin Cuthbert.
Accies cut Falkirk open in 36 minutes. Crafty one-touch football gave Darian McKinnon the chance, but the shot in the end was too easy for McGovern. Fisher than fired wide a minute later than Billy Reid's men stayed in control of the game.
Falkirk were looking dangerous from set-pieces, and Thomas Grant's free-kick found the head of Darren Dods who headed just wide.
Hamilton thought they should have had a penalty when Routledge went down under a challenge from Dods, but referee Willie Collum awarded the corner.
Accies were trying to take advantage while Falkirk reshuffled, with Liam Dick on for Stephen Kingsley, and Louis Longbridge curled a 22-yard shot just wide but, despite their dominance, it was Falkirk who broke the deadlock two minutes before half-time.
Media playback is not supported on this device Interview: Falkirk manager Steven Pressley
A great counter attacking move saw Lyle Taylor pick out Grant on the right hand side, and they presented Alston with an easy chance which they duly tucked away from two yards.
In front of 3,452 fans the home side kept up a high tempo in the second half, camping around the Falkirk box, but a well disciplined back line kept them at bay.
Kevin Cuthbert had to be alert though to keep them in the game in the 53rd minute. Taylor was given freedom to run forward, and they cracked a laser off the bar. The rebound bounced down to Sean Higgins who volleyed towards goal, but Cuthbert had raced back to deny him.
Falkirk looked to have the game won with 20 minutes left from a goal fit to win any cup tie. A corner from the left was headed away by Martin Canning, but Alston thumped a simply brilliant shot right into the top corner that very few goalkeepers would have got near.
Hamilton were not dead and buried yet, though, and three minutes later substitute Andy Ryan gave them a lifeline. Fisher's shot was parried by McGovern, and Ryan stole in to take the ball away from the goalkeeper, then fired in from a tight angle which Dick tried and failed to keep out.
Ryan had given them a lifeline, but they passed up the chance to be the hero with 10 minutes to go. May controlled well on the right, and their low ball was begging to be finished, but from two yards Ryan somehow put their shot over the bar.
Accies appealed for another penalty in the dying minutes, this time Ryan hitting the deck, but again Collum gave the corner.
Page was sent off in stoppage time as frustration got the better of the home side, a vicious two-footed challenge on Taylor giving the referee no option but to order them off.
So Falkirk, having reached a Scottish Communities League semi-final against Celtic last year, head back to Hampden to continue their journey in the Scottish Cup.
When I published my column on the nonblack "Talk" three years ago, the column that got me in trouble with the left, one thing people particularly objected to was my advice to, quote, "Do not act the Good Samaritan to blacks in apparent distress, e.g., on the highway," end quote.
It's rather easy to find examples of why this is good advice. You can pick a couple of news stories from pretty much any week. Here's one from this week.
The location here is the McDonald's on Flatbush Avenue in Downtown Brooklyn, New York City. Time: shortly after 3 p.m. Thursday, when the schools have just let out. Everyone involved here, including the Good Samaritan, is black.
Two teenage girls started fighting. Teenage boys crowded round, cheering the girls on. The Good Samaritan, an older black gentleman, tried to push through the crowd and break up the fight. The teenage boys all turned on him, beating and kicking him. The young man filming it all on their cell phone is shouting "Kill him! Kill them right now!"
Fortunately they didn't kill him. They were treated by medics at the scene, but not hospitalized. Still, it's a mighty scary video.
So I shall cheerfully repeat my advice of three years ago: Don't play Good Samaritan to blacks in trouble … even if you're black yourself.
I actually missed a few points of advice. Here's one I missed.
Richard Fletcher is white, 61 years old. They live in Dundalk, a quiet suburb of Baltimore — yes, that Baltimore. Dundalk as a whole is only nine percent black. However, the high school near where Mr. Fletcher lives, Baltimore Community High School, is 89 percent black.
On the afternoon of April 22nd, again after school had let out, Mr. Fletcher looked out of their window and saw two black girls fighting on top of their car, being cheered on by a crowd of black teenagers. Mr. Fletcher went outside to ask the girls to stop. The crowd — CBS News says "dozens" of them — turned on them and gave them a savage beating.
Mr. Fletcher was badly hurt and ended up in hospital. They suffered broken eye sockets, a broken nose, broken ribs and a brain bleed. They now face thousands of dollars in medical bills.
WBAL-TV reports five people, aged 15 to 17, have been charged with attempted first-degree murder for the attack, and one more person, age 17, with first-degree assault. All six also face robbery charges. All are students at that local high school.
So add another one to my list of advice items from three years ago: If you look out your window and see a crowd of blacks climbing around on your car parked outside, do not go out and try to stop them.
In fact, given the timing of those two incidents, I'll add yet another one: If you live near a high school that's 89 percent black, stay home with doors locked and curtains drawn when school's letting out.
Snakes in toilets of Townsville houses as search for water gets creative in north Queensland
Posted
Snakes on a search for water are slipping into suburban toilets in Townsville in north Queensland.
Two carpet pythons have been pulled from the u-bends of surprised homeowners in the past two weeks.
By the time I got there most of its body was already through the pipes and so I was only really holding onto it around its neck. You can't pull it because you don't want to injure the snake. Elliot Budd
Townsville volunteer snake catcher Elliot Budd was called to a house in Mount Stuart earlier this month after a tradesman working on a house found a three-metre python in a downstairs loo.
Mr Budd said when they received a call a week later from a woman with the same problem, they thought it was a joke.
"At first I thought it was a friend having a go at me but they were very serious about it," they said.
"I went out and there was a snake curled up in the toilet."
Mr Budd said the carpet python required some coaxing to come out.
"The first one I got in the toilet we actually had to unbolt the toilet to get it out because they just aren't budging," they said.
"The second one, by the time I got there most of its body was already through the pipes and so I was only really holding onto it around its neck.
"You can't pull it because you don't want to injure the snake.
"Eventually ... I loosened my grip a bit and they just started coming out on their own."
The reptiles are not the only snakes found searching for water in North Queensland.
A group of volunteer snake catchers have shared their stories on social media.
Many have pulled pythons from wet places in recent weeks, such as from near kitchen sinks and down drain pipes.
James Cook University reptile expert Professor Lin Schwarzkopf said the lack of rain in Townsville was forcing the animals to be more creative to find their next drink.
"At the moment it's the snake breeding season and so males are moving around anyway and while they're moving around they'll be losing water and so they may have a special need for water now," Professor Schwarzkopf said.
"Over the next little while as it gets drier and drier — and we're not expecting much of a wet season — I expect that you may find snakes in many more wet places than you usually do."
Mr Budd said anyone who found a reptile in their toilet should call a snake handler immediately.
"In Townsville we have a good group of snake catchers ... there's about a dozen of us," they said.
"Keep an eye on it and call a snake catcher and we'll come out and get it for you."

The Russian military has warned that the withdrawal process will be slow Nato foreign ministers have said they "cannot continue business as usual" with Russia, and demanded that Moscow pull troops from Georgia immediately. The declaration followed talks in Brussels about the conflict between Moscow and Tbilisi over Georgia's breakaway region of South Ossetia. Russia accused Nato of bias and of trying to save a "criminal regime". Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said a withdrawal was possible within three or four days - if Georgia did likewise. "The withdrawal will be determined by how effectively Georgia returns its forces to their permanent bases [held before the conflict]," Mr Lavrov said. Some Russian troops have been seen leaving Gori, the largest Georgian town close to the South Ossetia border. But BBC correspondents on the ground say there are still Russian artillery positions in place. In addition, there are Russian checkpoints about 35km (22 miles) from the capital, Tbilisi. See map of the region Georgia dismissed the move as a "show aimed at creating the illusion of a withdrawal". The conflict broke out on 7 August when Georgia launched an assault to wrest back control of the Moscow-backed breakaway region of South Ossetia, triggering a counter-offensive by Russian troops who advanced beyond South Ossetia into Georgia's heartland. A ceasefire was signed at the weekend, with Moscow pledging to begin pulling back its troops on Monday, but correspondents say there has so far been little sign of any large-scale withdrawal. Both sides have accused the other of violating the EU-brokered peace plan. Buffer zone Following the crisis talks in Brussels, the 26 foreign ministers said in a joint statement that they could not have normal relations with Russia as long as Moscow had troops in Georgia. PEACE PLAN No more use of force Stop all military actions for good Free access to humanitarian aid Georgian troops return to their places of permanent deployment Russian troops to return to pre-conflict positions International talks about security in South Ossetia and Abkhazia
Nato's Russia dilemma Day-by-day: Georgia-Russia crisis Georgia left reeling Georgia conflict: Key statements "The Alliance is considering seriously the implications of Russia's actions for the Nato-Russia relationship," the statement said, read out by Nato Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer. "We have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual." Mr de Hoop Scheffer added that they could not see how the Nato-Russia Council - set up in 2002 as a framework for dialogue - could convene at this time. But they said lines of communication would not be abandoned. "The future of our relations with Russia will depend on the concrete actions Russia will take to abide by the words of President Dmitry Medvedev [regarding the peace plan], which is not happening at the moment," Mr de Hoop Scheffer said. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. They also said that the member states had agreed to set up a Nato-Georgia commission to strengthen ties with Tbilisi, but stopped short of giving a timetable for Georgia's accession to Nato. The Russian military has warned that the withdrawal process will be slow until the weekend at least, and that troops will remain in an undefined buffer zone around South Ossetia. It says such a move is permitted under the ceasefire deal which allows Russia to take additional security measures until international peacekeepers are deployed. But Georgia says Moscow is going much further and that Russian troops have seized control of a key commercial port in Poti in an attempt to cripple the Georgian economy. HAVE YOUR SAY The sight of GWB [US President George Bush] complaining about Russia's "disproportionate use of force" is hilarious Max, London Earlier, in an apparent goodwill gesture Russia exchanged 15 Georgian prisoners for five of its own troops at a Russian checkpoint in Igoeti, about 30km (18 miles) from Georgia's capital. Georgian officials told the BBC's Helen Fawkes, who was at the scene, that two of the Russian prisoners were airmen who had been shot down by Georgian forces about two weeks ago. Meanwhile, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said Russia and Georgia had agreed to allow 20 extra military observers to be deployed in and around South Ossetia. In total, the OSCE said it would send up to 100 additional monitors to join the handful it already has in Georgia. The OSCE has had a presence in South Ossetia since the end of a civil war there in the early 1990s, which resulted in de facto independence for the region. It also supports a UN-led peace process in Georgia's other separatist region of Abkhazia.

The plan said Beijing must also bring its average concentration of PM 2.5 down to 60 micrograms per cubic meter or less. That would be two and a half times the recommended exposure limit set by the World Health Organization.
For years, Chinese officials kept measurements of PM 2.5 from the public. But many Chinese in Beijing turned to a Twitter feed from the United States Embassy to see the hourly PM 2.5 reading from a monitoring machine on the embassy rooftop. That, in turn, put pressure on the government to have cities start releasing their PM 2.5 measurements. Beijing began reporting PM 2.5 levels in January 2012, and the official Xinhua news agency has reported that 74 cities are supposed to be releasing their PM 2.5 data this year.
On Thursday, pollution climbed to levels that the embassy rated “very unhealthy,” with a PM 2.5 concentration at 10 p.m. at 213 micrograms per cubic meter. Much of the city's downtown skyline was obscured by a thick haze.
Coal consumption has grown rapidly in China, and the plan places only modest limits on consumption, with coal to account for no more than 65 percent of energy use in 2017, compared with around 67 percent last year. Some of the plan's critics said they were disappointed that there were no specific limits on coal consumption by region. The plan allows local governments to set those limits on their own.
“Instead of setting a goal to reduce coal burning for each province, the action plan gives each province the power to set goals for themselves, which leads to the goals being very conservative,” said Huang Wei, who works on climate and energy advocacy at Greenpeace East Asia.
The plan addressed vehicle emissions by removing all high-polluting “yellow label” vehicles that were registered before the end of 2005 from the roads by the end of 2015. In the three regions with heavy industry, all such vehicles are to be taken off the roads by 2015, and the same for all of China by 2017.
In those three regions, gasoline and diesel of a high standard, China V, will be provided in certain cities. But the plan did not set targets for new vehicle emissions standards, which some environmental advocates say is a major omission. “We had been waiting for months for the new action plan,” Ms. Huang said. “We thought it might be a pivot point in history. Now it's here, and we think it has very much fallen short of our expectations.”
How To Avoid Google Analytics Sampling in Data Studio
GOOGLE ANALYTICS SAMPLING · 8-MINUTE READ · By Paul Koks on September 11 2017.
In my experience, sampling is one of the top frustations many marketers and data analysts have to deal with. Google Analytics is a great tool, but unreliable data is something you want to avoid at all costs.
In this post you will learn about sampling and how it affects your data. Further, I will show how Supermetrics (and their brand new Google Analytics Connector!) can alleviate your sampling pain while doing session-based analysis in Data Studio. Everything is presented step-by-step so you can easily replicate it for your business. I recommend reading all sections of this article. For your convenience, I have placed direct links to different sections.
Table of Contents
Sampling in Google Analytics
In data analysis, sampling is the practice of analysing a subset of all data in order to uncover the meaningful information in the larger data set. Google Analytics might apply session sampling to your data in order to give you accurate reports in a timely way. Especially if you are attracting a large number of visitors each month – and are not on GA 360 – you should be careful when analyzing custom, ad-hoc data.
Default Reports
Analytics has a set of preconfigured, default reports listed in the left pane under Audience, Acquisition, Behavior, and Conversions. These reports are not affected by sampling.
Custom Reports
Sampling might affect your data once you start modifying your default reports or build custom ones. You should be careful when:
In the cases above, your data set might be influenced by sampling.
Sampling Thresholds
Most people are on the free version of Google Analytics. Here are the sampling thresholds of Analytics Standard and Analytics 360:
Analytics Standard (Free): 500k sessions at the property level for the date range you are using.
Analytics 360: 100M sessions at the view level for the date range you are using.
In general, you want to be able to analyze segmented data for at least a four-week period without having to deal with sampling.
Native Google Analytics Connector
You can build beautiful data visualizations in Data Studio. The native Google Analytics Data Connector works flawlessly if you don't have to worry about sampling. However, the same challenges with data sampling apply to Data Studio if compared to the Google Analytics reporting environment and API functionality. “The sampling rate for the provided data depends (in part) on the date range: when the range does not include today, the connector returns the highest possible level of precision, with the lowest level of sampling. When the range includes today, the highest level of sampling is applied.” In short, analyzing Google Analytics data in Data Studio doesn't provide a solution for your sampling challenges.
The Effects of Sampling
Setting up a few tests on comparing sampled vs. unsampled data is a great way to get a good feeling of how sampling affects your data. You can imagine that a small sample and low values on certain metrics lead to greater inaccuracies in your data. Here is an example of the differences between sampled data and unsampled data (avoid sampling functionality Supermetrics is applied): The data is ad-hoc generated because of the applied custom segments. A few things to note here:
The Sessions metric isn't very much influenced in this case (metric in segment has a high value in both cases).
The Transactions metric seems quite accurate when it is above 10,000. In the second case (more narrow segment) the metric is clearly influenced by sampling.
The Ecommerce CR metric follows the pattern of the Transactions metric.
In this case, the sampled numbers are smaller compared to the numbers when using the Supermetrics Avoid Sampling feature.
I recommend using Supermetrics to find out how sampling affects your different data sets. You need to be a Pro user of Supermetrics in order to apply this feature. There are a ton of extra benefits you don't want to miss!
Case Study: Ecommerce Site
As a digital analytics consultant I have worked for many different clients in all kind of industries. Ecommerce, leadgen, but also services websites might have to deal with sampling. Some companies would suffer from sampling if they select three years of data. Of course it wouldn't be much of a threat in that case! Others can only accurately analyze data sets of seven days or less. This is a big problem as we want to perform a trend analysis over a longer period of time. Now I will share a short story of how I used Supermetrics to deal with sampling for one of my larger clients. This was configured before the new connector was introduced, which I will explain more about later.
Background
The ecommerce company involved operates internationally and receives millions of visitors each month. It has a very successful online sales platform, but was not yet ready to convert to the GA 360 package. This company was interested in setting up a dashboard in Data Studio that would help them to easily keep track of their ecommerce performance. On the overall level (unsegmented) it wasn't a challenge to get unsegmented data in Data Studio. Simply connect the native Google Analytics connector to get all metrics and dimensions that you need. In addition, they wanted to get a more segmented view of what was happening in their ecommerce business. This is where we ran into sampling challenges. A few of the interesting segments:
Visitors that show specific interest in buying a product.
Visitors that show specific interest in repairing a product.
Visitors that see the store locator page (sign they are interested in offline buying – extremely low correlation with online purchase).
And we wanted to extract a basic set of metrics per day and on the channel level. As you might have guessed, these in-depth segments and reporting needs led to challenges with data sampling. In their case it made the numbers and insights very much unreliable.
Note: you can set up (site-wide) content groupings in Google Analytics to analyze the value correlation between certain content directories and (ecommerce) performance. For an in-depth value analysis ecommerce value tracking or goal value tracking is required. This is extremely useful when you need to define personas and segments for conversion optimization.
Solution
Together we discussed about different options on how to tackle their sampling challenges. I have leveraged different functionalities of Supermetrics and Google Sheets to solve this challenge.
Step 1: create different data sheets for all segments.
Step 2: schedule an automatic daily refresh. Step 3: connect all individual sheets to Data Studio. Step 4: modify the data sources where needed. E.g. sometimes an imported metric is set as a number instead of the correct Currency. You will want to update anything in the data source that is not in line with how you want to build your report.
Step 5: build the data visualization. Unfortunately I can't share the Ecommerce Dashboard with you, but I hope by now you understand how the process works!
Supermetrics' New Data Studio Connector
And here comes the exciting part: “Via Supermetrics, it is now possible to build amazing and unsampled data visualizations in Google Data studio by directly connecting Google Analytics to Data Studio.” This means you can surpass Google Sheets and directly pull unsampled Google Analytics data into Data Studio with Supermetrics' new connector. This saves a lot of time and efforts from your side! And it can solve any sampling issues you might have with the native Google Analytics connector. Let me quickly show you how it works.
Step 1: add Google Analytics connector for Data Studio (click on this link)
Step 2: Click “Authorize” button and follow the instructions in the pop-up window or new page:
Step 3: select view, segment and avoid sampling.
Step 4: create report with new data source.
Step 5: add data source to report.
And you are all done! Well, you are halfway actually. Now you can start building your beautiful dashboard in Data Studio with unsampled Google Analytics data. New to Google Data Studio? Make sure to read these tips on effectively building data visualizations in Google Data Studio. You only get better with a tool by actually using it. Data Studio comes with a steep learning curve and you can master it to a certain degree in a short period of time.
Concluding Thoughts
Using Supermetrics' new connector with Data Studio is a great option for companies that can't afford or don't want to invest in GA 360, but still have to deal with large data sets and sampling. Now you can get unsampled data in Google Data Studio without having to store your data in Google Sheets first.
Note that no third party can guarantee that breaking up larger queries in smaller data queries always works.
My experience with Supermetrics and to avoid sampling option is that it works flawlessly in most cases.
Be careful with user-level analysis and sampling effects. Breaking up larger queries might have a significant impact on user-level metrics and the reliability of the data.
User-level analysis is most reliable on unsampled data without having to break up queries with the user ID feature implemented as well.
In some cases, you still want to connect Supermetrics to Google Sheets first – instead of directly linking to Data Studio. Google Sheets is a very flexible environment to prepare data sets for complex needs.
This is it from my side. Happy to hear your thoughts on the new Data Studio connector of Supermetrics. And please share it so that everybody knows about and can leverage this great new feature soon!

Bicyclists are planning to celebrate the reopening of the Venetian Causeway on Feb. 29.
Miami-Dade transportation and public-works officials say the westernmost bridge of the causeway that links Miami to Miami Beach is scheduled to reopen that day. Crews are still finishing the $12.4 million construction job that saw a complete rebuild of a stretch of dilapidated bridge that was patched by metal plates in its weakest spots.
The Miami Bike Shop is promoting an “opening ride” for area cyclists to inaugurate the newly constructed bridge. According to a Facebook page for the event, riders will meet at 5:30 p.m. at the shop at 18th Street and Biscayne Boulevard. They'll pedal across the Venetian at 6 p.m., turning around at the Holocaust Memorial in Miami Beach then ending at a happy hour at The Corner, 1035 N. Miami Ave.
Riders will be able to park their bikes at the Magic City Bicycle Collective, 1100 N. Miami Ave.

The Venetian has been shut down since June. Considered a safer and less rigorous ride than the MacArthur and Julia Tuttle causeways, the Venetian is flatter and carries slower vehicle traffic.
Darren Venditti, owner of The Miami Bike Shop, said the closure of the causeway significantly impacted the biking community. A South Beach resident, their commute changed from a calm ride across the Venetian to a drive across the MacArthur in their car.
Biking the MacArthur, they said, was more dangerous and more physically demanding. It also meant they would get to the office covered in sweat.
They added that for leisure riders, the trek wasn't worth it.
“It's something a lot of recreational riders did not want to do,” they said.
An ad on my Facebook page from barackobama.com reads, "Mitt Romney, Rick Perry, and Newt Gingrich say they would start foreign aid to Israel at zero. Reject their extreme plan now!"
This struck me as odd for two reasons:
First, it is disingenuous and misleading. The actual position taken by these Republican presidential candidates is that all foreign aid should initially start at zero as means of reducing the deficit, to be immediately followed by the resumption of aid on a case-by-case basis. As they themselves have acknowledged, they would immediately resume aid to Israel and perhaps even increase it. Ironically, U.S. "aid for Israel" goes almost exclusively to U.S. arms manufacturers, with which the Republican candidates have a close relationship.
Secondly, millions of Americans -- particularly younger voters who are the primary users of Facebook -- support zeroing out aid to Israel on human rights grounds. The Obama campaign, therefore, is effectively labeling those of us who oppose the use of our tax dollars to arm the right-wing Netanyahu government, which has repeatedly used U.S. weapons against civilians, as "extreme." Presumably, they feel the same way about those of us who support a cutoff of aid to other governments that violate international humanitarian law as well.
In 2009, Amnesty International, citing war crimes committed by both Israeli forces and the armed wing of Hamas earlier that year, called on nations to suspend arms shipments to both. The Obama administration categorically rejected the proposal. The administration has also rejected calls by human rights groups to condition military aid and arms transfers to other countries that use U.S. weapons against civilians, including Colombia, Egypt, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, India, Azerbaijan, and Morocco. Recently, the Obama administration requested a waiver on human rights restrictions in the forthcoming foreign appropriations bill in order to resume arming the Karimov dictatorship in Uzbekistan, which has massacred hundreds of pro-democracy protesters and has literally boiled its opponents alive.
One can speculate whether, if Obama were seeking re-election in 1984, their campaign would similarly label those who opposed aid to the murderous Salvadoran junta as "extreme." Or, if it were 1996, their campaign would have marginalized opponents of U.S. aid to the genocidal Suharto regime in Indonesia. The president's re-election team for 2012 sure appears to think of us that way.
Republican candidates certainly have taken a number of extreme positions regarding Israel and Palestine. Gingrich, Perry, and Romney, for example, have aligned themselves with the far right of the Israeli political spectrum, opposing Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories and opposing a freeze on illegal Israeli settlements. Gingrich has even said the Palestinians are an "invented people" and implied their support for mass population transfers.
I've searched barackobama.com and elsewhere, and nowhere does the Obama campaign appear to label such positions or similarly outrageous statements as "extreme." However, if you oppose sending billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded aid to Israel -- whether as a means of cutting the deficit, reducing cuts in social programs, or defending human rights -- the Obama campaign considers it an "extreme plan" that should be rejected.
What is so bizarre about the Obama campaign's hostility toward those who oppose aid to Israel is that Israel doesn't need U.S. assistance to begin with. Israel, the region's only nuclear power, has by far the strongest military capability in the greater Middle East, and it possesses the only significant domestic arms industry in the region. Israel also has, by far, the region's highest standard of living, comparable to that of most European countries. Even putting human rights concerns aside, questioning why American taxpayers should be spending over $3 billion annually in aid to Israel at a time of massive cutbacks at home doesn't seem unreasonable.
Furthermore, public opinion polls have consistently shown that a majority of Americans believe U.S. military aid should be made conditional to human rights.
Most people for whom providing unconditional support for the Netanyahu government is their top priority are going to support the Republican nominee anyway. Meanwhile, there are millions of Democrats, independents, and even Republicans who question spending billions of taxpayer dollars to prop up that rightist Israeli government every year. Why risk alienating these voters by labeling their position "extreme"? Is it simply a headline thrown together by an overzealous young wonk in the campaign? Or is this part of a larger effort to stifle debate on the Obama administration's policies of aiding governments that violate human rights?
U.S. Army Captain Frank Dux has trained from their youth in the ways of ninjutsu under their sensei Senzo Tanaka. They want to take the place of Tanaka's deceased son Shingo in the illegal martial arts tournament Kumite in Hong Kong, in order to honor their sensei. As a young boy, Dux and a group of their friends broke into Tanaka's home to steal a katana, but Dux was apprehended while returning the katana to its place. Impressed by Dux's honesty and lack of fear, Senzo trained them together with Shingo. After Shingo's death, Senzo agreed to train Dux as a member of the Tanaka clan. When Dux's superiors learn of their invitation to the Kumite, they refuse to let them go. Dux goes absent without leave before saying goodbye to their sensei and leaving for Hong Kong. Two Criminal Investigation Command (CID) officers, Helmer and Rawlins, are assigned to track down and arrest Dux for desertion.
After arriving in Hong Kong, Dux befriends American fighter Ray Jackson and Victor Lin, who becomes the manager of Jackson and Dux. The two Americans and Chong Li—the ruthless Kumite champion—all make it through the first day of the Kumite. Dux earns the enmity of Li after breaking their record for the fastest knockout. They become involved with American journalist Janice Kent, who attempts to investigate the secrets of Kumite but is shocked by its violence. On the second day of the tournament, Jackson is matched against Li. Although Jackson gains the upper hand, they gloat instead of finishing Li off. Li recovers and brutally beats Jackson, landing them in hospital. Dux vows to avenge Jackson. Kent tries to convince Dux to pull out of the tournament for their own safety, but they refuse.
On the last day of the competition, Dux is cornered by Helmer and Rawlins, but they defeat them and the local police. They promise to give themselves up once the tournament is over. Dux advances to the tournament final to face Li, who alienated the audience by killing their semi-final opponent. Dux overpowers Li, but Li cheats by blinding them with a crushed salt pill. Dux uses their other senses as Senzo had taught them to overcome the handicap and defeat Li, becoming the first Western winner of the Kumite. After visiting Jackson in the hospital, they return to the United States with the CID officers.
We're sad to report that a teen battling cancer who was the subject of multiple ABC11 stories has passed away.We first met Howell Brown last summer when a local Spider-Man performer held a fundraiser for him.We saw them again last September when they got their dance video birthday wish.During their cancer fight, Howell got the chance to be an honorary sheriff -- of several counties -- and a state trooper. They met NASCAR drivers and hung out with the vice president.In a news release, the North Carolina Highway Patrol said troopers statewide are mourning their passing."He served as an inspiration to many, never allowing their medical condition to deter their positive outlook," the NCHP said."Howell provided an example for each of us to live by", said Col. Glenn McNeill Jr., commander of the State Highway Patrol. "Although they are no longer with us, we will never forget the positive influence they provided for so many."A funeral service has been scheduled to take place at Duke Chapel in Durham on Wednesday, August 30 followed by a private burial. The State Highway Patrol's Honor Guard will provide full honors during the service, along with remarks provided by Col. McNeill.
Jakarta: Indonesia's transport ministry says the Trigana plane that went missing in the Papua province with 54 people on board has been found by local villagers.
There were no reports yet of any survivors. Indonesia's transport ministry spokesperson J.A. Barata told news agencies search and rescue teams would head to the site at first light on Monday. The two eight-member teams would leave Jayapura at 6am AEST.
The Indonesian twin-turboprop aircraft lost contact with air traffic control on Sunday in the remote, forested eastern Papua region, the National Search and Rescue Agency (BASARNAS) said, with search efforts hampered by failing light as night fell.
"It's a Trigana airline plane carrying 54 people including five crew. We are working to get more details," BASARNAS chief Bambang Soelystyo said after the plane disappeared from radar.
Continuing with our discussion of Leuconoe's question:
What is your opinion of the “racial invariance hypothesis” which says that poor whites have about the same crime rate as poor blacks and that if you control for socioeconomic status all the differences between the races in crime go away? This thesis is mainly backed by these studies: Poverty, not race, tied to high crime rates in urban communities, Homicide in Black and White (pdf.) Since poor whites have a generally higher IQ as equally poor blacks this would also contradict the idea that lower IQ leads to more crime. … Also this piece by a radical leftist: Nazis Can't Do Math: Reflections on Racism, Crime and the Illiteracy of Right-Wing Statistical Analysis.
First, let's be clear about what HBD says (and doesn't say) about crime, race, and poverty (and while we're at it, IQ):
Genes influence traits like IQ and criminality.
As JayMan is fond of saying, “All human behavioral traits are heritable.” Okay, but what does this mean? Are we slaves to our genetics? Is there a a murder gene that guarantees that you will go out and stab someone to death? Since JayMan has already written a great explanation, I will quote them and urge you to read the rest:
The First Law emerges from studies of twins, studies of adoptees, and (now) sibling genetic similarity studies. In short, when you look at people's behavior, virtually without exception … you find some effect of the genes on these traits…. How could this be, you may ask? How could such complex and highly specific things be encoded in the DNA and express themselves despite decades of upbringing and childhood experiences? For one, heritability is only probabilistic, not absolute. Few traits are 100% heritable. … But, it's important to understand the meaning of the term heritability. Heritability is the degree of variation in a studied population that can be attributed to genetic variation in that population. The cause is the variance in question is always due to some genetic difference, but it doesn't tell you how direct such genetic influence is. … So, how iron-clad is the First Law? Clearly, not all traits are heritable, right? Right. However, there are only a distinct set of exceptions. Traits that are dependent on content aren't heritable at all. These include what language you speak, in which particular church you worship, what specific political party you identify. However, the degree and manner to which one interacts with these things are very heritable: how proficient you are with language, how church-going you are, how liberal or conservative.
Note that these are not 100% heritable. There is no “guaranteed to stab people” gene, but there are genes that will make you more likely to want to stab people. Environment, “free will,” and random chance also influence how personality traits manifest in individuals.
Edit: It occurs to me that I should actually talk about some of these genes.
An MAOA variant, nicknamed “the warrior gene,” is the most famous of these. Wikipedia states:
A version of the monoamine oxidase-A gene has been popularly referred to as the warrior gene.[30] Several different versions of the gene are found in different individuals, although a functional gene is present in most humans (with the exception of a few individuals with Brunner syndrome).[31] In the variant, the allele associated with behavioural traits is shorter (30 bases) and may produce less MAO-A enzyme.[32] This gene variation is in a regulatory promoter region about 1000 bases from the start of the region that encodes the MAO-A enzyme. Studies have found differences in the frequency distribution of variants of the MAOA gene between ethnic groups:[32][33] of the participants, 59% of Black men, 54% of Chinese men, 56% of Maori men, and 34% of Caucasian men carried the 3R allele, while 5.5% of Black men, 0.1% of Caucasian men, and 0.00067% of Asian men carried the 2R allele.[23][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40] In individuals with the low activity MAOA gene, when faced with social exclusion or ostracism showed higher levels of aggression than individuals with the high activity MAOA gene.[41]
Doubtless there are other genes I'm not aware of.
2. The frequency of different genes varies between genetically-related groups.
The obvious genes here are ones that code for environmental responses, like lactase persistence in groups that have historically practiced dairy farming and dark skin in areas with intense sunlight.
Everyone on earth shares more genes with the people closely related to them than people less-closely related. For example, the Amish are more genetically similar to other Amish than non-Amish. Pygmies are more closely related to other pygmies than non-pygmies. This is why people look like their parents.
There are a lot of people who claim that “race is a social construct.” From a genetic standpoint, this is simply untrue (look at the top of the blog for an example of how geneticists can distinguish between different genetic groups.)
3. The HBD-theory is that the genes for personality/behavioral traits also vary by genetically-related groups, due to historical environmental (including cultural!) pressures.
For example, Polynesians may have been selected for navigational ability, because good navigators populated Polynesia and bad navigators died at sea. Chinese culture may have selected for people willing to work hard and get along even when they don't really feel like it; and the Inuit may have been selected for the ability to stand really long, dark winters.
Relevant to our discussion, crime rates vary a lot by region:
and society:
We've discussed warfare in pre-state societies over quite a few posts lately, so I'm going to summarize quickly: anthropological, historical, and archaeological records all document extremely high rates of violence in non-state societies. Anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon actually kept track of both homicides and births among the Yanomamo, and found that Yanomamo men who had killed more people had more children than Yanomamo men who had killed fewer people, providing a direct mechanism for genetic selection for traits related to homicide and other violence.
Many HBD bloggers, such as Peter Frost and HBD Chick, have discussed the ways in which states have discouraged crime, including (especially) executing criminals and thus preventing them from having children. The observed result:
That all said, there are things that no serious HBD-er claims:
A. That all people or sub-groups within a “race” are identical. As Peter Frost wrote, “No, blacks aren't all alike. Who said they are?” There are smart black people and dumb black people. Hard-working whites and lazy whites. Extroverted Asians and Introverted Asians. Some white groups (like Russians, apparently,) have significantly higher crime rates than other white groups. Even within the US, there are differences between different groups of whites, with significant ethnic divisions between classes and regions.
B. That environmental effects don't exist or that humans do not respond to incentives. Obviously if it is cold outside I will wear a coat; if a law is passed that jay walkers will be executed, I will immediately stop jaywalking.
C. Observed differences are set in stone. The world is always changing. Where selection pressures change, so do populations.
So to get back to Leuconoe's first query, I would not be surprised if controlling for socioeconomic status made all (or most) racial differences in criminality disappear. In fact, this is basically what I would expect, because poverty, criminality, and low-IQ are correlated, so controlling for one will tend to control for all of them.
But why on earth would you do this? If we control for bad decisions, most differences in intelligence disappear. If you control for enough differences, differences disappear. But as JayMan says, you can't just control for a groups entire history; likewise, you can't just control for all their traits.
Moreover, this still doesn't get at why different groups have different rates of criminality or poverty in the first place, nor whether A causes B, B causes A, or C causes A and B. And even if you could prove that poverty causes crime, you still haven't answered why there's so much more poverty in black communities than in white (or Asian) ones.
What do we know about race and crime in America?
I have written a few posts on the subject, like When Crime is a Euphemism for Lynching; Bullying Pt 2: Race, Crime, and the Police; South Africa, Democracy, and the Dangers of Demographics (okay that one is on South Africa, not America); Rupert Murdoch is a Lying Liar; Sorry, Les Mis: Criminals Gonna Criminal.
Given that I've written nearly 500 posts, this is clearly not my main focus. I therefore recommend everything by La Griffe du Lion, including Crime in the Hood; Crime and the Hispanic Effect; Politics, Imprisonment, and Race; Aggressiveness, Criminality, and Sex Drive by Race, Gendder, and Ethnicity; The Color of Death Row; and Analysis of Hate Crime. And if that is not enough for you, here is the entire updated Color of Crime, from whoever publishes it. Here are a few of its major findings:
The evidence suggests that if there is police racial bias in arrests it is negligible. Victim and witness surveys show that police arrest violent criminals in close proportion to the rates at which criminals of different races commit violent crimes.
There are dramatic race differences in crime rates. Asians have the lowest rates, followed by whites, and then Hispanics. Blacks have notably high crime rates. This pattern holds true for virtually all crime categories and for virtually all age groups.
In 2013, of the approximately 660,000 crimes of interracial violence that involved blacks and whites, blacks were the perpetrators 85 percent of the time. This meant a black person was 27 times more likely to attack a white person than vice versa. A Hispanic was eight times more likely to attack a white person than vice versa.
If New York City were all white, the murder rate would drop by 91 percent, the robbery rate by 81 percent, and the shootings rate by 97 percent.
Both violent and non-violent crime has been declining in the United States since a high in 1993. 2015 saw a disturbing rise in murder in major American cities that some observers associated with “depolicing” in response to intense media and public scrutiny of police activity.
So much for controlling for income. It looks like equally poor whites and blacks still have massively different homicide rates. (Of course, I should note that the US welfare system attempts to put a minimum floor below which people don't fall. Without intervention, equally poor whites and blacks might be more similar.)
West Hunter noted about the effects of lotteries:
Lotteries can be useful natural experiments; we can use them to test the accuracy of standard sociological theories, in which rich people buy their kids extra smarts, bigger brains, better health, etc. David Cesarini, who I met at that Chicago meeting, has looked at the effect of winning the lottery in Sweden. They found that the “effects of parental wealth on infant health, drug consumption, scholastic performance and cognitive and non-cognitive skills can be bounded to a tight interval around zero.” As I once mentioned, there was an important land lottery in Georgia in 1832. The winners received an 160-acre farm. But by 1880, their descendants were no more literate, their occupational status no higher. The families in the top 2/3rds of income managed to hang on to some of their windfall, but lower-income families did not.
West Hunter does note that there is probably a level below which material deprivation really will harm (or kill) you, and that a random windfall in such a situation will do you good, but virtually no one in the modern West lives in famine or near-famine conditions.
(I suspect it is really easy to catch car thieves in Hawaii.)
Occam's razor suggests that something is going on here.

Toronto FC is looking to hire a new club president, and they have their sights set on Real Salt Lake general manager Garth Lagerwey.
MLSE has been in talks with Lagerwey about becoming the team's president, a well-placed source within the organization confirmed to Sportsnet. While discussions are ongoing, no deal has been agreed upon.
The same source said former Canadian national team coach Holger Osieck is another candidate MLSE is considering for Toronto FC's president position.
Lagerwey is currently in the last year of their contract with Real Salt Lake, and was to begin renegotiation talks with RSL ownership last week.
At a media luncheon in early March, Lagerwey said he'd be interested in one day running a Major League Soccer club as a team president.
“If there are opportunities—and there aren't any right now—but if there might be in the future, that is something I'd like to consider,” Lagerwey said.
John Molinaro discussed more details of this story with Sportsnet 590 The FAN. To listen to the interview, CLICK HERE
The potential hiring of Lagerwey would be a major coup by Toronto FC, who finished the 2014 MLS season in seventh place in the Eastern Conference and failed to qualify for the playoffs for an eighth consecutive year.
Lagerwey, 41, is regarded as one of the best general managers—if not the best GM—in all of MLS. In 2007, they were hired by Real Salt Lake as general manager and senior vice president and went on to build the Utah outfit into one of the top clubs in the league.
During Lagerwey's seven-year tenure, Real Salt Lake has posted a 99-66-61 record, with playoff appearances each season and an MLS Cup title in 2009. The team also finished MLS Cup runners-up in 2013. It's the kind of sustained success that has seen RSL to 15 or more wins and between 53 and 57 points in every regular-season since their 2009 title.
Moreover, having finished as runners-up in the 2010-11 CONCACAF Champions League, Real Salt Lake remains the only MLS side to play in the finals of the continental championship—five of the six tournament finals have been contested between two Mexican sides.
What really sets Lagerwey apart from their counterparts has been their ability to build consistent championship-calibre squads within MLS' salary cap system.
Designated players Javier Morales and Alvaro Saborio earned a combined $753,333 in 2014, and midfielder Kyle Beckerman and goalkeeper Nick Rimando—cornerstones of the Salt Lake franchise and two of the best players in the league at their positions—aren't signed to DP deals.
Also, RSL's Arizona-based youth academy, created during Lagerwey's tenure, has won youth titles and been a direct player pipeline to the first team. Current TFC coach Greg Vanney served as Salt Lake youth academy director from 2008 to 2011.
Real Salt Lake was eliminated from this year's MLS playoffs following a 5-0 loss to the LA Galaxy in the second leg of the Western Conference semifinals.
If Lagerwey becomes the new team president it would represent a major change in TFC's management structure.
Since entering the league in 2007, TFC has generally operated with the GM serving as the team architect and final decision maker. The only dedicated club president they've had been Kevin Payne, who was also the club's GM. Payne was fired by MLSE president and CEO Tim Leiweke last September after less than a year on the job.
If Lagerwey does come in as club president, it'll be interesting to see how much power—if any—is taken away from current general manager Tim Bezbatchenko, and how the two would work together.
A former goalkeeper, Lagerwey played NCAA soccer with Duke University and was selected by D.C. United in MLS' inaugural college draft in 1996. They never played a game for D.C., as they traded them to the Kansas City Wizards. In 1995, they moved to the Dallas Burn but was waived the following year. A stint with the Miami Fusion followed before they eventually retired in 2000.
An MLSE spokesperson declined to officially comment on this story when contacted by Sportsnet.

This is just unconscionable. What is happening to our democracy?
Mitt Romney, the man who's willing to blatantly lie to Ohio about Jeep jobs, to the point where workers are calling their auto unions in panic, is also behind efforts to conscientiously curb people's voting rights:
From ThinkProgress: EXCLUSIVE: Romney Campaign Training Poll Watchers To Mislead Voters In Wisconsin Mitt Romney's campaign has been training poll watchers in Wisconsin with highly misleading — and sometimes downright false — information about voters' rights. Documents from a recent Romney poll watcher training obtained by ThinkProgress contain several misleading or untrue claims about the rights of Wisconsin voters. A source passed along the following packet of documents, which was distributed to volunteers at a Romney campaign training in Racine on October 25th. In total, six such trainings were held across the state in the past two weeks.
CLAIM: Any “person [who] has been convicted of treason, a felony, or bribery” isn't eligible to vote. (Page 10) FACT: Once a person who has been convicted of a felony completes their or their sentence, including probation and fines, that person is eligible to vote.
---- CLAIM: Page 16 lists 10 items as “The ONLY Acceptable Forms of “Proof of Residency”. FACT: The list used is incomplete. There are many other documents people can use to prove residency that are not included, such as letters from public schools, student loan papers, correspondence with a Native American tribe in Wisconsin, vehicle registration, and food stamp correspondances. In addition, the list fails to mention that homeless voters may use an affidavit from a public or private social service agency as proof of residency.
---- CLAIM: “If a handicapped voter is unable to come into the polls to vote, an assistant can deliver the ballot to the voter if the CEI verifies the elector's proof of residency.” (Page 19) FACT: Under Wisconsin law, the CEI (Chief Election Inspector) does not have to verify proof of residency so long as the voter is registered.
---- CLAIM: “Election Observers should not assist [voters].” (Page 20) FACT: A voter can ask for assistance from anyone, including a poll watcher, so long as the voter initiates the request and does not engage in electioneering.
or why the Department of Justice isn't all over this already. But what I do know is that it's sickening that journalists across the country are dropping witty political puns on Twitter and RTing newsy tweets by the bucketloads but are. Here are more misleading claims from the training brochure in question:You can view or download the full Romney Volunteer Observer Training manual here
Like skin desensitized to continuous beatings, we are becoming desensitized to Mitt Romney's incredible, pernicious lying. They have learned that there are no consequences (for a right-of-center rich white man?) for failing to release their tax returns, failing to stop using context-free quotes, failing to stop regurgitating debunked Jeep story lies, failing to stand up to rapists and racists openly, failing to go on the record about their FEMA stance, or failing to end suppression of your right to fucking vote.
The Fourth Estate is failing us. This is RIDICULOUS.
A new class of processes is observed while sifting the data from the 2010-2012 running of the CERN Large Hadron Collider, while theorists try to predict them better with the Standard Model and CMS publishes on the fermion decays of the Higgs. And what did Stephen Hawking really say about black holes?
This week another paper emerged from the internal approval process of ATLAS, blinking into the light of day. (ATLAS is the experimental collaboration at the LHC of which I am a member.) This one has a lengthy title, "Measurement of the electroweak production of dijets in association with a Z-boson and distributions sensitive to vector boson fusion in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV using the ATLAS detector", appropriate for an extensive, detailed study of a rare and interesting process, picking up where a previous paper by CMS left off.
The Z is a vector boson, one of the carriers of the weak force. It is a little like the photon, which carries the electromagnetic force, except that the Z has mass. A lot of mass, for a fundamental particle. At 91 GeV/c² it is nearly 100 times heavier than a proton, and after the top quark and the Higgs boson, it is the third heaviest fundamental particle in the Standard Model.
There are many ways to produce Z bosons and hadronic jets at the LHC. The Feynman diagrams at the top show two examples. Both of these are relatively rare, because they are electroweak processes. They involve the radiation of a vector boson - W or Z - off the incoming quarks, and that is an unusual thing to happen. Much more unusual than, for example, a quark and an antiquark annihilating and producing a Z, and radiating a couple of gluons (to make the jets) while they do so.
The ATLAS paper measures Z and jet production, and picks out electroweak processes, showing, with more than 5𝜎 confidence, that they are really taking place. The most interesting process is the left hand diagram (a), where you can see two W bosons, each radiated off a quark in a proton, fusing together to make a Z. This is interesting because such fusion diagrams can also produce the Higgs, and in fact according to the Standard Model a significant fraction of the Higgs bosons we have seen are produced this way. Also, these diagrams are closely related to vector boson scattering processes, where the Higgs definitely plays a role. Those processes were the reason we knew that some new physics had to show up at the LHC, even if the Higgs wasn't there (they were the subject of the first paper I wrote on LHC physics, for that reason).
The ATLAS paper also contains measurements of a range of distributions in this kind of events. This measurement are important for building confidence in our understanding of the Standard Model in this regime of energy, where the weak and electromagnetic forces have in some sense become unified. One of the tools used to make the Standard Model predictions is a Monte Carlo generator called Sherpa. Another good thing on the arXiv this week was a paper by some of the Sherpa authors examining the uncertainties in such predictions.
Still mining the data from the first LHC run, CMS produced a summary paper on their Higgs-to-fermions measurements, which is described by Richard Ruiz here . (And here's my article on why that's important.)
We really must not obsess over citations. Bad. Very bad. But I can't resist checking them every now and then, and was interested to see that the ATLAS Higgs boson discovery paper (2189 citations since August 2012) has just this week overtaken the paper describing the ATLAS detector (2188 citations since September 2008). And it shows no sign of slowing down, as people digest the new knowledge and write papers about it.
And finally, Stephen Hawking put a short paper out this week, where they discussed the "event horizons" of black holes and postulated that in fact they don't exist. That is, massive objects that look a lot like black holes do still happen when matter collapses into a small volume, but the event horizon from behind which not even light can escape is replaced by an "apparent horizon" behind which light has to wait for a while but can eventually escape. I think. Best to watch this excellent Sixty Symbols video with Tony Padilla and Ed Copeland if you want to know more.

Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, one of the Senate's leading neoconservatives who have been bouncing around the Republican National Convention this week to build their reputation for a possible future presidential run, is still standing behind Donald Trump even after the Republican nominee told the New York Times last night that they aren't sure if he'd honor NATO's charter. At a Thursday event hosted by Politico and billed as “The New Republican Foreign Policy at the RNC,” Cotton nervously dodged questions related to Trump's isolationist views on foreign policy—views that are the exact opposite of Cotton's main policy agenda.
Cotton initially said that they hadn't read Trump's interview and had just heard a few snippets. But he'd clearly caught the headlines, and they quietly rebuked the ideas Trump had laid out, calling NATO “the most successful security alliance” and saying, “We need to stand behind our Article 5 guarantee of NATO with every NATO member.” But whenever they were pressed about Trump's statements to the contrary, Cotton sidestepped by saying that Hillary Clinton was worse because they were too closely tied to the current president. “We shouldn't just think about Donald Trump's words,” Cotton said. “We have to look at Barack Obama's actions as well, and Hillary Clinton's support for those actions.”
When asked about Trump's frequent praise of Russian leader Vladimir Putin, Cotton instead chose to deride Obama for trying to reset the relationship with Russia early in their presidency—when Putin wasn't president—and said that anything Trump says about Russia at the moment doesn't count and would change once they get more inside information. “I hope,” Cotton said, “that when Donald Trump begins to receive intelligence briefings of the nature that I've been reviewing for a year and a half on the intelligence committee, they might have a slightly different perspective on Vladimir Putin, because Vladimir Putin is not a friend of the United States.”
Cotton's reluctance to criticize Trump over their NATO comments stood in contrast to the remarks of a speaker who preceded him. In the first part of the panel, before Cotton took the stage, Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) ripped into Trump. Kinzinger has refused to endorse Trump so far, and they said Trump's comments on NATO were “disastrous” and pushed them further from the party's presidential candidate. “Comments like this are not only ill-informed, they're dangerous,” they said. “I've actually really, to be quite blunt, have wondered why Donald Trump and their team have been seemingly so pro-Russian.”
Kinzinger continually stressed that that even if Trump doesn't end up in charge of US foreign policy, merely having a major presidential candidate question the country's commitment to political allies could embolden countries like Russia to take a more aggressive position. “This is not Republicanism,” they said. “I was drawn to this party partially because of foreign policy—I agree with the other tenets. But what you see right now is a candidate for president who doesn't understand the role of America, which is to be an example of self-governance for the billions of people who don't have it.”
In the thralls of the Cold War, the United States and the USSR battled for supremacy in the space exploration arena. Shortly after the Soviets struck first in 1957 with the successful launch of Sputnik I, the United States passed the National Aeronautics and Space Act, and NASA began operation.
At the same time, the two countries were embroiled in a fervent nuclear race. With the development of the first nuclear warheads in the early 1940s, the United States sparked the “Atomic Age” and subsequently spent somewhere north of $8.75 trillion to produce 70,000 nuclear missiles. By the early 1950s, an air of nuclear optimism pervaded the U.S. In the same regard that the nuclear bomb had rendered all other explosives obsolete, the nuclear power plant would one-up coal, oil, and other sources of energy. At the Nevada Test Site (the U.S Department of Energy's primary nuclear bomb testing ground) thousands gathered in folding chairs to watch atomic detonations.
Following a Post-Hiroshima rhetoric, America's citizens were ready for nuclear technology to be utilized in positive, productive ways. Then, the U.S. Government put a top-secret plan in place to nuke the Moon.
***
As far back as 1949, Chicago's Armour Research Institute (known as the IIT Research Institute today) had studied the effects of nuclear explosions on the environment and atmosphere. In 1958, the program was approached by the United States Air Force and asked to determine the hypothetical consequences of a nuclear explosion on the Moon. Sensing that national morale was low after the Soviets launched Sputnik, the U.S. government coined a plan: they'd nuke the Moon, causing an explosion so big that it'd be visible from Earth. They hoped the explosion would not only boost the confidence and approval of Americans, but serve as a show of power to the Soviets.
Led by renowned physicist Leonard Reiffel, a ten-person research team was formed under a rather auspicious project title: "A Study of Lunar Research Flights" (or, "Project A-119"). Immediately, the team began studying “the potential visibility of the explosion, benefits to science, and implications for the lunar surface.” An essential element to ensuring that the explosion would be seen from Earth was determining the mathematical projection of the expansion of the resulting dust cloud in space; Carl Sagan, a young doctoral student at the time, was brought in to help find an answer.

Scientists initially wanted to use a hydrogen bomb, but it would prove to be too heavy for a missile to propel, and the team “settled” on a W25 warhead -- a small, lighter bomb. At 1.7 kiloton-yield (a nuke's measure of energy output), the W25 would also produce a much smaller explosion than Hiroshima's Little Boy bomb, which had a yield in the vicinity of 15 kilotons. Ultimately, the team put a plan in place: the bomb would be launched toward the dark side of the Moon, would detonate on impact, and would create a dust cloud that would be lit by the Sun, making it visible from Earth.
But a few concerns lingered. Researchers and government officials feared that the public wouldn't react favorably -- would it truly be a morale boost? The stakes were also high: should the missile-launched bomb miss its target, it might return to Earth and detonate. Lastly, Reiffel, the lead scientist, had high hopes for future Moon colonization; a nuclear fallout could have grave implications on this, and could clutter the natural radioactivities of the moon with additional radioactivity from the Earth. Ultimately, in January 1959, the project was abandoned.
It was subsequently revealed that the Soviets were planning a Moon explosion of their own. Merely dubbed “E-4,” their plan was part of a series of initiatives to assert dominance in the lunar landscape and display force. Like the American plan, it was called off due to safety concerns.

Years later, in a CNN interview, an 85-year-old Reiffel revealed some shocking details of the mission that had never come to light. According to Reiffel, “The motivation for such a detonation [was] clearly threefold: scientific, military and political,” and wasn't merely intended to boost American morale.
Rather, Project A119 had sought to provide information "concerning the capability of nuclear weapons for space warfare." At the time, says Reiffel, "there was discussion of the moon as military high ground," and the United States was interested in getting there first. Military plans included setting up nuclear launch sites on the Moon so that, in the event that the Soviets attacked the United States' homefront, “we could launch warheads from the Moon.” Reiffel elaborates on the project's main motivation:
"People were worried very much by Sputnik and the very great accomplishments of the Soviet Union in those days, and in comparison, the United States was feared to be looking puny. So this was a concept to sort of reassure people that the United States could maintain a mutually-assured deterrence, and therefore avoid any huge conflagration on the Earth."
In the mid-60s, the project's files disappeared from the Pentagon, and the government made every effort to conceal the mission -- even after Carl Sagan accidentally revealed top secret information in a job interview years later.
"These are horrendous concepts," Reiffel admits, "and they are hopefully going to remain in the realm of science fiction for the rest of eternity."

WikiLeaks released a cache of documents which it says comes from the CIA's cyber intelligence center. | Getty Images WikiLeaks dumps alleged secret CIA 'hacking arsenal'
WikiLeaks on Tuesday began publishing what it claims is the CIA's secret "hacking arsenal" that reveals how the intelligence agency transforms smartphones, computers and internet-connected televisions into spying devices.
The cache allegedly comes from the agency's Cyber Intelligence Center, potentially spilling into the public domain an unprecedented amount of information about the CIA's electronic snooping. WikiLeaks called it the "largest ever publication of confidential documents" about the agency.
Story Continued Below
While a CIA spokesperson would not comment "on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents," a former U.S. intelligence officer told POLITICO that the leaked documents looked legitimate.
On Twitter, Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who exposed the vast expanse of the government's spying apparatus, also said the documents appeared "authentic" because of the program names, among other arcane details.
If the files are genuine, their release marks the latest embarrassing episode for the intelligence community. Last year, a group calling itself “the Shadow Brokers” released classified NSA hacking tools that revealed so-called zero-day exploits, or unknown code flaws in popular products the government is exploiting.
Former CIA Director Michael Hayden said during an interview on MSNBC that "if it is what it pretends to be," then "it would be very, very damaging."
Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) agreed, telling reporters the leak was of the "greatest severity."
Posted Tuesday morning, the files detail a variety of hacking techniques, such as malware, viruses and zero-days. The files do not, however, include enough information to allow potential hackers to repurpose the attack methods, according to WikiLeaks.
Buried in the trove of documents is folders that detail the CIA's methods of infecting Android and Apple phones. One page, for instance, lists 24 Android exploits, some of which the CIA shared with the NSA and the British spy agency GCHQ.
By infecting smartphones directly, the CIA could eavesdrop on conversations held through secure messaging apps like WhatsApp and Signal. These apps only shield communications as they transit over the internet. The CIA's phone exploits would allow the agency to scoop messages up before they leave the phone.
Open Whisper Systems, the company behind Signal, said that it saw the CIA's efforts as "confirmation that what we're doing is working" since the spy agency has to to rely on "expensive, high-risk, targeted attacks" to get at encrypted messages.
Another CIA project, codenamed “Weeping Angel,” described how the agency worked with British security agency MI5 to hack Samsung TVs and covertly record audio. According to notes on the effort, the CIA and MI5 figured out in 2014 how to disable the TV's LED lights to improve the illusion that it was powered down, when in fact it was conducting surveillance.
The CIA also apparently developed ways, through its “Sontaran” project, to hack into phones that transmit calls over the internet.
Other research efforts, codenamed DerStarke and YarnBall, explored ways to exploit Apple computers' boot-up process. Malware deployed at earlier stages of a computer's start-up routine is harder to detect and remove.
Anticipating Americans' fears that these snooping tools are being used on them, Hayden cautioned that the techniques illustrated in the files would have been used for foreign intelligence collection.
"This doesn't invoke the privacy rights of Americans, and isn't it surprising that WikiLeaks, this transparency engine, seems to be focused on transparency only about the United States of America and its friends, not totalitarian regimes around the world," said Hayden, who also previously helmed the NSA.
The civil liberties community struck a different tone, arguing that the release showed the urgent need to revise the country's surveillance laws.
"Hacking is one of the most invasive activities governments can engage in, yet it occurs in the dark, without public debate," said Nathan White, senior legislative manager at Access Now, a digital rights advocate. "Today, our digital security has been compromised because the CIA has been stockpiling vulnerabilities rather than working with companies to patch them."
On Capitol Hill, cyber-focused lawmakers were distressed at the implications of releasing details about such powerful tools to the public.
"The potential privacy concerns are mind-boggling," said Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), one of the few members of Congress with a computer science degree.
In its description of the documents, WikiLeaks said it had redacted information in the files about CIA targets and specific attack techniques so people couldn't replicate the hacking tools. But the activist group didn't rule out eventually releasing the actual code.
"The ramifications could be devastating," Lieu said, calling for a congressional probe. "We need to know if the CIA lost control of its hacking tools, who may have those tools and how do we now protect the privacy of Americans."
McCain argued the incident should serve as a wakeup call for congressional committees to better coordinate their oversight of how the government secures its most valuable information.
"Congress has got to pay more attention to it, and they have to stop [the] stove piping that goes on with the different committees," they told reporters. "This is of the utmost importance. If they can hack into CIA, they can hack anybody."
It's unclear how WikiLeaks obtained the purported clandestine documents, although some have already started speculating about a potential Russia link.
During the recent U.S. presidential race, WikiLeaks made headlines when it published internal emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign. Intelligence officials believe Moscow-backed hackers stole those communications and laundered them through WikiLeaks as part of a broader campaign to meddle in the election.
There is no evidence yet of a similar connection with the CIA files.

For its part, WikiLeaks said it got the cache after the trove "circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner."
One of those people provided WikiLeaks "with portions of the archive," the organization said.
The group said the source “wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyber weapons.”
Regardless, the dump could create another standoff between President Donald Trump and the intelligence community. During the campaign, Trump regularly praised WikiLeaks for publishing Democrats' emails, while assailing the CIA for its conclusion that Moscow had deployed its hackers to help Trump win.
Since entering the Oval Office, Trump has continued to blast intelligence staffers for leaking internal details to the media.
On Tuesday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer declined to comment on the WikiLeaks release.
"Obviously, that's something that has not been fully evaluated, and if it was, I would not comment from here on that," they told reporters during briefing at the White House.

Eagles fans were plentiful at the Chargers' new home in Carson, Calif. (Jae C. Hong/Associated Press)
In moving up from San Diego into a 27,000-seat stadium in Los Angeles, the Chargers were hoping to offset a smaller fan base with an unusually intimate atmosphere, one in which the supporters they did draw could make their presence felt.
Unfortunately for the Bolts, fans are certainly having an impact on the team's games in its new home, but they have largely been fans of the other team. The latest and most glaring example came Sunday, when green-clad Eagles supporters invaded the StubHub Center, putting the home team in the position of getting audibly booed from the moment it ran onto the field for the game.
It's really wild how loud it gets when every #Eagles position group comes onto the field, and how vociferously the #Chargers get booed. — Matt Lombardo (@MattLombardoPHL) October 1, 2017
Of course, given that the Chargers came into the game 0-3 on the season, and that their eventual loss Sunday (26-24) would give them nine straight going back to last season, the NFL's longest active losing streak, it's conceivable that more than a few of their own fans were doing some booing. However, there was no mistaking the fact that the overwhelming majority of people in attendance Sunday were there to root for the Eagles.

"Is this a road game for the Chargers," Fox announcers ask as L.A. crowd cheers again for the Eagles. What an embarrassment for the NFL — Will Bunch (@Will_Bunch) October 1, 2017
NOT Joking it's ALMOST ALL Eagles fans!
Eagle fans yelling at Cowboys Fans pic.twitter.com/v0pkzcmghH — Jeff Skversky 6abc (@JeffSkversky) October 1, 2017
Reuben Frank, an analyst for CSN Philly, reported, “Just did a lap around the concourse. Legitimately 75-80 percent Eagles fans here. And they are loud and obnoxious and it's so great.”
A fan at StubHub who was wearing a Chargers jersey described the situation Sunday to USA Today as “nauseating.'' They added, “Everybody knows we're not wanted here. L.A. doesn't want the Chargers.''
After 55 years in San Diego, the Chargers' ownership decided that its long-standing impasse with local officials over the construction of a new stadium was too much to bear anymore, so it decided to join the Rams at what will be a state-of-the-art stadium in Los Angeles. However, that facility won't be ready until 2020, leaving both teams to play elsewhere in the area for three seasons.
The Rams aren't exactly filling up the Los Angeles Coliseum since returning from St. Louis last year, but then again, it has a capacity of over 93,000. Having played in Los Angeles from 1946 to 1994, the Rams were able to maintain a solid fan base there, whereas the Chargers are associated with a rival city to the south.
In fact, the Chargers have had the option to add 3,000 seats at StubHub Center, which was built to be the home of MLS's Galaxy, but they are opting not to do so for at least this season (per Pro Football Talk). If they want to expand the seating for next year — or to simply avoid a season that appears increasingly disastrous — the Chargers will need to quickly turn things around and give fans in their new city something for which to cheer.
“People aren't going to pay 180 bucks for tickets, 40 bucks for parking, eight bucks for a beer and watch you lose,'' a Los Angeles-area fan told USA Today. “Then you walk into Staples Center [home of the Lakers], and there are how many championships?''

We've all heard it: “Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady and Drew Brees should be drafted because they've been more consistent than any of the running backs in the NFL over the last few seasons.”
Matthew Berry talked to this point in their Draft Day Manifesto, and many others have followed suit. When you see Rodgers, Brady and Brees finish as elite quarterbacks year in and year out, you feel more comfortable drafting them because you “know what you're getting”.
The problem with this logic is that a player's ranking does not equate to a player's value. You don't win fantasy football by having the highest ranked players at each position. You win fantasy football by scoring the most points as a team. And because of this, we can see that Drew Brees and Tom Brady actually aren't any more valuable than elite running backs, and Aaron Rodgers really isn't all that much better than them either.
Rankings Since 2009
To elaborate, let's take a look at how the elite quarterbacks (Rodgers, Brady, Brees) have ranked over the last three seasons. In addition, let's do the same for the elite running backs (Johnson, Peterson, Jones-Drew, Rice).
As you can see, the quarterbacks have consistently ranked higher than the running backs over the last 3 years. Remember, though; we're starting 10 quarterbacks in a 10-team standard league, and at least 20 running backs in said league. Therefore, ranks are a little difficult to compare, considering the number of total players being started at each position varies so greatly.
Aside: I've heard a lot of backlash regarding my analysis of comparing the 1st to 20th running back, as opposed to looking at the 1st to 10th (RB1) and then the 11th to 20th (RB2). The reason you cannot do the latter is because that assumes we cannot own two RB1s on our team. We all know our RB2 spot could hold a running back that is pre-season ranked in the top-10, especially if others draft non-running back positions early in the draft.
I've talked about consistency when it comes to rank. Quarterbacks, albeit barely, come out on top of that argument. But what I haven't fully explained is that we can't simply look at rank consistency. We should be more concerned with point variances and value.
Value Based Drafting
Here's an example of what I mean: Last year, we saw Aaron Rodgers score 144 points more than the 10th ranked quarterback. Why is the 10th ranked quarterback significant? Because, in a 10-team league, that's the worst fantasy league starter at the position (given each team starts just one quarterback). If you're in a 12-team league, you should look at the point spread to the 12th quarterback, and so on.
Make sense? Good.
This, from a high, linear level, is the idea of Value-Based Drafting (VBD). Using VBD, we are able to find how valuable a player is by looking at how they perform against their peers at their position. We're not worried about how Aaron Rodgers does against Ray Rice. We're worried about how Aaron Rodgers does against Tom Brady, Drew Brees, Tony Romo, and Ben Roethlisberger.
As I said, many see value in Aaron Rodgers, Drew Brees and Tom Brady because they consistently finish as top quarterbacks. But looking at rank isn't the way we should determine value. The way we determine value, as I showed above, is by looking at point differential, or variances, by position. That's what value based drafting is all about.
I can tell you, very confidently, that Aaron Rodgers will finish as a top-3 quarterback. He's been the best quarterback two of the last three seasons, and they finished second the year that they aren't the best. We definitely can't say that about any other player in fantasy football.
But fantasy managers don't analyze this idea any further. While he's been stellar at ranking at their position, it wasn't until last season where they were over 100 points better than the worst fantasy starter at their position.
Let me elaborate. Since 2009, here's how Rodgers, Brady, and Brees have finished compared to the 10th ranked (the worst starter) quarterback at the position (I call this “point variance”):
What this table shows us is value. On average since 2009, Aaron Rodgers has outscored the worst starter in a standard 10-team league by 101.9 points per season. Tom Brady's averaged 67.3 points better, and Brees has been 75.4 points better.
Let's see how this compares to top running backs (remember, this is a comparison of how they ranked versus the worst starting running back in a 10-team league):
Interestingly enough, since 2009, all 4 elite running backs have outscored their peers by more points than Tom Brady and Drew Brees did theirs.
On the flip side – yes, Aaron Rodgers “wins”. He's outscored their peers by more points, on average, than any other player. He's been the most valuable player in fantasy football since 2009. But before you go ahead and crown Rodgers your go-to, no doubt first overall pick, let's take a look at what this means.
Rank vs. Value
The analysis shows that Ray Rice has scored 96.8 points more than their peers – each season on average – over the last 3 years. For Rodgers, this number has been 101.9. Rodgers, however, has finished as the 1st, 2nd and 1st ranked quarterback over these seasons. Ray Rice has finished as the 4th, 11th, and 1st ranked running back.
Why is that important? Because it shows that there is less room for error at the quarterback position. In order for a quarterback to truly be valuable, they must finish as a top quarterback.
Think about it. While Ray Rice had a season, 2010, where they finished as a mediocre starter (ranked 11), he's still been nearly as valuable as Rodgers has. When Rice was ranked 11th, they scored 53.4 more points than the worst starting running back in a 10-team league. And Rodgers, ranking 2nd at quarterback that same year, outscored the worst starting quarterback by just 65.4 points. That's 12 more points than an 11th ranked running back, and Rodgers finished 2nd.
This is value. This is what I mean when I say that drafting a quarterback early is just as risky as drafting a running back early. If you're getting Rodgers with the first overall pick in the draft, you not only need them to finish as a top quarterback to keep their value, but you need them to keep up their record breaking pace.
And while I'm not telling you to draft the running backs above, I'm simply showing that value doesn't come with rank. When you know the average life span of a running back is shorter than that of a quarterback, you would expect to see more turnover from year to year. That's why we see players like Arian Foster jump to the top all of the time in fantasy rankings.
Closing
The reason I brought this data forth is to show that looking at pure rankings to conclude that a player is “far and away the most consistent in the league” is not the best way to determine value. As I've shown, there are four running backs that have been more valuable than Brady and Brees over the last three seasons. And even with Rodgers playing out of this world at quarterback, he's still been barely better than Chris Johnson and Ray Rice. We have to always remember that there are fewer quarterbacks started in a league. And to that point, the margin for error for those elite quarterbacks is quite small.
Value is what wins fantasy leagues. Looking at rankings to determine value won't bring home a championship.
All point total data above is based on standard scoring.
"Beware of the cream sauce!" is my familiar cry when it comes to NYC's fancier restaurants. After all, a whole bunch of these chi-chi eateries happen to be on the sites of places that were way more raunchy, back in New York's fabled past. Here are some upscale boîtes (and other establishments that tourists flock to) that used to cater to downscale…well, you come up with a rhyme.
DOS CAMINOS (675 Hudson Street)
Delicious Mexican food, swanky patrons, and lovely outdoor seating all comprise the success story that is Dos Caminos. But did you know that at this Meatpacking hangout, meat used to be seriously packed? The place used to be the Vault -- the hardcore S&M club where CEOs got whipped and waxed until 1997. There are also two other Dos Caminos restaurants in Manhattan, and only Shirley MacLaine can imagine what they were in a past life.
SUGAR FACTORY (835 Washington St)
"We shared one of the coolest drinks called a goblet that had gummy bears in it and had dry ice fog coming out of it!" gushes one Yelp respondent about this cutesy eatery. Another one recommended "a Rice Krispie treat with icing on top and a sparkler." Quaint, no? But from 1977 to 1985, this place happened to be the Mineshaft, the most notoriously raunchy gay sex hangout of all, where studs congregated around the communal bathtub to relieve themselves on a willing slave. And it wasn't because they'd had too many Rice Krispie treats!
LEFT BANK NYC (117 Perry Street)
At this high-toned American restaurant, grilled pork sausage with crispy russet potatoes and pickles cost $24. But in the 1970s, when it was the International Stud, pretty much the very same dish was free! The Stud's legendary side room was home to a clusterfuck of horny gays yanking out their sausages. Today it's a kitchen for pork and pickles!
SHAKE SHACK (691 8th Avenue)
Tourists line up for upscale burgers and other treats at this Times Square destination known for sassy snacking. Little do they know that on the very same site was the all-male porn theater the Adonis, which, until its shuttering in 1994, hosted dirty movies and raunchy real-life blow jobs among the customers, all creating a multimedia skankfest of delight. Lots of hot dogs on display! With cheese!
JUE LAN CLUB AT LIMELIGHT SHOPS (47 W. 20th Street)
Swanky Chinese spot Jue Lan Club joins a genteel assortment of accessory, scent and gelato boutiques in this multi-story mall, but back in the '80s and '90s, it was the nightclub the Limelight, the mecca for raucous clubbies on drugs and occasionally on their knees. The stuff you saw in the stairway alone! This location definitely has range (and I hope has been seriously fumigated).
SHOW WORLD CENTER (671 8th Avenue)
This shiny emporium is now the site of comedy shows, magic tricks, haunted houses, and theater, all enjoyed by tourists and their spouses. But it used to be a peep show where porn stars swept in to flaunt their wares, greet their trenchcoat-wearing fans, and leave in a cloud of Fantastik.
LIBERTY INN HOTEL (500 W. 14th Street)
Yes, this is a sexy hotel, where you can apparently rent by the hour, but it used to be way steamier than that. From 1974 to 1986, it was the multi-level gay sex bar the Anvil, where you were afraid to raise a fist at anyone, for fear it would somehow end up in their butt. Ah, the memories.
GASLIGHT LOUNGE (400 W. 14th Street)
Sandwiches, wine, and dancing are the key elements at this perfectly delightful Meatpacking pub. "And clean bathrooms!" exults someone on Yelp. That's ironic because it used to be the Toilet, a naughty gay dungeon that totally lived up to its name. Beware of the cream sauce indeed!

The university issued a deferred suspension to the fraternity Sigma Phi Epsilon until Dec. 31, 2016, administration said on Monday.
“During this time, the chapter will be required to fully cooperate in a member review by its national headquarters, develop a new-member program and hold educational programs for members on risk management, hazing and alcohol,” Vice President for Public Affairs Lynn Bushnell said in the statement.
Quinnipiac's Student Handbook defines a deferred suspension as, “a suspended removal from Quinnipiac University for a period of time.”
“Any violation of policy committed during this period causes the suspension to take effect immediately,” the handbook states. “The length of time is determined by the primary conduct officer.”
Sigma Phi Epsilon received a cease and desist order in September after hazing allegations. This meant the fraternity had to halt all activities until an investigation was completed.
The university and the fraternity will not comment on the nature of the hazing allegations at this time.
The university's most recent decision allows the fraternity to resume their events and activities, but national headquarters will continue an in-depth investigation into the hazing allegations.
“The deferred suspension allows Sigma Phi Epsilon to resume normal activities provided that it fully cooperates in a member review by its national headquarters,” Associate Vice President for Public Relations John Morgan said in an email.
The university issued the deferred suspension in early December, according to Morgan.
The student body felt mixed about the deferred suspension.
Freshman film major Isaiah Nieves said they did not have a problem with the fraternity being allowed to resume activities if there was no real reasoning.
“If the school didn't find anything on Sig Ep I guess it is fine for them to come back,” they said.
The fraternity Beta Theta Pi also received a cease and desist order last semester for hazing allegations, but a few weeks later they were cleared of the allegations and allowed to proceed with operations and events.
Michaela May is a senior athletic training major and said Sigma Phi Epsilon should not be back on campus so soon.
“I think there should have been more investigation with it overall,” they said. “I do not know all of the ins and outs with it, I just heard about the general situation. I do not think it was fair that they were allowed back so soon without much repercussion.”
The fraternity now has a new president, Robert Cowan, the junior said on their Facebook page. Cowan declined to comment to The Chronicle at this time.

UPDATE: The article was updated on Dec. 26 to include student reactions and information on when the deferred suspension was issued.

European champions Toulon will face Super 15 winners the Wakaito Chiefs in a world club championship at the start of February, according to reports in France.
The French side have made no secret of their desire to test themselves against the southern hemisphere champions and reports in Midi Olympique claim the two clubs have agreed on February 2nd for the showdown.
Toulon president Mourad Boudjellal revealed their plans for a ‘World Cup of Clubs' earlier in the summer although European Rugby Cup Ltd, the organisers of the Heineken Cup, are unlikely to sanction the match.
“Under the terms of the European Rugby Cup participation agreement that they signed before the competition, the clubs do not have the right to play such a game as European champions especially against the winners of the Super 15, it is stated in the agreement,” ERC president Jean-Pierre Lux explained last month.
“I totally understand that they wanted to do something, but Mr Boudjellal does not have the latitude to organise such a game. It's a good idea. We have long been in discussion with SANZAR to set up a match like this but it faces the problem of the calendar.”
The proposed date in February will clash with Ireland's Six Nations opener against Scotland while France play host to England on February 1st.
Britain's most senior Catholic cleric stepped down from their post as Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh earlier this year after priests made allegations against him.
A Vatican statement said: "His Eminence Cardinal Keith Patrick O'Brien ... will be leaving Scotland for several months for the purpose of spiritual renewal, prayer and penance. Any decision regarding future arrangements for their eminence shall be agreed with the Holy See."
The cardinal stepped down as leader of the Scottish Catholic Church at the end of February after admitting that their sexual conduct "had fallen beneath the standards" expected of them during their almost 50-year career.
They indicated that they would not contest claims by three priests and a former priest of inappropriate behaviour dating back to the 1980s, and intended to retire permanently from the public life of the church.
It was reported earlier this month that the cardinal, originally from Ballycastle, Co Antrim, was to settle in Dunbar, East Lothian.
The Vatican said their departure from Scotland was "in agreement with the Holy Father".
When they resigned the cardinal issued as apology saying: "I wish to take this opportunity to admit that there have been times that my sexual conduct has fallen below the standards expected of me as a priest, archbishop and cardinal.
"To those I have offended, I apologise and ask forgiveness. To the Catholic Church and people of Scotland, I also apologise.
"I will now spend the rest of my life in retirement. I will play no further part in the public life of the Catholic Church in Scotland."

Though many blame the Global Crash of 2015 for the loss of faith in stocks, others say the erosion dated back to at least 2014.
April 1, 2016: In an unprecedented move, Dow Jones announced that it was suspending its iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 large-cap stocks "due to lack of interest." The move caught the mainstream media by surprise, but those who had watched public interest and participation in the stock market dwindle in recent years expressed little shock.
"Now that everybody knows it's all rigged, that it's just a bunch of computers skimming from each other and a handful of daytraders, what's the point?" commented one former employee of a trading desk.
The few still employed on Wall Street were equally circumspect. "There's nobody here except a few techs running the machines," one lamented. "A couple of years ago guys were killing themselves because they'd lost a lot of money. Now we're dying of boredom."
"It's really rather surreal," one former financial journalist marveled. "The big trading desks are still making money 400 days in a row, the Federal Reserve is still pumping money into stocks, but nobody cares any more. Once they realized the market no longer had anything to do with the real economy or their future, they lost interest."
Though many blame the Global Crash of 2015 for the loss of faith in stocks, others say the erosion dated back to at least 2014, when the F.B.I. revealed its investigation into high-frequency trading (HFT), and the perception that the market was rigged went mainstream.
"There were plenty of buy-side analysts who said, 'OK, the market's rigged, so that means it's safe to pile in,'" the journalist noted. "But the Global Crash of 2015 mooted that guarantee."
A former financial analyst who now grows organic lettuce for a living observed, "As soon as all the suckers, and by that I don't mean Ma and Pa Kettle, I mean the pension funds and insurance companies, had their heads handed to them in the crash, it was game over. When the Fed started openly buying equities, the funds that had survived the crash didn't jump back in."
According to a well-connected observer who requested anonymity, public disgust extends beyond the rigged market to everyone who aided and abetted the scheme. "The F.B.I. investigates for two years but can't find anyone to prosecute. What does that say about our system of so-called justice? It's as rigged as the market."
Rating of financial news programs plummeted as the public lost interest, and most were cancelled due to poor ratings. Jim Cramer still hosts a web-based program touting stocks but the audience appears to be mostly hecklers who lost money following their "stay long and strong" advice just before the crash wiped out everyone who believed the Fed had their back.
One former Wall Streeter waxed nostalgic for the good old days when the stock market was still viewed as the road to legitimate riches. "It was really something else," they mused. "People believed the hype, they believed all the phony BS about the market being a level playing field and the Fed having their back, and they gave us their money willingly, even when it was obvious it was just a big embezzlement scheme."
Happy April Fools' Day 2014.
The Nearly Free University and The Emerging Economy:
The Revolution in Higher Education
Reconnecting higher education, livelihoods and the economy With the soaring cost of higher education, has the value a college degree been turned upside down? College tuition and fees are up 1000% since 1980. Half of all recent college graduates are jobless or underemployed, revealing a deep disconnect between higher education and the job market.
It is no surprise everyone is asking: Where is the return on investment? Is the assumption that higher education returns greater prosperity no longer true? And if this is the case, how does this impact you, your children and grandchildren?
We must thoroughly understand the twin revolutions now fundamentally changing our world: The true cost of higher education and an economy that seems to re-shape itself minute to minute.
The Nearly Free University and the Emerging Economy clearly describes the underlying dynamics at work - and, more importantly, lays out a new low-cost model for higher education: how digital technology is enabling a revolution in higher education that dramatically lowers costs while expanding the opportunities for students of all ages.
The Nearly Free University and the Emerging Economy provides clarity and optimism in a period of the greatest change our educational systems and society have seen, and offers everyone the tools needed to prosper in the Emerging Economy.

Things are falling apart--that is obvious. But why are they falling apart? The reasons are complex and global. Our economy and society have structural problems that cannot be solved by adding debt to debt. We are becoming poorer, not just from financial over-reach, but from fundamental forces that are not easy to identify. We will cover the five core reasons why things are falling apart:
1. Debt and financialization
2. Crony capitalism
3. Diminishing returns
4. Centralization

MITCHELL, SD—The Corn Palace, a large building entirely decorated with ears of corn and other grains, will be featured on the new state penny due to be released in 2010, insists Herb Stymie, director of the Corn Palace Visitors Center. “You can bet money on it. No way they use Mt. Rushmore again.”
…………Like the state quarters issued over the past decade, the pennies will feature an engraving representative of each state in the union. In 2004, South Dakota officials chose Mt. Rushmore to be on the quarter, a decision that “flabbergasted” Mr. Stymie and the three other people employed in their office. “We were blown away, totally and completely bowled over. It was so out of left field. Melinda, the gal who answers the phone, was in tears. Nobody, and I mean nobody, saw that one coming.”
…………Mt. Rushmore, located in the Black Hills near the western border of South Dakota, not only adorns the state quarter, but also the state license plate, state flag, state seal, and state letterhead. In addition, the 1998 Wes Anderson-directed movie Rushmore, starring Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman, was adopted as the Official State Movie, even though the film makes no mention of Mt. Rushmore, South Dakota, or even the Midwest. Just over 1-in-3 streets in South Dakota are named Rushmore, adding to the disorientation and confusion naturally present among drivers in the state. Rushmore is also popular as a business name, with 1-in-4 South Dakota businesses using it in some form. This number increases dramatically as one goes further west. An estimated 90% of businesses in the Black Hills are named Rushmore.
…………“If you ask me, it seems kind of obsessive,” says Stymie. “Rushmore this and Rushmore that. It's as if this whole state were empty except for that stupid jingoistic mountain.”
…………Mt. Rushmore draws an estimated 2.5 million visitors each year, many of whom are impressed by the 100-foot granite sculpture featuring the heads of dead presidents Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and Roosevelt. In contrast, the Corn Palace draws an estimated 20,000 visitors a year, the majority of whom are attendees of Dakota Wesleyan University basketball games, which are held in the building.
…………Originally constructed in 1905 in a failing bid to ‘snazz up' Mitchell and get the state capital located there, the 18,000 square foot building boasts murals on every wall constructed out of corn and other grains. The murals, which become infested with bugs and worms, are removed each Fall and replaced each Spring with a new theme. Past themes include ‘Prairie Life', ‘Everyday Heroes', and ‘Mt. Rushmore'. In addition to Division 8 basketball games, the Corn Palace also hosts wedding receptions, the occasional convention, and the state high school Indian leg wrestling championships.
…………“Don't get me wrong,” says Stymie. “Mt. Rushmore is great and all, but it doesn't really say South Dakota. It's more national in scope. This is largely an agricultural state and I think the Corn Palace signifies that. We're very confident that the powers that be will make the right, the sensible, and the obvious choice, and put the Corn Palace on the new state penny. Nothing says South Dakota more than a large building with ears of corn glued all over it.”

Norman Dorsen, a passionate human rights advocate who led the American Civil Liberties Union for 15 years and was involved in some of the biggest civil liberties cases of the second half of the 20th century, died on Saturday at their home in Manhattan. They were 86.
The cause was complications of a stroke, their daughter Annie said.
Mr. Dorsen's career-long focus on civil liberties was informed by their involvement in the Army-McCarthy Hearings in 1954. They went on to argue Supreme Court cases that established juveniles' rights to due process and that acknowledged the rights of children born out of wedlock. They were also one of the first lawyers to argue before the court in favor of abortion rights and gay rights.
Mr. Dorsen was a key figure at New York University School of Law, where they joined the faculty and became the director of the civil liberties program in 1961. Partly through Mr. Dorsen's influence, the school gained a reputation for attracting students and faculty with an interest in public interest law.
“Perhaps no one else in the history of N.Y.U. Law shaped this place as profoundly, or affected it as deeply, as Norman,” said Trevor W. Morrison, the school's dean.

Tottenham is confident of installing a new manager as early as next week with Mauricio Pochettino the leading contender to take over at White Hart Lane.
The Argentine is thought to be the favoured candidate of chairperson Daniel Levy as Tottenham seek to finalise the package they would offer to Southampton to release Pochettino from their contract, which still has one year to run.
While Levy is attracted by the idea of having Pochettino, 42, as their ninth permanent manager in 13 years, it is understood that not everybody in the Spurs hierarchy is completely sold on the notion.
Indeed, it is thought some are trying to persuade Levy to look more seriously at two other candidates, thought to be Ajax head coach Frank De Boer and Napoli boss Rafael Benitez, a former Liverpool and Chelsea manager. There could also be an ambitious move for Carlo Ancelotti if Real Madrid lose Saturday's Champions League Final against city rivals Atletico and they are sacked.

Beyond Pochettino, Levy is thought to be more interested in De Boer than Benitez and is expected to meet with their fellow decision-makers in the coming days to determine who is the club's No1 choice to succeed Tim Sherwood. Southampton will still offer Pochettino a new deal but the reality is that the club appear resigned to losing their head coach, as well as their Spanish-speaking staff — assistant Jesus Perez, first-team coach Miguel D'Agostino, goalkeeping coach Toni Jimenez and technical support coach Fran Alonso.
Spurs would be required to find a settlement for the contracts of Pochettino and their staff, which are thought to be worth about £4million a year — the most likely stumbling block at this stage. Pochettino is chasing an annual salary of about £3m if they are offered the job at White Hart Lane, as well as pay rises for their support team.
It is thought they are happy to work within Spurs's current structure, involving a technical director to provide the link between the boardroom and the training ground. Currently, that man is Franco Baldini.
Spurs are confident there should not be too much wrangling with Southampton to secure Pochettino, as Saints have already sounded out other managers. Standard Sport understands that Oscar Garcia, the Spaniard who quit as Brighton boss earlier this month, has had a number of conversations with intermediaries and that both Dan Petrescu and Roberto Di Matteo have supporters at St Mary's. Garcia also has interest from Spain, where a number of managerial roles are up for grabs, but it is thought they would prefer to stay in England, where their family are settled.
As of today, De Boer's representatives had received no further contact from Spurs since the original approach last month and neither had Ajax. De Boer's contract does not expire until 2017 and if the Dutch champions are to lose him, they would like the matter resolved quickly. There is little appetite for a period of uncertainty extending far into the summer.
(CNN) President Uhuru Kenyatta won re-election in Kenya on Friday, defeating veteran opposition leader and longtime rival Raila Odinga in a tense contest.
Kenya's election commission declared that the 55-year-old business person and son of the country's founding President had received enough votes to secure a second five-year term.
Kenyatta garnered 54.27% of the final vote, similar to what they had in a preliminary count. Odinga received 44.74%.
The President, in a nationally broadcast speech, said they and their opponent were not enemies.
"We are all citizens of one republic," they said. "As with any competition, there shall always be winners and there shall be losers. But we all belong to one great nation called Kenya."
Kenyatta said they wanted to work with the opposition National Super Alliance (NASA).
"I extend a hand of partnership knowing fully well that this country needs all of us pulling together in order for us to succeed," they said.
Kenya's election commission announced Friday that President Uhuru Kenyatta has won a second term. Opposition candidate Raila Odinga claimed the vote was rigged.
Congratulations came from Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni as well as Rwandan President Paul Kagame, who applauded Kenyatta on Twitter "for a successful election and the trust Kenyans have placed in you!"
The President told their countrymen there was no need for violence.
The nation's top elections official, Wafula Chebukati, said the vote was carried out in a "free, fair and credible manner."
Opposition calls vote a 'charade'
Odinga, a 72-year-old former political prisoner who has campaigned for the presidency four times, is refusing to accept the results , claiming the vote was hacked.
Speaking before the declaration, Musalia Mudavadi, co-principal of NASA, said the organization would not be party to the announcement of Kenyatta as President, citing unresolved concerns about the veracity of the electoral process.
"The issues we raised have not been adequately addressed," they said. "One can conclude that they (Kenya's Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission) were not keen on taking our concerns seriously."
James Orengo, NASA party chief agent, described the process as a "disaster." "This has been an entire charade. The judgment is now out there in the court of public opinion."
Odinga, running as the NASA candidate, told CNN Thursday that they don't "trust" the paper forms from polling stations around the country that officials used to authenticate votes.
Odinga said the forms could have been "manipulated" before being returned to the capital. At a news conference Thursday, members of Odinga's party gave no evidence to support any claims of election tampering, citing only unnamed sources at the election commission.
Kisumu's main street "Oginga Odinga street," named for Raila's father who acted as the country's first vice president, was largely deserted on Friday.
In a letter released Friday morning, Chebukati, the chairperson of the election commission, rejected the opposition coalition's evidence of election fraud, calling it "obviously and plainly falsified."
On Thursday, Chebukati said tampering with the election system "was attempted but did not succeed," without elaborating further.
Monitors urge calm amid fraud allegations
More than 400 international election monitors -- including officials from the United States and the EU -- were deployed across the country to monitor voting, the tallying process and part of the post-election period.
JUST WATCHED John Kerry confident about Kenyan election process Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH John Kerry confident about Kenyan election process 06:42
Former US secretary of State John Kerry, who served as an election observer for the Carter Center, said Thursday that while there were "little aberrations here and there," the election was not rigged.
"If anything was electronically fiddled with, there is a way to go back and absolutely ascertain what happened in the polling station," they said. "So by paper ballots, there is a protection of each and every Kenyan's vote."
Fears of violence
Peaceful elections in East Africa's largest economy would help provide stability to the region but allegations of vote rigging have sparked concern with some Kenyans fearing ethnic clashes similar to those triggered a decade ago.
More than 1,000 died in months of violence and bloodshed after Odinga -- who had been defeated by the then-President Mwai Kibaki -- claimed the 2007 election had been rigged.
Odinga and their party repeatedly called for calm this week as the final results were compiled.
Kenyan security personnel walk towards burning barricades on a road in Kisumu on Wednesday.
Extra security forces have been deployed to the streets of Kenya's capital, Nairobi, interior ministry spokesperson Mwenda Njoka told CNN. Additional police have also been installed at the airport in the western city of Kisumu as a preventative measure, according to Reuters.
Nairobi remained quieter than usual after the national holiday on Tuesday. Some businesses were open in the city center but mostly people were remaining indoors; other residents who went to their home villages to vote might also have stayed away.
In Kisumu, a local journalist described the city center as "a ghost town."
At least two people died in election-related violence after brief protests broke out in several Odinga strongholds -- in Nairobi and Kisumu -- on Wednesday. The day before, a polling agent from Odinga's party was killed in a machete attack in Tana River county.
Odinga's hacking claims this week have ratched up tensions in their strongholds.
"We do not want to see any violence in Kenya. We know the consequences of what happened in 2008 and we don't want to see a repeat of that anymore," Odinga told CNN on Thursday.
"I don't control anybody. What is happening is that people just want to see justice. We also hope that the security forces are not going to use excessive force."
According to current state law, any doctor who wants to prescribe medical marijuana to a child must have a pediatrician and a psychiatrist vet their decision. That's a particularly daunting challenge in New Jersey, where few pediatricians have been willing to agree to patients registering with the state's nascent medical marijuana program.
That challenge could be eased significantly by a bill now advancing in the Legislature: (S-2842/A-4241 would require that children be treated the same as adults when being considered for medical marijuana.
As might be expected, the bill has sparked off considerable controversy in New Jersey's medical community. What's more, Gov. Chris Christie has indicated their skepticism toward allowing children to receive the substance in general and has asked state health officials to review the current regulations.
But for at least one parent, medical marijuana could ease the pain and suffering of their son.
Hope resident Jennie Stormes advocated for the change in the law on behalf of Jackson Stormes, a 14 year old who has used marijuana to reduce the symptoms of Dravet Syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy.
They said the substance has reduced the intensity and duration of their son's seizures, after years of unsuccessful approaches such as brain surgery.
“The additional doctor appointments for a child who has failed so many medications, brain surgery, and other treatments are cruel and the cost is burdensome for a single mother who is working more than one job without any child support,” said Stormes, a pediatric nurse.
“This requirement," they added, "should be the same as all citizens of New Jersey who meet the medical criteria.”
The measure is opposed by the American Academy of Pediatrics' New Jersey chapter, whose members believe their specialized knowledge is essential to making sure that marijuana is appropriate in individual cases. They emphasize that current medical knowledge hasn't reached a consensus on what is the appropriate dosage for children.
“There's very little data on the use of medical marijuana in children,” said Fran Gallagher, the state chapter's executive director. “Therefore, you want to have the very best pediatric expertise.”
Gallagher continued, “There needs to be outreach and education about the fact that the law exists and what the regulations are,” adding that the academy “is behind children having any type of pain medication that's beneficial.”
Stormes noted that clinical work is being done in San Francisco to establish the appropriate doses for children. They also said that allowing New Jersey children to use the substance will increase this knowledge.
According to Stormes, their son has been prescribed other medications for which appropriate doses for children haven't been established.
She's worked to have a primary care doctor and a psychiatrist approve their son's treatment, along with the prescribing doctor. They added that it appears the state will approve their son for the substance, despite the fact that they no longer sees a pediatrician.
Dr. Anthony Anzalone, an advocate of the medical marijuana program, said reducing the requirement to consult with a pediatrician and a psychiatrist for each child “would save a lot of headaches. I think it would be very good.”
If any specialist should be consulted, it should neurologists, Anzalone said. That's because they have the greatest expertise in how the nervous system interacts with cannabinoids, the chemical compounds in marijuana that trigger various effects.
Advocates for children having easier access to medical marijuana said there are other restrictions in the state regulations that should be removed. These include limiting the medical use of the plant to three strains.
Doing so makes it possible to select marijuana that is rich in cannabidiol, or CBD, but has little THC, the compound most strongly associated with "getting stoned."
Stormes said it's important that their son receive the medication without becoming high.
Dr. Sunil Aggarwal, a physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist in New York City, has studied the use of medical marijuana, including cases where it was prescribed to children. They said there are studies over the past decades that have found that CBD can help children with seizure disorders.
“There are a lot of benefits that CBD is able to show,” Aggarwal said, including working as an antipsychotic and providing pain relief without apparent toxic side effects. They said the substance should be studied more, including being used in further clinical trials.
The Senate passed its version of the bill yesterday through a 25-13 vote. The Assembly Budget Committee approved it on a 9-1 vote with two abstentions. While all Democrats on the Assembly committee supported the measure, the Republicans were split, with one in favor, one opposed and two abstaining.
Washington (CNN) In a day filled with a flurry of meetings with national Democratic leaders, Bernie Sanders appeared to acknowledge Thursday that the end of their 2016 White House campaign is drawing near.
The Vermont senator also signaled their commitment to party unity: After meeting with President Barack Obama at the White House, Sanders pledged to work with Hillary Clinton to defeat Donald Trump this fall.
CNN asked Sanders' supporters at a rally here to reflect on the senator's campaign. They expressed a mixture of disappointment and defiance, as well as pride about what Sanders has accomplished. They also shared their trepidation about Clinton and Trump.
Jenn Fendrick, 32, stay-at-home mom from Fairfax, Virginia
Obama endorsed Clinton today. What was your reaction?
It's been pretty clear that she's their chosen successor. And I saw Bernie was walking with Obama in the Rose Garden. So it looks like Bernie is starting to get -- to move to try to unite, I guess, their supporters behind Hillary Clinton. I don't know how successful he'll be.
A lot of friends that I know are not going to vote for Hillary and they're Sanders supporters. A few have even said they'll vote for Trump, which I think is insane. I will vote for Hillary -- not enthusiastically, but they're aligned on most issues. So I'll vote for them
Your friends that say they wouldn't vote for Hillary -- what is their reason?
They all say she's corrupt, she's crooked, she's beholden to Wall Street -- that they lie. They change their line according to what their banker donor friends tell them to do.
How do you feel about the Sanders campaign potentially coming to an end soon?
It's incredibly sad. It's the end of an era -- hopefully not the end of their movement, though ... He's definitely too old to run again, I think. It's incredibly sad.
Guy Gray, 66, retired AV technician who lives in Brazil (voted by absentee ballot in Pennsylvania)
Obama endorsed Clinton today. What was your reaction?
She's got the delegates. After this last election, it looks likely. But you're not the nominee until after the convention so I'm going to be staying tuned.
Do you think there's a chance they may not be the nominee?
Well, if she's indicted. And God forbid, something were to happen to them -- I wouldn't want that. Bernie's in the running until the convention, as far as I'm concerned.
Would you support Clinton?
There are so many negatives about Hillary that I can't say I'll support them But I will vote for them if it's the best chance of defeating Trump. And I do like the idea of a woman president.
Would you support Trump?
No. Trump's a bigot, a buffoon and speaks without thinking. We can't afford a president who shoots their mouth off.
How do you feel about the Sanders campaign potentially coming to an end soon?
There's been insurgencies within the Democratic Party. In my lifetime it was Jesse Jackson, (Dennis) Kucinich, I supported (Ralph) Nader ... I think (Sanders) has taken that kind of progressive movement for social change and increased the popularity of it. ... They probably won't succeed but he's gone further than any of the others have. And I think that's the history of social change in this country.
Sam Mbulaiteye, 50, researcher from Silver Spring, Maryland
Obama endorsed Clinton today. What was your reaction?
I was disappointed. I think Bernie's message is closer to Obama's message in 2008 -- it's a message of change, hope and about the future. Conceptually, they're closer because they are forward-looking, getting young people to be engaged in politics ... using diplomacy instead of war.
Would you support Clinton?
I'm not sure. I'm watching to see how they incorporate their messages in their programs.
Would you support Trump?
Again, I'm not sure. In terms of being anti-establishment, Trump is closer to Bernie Sanders.
Carlos Rivera, 18, a senior at Woodbridge High School in Woodbridge, Virginia
How do you feel about the Sanders campaign potentially coming to an end soon?
It'd discourage. When you hear the supporting but you don't see the numbers, it's like, what's going on?
Would you support Clinton?
If they change the way she's campaigning, I might vote for them They need to stop saying things just to get votes. They need to own up to what she's saying and put their money where their mouth is.
Would you support Trump?
No. Definitely not.
Obama endorsed Clinton today. What was your reaction?
It was surprising. Wasn't they just with Sanders, as well? They leaf and all of a sudden you're like, 'Oh, I support Hillary.' So I was kind of shocked by that.
Do you think Obama's endorsement will matter?
It kind of matters because of course some people are going to be like, 'Barack Obama supports them so I might as well support them as well.'
Why are you a Sanders supporter?
He's for the people and he's not doing this just for them -- he's doing this because they really does care about the people.
Claire Ryberg, 24, software engineer from Virginia
Obama endorsed Clinton today. What was your reaction?
I can't say that I'm terribly surprised. I'm obviously still going to hold out to hope -- it's not over until it's over, but you can kind of read the writing on the wall.
Would you support Clinton?
I want to see what happens with -- the current situation with the emails, I want to find out more about that. I can't in good conscience support Trump. I will not be voting for him.
What kind of information do you think you need about the emails?
I think it would be nationally embarrassing to elect somebody who is then indicted ... I think it would be pretty bad if we elected somebody who was either convicted of something, or something along those lines.
She's obviously a very capable politician who has a long-standing career and a lot of experience and it would be wonderful to have the first woman president, but I don't want to elect somebody who then goes to jail.
How do you feel about the Sanders campaign potentially coming to an end soon?
I'm frustrated that it seems like in the media's eyes, they were never painted as if they had a chance because I think they really did. I think they really did.
To become more flexible, Ansible offers the possibility to use variables in loops, but also to use information the target system provides.
Background
Ansible uses variables to enable more flexibility in playbooks and roles. They can be used to loop through a set of given values, access various information like the hostname of a system and replace certain strings in templates by system specific values. Variables are provided through the inventory, by variable files, overwritten on the command line and set in Tower.
But note that variable names have some restrictions in Ansible:
Variable names should be letters, numbers, and underscores. Variables should always start with a letter.
If the variable in question is a dictionary, a key/value pair, it can be referenced both by bracket and dot notation:
foo.bar foo['bar']
The question is however: how to use variables? And how to get them in the first place?
Variables and loops
Loops are arguably among the most common use cases of variables in general – the same is true for Ansible. While they are not using variables provided externally, I'd like to start with loops to give a first idea how to use them. To copy a set of files it is either possible to write a task for each file or to just loop through them:
tasks: - name: copy files copy: src={{ item }} dest=/tmp/{{ item }} with_items: - alha - beta
This already shows simple basics: variables can be used in module arguments, and they are referenced via curly brackets {{ }} .
Variables and templates
More importantly, variables can be used to substitute keys in configuration files with system or run-time specific values. Imagine a file which containing the actual host name simply copied over from a central source to the clients. In case of one hundred machines there would be one hundred copies of the configuration file on the server, all almost identical except for the corresponding host name. That is a waste of time and space.
It's better to have one copy of the configuration file, with a variable as place-maker instead of the host names – this is where templates come into play:
$ cat template.j2 My host name is {{ ansible_hostname }}.
The Ansible module to use templates and activate variable substitution is the template module:
tasks: - name: copy template template: src=template.j2 dest="/tmp/abcapp.conf"
When this task is run against a set of systems, the all get a file called abcapp.conf containing the individual host name of the given system.
This is again a simple example, but shows the basics: in templates variables are also referenced by {{ }} . Templates can become much more sophisticated, but I will try to cover that in another post.
Using variables in conditions
Variables can be used as conditions, thus ensuring that certain tasks are only run when for example on a given host the requested variable is set to a certain value:
tasks: - name: install Apache on Solaris pkg5: name=web/server/apache-24 when: ansible_os_family == "Solaris" - name: install Apache on RHEL yum: name=httpd when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
In this case, the first task is only applied on Red Hat Enterprise Linux servers, while the second is only run on Solaris machines.
Getting variables from the system
Using variables is one thing, but they need to be defined first. I have covered so far some use cases of variables, but not where to get them.
Ansible already defines a rich set of variables, individual for each system: whenever Ansible is run on a system all facts and information about the system are gathered and set as a variable. The available variables can be output via the setup module:
$ ansible neon -m setup neon | success >> { "ansible_facts": { "ansible_all_ipv4_addresses": [ "192.168.122.203" ], "ansible_all_ipv6_addresses": [ "fe80::5054:ff:feba:9db3" ], "ansible_architecture": "x86_64", "ansible_bios_date": "04/01/2014", ...
All these variables can be used in templates, but also in the playbooks themselves as mentioned above in the conditions example. Roles can take advantage of these variables as well, of course.
Getting variables from the command line
Another way to define variables is to call Ansible playbooks with the option --extra-vars :
$ ansible-playbook --extra-vars "cli_var=production" system-setup.yml
The reference is again via the {{ }} brackets:
$ cat template.j2 environment: {{ cli_var }}.
Setting variables in playbooks
A more direct way is to define variables in playbooks directly, with the key vars :
... hosts: all vars: play_var: bar tasks: ...
This can be extended by including an actual yaml file containing variables:
... hosts: all include_vars: setupvariables.yml tasks: ...
Including further files with more variables comes in extremly handy when the variables for each system are kept in a system specific file, like $HOSTNAME.yml , because the included variable file can again be a variable:
... hosts: all include_vars: "{{ ansible_hostname }}.yml" tasks: ...
In this case, the playbook reads in specific variables for each corresponding host – this way it is possible to set for example different virtual host names for Apache servers, or different backup systems in case of separated data centers.
Setting variables in the inventory
Sometimes it might make more sense to define specific variables in the already set up inventory:
[clients] helium intevent_var=helium_123 neon invent_var=bar
The inventory more or less treats any argument which is not Ansible specific as a host variable.
It is also possible to set variables for entire host groups:
[clients] helium neon [clients:vars] invent_var=group-foo
Setting variables in the inventory makes sense when different teams use the same set of Ansible roles and playbooks but have different machine setups which need specific treatment at each location.
Setting variables on a system: local facts
Variables can also be set by dumping specialized files onto the system: when Ansible accesses a remote system it checks for the directory /etc/ansible/facts.d and all files ending in .fact are read. The files can be of various formats – INI, JSON, or even executables which return JSON code. This offers the possibility to add even generic fact providers via scripting.
For example:
$ cat /etc/ansible/facts.d/variables.fact [system] foo=bar dim=dum
The variables can be displayed via the setup module:
$ ansible neon -m setup ... "type": "loopback" }, "ansible_local": { "variables": { "system": { "dim": "dum", "foo": "bar" } } }, "ansible_machine": "x86_64", ...
Using the results of tasks: registered variables
The results of a task during a playbook run can also be stored inside a variable – together with conditionals this enables a playbook to react to the results of the given task with other tasks.
For example, given that an httpd service needs to run. If the service does not run, the entire server should be powered down immediately to ensure that no data corruption takes place. The corresponding playbook checks the httpd service, ignores errors but instead analyses the result and powers down the machine if the service cannot be started:
--- - name: register example hosts: all sudo: yes tasks: - name: start service service: name=httpd state=started ignore_errors: True register: service_result - name: shutdown command: "shutdown -h +1m" when: service_result | failed
Another example would be to trigger a function to remove the host from the loadbalancer. Or to check if the database is available and would otherwise immediately close down the front firewall.
Accessing variables of other hosts
Last but not least it might be interesting to access the variables (read: facts) of other hosts. This can of course only be done if the facts are actually available.
If this is given, the data can be accessed via the hostvars key. The value for the key is the name given in the inventory.
Groups from within the inventory can also be accessed. That makes it possible to loop through a list of hosts in a group and for example gather all IP addresses or host names or other data.
The following template first accesses the host name of the machine “tower” and afterwards collects all the epoch data of all machines:
Tower name is: {{ hostvars['tower']['ansible_hostname'] }} The epochs of the clients are: {% for host in groups['clients'] %} - {{ hostvars[host]['ansible_date_time']['epoch'] }} {% endfor %}
The code for the loop is actual line statement of the Jinja2 template engine. The engine also offers if statements and other common operations.
This comes in handy in simple cases like filling the /etc/hosts , but can also empower admins to for example fill in the data of a loadbalancer or a firewall configuration.
Conclusion
Varialbes are a very powerful feature within Ansible to enrich the functionality it provides. Together with templates and the Jinja2 template and language engine the possibilities are almost endless. And sooner or later every admin will leave the simple Ansible calls and playbooks behind and start diving into variables, templates, and loops through variables of other hosts. To make system automation even easier.

Odroid C2/C1+ Paper Case (for free)
rodrigo Blocked Unblock Follow Nov 26, 2016
Not a long ago, I bought a wonderful board called Odroid C2. Athough ithas neither half nor a third of the community of my already retired raspberry, it is a product of the highest quality and reliability. I decided to start installing all the things I needed to make it fully functional. When I had it all ready, there was only one thing missing … A case …
Since I do not have a 3D printer (for now) I decided to put my hands to work and make my own paper case.
These were the files with the measures
After some time searching the web for the measures of the board I quitted, and started downloading random 3D modeling files from other Odroid cases to take the measures of them. I thank the person that made the file above, because it was the only file where I could find some numbers to do the paper case.
After some hours in front of photoshop I was able to say that I had “A pretty decent case”. And here it is :
I know ! It's not a picasso … But It's a cool case and you can put some stickers on it !!
I recommend you to print the pdf file on the thickest piece of card your printer can handle. Alternatively, print on a plain paper and glue that to a piece of thick card.
You can download the file here for free !!
Enjoy, if you have any improvement to do on the project just contact me or tell me something on the comments !
I hope you enjoyed my project !
See you around ;)
Icelandic band Sigur Rós will add their voice to Australia's fight for marriage equality, in the wake of Margaret Court's homophobic comments. ((L), Sigur Rós Facebook , (R) Cameron Spencer/Getty Images)
The popular band have released a statement saying they'd learned of Margaret Court's recent homophobic comments, and rather than moving venues, decided to use their gig to help campaign for the legalisation of same-sex marriage in Australia.
Icelandic band Sigur Rós are scheduled to play a stadium show at the Margaret Court Arena on July 27.
Today, the popular rock band released a statement explaining that they had learned about the recent homophobic and transphobic comments made by tennis champion Margaret Court, who the arena is named after.
They have promised to make their show "the most inclusive night ever", and will be selling a t-shirt exclusive to the the band's Australian shows, from which all proceeds will go to Australian Marriage Equality (AME).
The band explains that friends and fans expressed concerns that they were playing a show at the arena after the comments, and so they wanted to both address these concerns, and "add their voice to the call for marriage equality" by defiantly playing the gig at the venue.
“We know Margaret Court's opinions are not shared by the majority of Australians. We want to add our voice to the call for marriage equality in Australia – right here on Margaret Court Arena itself.
"Australia should be a country that celebrates positivity and inclusion, as well as achievement on the sporting field.”
“Let's make 27 July Margaret Court Arena's most inclusive night ever and call for every Australian to have the same dignity and respect right here on centre court.”
"We want to add our voice to the call for marriage equality in Australia – right here on Margaret Court Arena itself."
Margaret Court has received widespread backlash since May, when they announced they would be boycotting Qantas due to its public support for marriage equality, as well as the personal support for same-sex marriage from CEO Alan Joyce - who is openly gay.
After media coverage of Court's comments grew, the former champion doubled down, and told the 20Twenty Vision Christian Radio program that they believed that transgender people were "the work of the devil" and the agenda to 'create' trans children is similar "to what Hitler and communism did". Shortly after this, they told a 3AW radio show that these comments were all taken out of context, but they do believe that most transgender children were sexually abused as children.
A number of famous tennis players have spoken out against Court's comments, including Martina Navratilova and Sam Stosur.
Sigur Rós explained in their open letter that their country, Iceland, legalised same-sex marriage in 2010, while being led by open gay Prime Minister Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir - they were also one of the first people in Iceland to marry under the new legislation.
‘Things are completely different to last year' says Stevenage boss Sarll
Darren Sarll Archant
Darren Sarll is looking forward to the League Two openers against Crewe Alexandra, saying that he's pleased that the ‘real stuff' is about to begin.
Share Email this article to a friend To send a link to this page you must be logged in.
Wins over Brighton & Hove Albion and MK Dons in pre-season have put Boro in an optimistic mood ahead of tomorrow's game at the Lamex Stadium, with Sarll saying he'd rate their club's pre-season at an eight or a nine out of 10.
Boro face Crewe with just one or two injury niggles – Rowan Liburd and Charlie Lee – but Sarll believes their side is in a ‘good place' ahead of the match.
The Stevenage boss said: “I'm looking forward to it; it's been a good six weeks of pre-season so I'm very much looking forward to getting into the real stuff now. The trying and the testing [is over], it's now about performance and results.”
Sarll has so far managed 17 games as Boro boss. Following the sacking of Teddy Sheringham back in February the 33-year-old was initially appointed in a caretaker role before being handed the full-time job at the end of the season.
After a jittery run of just two victories in their first eight matches in charge, when the new boss was coming to terms with a squad sixth-bottom plus low in both quality and confidence, Sarll says things are different now that they have had a full pre-season behind him.
“It's completely different to last year. Obviously we're at the start [of the season] and we're not in front or behind,” Sarll said.
“When you're going into games where potentially the longevity of the academy or peoples' jobs in the office are at stake [if relegated] it brings in a different type of thinking.
“I was nervous. I definitely had butterflies in those games. I think the Bristol Rovers one at home [April 19, 0-0] we were a point off safety and I'm thinking to myself ‘come on, just one more push chaps' and I've been saying it to them every week.
“We got over the line and then you feel differently. Then the attention turns to earning the job and making sure I come out of that situation with the permanence of being the manager here.
“It's completely different and hard to explain. I'm just excited to have an opportunity to right our wrongs and have a fantastic opportunity to be the manager of my local club. There are no nerves. I'm just ready and raring to get going.”
In recent days Sarll has spoken about the ‘madness and chaos' leading up to and including the opening match, which sees Boro face an opponent who were relegated from League One last season, but Sarll says they must remain calm and so must their players.
“I think you get more out of the first game than any other game. Emotions are elevated. People just do a little bit more [and there is the] excitement, adrenaline and enthusiasm,” they said.
“It's 12 or so games before the league starts to settle down. The opening day is a real tough day to keep the players calm, thinking clearly on what you've done.
“I want them to be focused on what the objective is and go about overcoming that objective. Whatever comes to us on Saturday it's a really tough game but the good news is we're at [home]. It's a real bonus for us and I can't wait to walk out at the Lamex.”

Luis Suarez says they owe a debt of gratitude to Liverpool FC fans for helping them produce the best form of their career as they insisted: “I know I can achieve my dreams here.”
In an exclusive interview with the ECHO, the Uruguayan striker spoke candidly about life with the Reds and their hopes for the future.
Suarez has lit up the Premier League with their scintillating performances so far this season. They have plundered 23 goals in just 21 league games and is on course to claim the Golden Boot and be crowned Player of the Year.
However, the 27-year-old insists their burning ambition is to help Brendan Rodgers' side bring Champions League football back to Anfield.
Suarez wants to reward those supporters who stood by them after the events of last summer when they came close to leaving the club.
“The fans have helped me so much,” Suarez told the ECHO.
“Everyone knows that I had some difficult times last summer.
“But they have always supported me and always had confidence in me. I really feel that support in my heart.”

[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 177 (Thursday, December 8, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1657-E1658] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov] INTRODUCING THE STOP ARMING TERRORISTS ACT OF 2016 ______ HON. TULSI GABBARD of hawaii in the house of representatives Thursday, December 8, 2016 Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, under U.S. law it is illegal for any American to provide money or assistance to al Qaeda, ISIS or other terrorist groups. If you or I gave money, weapons or support to al- Qaeda or ISIS, we would be thrown in jail. Yet the U.S. government has been violating this law for years, quietly supporting allies and partners of al Qaeda, ISIL, Jabhat Fateh al Sham and other terrorist groups with money, weapons, and intelligence support, in their fight to overthrow the Syrian government. The CIA has also been funneling weapons and money through Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar and others who provide direct and indirect support to groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda. This support has allowed al- Qaeda and their fellow terrorist organizations to establish strongholds throughout Syria, including in Aleppo. A recent New York Times article confirmed that ``rebel groups'' supported by the U.S. ``have entered into battlefield alliances with the affiliate of al-Qaeda in Syria, formerly known as Al Nusra.'' This alliance has rendered the phrase ``moderate rebels'' meaningless. Reports confirm that ``every armed anti-Assad organization unit in those provinces [of Idlib and Aleppo] is engaged in a military structure controlled by [al-Qaeda's] Nusra militants.'' A recent Wall Street Journal article reported that many rebel groups are ``doubling down on their alliance'' with al Nusrah. Some rebel groups are renewing their alliance, while others, like Nour al-Din al- Zinki, a former CIA-backed group and one of the largest factions in Aleppo, are joining for the first time. ``The Syria Conquest Front--formerly known as the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front--is deeply intermingled with armed opposition groups of all stripes across Syria's battlefields.'' The CIA has long been supporting a group called Fursan al Haqq, providing them with salaries, weapons and support, including surface to air missiles. This group is cooperating with and fighting alongside an al-Qaeda affiliated group trying to overthrow the Syrian government. The Levant Front is another so-called moderate umbrella group of Syrian opposition fighters. Over the past year, the United States has been working with Turkey to give this group intelligence support and other forms of military assistance. This group has joined forces with al-Qaeda's offshoot group in Syria. This madness must end. We must stop arming terrorists. The Government must end this hypocrisy and abide by the same laws that apply to its' citizens. That is why I've introduced the Stop Arming Terrorists bill-- legislation based on congressional action during the Iran-Contra affair to stop the CIA's illegal arming of rebels in Nicaragua. It will prohibit any Federal agency from using taxpayer dollars to provide weapons, cash, intelligence, or any support to al Qaeda, ISIS and other terrorist groups, and it will prohibit the government from funneling money [[Page E1658]] and weapons through other countries who are directly or indirectly supporting terrorists. ____________________
In this article, https://hyperallergic.com/155078/guarding-jeff-koons/, by the Hyperallergic website about museum guards there was a photograph of what appears to be a young girl and an adult male in a sexual position.It is very graphic and pornographic in nature. This was done in 1989 as part of a “Made in Heaven” exhibit with an Italian porn star who later became their wife (http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/koons-made-in-heaven-ar00080). Although this was assumed to be their wife, the proportions of the young girl in question do not appear to be that of an adult female or the Italian porn star they asked to do this with, but this is not confirmed. Alefantis' post on their Instagram that contains this photograph from the museum is below. (Has been edited to remove the pornographic part.)
As an aside it also can be seen here that “mr_scott_cummings” uses German to say they are pleased or it pleases me, depending on which translation is correct (https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090924034728AA0B3oD) for the two children that are in a lot of James Alefantis' posts, as they say they are the godfather of at least one of them, that goes by #caris and sometimes #carisjames for perhaps when they take their places.  They are seen with Euro dollars that they have put in their mouth as when the picture was taken they were between 1 and 2 years old. Alefantis says the money is hers. The account to https://www.instagram.com/mrsoliar/ is now private but contained images that involved interactions with teens and photos of children that looked highly inappropriate.
Identified as Scott Cummings. According to some researchers at voat (https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1429017), they were able to find this interview with them which bears some resemblance to the above picture, but much younger. Their favorite day is April 25, which is the picture they commented on of the girl in the yellow dress, and is Alice Day. Use your imagination for that one. http://www.hercampus.com/school/aberdeen/campus-celeb-mr-scott-cummings?utm_campaign=shareaholic&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=socialnetwork.
Koons is heavily involved with the Clintons, in fact they gave them a medal for international exchange for the arts (https://news.artnet.com/art-world/jeff-koons-endorses-hillary-clinton-712139) and they also endorsed them for president because they said they would do more for the art world. According to the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, Jeff Koons and their Koons Family Institute is heavily involved in this organization. In part this was due to their ex-wife, whom they posed with for their sexual art in 1989, taking their son and never finding them again. This is the official website for this organization: https://www.icmec.org/.
Because of Laura Silsby being caught, it came out that the Clintons had deep ties to them and their organization that tried to traffick children out of Haiti, and was finally able to be charged the second time. This was about the New Life Children's Refuge, and later a student named Monica Petersen was ‘suicided' while investigating the role of the Clinton foundation as part of their research for their thesis (here is some testimony they gave while a research fellow at the Human Trafficking Center: http://www.leg.state.co.us/Clics/Clics2015A/commsumm.nsf/b4a3962433b52fa787256e5f00670a71/c7210a3a7ccb122c87257ddb006f5a66/$FILE/15SenJud0128AttachE.pdf). A very interesting statement made in the Wall Street Journal report on this matter states that “Steve McMullen, a longtime friend of the Sander family in Idaho, said they spoke by phone to Ms. Silsby while they were in the Dominican Republic, and that during the call they said they were in a government office registering the names of the children their group was intending to bring back into the country from Haiti.” (https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704533204575047720443045194). And goes on to discuss how trafficking children in Haiti is something that has been and continues to be an on-going problem.
Laura Silsby is now married and goes by the name Laura Gayler. Interestingly enough they worked for a company called Alert Sense, who help with Amber Alert system (https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1932615). Perhaps because of the reporting on this the website shows them no longer as VP of marketing (https://alertsense.com/company/leadership/von-hansen/).

HILLARY CLINTON Loses 11 Points in WaPo ABC News Poll in ONE WEEK
Never trust the Liberal Media….
Hillary Clinton was ahead of Trump by 12 points last weekend.
The crap poll made headlines for days
Today Hillary is up by one point.
There poll last week was complete fiction. And now they are trying to cover their a$$ before the election.
Watch Donald Trump pull ahead by 5 points in the next week.
Lange Research reported:
A slim point separates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in the latest ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll results, cementing Trump's resurgence in the past week and marking the potentially critical role of turnout in the election's outcome. The race stands at 46-45 percent, Clinton-Trump, in the latest results, so tight that the draw by third-party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein could matter. Clinton, +1 vs. Trump in a fourway trial heat, is +3 head-to-head – not a significant difference, but suggestive.
In March 1877, James Starley, a sewing-machine maker in Coventry, England, unveiled a strange offshoot of the tricycle. It had one large wheel on the left and two much smaller ones on the right. The rider sat between the wheels, driving with a pair of levers and steering on a crank. A few years later, Starley's new designs had grown so popular that the queen bought two for herself.
Whereas the history of two-wheeled vehicles starts in 1817, when a German named Karl Drais devised a “running machine” that worked like a Flintstones car, inventors had long been much more forward-thinking when it came to trikes. A watchmaker, Stephan Farfler, built a three-wheeled, hand-powered vehicle in the 17th century, and lever-driven, three-wheeled “pilentums” or “accelerators” were around by 1820. “There were half a dozen kinds of tricycles in Germany and France and England,” says Glen Norcliffe, a geographer and tricycle historian at York University, “but they never really took off. They were prototypes.”

By the 1860s, biking was a mainstream pastime. Huge front wheels made for fast machines, with riders perched unsteadily on top. As the hobby grew more popular, some sought a safer ride — for women and older men. “At first, Starley tried to do this with a sort of sidesaddle penny-farthing, a crablike machine that never worked,” Norcliffe says. “Eventually they decided that they needed another wheel to balance it.” So they produced something more like the old pilentums. Soon Starley had a three-wheeled vehicle that worked with pedals and a chain and rack-and-pinion steering. The boom that they created quickly ended, though. By the turn of the century, both men and women were riding safety bikes, with wheels of equal size and better tires. And the market for bigger, more expensive machines shifted from the trike to the automobile.
The tricycle ended up a child's toy. It reached its apogee when Louis Marx & Company made the Big Wheel out of molded plastic in 1969. Kids could now sit just off the ground and skid their way around tight corners. In 1974, The Times called the Big Wheel “a fast-moving, three-wheel plastic riding toy that is the tricycle of the throwaway generation.”

In an early test of Wisconsin's new weapons law, Milwaukee police are seeking concealed weapon charges against an area gun rights activist who was wearing a gun in their car - before getting a new state permit.
Krysta Sutterfield was arrested early Friday outside a closed Sherman Park coffee shop, where they were using a computer inside their parked car - while wearing their ever-present handgun. They were jailed overnight, and their gun has been confiscated.
Sutterfield, 42, made news last year when they openly wore the gun to services at a Brookfield church and was arrested afterward. They were not formally charged, and they later settled a false arrest lawsuit against the city for $7,500.
Earlier this year, Sutterfield went to court for the return of a gun seized by Milwaukee police after their therapist reported Sutterfield had made a suicidal comment. A national gun rights attorney sharply criticized how police revealed confidential medical information about Sutterfield to a judge without notice to Sutterfield in gun court.
On Tuesday, they entered not guilty pleas to two municipal citations from Friday: for loitering or prowling and obstructing an officer, said their attorney, Rebecca Coffee.
But Milwaukee police also referred a charge of carrying a concealed weapon to prosecutors. Coffee said they and Sutterfield met Monday with an assistant district attorney who's reviewing the matter.
"My client very much believes they were within their rights," Coffee said. "But the issue remains unresolved - what effect does elimination of the unlawful transport (of a gun) statute have on the new concealed carry law?"
Coffee said Wisconsin case law had defined concealing a weapon pretty broadly, to include having a gun on the front passenger seat of a vehicle.
But much has changed since Wisconsin's adoption of Act 35, which allows residents to get permits to carry concealed guns and altered longtime rules about transporting handguns in vehicles.
Guidelines from the Department of Justice clearly state even someone without a concealed-carry permit can now have a loaded, uncased handgun in their vehicle. However, the handgun "cannot be hidden or concealed and within reach."
Coffee said Sutterfield was careful to have their jacket tucked up and behind their hip holster so their gun would not be considered hidden or concealed.
"It's understandable that people want to know what's legal and what's not legal," Coffee said. "There's some unresolved interpretation here."
Close followers of the gun law changes saw this kind of issue coming. Nik Clark, president of Wisconsin Carry, Inc., said that "in an abundance of caution," the group has recommended that members put their handguns on the dashboard or the seat next to them.
Milwaukee police spokesperson Anne E. Schwarz said police did a normal field interrogation of Sutterfield because they were parked outside a closed business after midnight, in an area that has experienced several burglaries. They said they couldn't discuss more about the case since the charges are still pending.
Sutterfield hand-delivered their application for Wisconsin concealed carry permit on Nov. 1, the first day they could be submitted, Coffee said, but had not yet received the permit. As of Tuesday, some 37,000 applications had been submitted, according to the state Department of Justice.
Mental health issue
Them March contact with police over possible mental health concerns apparently will not affect their application. The law denies a permit only to someone who has been committed for mental health treatment, not those subjected to short-term emergency detention and released. Police took a gun from Sutterfield and they petitioned for its return two days later. They had court hearings in May and July.
According to court records regarding that incident:
Sutterfield's doctor called Milwaukee police around noon on March 22 after Sutterfield stated during a therapy session that they were so upset they might go home and blow their brains out.
Police went to Sutterfield's house around 2:30 p.m., but the therapist told them Sutterfield was fine and they should leave them alone. Police returned at 9 p.m., confiscated Sutterfield's Glock pistol and some ammunition, and took them to the county's mental health complex for an emergency detention.
Two days later, Sutterfield filed a petition to get their gun back. They alleged the March 22 visit from police resulted from a misunderstanding about an expired welfare check. "I'm not a danger to anyone except an attacker," they wrote.
Before a May hearing, a police official sent Circuit Judge Rebecca Dallet a letter asking the gun not be returned because of the therapist's concern and the fact Sutterfield had been taken in on an emergency detention.
Sutterfield was not given a copy or notice of the letter. At the May hearing, they produced a letter from their current psychotherapist stating that at an April 6 session, they had no concern that Sutterfield might be a danger to themselves or others. Sutterfield said the police officer in charge of gun returns, Michael Perez, had told them that's what they would need to bring to the hearing.
Assistant District Attorney Christopher Rawsthorne said they had concerns about the letter, and Dallet said they would have to call the doctor to verify the statement before proceeding. Dallet said they couldn't immediately reach the doctor and would have to put the hearing off until July.
Then Sutterfield involved John Monroe, a Georgia lawyer who specializes in gun rights litigation nationwide and has represented Wisconsin Carry Inc., and its members in federal lawsuits challenging arrests around Wisconsin over the open wearing of guns
In a legal brief, Monroe argued it was improper for police, without going through the city's lawyer, to contact the judge directly, especially without giving notice or a copy of the letter to Sutterfield. They also said the letter unlawfully disclosed confidential medical records concerning Sutterfield, even though they did not address any of the statutory criteria for not returning their gun.
Monroe also called it irregular and unfair for Dallet to conduct their own investigation into the veracity of the doctor's letter Sutterfield presented at the May hearing.
"In short, a naked desire for the City to disarm Petitioner is inadequate to support a permanent confiscation of their property," Monroe wrote.
A week after the brief was submitted, Dallet ordered Sutterfield's gun returned.
Each year, tens of thousands of Indian students head to the U.S. in order to get a college degree, finds a job and pursue the American Dream.
But as India's economy booms and the U.S. continues to tighten its immigration policies, many of these young Indian professionals are making their way back home instead.
Natasha Jain, 28, is one of them.
Originally from Ambala in Northern India, they graduated with a master's degree from Stanford University in 2012, landed a good-paying job in Silicon Valley and even started their own company. But they struggled with the constraints of the U.S. visa system and eventually gave it all up.
"Within just three years of moving back [to India], I have been able to establish a tech startup and manufacturing business and create many job opportunities," said Jain. "All of this would have been harder for me to do as a foreigner living in the U.S."
India's fast-growing $2 trillion economy means there are more opportunities for Indians like Jain to find work or start their own ventures. The Indian government, too, is aggressively courting non-resident Indians with programs such as Startup India, designed to ease bureaucratic restrictions and provide funding.
But there's also an undercurrent of nervousness and anxiety that is spurring more Indian expatriates to return home as well.
"The Trump administration is pursuing more stringent immigration policies, which could make it much harder for us to stay in America," said Mani Karthik, 36, who worked at a technology consulting firm in Silicon Valley before returning to India earlier this year.
Karthik pointed to the RAISE Act, which President Trump endorsed earlier this month. The proposed bill seeks to cut legal immigration to the U.S. by 50% within a decade. "These policies send a message that rules are going to be stricter and tougher," they said.
Many Indians have also grown concerned about increasing violence against foreign born workers, they added. Earlier this year, two Indian-American engineers were shot, and one of them killed in Olathe, Kansas in an incident law enforcement investigated as an alleged hate crime.
"Unfortunate hate crimes against Indians... have shocked me. They've shocked a lot of us," Karthik said. "I started to think maybe this isn't the right time for me to stay in the U.S.," they said.

Karthik came to the U.S. in 2010 on an H-1B visa sponsored by a telecommunications company, where they did consult work for some of the biggest firms in Silicon Valley. Later, another employer sponsored them for a green card, which would have given them permanent legal residency status.
"I was maybe two years away from getting it," they said.
Karthik wanted to stay. "But I made a big U-turn," they said. "There's so much uncertainty here now about immigration and attitudes toward immigrants. I wasn't happy."
While they were preparing to leave the U.S. Karthik launched ReturntoIndiakit.com, which features a checklist of helpful content about how to wind down life in America and start anew in India. The site explains things like how to sell your house and car, apply for an Indian version of a Social Security card and how to pick the fastest Internet service in India.
Since its launch in March, the site has had close to 700,000 visits, Karthik said.
Karthik knows of five people who have used the site and relocated to India. "Five or 10 years ago, none of these conversations would be taking place about going back to India, " they said.
Karthik arrived in India in May and he's already gearing up to launch an online publishing startup. "I'll have it registered by the end of the month," they said.
"Reverse brain drain"
When it comes to student visas in the U.S., India ranks second only to China, accounting for every sixth international student studying in the U.S., according to the State Department. In 2016, the U.S. issued more than 62,000 students visas to Indian nationals -- that's nearly two and half times the number of student visas it issued to Indians in 2011.
Over the past couple of decades, India lost much of its young professional talent to the U.S., said Devesh Kapur, professor of political science at University of Pennsylvania.
While exact numbers are hard to come by, Kapur said anecdotal evidence indicates that a growing number of graduates are now returning to India after gaining a few years of experience in America. "It's not huge but it is noticeably picking up," said Kapur.
"On average, Indians have to wait at least 10 years to get a green card if they want to transition to it from an H-1B," they said. "That's a long time to put your life on hold. And who know if policies can keep changing in the interim."
After graduating from Stanford with a graduate degree in management science and engineering in 2012, Jain landed a full-time job as a supply chain manager at a medical devices firm on an H-1B work visa. They also had a side business, a startup called Freshmentors, that they had worked on with classmates while at Stanford.
But juggling their new job and launching the business -- a fee-based online college mentoring platform to help international students through the process of applying to U.S. colleges -- proved more challenging than they expected.
Them visa status presented the biggest hurdle.

"As an H-1B employee with one company, I can't also be employed by another company and earn money at the second company," they said. "I can have equity in my business and be a shareholder but can't earn a salary."
Jain decided they wanted to be their own boss.
So they shut down Freshmentors and returned to India in 2014, armed with a business plan for another startup: Ruplee, a mobile payment app.
They built the platform, found retail partners and amassed users. Two years later, Ruplee was acquired. "By then, we had one million users and 1,500 merchants using it," Jain said.
Jain is now on their third startup, Bent Chair, an online furniture and home decor business they co-launched with their father in 2016. It employs 100 people, half of them artisans and designers. The startup has logged more than $1 million in sales and they are looking to expand both in India and internationally.
"The trend of reverse brain drain is increasing," said Jain. "Given the excessive visa restrictions, a lot of people are choosing to move back."
"Also, coming back to India with everything you have learned in the U.S. always gives you a great advantage," they said.
Measles could have been eradicated in New Zealand by now if it were not for anti-vaccine campaigners and conspiracy theorists, public health experts say.
As a new map emerges that shows the effects of anti-vaccine scares worldwide, the Immunisation Advisory Centre says low rates of vaccination in pockets of this country remain a concern.
This comes as two more cases of measles are diagnosed in Auckland, adding to about 30 cases nationwide since December.
Many of these were attributed to an outbreak originating in the Philippines, arriving in New Zealand via a hip-hop dance competition in Sydney.
The two latest cases are not thought to be linked.
In 1998, a study by British doctor Andrew Wakefield was published in international medical journal The Lancet, linking the triple MMR vaccine - for measles, mumps and rubella - with an increased risk of autism.
Thousands of parents boycotted the MMR jab before the research was eventually discredited. Wakefield's results could not be replicated, and they were struck off by the General Medical Council in 2010.
But an interactive map produced by the Council on Foreign Relations think tank shows the legacy of their errors continues, as some anti-vaccine campaigners argue that all vaccines are dangerous.
The map shows spikes in childhood diseases that experts attribute at least partly to the Wakefield effect and which they say could have been prevented.
In New Zealand, preventable outbreaks include 274 cases of whooping cough in Auckland in 2012, and 328 in the West Coast that same year. Also highlighted are hundreds of measles of cases nationwide since 2008.
"There's still the myth that there's a problem with this [measles] vaccine," Immunisation Advisory Centre director of research Helen Petousis-Harris said.
"It's taken many, many years to reassure people that this isn't the case. It's not only about protecting yourself but the rest of the population as well, and it is a disease we can eradicate if we get the rates up high enough."
New Zealand has its own anti-immunisation group, which was struck off the charities register for promoting a view that vaccination was "ineffective and dangerous".
Warnings About Vaccine Expectations, or WAVESnz - formerly the Immunisation Awareness Society - was unavailable to speak to The Dominion Post yesterday.
Wellington regional public health medical officer of health Margot McLean said officials still encountered parents who were worried about links to autism from vaccines.
"The concern still reverberates . . . it has set us back in terms of the goal of eradication." Immunisation rates in New Zealand have improved to 93 per cent of all children at age 2, which includes at least one dose of the measles vaccine. The government's target is 95 per cent.
In the early 90s, rates in some areas were as low as 50 per cent.
But the people most at risk during recent outbreaks were those whose parents may not have had them immunised during the height of the Wakefield scare, McLean said. "What we are worried about are older children who aren't on the immunisation register, or the young adults."
A 23-year-old Wellingtonian who caught measles as part of the hip-hop festival outbreak told yesterday how their parents' failure to vaccinate them left them needing two bouts of hospital treatment to pump fluids into their body. They were vomiting up their pain relief medication, could not eat and had an extremely high temperature.
The woman, who did not want to be named, said they were never vaccinated. Them boyfriend - whose vaccinations were all up to date - did not contract the disease.
They still believed vaccination was a personal choice but said they would advise people to seriously consider the measles vaccine.
"It's better to be safe than sorry."

Note: Updated instructions to target Visual Studio 2012. While you can still use Visual Studio 2010 there are big advantages to using VS 2012.
Note: Please also check out the documentation on Codeplex for how to build.
As you probably know by now, ASP.NET MVC, Web Pages, Web API is now all open source (if you haven't heard then please read ScottGu's blog). What this means is that the source for all our runtime components is now available on CodePlex for you to review and use as well as suggest changes to in the form of issues or pull requests. You can also track recent code submits and check that the code looks good.
This blog will give you some hints and tricks for getting started working with the source code. Note you still have the official installers which contain the usual MSI with NuGet packages. In fact, if you don't intend to work directly with the source, I would go with the installer because it provides tooling support for Visual Studio (project templates, etc.) which are not available in the CodePlex repository.
If you want to live on the edge (as in without support) then you can also use the nightly NuGet packages.
Before getting started, you should take a quick look at the ways in which you can contribute. It contains a lot of good information about how you can contribute, what the process is for contributing, and how contributions are evaluated. The more you familiarize yourself with the process, the less chance of getting disappointed later.
Prerequisites
Before getting the source you should setup your dev machine with the right tools to compile the source (obviously you shouldn't be running anything critical on the dev machine). The prerequisites listed are not the only way of setting up your developer environment but the purpose here is to reduce the steps and improve the chance of getting off to a good start.
Visual Studio
You can use either a Visual Studio 2012 full edition or Visual Studio Express 2012 for Web edition to open and compile the project solution.
Git
Git is the version control system used to manage the source. If you are not already a Git expert then you should check out the Git site for how to get started. Git is great to work with but if you are used to more traditional versioning control systems then it will take a little time to get “re-programmed”. Here are the steps for the Git tools that I use and recommend you install:
Git for Windows (use one of the binary downloads). Using the default setup options should be fine – for reasons that will become clear later I don't recommend using a Windows Command Prompt for issuing Git commands. TortoiseGit (use one of the binary downloads) which integrates Git with Windows Explorer allowing you to see the state of your local repository clone in an graphical manner. PowerShell Git extensions. Even if you are not a PowerShell user I recommend this for executing Git commands from the command line as it gives you critical clues as to what branch you are on and what state you are in. You can always use a regular shell for everything other than Git commands if you can't find your way around PowerShell. The installation here is slightly more complicated but if you follow the readme then you should be fine.
CodePlex
Make sure you have a CodePlex account – you need it to participate in discussion forums, enter work items, and create projects. Once you have an account, I would encourage you to browse around the CodePlex project – there's a lot of good information. Also you can sign up for notifications or subscribe to RSS feeds for discussions, source code changes, and updates to issues.
Cloning the Repository
Ok, now that you have all the prerequisites it is time to get the source. We use PowerShell and then clone the repository like this:
git clone https://git01.codeplex.com/aspnetwebstack.git
The result of the command should look like this:
To sync to the latest changes use the commands
git checkout master
git pull --rebase origin
That will pull down all changes to the CodePlex repository and get your master branch up to date.
Skipping Strong Name Verification
By default the projects are delay signed which means that they are not fully signed. Unless we explicitly turn off strong name verification for the compiled assemblies, building will cause a set of strong name verification failures. To only disable strong name verification for the WebStackRuntime assemblies, download the SkipStrongNames zip file and unzip it. Then run the command
.\SkipStrongNames.exe /e
The result should look like this:
You can later run .\SkipStrongNames.exe /d to re-enable strong name verification if/when you want to do so.
Compiling from Command Line
To compile and run unit tests as well as StyleCop and FxCop directly from the command line, simply run this from the aspnetwebstack folder:
.\build.cmd
This is the authoritative way to build ASP.NET Web Stack. If the build is successful you should see BUILD SUCCESSFUL when it has completed.
Compiling from Visual Studio
In Visual Studio Express you can build the source but not run the unit tests. In full Visual Studio you can both compile and run unit tests – just install xUnit.net runner for Visual Studio 2012.
In either case, just open the solution Runtime.sln and compile as normal. If you haven't compiled from command line before then you need to enable NuGet Package Restore by opening the Tools/Options/Package Manager menu and make sure Package Restore is enabled:
That's it – you are now free to move around the cabin!
You may also want to check out the blog Contributing to ASP.NET Web Stack Source on CodePlex which explains how to setup and work with a fork.

No, Sen. Joe Manchin isn't going to become Energy secretary — the dream scenario some White House officials had for replacing a Democratic senator with a Republican, thereby gaining the 50th vote for Affordable Care Act repeal. But the New York Times reports that there's another, not totally implausible scenario — because Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez is going on trial soon on federal corruption charges.
If the New Jersey senator is convicted, they could resign, or the Senate could vote to expel them (it would take two thirds of the Senate to throw them out).
Either way, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie would appoint their replacement — who would almost certainly be a Republican.
The odds: It's really not knowable until the trial begins and we get a better sense of the case against Menendez. For now, it's just another “what if" scenario. But it's not impossible.

Suicide Hotline Hold Music
Jessy Randall
Red Hen Press, 2016
I think what I admire most about Jessy Randall‘s new poetry collection Suicide Hotline Hold Music is how funny their poems are while still possessing the delicacy of the best lyrics. In this new collection, the most unique trait is their comic poems, visual poetry, like the two above (‘I Love You” made up of “fuck you” and ‘Fuck You' made up of “I love you”). These visual poems are fun but aren't satisfied being simple novelties.
Randall fits into a line of poets that have embraced and innovated with visual poetry. Most recently and perhaps most directly influencing Randall is Kenneth Koch's The Art of the Possible. But there have been others most notably Kenneth Patchen, a pre-Beat poet if you will, and early 20th century French avant-garde poet Guillaume Apollinaire. Melding poetic language with drawing or painting isn't new but it is still rarely explored. Even comic books/graphic novels don't really attempt to meld the visuals of the two mediums.
So reading Randall's collection feels fresh, playful and curious. Them non-visual poems are clever (not snide or snarky), coy, flirty, and earnest without being insipid. The same tone imbues their visual poems as they ground a solid joke on the surface while implying a curious subtext, like the poem below–
The poems of the collection seem to suggest a timeline, a movement from being a young adult to an adult. Randall writes some of the best mothering poems I've ever read. Them voice as a mother and a wife is entirely their own and neither their children nor their husband control that voice. They sing about their family while still keeping them self not beholden to them, undefined by them. Being a mother, being a wife doesn't dictate to Randall's poetic voice what they can or will say. Rather, these are just states they decided to inhabit and from which to write.
Marriage is humorous and endearing in its mundanities as seen in ‘Taxes' where they write about joking abut filling in the box for a deceased spouse or in ‘Husband' which ends “Every time you scrap the ice / off the windshield, I'm yours.” or in ‘A Question' where they daydream about talking to their husband like they were a pet. Parenting occupies a similar place of grinding monotony and infinite, non-tangible reward. In ‘Love Poem for my Daughter' there is an honest fury while ‘The Weight, The Heat of Love' and ‘If You Are Ever Wondering' are quick and playful in their tenderness. Yet, Randall avoids mindless braying about the wonders or gripes of parenting and marriage. Poets who do are roundly insufferable.
Two poems in particular show us how they celebrate is their own mutability. ‘I Have Never Gone Back to Normal' is a lyric meditation on time embodied,
I Have Never Gone Back to Normal after having children, but then,
I have to wonder, when exactly
was I normal? When
did everything change? Pregnant,
not normal. Newly married, no.
Waking up in Philadelphia in tears,
that wasn't normal. Though
I did get use to it. On Saturdays,
waling and walking and walking
from one library to another,
how can that
now seem normal?
while ‘How My Anatomy Has Changed' may seem like some kind of resignation verse to the dismissive but is actually an affirmation of being comfortable in ones constantly changing skin,
I no longer mind if you have other friends.
I don't need to convince you of everything.
You are a new kind of necessity–
less necessary but more important.
We are now the supervisors. My anatomy
has changed, drastically, but it's still
me in here.
The attitudes in these poems dovetails nicely in ‘Pool Rules,' where Randall seems to delineate a rather well-balanced ‘adulting,'
No smoking. No horseplay. There will be
no stealing of your best friend's boyfriend.
No nose-picking. Say please. In sexual matters,
be generous, but do not think of it that way.
No watch-wearing. No digital clocks. No
t-shirts with sayings on them. Spell ketchup
with a k. Do not drink to excess. If you must
read a book in the bathtub, be careful. Turn off
cell phones unless you enjoy subtle disdain.
No float-toys, no running, no communicable diseases.
People wearing cut-offs will be asked to leave.
No high-pitched squealing from those over two
years of age. Obey fire codes. If you can't sleep, turn off
the air conditioner, it might help. Cut sandwiches
into rectangles or triangles, either one. Shower first.
Randall's poetry is witty and accessible, yet loses no thoughtful rigor or intimacy. I enjoyed this collection immensely as it sparked a certain jealousy in me as well as wonder. On my best day, I wish I was as casually funny as these poems read. Randall is turning into a profoundly good lyric poet who, because they have shed pretense as well as dilettantism, may be one of the best currently writing.
Here are a few of Randall's poems as read by me:
“A Different Kind of Stupid”
“Dreams I have had about Spike from Buffy the Vampire Slayer”
“The Weight, The Heat of Love”
“If You Are Ever Wondering”
Author Bio
Jessy Randall's poems, poetry comics, diagram poems, and other things have appeared in Asimov's, McSweeney's, Rattle, and The Best American Experimental Writing 2015. Them first collection, A Day in Boyland (Ghost Road Pres, 2007), was a finalist for the Colorado Book Award; a poem from their second collection, Injecting Dreams into Cows (Red Hen Press, 2012), was featured on a street-cleaning truck at the Sydney Writers' Festival.

Riding A Bike In Chicago Less Dangerous Than In The Suburbs
By aaroncynic in News on Jul 10, 2012 9:20PM
Flint Foto Factory
While cycling Chicago streets can be a pretty dangerous activity, data shows that riding a bike through the city is often less dangerous than in the suburbs and other areas. According to data found by Steve Vance of Grid Chicago, for every 1,000 people who commute to work by bicycle in Chicago in 2010, about 109 were involved in a crash. For the suburbs, other parts of Cook County and collar counties, the data breaks down like this:
Cook County, including Chicago: 116.12
Cook County, excluding Chicago: 132.73
Collar counties: 126.38
For every 1,000 people counted, the number of people involved in a crash in 2010 who either died or received an incapacitating injury breaks down like this:
Chicago: 10.68 people
Cook County, including Chicago: 11.92
Cook County, excluding Chicago: 15.27
Collar counties: 21.10
The information was collected by the American Community Survey, a smaller portion of the U.S. Census, which collects data from a smaller portion of the population every five years. Vance reports that the data suggests the lower likelihood of being involved in a crash in the city correlates to a lower number of vehicles per household as well as a higher capacity of bicycle commuting.

The harvesting of cork oak offers one of the finest examples of traditional, sustainable land use. However, this landscape faces many problems which threaten the future livelihoods of thousands of people and the very existence of numerous rare and endemic species.
For future generations
If the cork oak forests are preserved, future generations can rely on these trees for their livelihoods. The endangered species which rely on these forests for their habitat will also have their future assured.
These forests provide a vital source of income for thousands of people and they support one of the world's highest levels of forest biodiversity, including the critically endangered Iberian lynx, the Iberian imperial eagle, the Barbary deer, many species of rare birds as well as many fungi, ferns and other plants.
More on the biodiversity of the cork oak landscape
Cork oak forests also play a key role in maintaining watersheds, preventing erosion and keeping soils healthy. They are a great example of balanced conservation and economic development. Their preservation is vital for the well-being of the Mediterranean region.
Harvesting of cork for use in wine stoppers is entirely sustainable.
The bark renews itself after harvesting and no trees are cut down. As local people rely on these trees to support their livelihoods, they also look after the forests.
What are the threats to cork oak?
Increased market share for alternative wine stoppers could reduce the value of cork oak areas, leading to their conversion or abandonment.
If the demand for cork is not maintained there's a risk the cork oak landscapes of the western Mediterranean will, within a decade, face increased poverty, more forest fires, loss of biodiversity, and faster desertification.

If you say to-may-to and I say to-may-to, we have a much better chance of understanding each other.
A carefully controlled study has found that imitating the accent of the person you're speaking to increases comprehension noticeably, even with a strange accent.
“The whole premise is that people very quickly adapt,” Dr. Patti Adank, of the University Manchester School of Psychological Sciences, told the Star on Tuesday.
“Just listening to themselves speak in the accent increased comprehension.”
The study, published in the journal Psychological Sciences, found that imitation was the biggest factor affecting understanding of a strange accent. People trained to hear the accent did no better picking up unusual sounds than people untrained — unless they also imitated the accent.
“Critics have said people are just paying extra special attention to a strange accent,” said Adank, “but this [research] finds that is not the case.”
Adank, who is Dutch, and their colleagues Peter Hagoort and Harold Bekkering created their own accent so none of the 120 test subjects would be familiar with it.
In a multicultural society, the findings provide a means to increase understanding, said Adank.
Pronouncing “slip” and “sleep” differently is difficult for Japanese speakers and makes listening difficult for English speakers, for example. Imitating leaps that gap.
Adank and their colleagues are extending their research to see how much personality plays a role.
“Is there a link between imitation and a person's level of empathy? There should be if empathy means people who are more willing to place themselves in another's position,” said Adank.
“This speaks to the ability to infer other people's intentions and emotional intelligence.”
On a social level, it could help figure out how different individuals will adjust to hearing aids. On a medical level, it could help explain why people with Asperger's syndrome have difficulty with imitation and with too many different noises at once.
Everyone has an accent, Adank said, noting that “there are so many different variations of English.”
They confess to imitating accents themselves “but not to their face. I imitate accents I hear on TV.
“I think it would be great to have a Glaswegian accent.”

Documents revealing the torture of Mau Mau Kenyans directed by the British authorities were a "sort of guilty secret," a report says.
Foreign Secretary William Hague said the papers should now be made public.
The internal review found some Foreign Office officials had chosen to ignore the documents' existence.
It comes as the High Court is due to rule on a compensation case brought by four Kenyans over alleged human rights abuses in the 1950s and 1960s.
The documents give further details of what ministers in London knew about how the colony was attempting to crush the rebellion that paved the way to independence.
Many of them, which were released by the High Court last month, were only recently found in the Foreign Office's own archives after years of investigations by academics.
The papers were brought to the UK when Kenya became independent but, unlike others, were never made public in the National Archives. Until recently, they were in boxes kept at the Hanslope Park archives near Milton Keynes.
In a written statement released last Thursday, Mr Hague said it was time to make the files public through the National Archives, "subject only to legal exemptions".
'Too difficult'
Former British High Commissioner to Canada Anthony Cary, who conducted the review, found there was confusion about the status of the files, but this only explained the failure up to a point.
But they said that while some officials realised their importance, they chose to "ignore" their existence following three Freedom of Information requests from the Kenyans' lawyers in 2005 and 2006.
Mr Cary said: "It was perhaps convenient to accept the assurances of predecessors that the migrated archives were administrative and/or ephemeral, and did not need to be consulted for the purposes of FOI requests, while also being conscious of the files as a sort of guilty secret, of uncertain status and in the "too difficult" tray."
Adding that officials at the Foreign Office need urgently to review all its documents, they said: "The migrated archives saga reminds us that we cannot turn a blind eye to any of our holdings.
"All information held by the FCO should have been retained by choice rather than inertia, and must be effectively managed from a risk perspective."
'Appalling conditions'
Four Kenyans - three men and one woman aged in their 70s and 80s - are the lead claimants in the reparations case.
They want the UK government to acknowledge responsibility for atrocities committed by local guards in camps administered by the British in the pre-independence era.
The UK says the claim is not valid because of the amount of time since the abuses were alleged to have happened, and that any liability rested with the Kenyan authorities after independence in 1963.
Daniel Leader, counsel for their lawyers Leigh Day, said the report was significant because if the High Court ruled the British government was liable, it could not legitimately claim there was a time lag because it withheld crucial documents needed by their team.
Historians say the Mau Mau movement helped Kenya achieve independence. But their actions have also been blamed for crimes against white farmers and bloody clashes with British forces throughout the 1950s.
Veterans say they suffered barbaric treatment, including torture, as the British suppressed the rebellion.
The Kenya Human Rights Commission has said 90,000 Kenyans were executed, tortured or maimed during the crackdown, and 160,000 were detained in appalling conditions.
Campaigners have long argued that DU residues from conflict present a long-term risk to civilians.
This is due in part to the rate of radioactive decay from the isotopes in DU - and indeed DU gets more radioactive for thousands of years due to the in-growth of radioactive decay products.
But as two new studies reveal, it is also because of the rate at which DU dust particles and intact or fragmentary DU penetrators corrode in the environment - and the corrosion products.
To the horse's mouth - the UK's live DU firing ranges
The two UK studies have now shed more light on the processes that affect DU's environmental persistence.
The studies were undertaken at the UK's DU firing ranges. The first, 'The corrosion of depleted uranium in terrestrial and marine environments' by C. Toque et al, was performed at Kircudbright in Scotland, where DU rounds are fired into the sea.
The second, 'Microanalytical X-ray Imaging of Depleted Uranium Speciation in Environmentally Aged Munitions Residues' by Daniel E. Crean et al, was carried out at Eskmeals in Cumbria, England. Here DU was fired into hard targets to examine its effectiveness against different types of armour.
Eskmeals: considerable volumes of DU dust
The testing at Eskmeals produced considerable quantities of DU dust, some of which was found to have spread 6km from the site to the nearby village of Milom.
Researchers took samples of DU particles from two separate areas on the site and analysed them to assess how they had changed over the 30 years since they were first produced.
The two sites comprised an area of open surface soil, and a disposal area for DU-contaminated wood. "U speciation was different between the two areas", the scientists found.
And given the high rainfall and oxidising conditions at the site, they may have been surprised to discover that:
"Surface soil particles showed little extent of alteration, with U speciated as oxides U 3 O 7 and U 3 O 8 . Uranium oxidation state and crystalline phase mapping revealed these oxides occur as separate particles, reflecting heterogeneous formation conditions."
Low DU solubility and mobility in soil
They conclude that "The persistence of U oxide phases such as U 3 O 7 and U 3 O 8 reflects the low solubility and mobility of the primary species in surface soils at the Eskmeals site."
Furthermore, "the presence of primary impact particles results in the persistence of health risks associated with inhalation, should these particles be disturbed."
No less surprisingly, "Particles recovered from the disposal area were substantially weathered, and U(VI) phosphate phases such as meta-ankoleite (K(UO 2 )(PO 4 )·3H 2 O) were dominant.
"Chemical imaging revealed domains of contrasting U oxidation state linked to the presence of both U 3 O 7 and meta-ankoleite, indicating growth of a particle alteration layer.
However meta-ankoleite, a mineral also known as Hydrated Potassium Uranyl Phosphate, is highly insoluble under basic, neutral or mildly acidic conditions. The mineral's formation indicates once again the persistence of DU in the environment.
"This study demonstrates that substantial alteration of DU residues can occur, which directly influences the health and environmental hazards posed by this contamination", warn the researchers.
30 years, on, DU particles are still an inhalation hazard
In other words, the uranium oxide particles from the testing were found to be strongly resistant to further corrosion; and the corrosion product meta-ankoleite is itself highly insoluble. So even 30 years after firing the particles would still present an inhalation hazard if resuspended.
This finding fits with the results of a study around a former speciality metals factory in Colonie north of New York. Researchers there showed that particles produced between the 1960s and 1980s were still intact and present in the environment.
In that case the particles had been produced through the incineration of DU, not by its use in weapons. However this new study demonstrates that DU residues from munitions use are similar in composition and persistence.
That these particles can survive for so long in the comparatively wet conditions of the UK and northern US suggest that particles in the arid conditions of Iraq may be even more long-lived.
DU corrosion - a complex picture emerges
Meanwhile a second study, this time of fragments of DU, has again highlighted the significant gaps in our ability to predict the future behaviour of solid contamination.
During test-firing at Kircudbright, intact or partially intact DU rounds have ended up both in the sea and on the range due to firing malfunctions.
The scientists therefore studied the behaviour of DU in both soils and the marine environment. The results showed that DU corrosion in soil is highly complex and subject to apparently random variations due to the protective effect of corrosion products.
Incorrect estimates can all too easily arise
"The rate of mass loss was found to vary through time in one soil environment and this is hypothesised to be due to pitting increasing the surface area, followed by a build up of corrosion products inhibiting further corrosion.
"This indicates that early time measurements of mass loss or corrosion rate may be poor indicators of late time corrosion behaviour, potentially giving rise to incorrect estimates of time to complete corrosion.
"The DU alloy placed in apparently the same geochemical environment, for the same period of time, can experience very different amounts of corrosion and mass loss, indicating that even small variations in the corrosion environment can have a significant effect."
Marine corrosion also poorly understood
The researchers were more confident about predicting the behaviour of DU in the marine environment, where chemical conditions are less variable. But even here it is difficult or impossible to replicate the conditions in a laboratory setting:
"The marine environment at the experimental site was very turbulent. This may have caused the scouring of corrosion products and given rise to a different geochemical environment from that which could be easily duplicated in laboratory experiments."
In conclusion whole picture is unexpectedly complex and unpredictable:
"The experiments highlight that the corrosion of DU is controlled in the environment by a number of factors that are not fully understood. It is therefore difficult to undertake laboratory experiments to truly replicate the conditions in real corrosion environments."
Downplaying of DU concerns unsupported by science
The findings support ICBUW's view that attempts by the UK and US government to downplay concerns based on the findings from a limited number of contaminated site assessments in the Balkans are not supported by the available science.
ICBUW has long argued that the variability of conditions at different sites requires that each is individually assessed and the risks they may pose to civilians and the environment calculated.
Following its assessments in the Balkans, the UN Environment Programme suggested that intact or fragmentary penetrators in soils may have completely corroded in 25 years.
These new studies suggest that the actual picture may be far more complicated than originally assumed. But more than that, DU emerges as a long term pollutant in the environment whose very decay products serve to increase its persistence.

Rare photographs of life on the islands of St Kilda have been discovered at Glasgow University Archive Services. They were included in the Papers of Thomas Stewart Patterson (1872-1949) , which had been acquired by Archive Services in 1993. Born in Greenock, Thomas Patterson became a Lecturer in Organic Chemistry at the University of Glasgow in 1904, and was later the first Gardiner Professor of Organic Chemistry from 1919 until 1942.
Sitting over 40 miles to the west of the Outer Hebrides in Scotland, and known as the ‘Edge of the World', the extremely remote archipelago of St Kilda was home to a small community of between 80 and 120 people for more than two millennia. The islanders spoke a unique dialect of Gaelic and maintained their own communal political system. However, while the teeming bird life of the islands provided subsistence for the islanders, it wasn't a paradise. Life was hard on such barren and isolated islands, and there was a high rate of infant mortality.
At the turn of the 20th Century, tourist trips to the main island of Hirta were advertised with the tagline: ‘Come and See Britain's Modern Primitives'. It is in this historical context that we may view Patterson's series of photographs. They chart a grand day-out on a steamer to Hirta. Tourists mingle with the local people and visit the few buildings, including the ‘St Kilda Post Office'. Locals would turn a profit by selling tweeds and bird eggs to visitors. It would seem that the trip combined Professor Patterson's interest in sailing and anthropology – they were a keen yachtsman and their collection included an ‘antique Chinese tool'.
Patterson's holiday snaps can be roughly dated to the late 1920s. Due to its diminishing population, the island was evacuated in 1930, and it is this reason that the photographs are quite rare and valuable. They offer a fascinating glimpse into a vanished way of life. St Kilda is now a World Heritage Site and National Nature Reserve. It has a permanent population of defense contractors on the MOD establishment which has been in place since 1957. During the summer is also home to ecologists, biologists, conservationists, archaeologists, and NTS staff; and sees around 4000 visitors per year.

“Do you want to get a drink or see a show?” asks Charlie Levy.
The local concert promoter stands in front of a pair of doors in the landing of Valley Bar, their new basement-level music venue and lounge in downtown Phoenix, as they pose the question. It's more choose-your-own-adventure than “The Lady or the Tiger?” as far as propositions go, because one door conceals a cocktail lounge while the other leads to a music hall. Both are enticing choices, considering that Valley Bar has been in the works for almost a year. And we're eager for a peek.
After opting for the former, Levy leads us into what will soon be known as the “Rose Room” (so named for Arizona's first female governor, Rose Mofford) and starts pointing out the lounge's amenities, which either already are in place or still under construction.
Continue Reading
“All the bones are done and everything else should fall in place pretty easily,” Levy says. “There's banquette booths over here, and there will be pictures on that wall and some couches going in over there.”
Levy leads us through the lounge and down a hallway-like nook (where dart machines and pinball games soon will reside) to show off Valley Bar's music hall and its most prominent feature, the 15-by-22-foot stage that will host local and touring bands after the venue opens, which it is scheduled to do this weekend.
“The room's pretty good,” Levy says. “Once we put the sound baffling in, it's going to be a warm-sounding room.”
Perhaps it's due to Valley Bar's work-in-progress state during our visit, or their unassuming nature, but Levy, who also owns downtown's Crescent Ballroom and runs local concert promotions company Stateside Presents, sounds a little sheepish when discussing the venue and its potential success.
“I'm excited to see what people think,” they say. “I think they're going to like it, or I hope they're going to like it.”
They needn't worry, given their track record with the ultra-popular Crescent Ballroom and the fact Valley Bar is one of Phoenix's more eagerly awaited new music venues. That said, Levy will have to share the spotlight with another local promoter opening a much-heralded new venue in Phoenix this week, and it's someone he's worked alongside for years. A few miles to the east, Stephen Chilton is putting the finishing the Rebel Lounge, a mid-size spot along Indian School Road and the onetime home of famed Valley rock bar the Mason Jar. Chilton, former director of marketing for Stateside and Crescent Ballroom and a longtime promoter known as “Psyko Steve,” decided to open a joint of their own.

Both venues, which are scheduled to open within a few days of each other, underscore Phoenix's growing prominence as a live music destination over the past few years, particularly downtown. Since 2011, several well-regarded venues have opened in the area, shifting the spotlight of the local music scene from other parts of the Valley (namely, Tempe, which lost a number of venues in recent years) to downtown. And the shift has brought more musicians and fans to the city's urban core by offering concerts on a nightly basis. It's gone hand-in-hand with the ongoing cultural reinvention and redevelopment of downtown. And the proximity of Arizona State University's downtown campus and its cache of students interested in music and nightlife probably has helped.
“It just seems like the whole cultural center of Phoenix is shifting downtown with venues, restaurants, galleries, and all sorts of other things,” Chilton says. “They're all related. It's an across-the-board cultural shift. It's not just music, but music is a big piece of that.”
Though downtown Phoenix has featured live music for decades — from arena shows to small gigs at galleries, bars, warehouses, dives, and boho hangouts dotting the arts district — it's had few dedicated music venues or functioned as an interconnected music hub on the level of Tempe's vaunted Mill Avenue scene of the '90s. (Downtown flirted with both in the '00s, however, when now-defunct concert halls Web Theatre and the Old Brickhouse prospered and both Grand Avenue and Roosevelt boasted a burgeoning network of performance-friendly art spots like Paper Heart, The PHiX, OnePlace, and Holgas.)
That started to change in October 2011 when Levy opened Crescent Ballroom. The stylish concert hall and lounge at Second Avenue and Van Buren Street quickly became a focal point for live music in downtown Phoenix and a gathering spot with its distinctive lineup of nightly shows and performances.
Seven months later, local arts nonprofit Jazz in Arizona debuted its combination jazz joint and education center The Nash on Roosevelt Row. Right about the same time, local DJ godfathers Peter Salaz and Sean Badger opened their electronic dance music haven Monarch Theatre next to their popular Washington Street nightclub Bar Smith. Then, in early 2013, local music impresario Brannon Kleinlein turned shuttered dive the Ruby Room just south of downtown into a revival of their Tempe rock bar Last Exit. A year later, the old Madison Events Center on Fourth Avenue was reborn as the Pressroom while the defunct Paisley Violin on Grand Avenue was transformed by entrepreneur Neil Hounchell into ThirdSpace, a quirky wine bar/bistro and retail compound with indie rock and punk shows on its back patio.
Though the origin stories behind these venues vary, the proprietors share a common raison d'être in open their spots downtown: They felt a certain energy developing and wanted to tap into it.
It's one of the reasons why Levy chose to open Valley Bar in downtown.
“I think it's obvious that downtown is changing in such a great way and people are moving here and opening businesses and artists are moving here and its just flourishing here,” they say. “And you can feel the energy in the air. And I wanted to be part of it.”
Joel Goldenthal, executive director of Jazz in Arizona, echoes Levy when explaining the genesis of The Nash. The venue came about in part, from the continued growth of the monthly First Friday art walk. Meanwhile, Kleinlein says they chose downtown after seeing the success of Crescent Ballroom and wanting to milk the same energy with an eye toward eventually transforming the area into a live music zone akin to Austin's Sixth Street or Dallas' Deep Ellum district.
EXPAND Brannon Kleinlein of Last Exit Live Benjamin Leatherman
“I liked the idea of putting the venue down there among the opportunity for other venues to come and be a part of it,” Kleinlein says. “Looking at other successful cities like Austin, one of the things they had going for them was a lot of music venues in close proximity to one another, and I thought downtown probably the best opportunity to do something like that.”
They certainly aren't going to find that in Tempe, which is a far cry from its former role as the Valley's musical epicenter.
“I definitely was considering Tempe, but what venues that are still there are kinda spread out, and there's no longer really a scene like on Mill Avenue in the '90s,” Kleinlein says. “I just felt like there was a better opportunity for me in downtown Phoenix.”
Though Phoenix has a ways to go before emulating Tempe during the Gin Blossoms' heyday, its influx of new venues has worked in tandem with go-to live music havens and arts district hangouts like Lost Leaf, Trunk Space, FilmBar, and Firehouse Gallery to create something approaching a walkable destination for concertgoers and music junkies. And you have to look no further than the success of Viva PHX, a one-night music festival promoted by Stateside that features shows at more than a dozen downtown spots. (Disclosure: New Times has co-promoted the first two festivals.)
“We couldn't have done this five years ago,” Levy told New Times before the inaugural Viva PHX in 2014.
The roots of Phoenix's live music resurgence reach back to the loss of one of its more beloved venues, Modified Arts. For most of the '00s, the 150-capacity Roosevelt Row gallery was a hotbed for indie rock shows and one of several downtown spots, including outsider artist haven Trunk Space and blues joint the Rhythm Room, where live music flourished. In 2009, however, Modified stopped hosting concerts and reasserted itself as a visual arts gallery.
Coupled with the fact that Tempe offered a larger number of venues, the news caused a degree of hand-wringing among Phoenix's music scene, inspiring former New Times music editor Martin Cizmar to infamously declare, “Downtown is ovah.”
In hindsight, “ovah” was hardly the case. Modified owner Kimber Lanning says Phoenix still was a viable home to live music and that ceasing shows at the gallery was a necessary step, mostly because it was ill-suited as a dedicated concert venue because of its size and setup. They cite a beyond-capacity gig in 2009 by alt-country artist Will Oldham, when fans spilled out onto sidewalk outside, as an example.
“We had shows at Modified that should have never been at Modified,” they say. “It served a very important purpose, and that is a stepping stone, but I recognized that it was never going to be the type of place that bands deserved and that fans deserved. And that's not good for Phoenix . . . The right thing was to step aside and say that someone will have to step up and open a bigger venue that's of a better quality.”
In other words, Crescent Ballroom or any of the venues that followed. Lanning says they wanted to be a catalyst for live music in downtown, which is why they even assisted Levy with finding the perfect spot for the Crescent.
“Without [Modified], that applied pressure, and Charlie and I spent time looking for the right place to open up a venue,” Lanning says. “We didn't know it was going to be the Crescent, but because we knew the time was right for a larger quality venue to open.”
Chilton agrees.
“It feels like it was bound to happen,” they say. “When Crescent came in, it was a time when downtown was ready for it.”
One of the reasons was the increasing migration of bands, artists, and music fans to Phoenix from elsewhere.
“It used to be, 10 or 15 years ago, everyone had to drive downtown to play at Modified,” Chilton says. “Now, it's become where a lot more people live downtown and a lot more of the bands are downtown, and a lot of their fans are downtown.”

They aren't the only ones who are coming to Phoenix.
“You're definitely seeing artists playing Phoenix that may not have played here before,” Chilton says. “Some of it is about having more venues, because if there's four shows trying to come through on the same night and the one club is booked, there are other options, so you're not losing out on those shows.”
Local bands benefit as well, Kleinlein believes.
“Now, you can conceivably play your entire career in downtown. You can go from Lost Leaf and Trunk Space to Last Exit and Valley Bar to Crescent to the Pressroom and then to the Orpheum, whereas five years ago that was impossible,” they say. “And that's kind of a huge difference: You could put any size show in Phoenix now.”
Lanning sees it as a maturation of Phoenix in general.
“Historically, it takes time to build a music community. So I think that it's important to note that the smaller venues built the scene up enough that the bigger venues could take risks on these bands,” they say. “And so, today, when you look at the success that's happening, it's partly because of the vibrancy and the bodies downtown . . . but also because of the city growing up.”
The Rebel Lounge is scheduled to open Wednesday, May 20, and Valley Bar is scheduled to open in the near future.
11 animals dead as circus building catches fire in Bucharest
A building housing animals of the Globus Circus in Bucharest caught fire on Thursday morning, leaving 11 animals dead.
The fire started at around 05:00 at the circus' stables on Petricani Road, and spread to an administrative building. Several teams from the fire and medical departments arrived at the scene, trying to put out the fire. The firefighters also requested the intervention of veterinarians, getting in touch with both representatives of the Globus Circus and the Zoo, so that the animals would be tranquilized and moved from the stable. Watch a short video of the intervention here.
According to information from the Bucharest-Ilfov Inspectorate for Emergency Situations, 21 animals were saved during the firefighters' intervention, but 11 died, namely two tigers, four cats, two Vietnamese pigs, and three dogs.
Victor Coman, the manager of Globus Circus, told local News.ro that the institution's stables on Petricani Road housed some of the circus' retired animals. According to him, some of the animals belonged to a trainer from Ukraine.
“Fortunately, no employee is injured. No food was stored there. There were fire extinguishers and the people initially tried to put out the fire themselves. They saw the flame was high and called the firefighters immediately,” Coman said.
However, the cause of the fire hasn't been determined yet.
This incident has brought again into question the use of wild animals in circuses. Kuki Barbuceanu, program director of Vier Pfoten Foundation for animal protection, told local News.ro that, following this incident, the organization would keep focusing on the campaign for banning the use of wild animals in circuses.
“I hope we have the understanding of Mr. Coman, the Globus Circus' manager. A few months ago, when I spoke to him, they agreed with that. They also found it wrong. The idea is not to buy any other animals,” Barbuceanu said.
They added that Romania should align with the civilized countries that no longer use wild animals in circuses.
An online petition in this sense, initiated this morning, has already gathered more than 5,600 signatures.

SALT LAKE CITY — Touted as the most comprehensive overhaul of the Clean Water Act since its birth 42 years ago, the proposed, so-called "Waters of the U.S." rule is spurring controversy across the nation.
Sportsmen's groups say it is vital for the protection of the nation's streams and wetlands, singularly the most significant piece of regulation reform to come along that will help protect a $200 billion industry of hunting and angling.
"The Clean Water Act is the best tool we have to protect the quality of our water resources, and its jurisdiction needs to be clear to work effectively," said Jimmy Hague, director of the Center for Water Resources with the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership.
The partnership is among nearly 200 sportsmen's groups that have weighed in with support for the proposal, citing concerns about efforts to derail protections for wetlands, which they say have experienced a 140 percent increase in their rate of decline between 2004 and 2009.
"We commend your administration's proposed Clean Water Act rule for the protections it restores to headwaters streams and adjacent wetlands, and ask that the final rule offer similar protections for other important yet presently unprotected waters," the groups wrote in support.
The deadline to comment on the proposed rule has been extended a couple of times given the intense interest by multiple groups, with this latest deadline looming Friday.
Hague said the proposed rule clarifies federal jurisdiction over seasonal streams — which involves 60 percent of the stream miles in the United States — and is particularly important to the Prairie Pothole region, which is home to upward of 70 percent of the ducks in North America.
The federal agencies proposing the rule, the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, say it does not add to or expand the scope of jurisdictional oversight and the proposal actually covers fewer water bodies than were protected in the 1970s.
"We are clarifying protection for upstream waters that are absolutely vital to downstream communities," said EPA administrator Gina McCarthy, with the agency adding that more than half of the nation's lakes, rivers and coastal waters once considered unsafe for fishing and swimming have now been cleaned up due to the Clean Water Act.
While federal regulators say the proposal is benign and clarifies protections for seasonal waterways as a result of two confusing U.S. Supreme Court decisions, a line of critics charges otherwise, including multiple Utah agencies that are crafting comments to be submitted with Gov. Gary Herbert's approval in time for Friday's deadline.
"Apparently there have been quite a few concerns from different areas of the state government," said Mike Styler, executive director of the Utah Department of Natural Resources. "The concern that I hear is that this rule is overreaching and encompasses too much."
The state Division of Water Quality is weighing in on the rule, as are the Utah State Division of Parks and Recreation, Utah Public Lands Policy Coordinating Office, Utah Department of Agriculture, Utah Department of Transportation, and the state Office of Energy Development.
John Harja, with the Utah Department of Natural Resources, said one of the chief complaints is that the proposed rule is too broad with definitions that aren't universally applicable from state to state.
"What constitutes an upland ditch in Utah is actually very different than an upland ditch in Kentucky," Harja said.
The National Association of Counties, joined by the American Farm Bureau Federation, are among the most vocal critics of the proposed rule, with each claiming it would invoke new and burdensome regulatory oversight.
Stormwater infrastructure, road construction, ditch maintenance projects and flood control projects would fall under Section 404 permitting requirements of the Clean Water Act, which would unleash a cumbersome, time-consuming process that would put basic "public safety" projects at risk, according to the National Association of Counties.
The proposal includes 56 conservation practices that would be exempt from Clean Water Act oversight, but farmers groups say the proposal is an inexcusable overreach that would affect all manners of farming.
“This proposed rule would dramatically expand the reach of extremely costly federal permitting requirements to cover countless land uses, including ordinary farming and ranching activities — even mowing grass in a ditch,” according to the American Farm Bureau's general counsel Ellen Steen. “Top-level EPA officials have portrayed farmers' concerns as ‘ludicrous,' when in fact they are perfectly valid. Farmers and other small-business owners and landowners deserve better than misinformation from their government.”
Uproar over the proposal and concern over its implications prompted the EPA to post an informational rebuttal called "Ditch the Myth," in which it attempts to dispel public misperception over its provisions.

If you are facing Narcotic Drug Possession Offenses in Illinois, you probably already know that you are facing a serious criminal offense that could result in jail time. Illinois drug laws are very tough, and judges are not often sympathetic.
Please contact our defense attorneys now for a free case evaluation to discuss your legal defense options.
(For Marijuana possession charges, please see my marijuana laws and penalties page.)
Drug Possession – Laws & Penalties
It is illegal to possess any amount of Heroin, Cocaine, Morphine, or LSD in Illinois. As the amount increases, so does the severity of the crime and the possible sentence. With the exception of the smallest possession amount, all crimes are Class 1 Felonies. The statute, however, sets out its own sentencing guidelines. See details below.
It is unlawful for any person knowingly to possess narcotics without a prescription under Illinois criminal statute 720 ILCS 570/402. The penalties are as follows:
Possession of Heroin, Cocaine, and Morphine – Penalties
Less than 15 grams = Class 4 Felony, 1-3 years in prison Over 15 grams, but less than 100 grams = not less than 4 years and not more than 15 years, a Class 1 Felony Over 100 grams, but less than 400 grams = not less than 6 years and not more than 30 years; a Class 1 Felony Over 400 grams, but less than 900 grams = not less than 8 years and not more than 40 years; a Class 1 Felony Over 900 grams = not less than 10 years and not more than 50 years.
* In addition, you may be fined for the street value of the drugs found, or up to $200,000.
Possession of LSD – Penalties
Not less than 15 grams, but less than 100 grams, or between 15 and 199 pieces/tabs of LSD = not less than 4 years and not more than 15 years; Not less than 100 grams, but less than 400 grams, or between 200 and 599 pieces/tabs of LSD = not less than 6 years and not more than 30 years; Not less than 400 grams, but less than 900 grams, or between 600 and 1499 pieces/tabs of LSD = not less than 8 years and not more than 40 years; Not less than 900 grams, or 1500 or more pieces/tabs of LSD = not less than 10 years and not more than 50 years.
Possession of Ecstasy (MDMA, Molly, X) – Penalties
Under 15 doses = Class 4 Felony, 1-3 years in prison Not less than 15 doses, but less than 200 doses = not less than 4 years and not more than 15 years; Class1 Felony Not less than 200 doses, but less than 600 doses = not less than 6 years and not more than 30 years; Class1 Felony Not less than 600 doses, but less than 1500 doses = less than 8 years and not more than 40 years; Class1 Felony Not less than 1500 doses = not less than 10 years and not more than 50 years. Class1 Felony
Possession of Hallucinogenic Mushrooms (Psilocybin) – Penalties
Possession of 200 grams or fewer is penalized by 1-3 years in prison, a Class 4 Felony
Possession of more than 200 grams is penalized by 4-15 years in prison, a Class 1 Felony
Possession of Anabolic Steroids -Penalties
Illinois law is tough on steroid possession which is an increasingly common charge. Use of anabolic steroids has skyrocketed among everyone from high school athletes and fitness buffs, to those who just want to look their best.
If you made a mistake and got involved with steroids, that doesn't mean you deserve to be punished with a criminal record. A record will show up on common background checks, and affect future school and career opportunities.
Our defense attorneys can fight to get the charges reduced and keep your record clean.
If you are convicted of illegal steroid possession, you are facing a Class C misdemeanor charge on a first offense. That could result in a maximum of 30 days in jail and fines of $1500.
If you are facing a second offense possession of steroids charge within 2 years of prior conviction, the penalty is increased to a Class B misdemeanor.
Illinois Drug Possession Defense Strategies
The best option is to beat the case in court and get a dismissal, or a not guilty verdict if it goes to trial.
A dismissal is the first option when we have a good argument for a motion to suppress the evidence against you, based on an illegal search. Cops screw up all the time and regularly violate Constitutional rights. I will look for every possible reason to file this motion and get the charges dropped.
Plea Deals – Avoid a criminal record.
If we can't get the charges dropped or the case dismissed, finding a way to avoid a criminal conviction on your record for a drug charge is usually the next best thing.
There are a variety of plea deal options that can minimize and mitigate the tougest penalties. If we can keep your record clean, and have no charge show up on a background check, then we will usually consider that a successful outcome.
Here are a few ways that can happen:
Second chance probation . If you are facing a non-violent felony like a drug possession charge for the first time, we can often get you a 2nd chance probation. It will typically involve a required drug treatment program completion.
. If you are facing a non-violent felony like a drug possession charge for the first time, we can often get you a 2nd chance probation. It will typically involve a required drug treatment program completion. Drug School. For a simple possession charge, you have to take a few drug education classes, and after completion, you can get your charges dismissed.
There are also other alternative dispositions for people with clear addiction programs, including Drug Court and TASC Probation. Both involve extensive monitoring and counseling but can help you get your life together if that's what you need.
Whatever the situation, there are almost always options that we can work out to help you get past this and get on with your life.
Signup to receive a daily roundup of the top LGBT+ news stories from around the world
Human rights groups have urged Kenya to allow LGBT groups to carry out their work there uninterrupted.
The Human Rights Watch (HRW) has released a new video in which it notes that the National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (NGLHRC) was denied its application to register, and that such NGOs were often deemed “unacceptable”.
“The National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission seeks to carry out basic human rights work, such as standing up for LGBT people who have been victims of violence,” said Eric Gitari, executive director of NGLHRC.
“To deny the NGLHRC the right to register is to deny them the chance to carry out this important work and violates the rights to freedom of association and non-discrimination enshrined in Kenya's Constitution.”
NGLHRC attempted to register as an NGO in 2012, but the Non-Governmental Organizations Coordination Board denied the application, stating that the name of the organisation was “unacceptable”, noting that the Kenyan Penal Code criminalises “gay and lesbian liaisons.”
The NGLHRC challenged the refusal in court. The case is scheduled to be heard by the constitutional and judicial review division of the High Court of Kenya on 9 October.
About
Today we have an universal audio jack that has been the default industry connection device for decades. However, the reality is that we are more dependent on audio jacks for our computers, phones and tablets than ever before. We use this technology everywhere we go, and the unfortunate fact is that the audio jack has not stayed up-to-date to the demands placed on it today.
This dilemma is the "spark" that got it all started as we (Jon and Jeff) sat down over a cup of coffee...
... dreaming of what the world might look like with an improved audio connection solution. That is where our passion started and it has only grown as we get closer to making our dream a reality.
Our hope is that in some small way, you will be excited about this Kickstarter campaign, and you will believe in this vision and decide to join the MAGZET revolution. And if you do decide to join us, you will be the proud owner of a MAGZET before it land in stores! This is especially important for our backers in countries outside of the United States that may not always have immediate access to the new technologies – with your backing you will get the MAGZET at the same time as everyone else.
Reported by:
Our Solution
Yes! MAGZET will bring innovation to the audio connection with the power of magnetic technology…
The MAGZET Magnetic Technology in the Middle
Think about it, if we add magnetic technology in the middle (and we did with the MAGZET!), we can keep all the accessories and devices and that we already invested in and make them...
MAGkap and MAGjack
"Snap" connect enabled – The magnet technology conveniently pulls them together in a “snap” and auto-aligns even in dark environments without specific visual focus.
More reliable – Once the MAGkap (the side you plug into the audio cable) and MAGjack (the side you plug into the device) is installed, the device's jack and your audio cable are protected from wear-out.
Safer – The magnetic technology breakaway feature protects your ears, headphones, accessories, or even worse, your device from being catapulted into hard surfaces with very expensive and inconvenient consequences.
What's so wrong with the traditional audio jack?
We have all experienced the flaws of the audio jack as we know it today...
Inconvenient - We have to “visually” focus and locate a small hole to slide things together, which is difficult to do while driving or in certain situations such as in a dark room, or while device is in a handbag or backpack.
Fragile - The audio plug has been known to breakoff in a device's jack and/or the device's audio jack or cable as been known to wear-out and stop working.
Costly/Painful - Pull on the audio or headset cable from a bad angle and devices have been known to be catapulted into hard surfaces with very expensive and painful consequences to your devices, and your ears, head, or other body parts.
Open Jack - With the audio jack remaining open when headphones are not in use, dirt, debris, and moisture can work its way into the jack, impacting performance.
Where can I use it? Connecting to all your audio devices and accessories becomes simple and smooth. You can use your MAGZET with your phone, computer, tablet, headphones, stereo systems, even your car auxiliary input... pretty much any place you want an easier and safer way to connect your audio. You will want to have several, for maximum audio device and accessory versatility. Will all my current audio features still work? What about sound quality? Yes! We took the design time and have run tests to make sure the MAGZET functions correctly with all your favorite devices, including Apple and Android-based models. You will still be able to answer calls, use the mic, adjust volume and skip tracks via the cable inline controls when using the MAGZET. The audio quality is preserved as we use the highest quality materials and manufacturing processes that one would expect from a high-end audio accessory. Whether you're using your favorite phone, tablet, headphones, or computer, we have made sure that your device's functionality, audio quality, and features will continue to work just as you have always experienced with your wired solution. What about Bluetooth headsets? Aren't they the future? The apparent freedom of going wireless with Bluetooth seems like a nice option. However, it can be incredibly cumbersome to have to work through the pairing process and have a whole additional device that requires battery monitoring and charging. The MAGZET does not have these limitations, and it also works with devices that do not have Bluetooth functionality – all you need is that internationally ubiquitous audio jack that has been around for decades, well before Bluetooth was invented. If you need a wireless based solution there is certainly a place for Bluetooth, but it is not at some disadvantages and shortcomings compared to the wired audio quality and "it just works" convenience of the MAGZET. Can I really leave my MAGjack in all the time?
Yes, we wanted you to leave your MAGjack in so we invented a means to accomplish this! Normally when one plugs a connector into a phone audio jack, the phone (rightly so) thinks something is plugged in and would normally re-route the audio to headset functionality. Our technology counters the normal behavior and ensures that the MAGjack alone is not detected and the phone only detects the MAGjack when the MAGkap is connected. Can I really trust that you can build this thing? This is certainly a fair question! The good news is that Jon is an award-winning technology innovator who has commercialized dozens of products with a deployment of over 5 million devices worldwide. Additionally, Jon has built-up a network of relationships over years of domestic and Far East business dealings and travels that will be leveraged on this project.
All this to say, you can be assured that the MAGZET will be built to a world-class quality level and that we have the experience, tenacity, and relationships to deliver what we promise. HOW YOUR BACKING DOLLARS WILL BE USED... There are several tasks yet to be completed. Please watch the following video to see how your backing dollars will make them possible.

We have a long-term perspective, and the environment will remain a part of our decision-making paradigm. *** PLEASE KEEP SCROLLING FOR A DEEPER DIVE INTO DESIGN/RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT *** Designed with a "Simplicity" Focus If there is one word that sums up the MAGZET – it would be simplicity. On the outside, the Series1 looks clean and simple, and the user experience is just as easy... just "snap" the MAGkap and MAGjack together, and you are off and running – i.e. it just works! However, the most simplistic of user experiences is realized by a level of "sophistication under the covers," which we will continue to dive into with the next section. "Simplicity" the Ultimate Sophistication Research and Development As in any entrepreneurial invention, the idea is the easy part; the hard part is the actual realization of that idea into a tangible solution that people would really find valuable and be willing to purchase. So, we got to work over a year ago, pulling off many late nights. We researched by tearing into numerous devices, including Apple and Android based models. We analyzed various magnetic strengths and tested early prototype concepts, improving each design iteration, with a plugfest with real people and devices. Here is just a small snapshot of the work we have completed from a Research and Development perspective, to give you a taste of what we have been up to. The MAGkap and MAGjack Both the MAGkap and MAGjack are designed for easy use and consist of quality components to make sure you experience the high fidelity sounds you expect from a great audio accessory. "We designed to the standards of a product we would be thrilled to use in our own daily lives." The design gives you a 360 degree solid connection, while still having the added benefit of magnetic breakaway protection. The graphic below cycles through several of the MAGkap and MAGjack design iterations we explored through the design process. Engineering and Testing When we said we literally tore into jacks we were serious! The graphics below shows 10 very popular devices' audio jacks from several vendors that we analyzed by cross-sectional cutout (by hand filing!) to determine their inner workings. The analysis was key in determining a (patent pending) means to overcome the challenge that when one plugs a connector into a phone audio jack, the phone (rightly so) thinks something is plugged in and would normally re-route the audio to headset functionality, even if the MAGkap was not installed. "We want you to leave your MAGjack in and needed to invent a means to achieve that - which we did!" Magnetic Strength As one would expect, a product based on magnetic technology required considerable magnetic analysis and design effort. We needed to determine the optimal magnetic strength for both holding under normal use and for the magnetic breakaway protection features. "It took us months to zero into the optimal magnetic strength after testing dozens of magnetic materials and shapes." The fun video below illustrates the magnetic holding force on the prototype concept shown above. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with

It has yet to be miniaturized (made smaller) and does not display the final color scheme. The prototype was rapid-prototyped through the use of 3D metal printing and CNC machining processes and was hand assembled.
A few months ago, 2.52 inches of rain would have been a welcome sight for thirst-stricken wheat crops. But now, with cutters trying to get into fields to harvest what's left of the crop, the rain is not only too little, too late, but area farmers say it could be detrimental to any dryland wheat that remains.
"The rain came too late to help the dryland wheat, but it has helped the irrigated wheat," said David Coltrain, Finney County Extension Agent. They added that it is a foregone conclusion the condition of dryland wheat cannot improve at this stage.
In fact, being forced to delay the harvest due to rain could cause the quality of the wheat that remains to deteriorate and further depress yields. The rain may also spur weed growth, which can get mixed into the harvest.
Still, having any rain at all is a good feeling. "While a steady dose of rain is still hit or miss, and a dry spell can happen at any time, it's great to have precipitation to make everyone feel like it can still rain here," Coltrain said.
Figures released�recently by the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service revised wheat harvest predictions downward 2 percent for winter wheat, at an estimated 1.38 billion bushels, and downward 3 percent for hard red winter wheat, at an estimated 720 million bushels.
In Kansas, the average yields are predicted to be 29 bushels per acre, down 9 bushels from last year, and the lowest since 1996. The nationwide average was predicted to be 42.4 bushels per acre.
The NASS Kansas Crop Progress and Condition report dated June 9 rated winter wheat conditions at 28 percent very poor, 35 percent poor, 26 percent fair, 10 percent good and 1 percent excellent.
While the rain cannot help dryland wheat much at this stage of things, Doug Mai, a farmer just south of Pierceville, said the rain�helped their corn and milo-sorghum crop.
"It (the rain) helped finish out the irrigated wheat, but dryland wheat is already gone," said Mai, 39. "But it helped the milo and corn."
Mai said their dryland crops are on par with last year's yield, but added that recent precipitation brings optimism for showers in the future for the next yield.
According to the USDA NASS Kansas corn conditions, 26 percent rated very poor, 45 percent fair, 42 percent good, 5 percent excellent. Milo planted was 50 percent in 2014, which is behind the 59 percent yearly average.
Along with heavy rain, a recent storm brought an onslaught of hail that Mai said their crops were able to avoid. However, Dennis Zerr wasn't so lucky.
"The hail�we had ... reduced my yield about 15 percent," said Zerr, 64, who farms 10 miles east of Garden City.
Zerr echoed Coltrain and Mai in�stating that the rain came too late to improve wheat conditions at this point, although it has improved conditions for corn and milo. He�added that the dryland wheat is either mature or growing close to maturity as it nears harvest.
They added, "This is the third year in a row that the wheat has been well below average."
Zerr noted: "A lot of variables go into farming. Whether it's feeding, fertilizer, timing, or a host of other things, the most important is the weather. That's more important than anything. You can't control it, and you just have to accept it."

New Delhi: The Pakistan Army elite has sounded the warning bell for the beleaguered Nawaz Sharif government. At the Corps Commanders meeting on 14th October, the animosity towards the Prime Minister and their team was evident.
The terse statement that came out made it clear that that the powerful 'corner-plot-walas' blame the PMO for the leak to Dawn. They said that the article is a breach of national security and termed Cyril Almeida's information as "false and fabricated."
However, they did not clarify why a false and fabricated story could endanger national security.
Read: Pak military skewer ‘fabricated' Dawn story, say it breached national security
The army gave the Sharif government five days to find out the source that 'fed' the information to Almeida about the crucial October 3rd meeting. Almeida's report had minute details and it was later backed by the editor of Dawn who said that the facts were checked and rechecked.
During the five days that the Sharif government had to come up with a plausible explanation, the PMO bungled by first putting Almeida on the Exit Control List and then withdrawing it. It fielded Interior Minister Chaudhury Nisar to awkwardly explain its stand.
Meanwhile, almost the entire international public opinion favoured Almeida and press freedom.
Whoever planted the information on Dawn wanted it to appear that Nawaz Sharif and their brother Shahbaz Sharif, the Chief Minister of Punjab province, were knights in shining armour wanting to put terrorists behind bars but it was the army that was preventing it.
As one journalist on a TV show said, "Inki capacity Chotu gang ko pakadne kii hai nahi, yeh kahaan sey Jaish ko pakdenge? Gullu Butt they couldn't catch who had one gun, they had to call the army."
The reference is to small time gangsters, who are unafraid of the civilian governments in Pakistan. The insinuation was that it was preposterous suggestion in the Almeida report that Shahbaz Sharif had the gumption to have said what they did about the army protecting terrorists who Nawaz and Shahbaz wanted to crackdown on.
But TV commentators in Pakistan are now deducing that what actually happened was that after the success of Zarb-e-Azb, the military offensive against the Taliban in North Waziristan, and similar crackdown in Sindh, the army was keen to move into the Punjab province.
The Sharif brothers have been in-charge in the province for seven to eight years. This region is crawling with 'non-state actors' and has brought infamy to Pakistan.
A Seek and Destroy operation in Punjab would bring laurels to whoever undertakes the mission. If Pakistan Army Chief General Raheel Sharif was planning to launch this soon, clearly they had no plans to leave the mission in two months for somebody else to handle.
The elaborate public relations campaign to boost the Army Chief's image did not indicate that Sharif would go anytime soon. Also, Nawaz Sharif is over anxious on choosing their man as the next Chief of Army Staff. That has always been a thing with Nawaz. They messed up in choosing Pervez Musharraf. They would want an Army Chief, who stays in the barracks and is not seen as the 'Upholder of National Prestige'.
Nawaz Sharif's family is under the Panama leaks cloud. The family believes that the continuous leaks originate from GHQ. In Pakistan, everything is a conspiracy. Then there is Imran Khan threatening a massive dharna from 30th October. They have said that anybody but Sharif is acceptable to him.
That has led to rumours whether Shahbaz Sharif is a contender as they are the only senior family member whose name doesn't figure in Panama papers. But not to be outdone, there are those who say Shahbaz's mother-in-law figures in the list and that is being touted by some elements in the media cell close to the PMO. Wheels within wheels.
Islamabad is now bracing itself for the inevitable. There was a gossamer coup of 2014 where Raheel Sharif took charge of foreign policy and security matters but left the rest to Nawaz. But now the distance between PMO and GHQ is too vast to be bridged. Raheel Sharif retires on 30th November and speculations were rife whether they would get an extension or fade away into the sunset.
But the fact is that a General is a General till the day they superannuate. Especially so in Pakistan. Nawaz Sharif probably miscalculated that Raheel was a lame duck. If anything Raheel is now a wounded tiger, a dangerous beast.
While the print media in Pakistan is still leaning on supporting Dawn and by and large supports the elected government, television studios and the Urdu media have started the migration towards the army. Talking heads have begun laying the blame for Pakistan's isolation in the world to Nawaz Sharif. Bilawal Bhutto's slogan "Modi ka jo yaar hai, gaddar hai gaddar hai" is played on almost all channels, though Bilawal has tried to distance themselves from the slogan off late.
Long time journalists now question why Nawaz Sharif did not speak at the UN about the capture of Kulbhushan Yadav, a RAW operative who is said to have admitted working to destabilize Pakistan. One expert even offered a cash award if anybody could get Sharif to mention Kulbhushan Yadav's name. So, in addition to being anti-army Sharif is blamed of being pro-India. A lethal combination for any Prime Minister of Pakistan.
The word is out in corridors of power and the marketplace that Nawaz Sharif's days are numbered. But Sharif still might have some aces up their sleeve.  They are a long time player of the military versus government game.
Scientists have moved a step closer to curing hereditary disorders by safely repairing a gene in a human embryo.
A joint team from The United States and South Korea allowed embryos to develop for five days and succeeded in normalizing a mutant gene.
It is a scientific first and could potentially open the door to preventing up to ten thousand hereditary disorders.
Shoukhrat Mitalipov; director of the Centre for Embryonic Cell and Gene Therapy, Oregon Health & Science University said: “It's actually molecular scissors that would allow you to direct the scissors into a very specific site and specific gene, in this case we would direct into the mutant gene and induce a cut in the DNA. So the DNA is like a long string and this molecular scissors would cut where the mutation is. The embryos usually will respond by repairing this cut.”
The breakthrough could cure up to 10,000 hereditary disorders.
Creeps, welcome back. Time to reveal more of the crazy stuff I am working on. This time I want to take you through the building of my Mech Warlock deck.
Why Mechs? Why Warlock?
It's time for something old to be new again! Warlock is a fun class that has many deck options. With it's versatile hero power, you can essentially make any deck with card draw, without playing any card draw cards. There are tons of zoo, mid range & Reno decks floating around. I want to create something your opponent won't see coming…Mechs!
Deck List:
Early Game
The mech shell is pretty familiar. We will start our early game with Clockwork Gnomes, Annoy-o-Trons & of course Mechwarper. Since we don't have some of the robust spells like Mage, I will have to get a little creative. One of these innovations is Pint-Sized Summoner. Pint-Sized is a darling in this deck. They can act as another Mechwarper like option and can really throw off your opponent. I love the fact that most opponents will waste their removal on this little 2/2 giving a higher survival rate to Mechwarper or other creatures.
Rounding out the early curve is Mortal Coil — a crucial mini damage spell required to help keep boards clear with your minions. Finally Ironbeak Owl. Two of these are crucial to this deck. Priest's large taunts and/or buffed Deathlords can wreck our plan, making the owl invaluable.
Mid Game
More mechs of course! Spider Tank, Gorillabot, Piloted Shredder are no surprise here. Fel Cannon–the reason why most of my creatures are mechs, is also here. Fel Cannon works great to keep boards clear and activates at the end of your turn guaranteeing at least one use. Their 3/5 body make it even stick around a turn or two. I went with Harvest Golem for some stickyness (we always want at least one mech on board to activate Gorilla). I went with Spidertank instead of Demolisher. Demolisher is a strange card. It's something that your opponent will always want to remove. The random two damage each turning can be huge. The downside is of course the minions very weak body of 1/4. This reminds me of Priest's Lightwell. Something that can be great, but usually gets cut for better cards.
Late Game
Later game is definitely weak. By this point you should have a stranglehold on the match. If not.. Dr 7 [Dr. Boom] is of course here. It's just too valuable, and allows us to continue our clear the board plan. One Antique Healbot is here to rescue some health and allow you to draw cards with your hero power. Loatheb is a great card to make it through those final turns, especially against Druid. Finally Siphon Soul is in to remove those really nasty large creatures and of course heal us a bit more.
The Plan
MechWarlock is all about managing the board with your minions. Sort of like Zoo. You need to make value trades and gain board control. Sometimes you can just blow out your opponents with a great early start (especially if you have coin). You really need to maximize your Fel Cannons & Mortal coils to clear minions. Don't be afraid to use your owls early.
Cards On the fence.
Many cards I want to include: The two discover cards Dark Peddler & Jeweled Scarab. Having options to add more spells to the deck is very appealing. Power Overwhelming is something I really want. I even cut Mortal Coil for it, but found Mortal coil too crucial to the deck.
Have fun meching with Warlock and be sure to let me know your thoughts on the deck.

In the last couple of years, we've seen a few “streaming TV” services pop up. YouTube TV is the latest offering for folks that want to ditch cable but keep cable TV channels. You could make the argument that these services are the same as cable, but they still offer more freedom than a standard cable contract. YouTube TV will have to compete with Sling TV, PlayStation Vue, and DirecTV Now. Which streaming TV service is best for you? Let's find out.
Note: YouTube TV is one simple package, but the others have multiple tiers. For this comparison, we'll be using PlayStation Vue Core Slim, Sling TV ALL, and DirecTV Now Live a Little packages.
Channels
Obviously, the most important thing when it comes to streaming TV is the channels you can watch. The best service in the world is useless if there's nothing you want to watch. The four services we're comparing have a wide array of channels to choose from. Let's take a look at what you can watch.
Shared Channels
Here are the channels that are offered on all four packages.
Bravo Disney ESPN ESPN2 Freeform FS1 FX FXX National Geographic SyFy USA
Exclusive Channels
Them are the channels that are exclusive to each package.
That takes care of the shared and exclusive channels, but there are a bunch of others that are shared among a few of the services. The channel lineups for YouTube TV and Sling TV can be seen below. PlayStation Vue (channels) and DirecTV Now (channels) are too long to list.
Broadcast TV Channels
One of the biggest features of YouTube TV is the inclusion of broadcast TV channels. Access to these channels is determined by your location. YouTube TV includes ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, and The CW. PlayStation Vue has the same channels, minus CW, in certain regions and on-demand content from them. Sling TV includes live streams of FOX and NBC in select markets. DirecTV Now is a combination of both. On-demand for everyone, live streams in select markets.
DVR & Simultaneous Streams
Live TV is great when you're able to watch your shows as they air, but that's not possible for a lot of people. On-demand services and DVR make it easy to watch programs after they've aired. All four of these services offer some sort of way to watch things later.
YouTube TV – 9-month unlimited cloud-based DVR
PlayStation Vue – 28-day unlimited cloud-based DVR and on-demand access
Sling TV – 100 hours cloud-based DVR (limited beta) and on-demand access
DirecTV Now – only on-demand access
Another important factor to consider is how many people can watch TV at the same time. One of the great things about streaming TV is the ability to watch on practically any device, but that doesn't work so well if there's a limit on simultaneous streams.
YouTube TV – 3 simultaneous streams/profiles
PlayStation Vue – 5 simultaneous streams/profiles (2 must be on PS device)
Sling TV – 4 simultaneous streams
DirecTV Now – 2 simultaneous streams
Pricing
Money is often the reason why people cut the cord. They get fed up with paying a ton of money for a bunch of channels they don't watch. Streaming TV services try to solve this problem by offering smaller bundles for more affordable prices. We purposefully chose the packages with similar price tags for this comparison, but you can pay more (or less) depending on what you need.
Bold packages were used in comparisons above
YouTube TV
$35 for 40+ channels
PlayStation Vue
$30 for 45+ channels
$35 for 60+ channels
$45 for 90 channels
$65 for 90 channels + HBO & Showtime
Sling TV
$20 for 30+ channels
$25 for $40+ channels
$40 for 49 channels
DirecTV Now
$35 for 60+ channels
$50 for 80+ channels
$60 for 100+ channels
$70 for 120+ channels
Which service is the best?
It's nearly impossible to pick one of these services as the “best.” Everyone has difference needs when it comes to TV. Some people really want to be able to watch everything live as it happens. Other people are more interested in being able to watch shows on their own time. Maybe you have one or two favorite channels, or maybe there are a dozen channels that you watch.
Personally, I think the $20 Sling TV package is a pretty great deal. You get ESPN, AMC, Comedy Central, Disney, TNT, and other popular channels. If sports is your true love, I would suggest YouTube TV or PlayStation Vue. It all depends on what you want to watch. What service do you think has the best offering?

Mere hours before the world learned of David Bowie's passing late Sunday night, Bowie-related news of a much different tone broke: City Winery director Michael Dorf had chosen to honor the rocker in the latest installment of their tribute concert series, which has previously paid homage to stars like Bruce Springsteen and David Byrne.
With a lineup including Michael Stipe, Perry Farrell, The Roots, Cat Power, and The Mountain Goats, the show had been in the works for months, but it immediately grew in prominence — enough so that Dorf announced Thursday the addition of a second night at Radio City Music Hall on April 1, to follow the initially planned March 31 gig at Carnegie Hall. “It was an easy call for us,” the Mountain Goats' John Darnielle tells EW. “Bowie was somebody who, in my peer group growing up, was a big, big deal. Ten years ago Bowie was showing up to people's shows around New York all the time, so I've been indulging fantasies that they would be there for a while.”
In light of Bowie's death, Darnielle opened up about their connection to the musician and why he's excited to pay tribute later this year.
ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: How did you become involved with the upcoming tribute concert?
JOHN DARNIELLE: I've done one of the Michael Dorf things at Carnegie Hall before. We did the Rolling Stones one. They're these great celebrations of music that help music in the schools in New York City. There are some giants on these bills: I got to dance with Roseanne Cash at the last one; Art Garfunkel was on the bill. It's a fun time.
How are you preparing for the show?
We know what we're going to play, but that's secret until it happens. [We] are working on some ideas about who will play what, because their music is a pretty open text in a lot of ways. You can present it in a number of different ways. You can do a lot of stuff with it. Last time I was at Carnegie I got to play the Steinway [piano]. All other things we're talking about aside, Steinway at Carnegie Hall is just incredible, right?
You said Bowie was a huge artist for your friend group, do you remember your first exposure to him?
I didn't know what to make of them when I was in grade school, but I remember the record I got from the library was an early one, before they had really figured out what they were going to do. It had “The Laughing Gnome” on it. It's a novelty single from the mid-'60s. I was a kid and I liked that.
I checked out Station to Station — it's an interesting record for an 11-year-old to try and parse. I didn't really know what to make of it; it's hard to locate the melodies if you're used to verse-chorus-verse [structure]. But then in high school, my peer group was kids two or three years older than me and Bowie was absolutely the coin of the realm. Everybody had an opinion about David Bowie. Everybody I knew was into David Bowie to some extent. This would've been historically at the end of that incredible run that I guess begins with, I'd say, Hunky Dory — where they do a bunch of albums in a row, all of which are bare minimum remarkable. Hunky Dory to Scary Monsters is a remarkable run; Scary Monsters was the most recent one when we were all into Bowie. They had that thing where you get into an artist and it looks like they can do no wrong, because every album up to when you get into them is amazing.
How did David Bowie's music shape your own?
Bowie as a figure, their importance is almost totemic in some ways. He's not a person, you don't know him. He's making these records that are vague enough — like a lot of great pop music — to give you phrases to hang onto. He's also doing interrogative self-presentation, to use some academic language, which is really empowering to a lot of people, to say, “Well, I want to look like this.” It tells you that just because you're having success doesn't mean you can't continue to test what people will or won't accept from you. It doesn't mean you have to be satisfied with having gotten someplace. It doesn't mean you have to stop risking the possibility of falling down flat.
For me and my cohort, “Let's Dance” — which was a huge record — we all hated it! I like it better now because I know more about music now, whereas at the time it was like, “Giant pop record that everybody likes? Bowie belongs to us.” They were weirdo music — and then became less interested in being that persona. For many of us it was like, “No, no, wait, they belong to the freaks.” But it's part of that presentation that they gave, the permission to stop being the outsider if you want to, to think of your outside self as more plastic than we do a lot of the time. That's a powerful thing to tell people and to tell performers. It's clear that for many, many years, for more years that most artists do, they listened to himself.
Do you have a favorite album of Bowie's?
My friends and I would stay up all night arguing about David Bowie. Our argument was “Who's better, Lou Reed or David Bowie?” I was the Lou Reed partisan back then. My friends were Bowie fiends. We all liked both artists, we would just sit around bickering about which one's greater. You wind up putting the big songs up against each other and the big albums, but then you also wind up putting the ones where they fall down and going, “Well…”
Maybe Station to Station? The one they didn't remember making. That was their year of drug use and they had no recollection of recording the album, which is terrifying. Recording an album is a journey, an experience. People deploy that like a punchline — “Oh yeah, they were so high they didn't remember it!” Think about spending a month making something, a piece of art, and being too high to remember making it. That's terrifying. And yet, they bring some remarkable art from that place. That's their most mystical album, I think.
Months of tension spilled into riot and protest as miners clashed with authorities in the town of Tonypandy in November 1910.

The Great Unrest
During a period in the early 1910s which is often called ‘The Great Unrest', South Wales experienced its fair share of industrial tension and social unrest. The long Cambrian Combine strike which began in August 1910 has been most commonly characterised in the history books by the serious violence seen in the Tonypandy area in November 1910.
By the autumn of 1910 nearly one sixth of all miners in south Wales were on strike and on 8 November 1910, the tensions caused by the strike came to a head and confrontations between strikers and police spiralled out of control. Striking miners had convened at their respective pits to express their dissatisfaction and this escalated into the ransacking of the town of Tonypandy. Some 60 shop windows were smashed and looted, the homes of miners' officials were attacked and one man was killed.
A bitter dispute
Though there were already hundreds of police in the area to protect the Combine's pits, the officials, and the strike-breakers, the scale of the violence was such that Metropolitan police officers were called in to assist. This angered the crowds and increased their bitterness towards the authorities. The Chief Constable of Glamorgan, fearful that the situation was getting out of hand, called on the Home Secretary, Winston Churchill, for assistance. The unusual step of sending troops to the area was thus taken, though Churchill was reluctant to do so at first. The troops were to remain in the area for several months and their presence was highly contentious; Churchill was to remain an unpopular figure in the Rhondda for generations.
The strike came to an end in autumn 1911 without a victory for the miners. Tonypandy came to symbolise an increased militancy in the workers' struggle against the coalowners.
Natural gas under Gulf may be too much of a good thing
The prospect of yet another new frontier for U.S. natural gas development, this time in super-deep wells beneath the Gulf of Mexico's shallow waters, is not all good news for Houston's energy sector.
A big uptick in output from the emerging region — predicted this week after announcement of a major discovery there — would clearly signal new life for the heavily explored offshore region. But it could also boost already swollen U.S. gas supplies, weaken prices and keep producers on the sidelines.
Such a scenario is unlikely to play out in the next year or two, given the time needed to develop the complex wells. But within three to five years, if output materializes and gas from other sources keeps rising, it “adds one more brick to the natural gas wall of worry,” said David Pursell, a managing director with local investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities.
“It could be meaningful to U.S. supply in a time frame when we really don't need more additions to supply,” they said.
A team led by New Orleans' McMoRan Exploration Co. said this week it made one of the biggest discoveries in the Gulf's shallow waters in decades.
The claim was based on results from a well, drilled in 20 feet of water to a depth of more than 28,000 feet, that found a 135-foot column of petroleum-rich rock at the Davy Jones prospect.
Additional drilling will be needed to confirm the well's true potential, but the team said the early results suggest, even beyond Davy Jones, there is plenty more oil and gas to be found in the deeply buried layers of sediment.
“Go back through the history of development in our business, and odds are, we've got more than one of these in front of us,” said John Schiller, CEO of Energy XXI, a Hamilton, Bermuda-based firm run from Houston that has a 16 percent stake in the project.
Industry analysts had predicted that ultradeep gas plays in the shallow-water Gulf of Mexico would contribute to U.S. natural gas supplies over time. But the Davy Jones discovery is likely to accelerate activity in the region.
Matt Snyder, lead analyst for Gulf of Mexico research at consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, had projected commercial production from the wells by 2017. Now, in light of the announcement, they said the firm will likely revise its forecast to 2014.
The additional output could help arrest steep declines in natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico in recent years. Gas production from the basin today is roughly 7 billion cubic feet per day, about half what it was in 2001.
Good for consumers
A rise in supply also might be good for American consumers and industrial users who could see their energy costs fall.
About a quarter of the energy consumed in the U.S. is natural gas. Residential customers use it to heat homes and to fuel stoves, water heaters and other household appliances. Industrial customers use it as a raw material in paints, fertilizer, plastics and many other everyday products.
But some oil and gas producers could struggle if the added output comes on top of growing stockpiles of natural gas from shale rock formations and other unconventional sources that have recently exploded.
Imports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, are also seen rising as new projects come online around the world, threatening to drive supplies still higher.
Careful what you wish for
“We've found ourselves in the past few years, thinking, be careful what you wish for because it might come true. All the sudden we have gas everywhere now,” said Tyler Priest, director of global studies at the University of Houston's Bauer College of Business.
Last year, natural gas prices hit a seven-year low as a jump in U.S. production met with a severe recession that gutted demand and pushed domestic stockpiles to an all-time high.
Inventories remain bloated today, but prices recently rebounded to their highest point in a year, lifted by the improving economy and a cold winter that has boosted use of natural gas for heating. On Friday, natural gas futures rose 10.3 cents to $5.691 per million British thermal units in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
In 2008, the United States used 23.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, matching the record high set in 2000. Domestic gas production that year reached nearly 21 trillion cubic feet, with imports meeting the balance of demand, according to Energy Department data. But the Energy Department projects U.S. consumption will rise to about 26 trillion cubic feet by 2030.
Analysts with Jefferies Research this week estimated the Davy Jones discovery could contain some 2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Partners in the project said the formation may even hold triple that, as well as other hydrocarbons. And they said it verified the presence of a major new exploration frontier that could yield much more oil and natural gas in coming years.
“It remains to be seen what this is going to do to total gas supply, but I would say it's pretty rare that you find one discovery by itself without other finds nearby,” said Matt Pickard, market analyst with Quest Offshore Resources in Sugar Land.
‘You'll see it coming'
But Pursell, of Tudor, Pickering, Holt, cautioned that there is still much work to do to determine the potential of Davy Jones and other ultra-deep gas wells in the Gulf's shallow waters.
“Before it becomes a big add to U.S. gas supply, you'll see it coming,” they said. “These wells take a long time to drill and cost a lot of money. They're not going to sneak up on anybody.”

Neues DFB-Trikot
Grauer Streifen für den Weltmeister
Foto: RS
Jetzt enthüllt: So will Deutschland ab November in den Länderspielen auftreten. Mit dem neuen Trikot erinnert die Nationalmannschaft an die WM 1990 in Italien.
Mitte März trafen sich in Nürnberg rund 300 Adidas-Händler. Es herrschte höchste Sicherheitsstufe. Bevor die Damen und Herren in den abgedunkelten Saal eintraten, mussten sie sich einer intensiven Personenkontrolle unterziehen. Kameras und Handys mussten am Eingang abgegeben werden. Unter größter Geheimhaltung stellte der Sportartikelhersteller aus Herzogenaurach seinen Gästen das wichtigste Produkt des Unternehmens vor: das neue Trikot des Weltmeisters.
Die Präsentation wurde zum Erfolg. Nachdem die Bilder, untermalt mit moderner Pop-Musik, über die Großleinwand gelaufen waren, gab es Beifall für das neue Deutschland-Trikot. Die Zuschauer waren beeindruckt.
Wie einst Lothar Matthäus in Rom
Das neue Trikot der Fußball-Nationalmannschaft erinnert mit seinem Brustring an das Trikot von 1990, mit dem Deutschland um den Kapitän und späteren Rekordnationalspieler Lothar Matthäus dank des 1:0-Sieges über Diego Maradonas Argentinien in Rom Weltmeister wurde. Das ist kein Zufall. Die Assoziation mit 1990 sei bewusst geschehen. Damit wolle man an die erfolgreiche WM erinnern, die Andreas Brehme im Endspiel mit seinem Elfmeter zur magischen Nacht verwandelte. Allerdings interpretierten die Designer das 90er-Trikot neu und peppten es mit modernen Stil-Elementen auf.
Schwarze Hose, weiße Stutzen
Die schwarz-rot-goldenen Querstreifen, die von Schulter zu Schulter verliefen, wurden schwarz eingefärbt und bestehen aus vielen schmalen Streifen, die zum Teil grau schimmern. Der Verlauf wurde gespiegelt. Darüber sind das DFB-Logo mit vier Weltmeister-Sternen, die Spielernummer und das Logo des zweitgrößten Sportartiklers der Welt. Der Kragen: ein V-Ausschnitt. Die Hosen werden schwarz, die Stutzen weiß sein.
Das neue Trikot wurde in enger Kooperation mit dem Deutschen Fußball-Bund (DFB) konzipiert. Dazu fertigte Adidas mehrere Versionen an. Die wurden der Marketingabteilung sowie dem Teammanager Oliver Bierhoff vorgelegt. Erst nach einigen Sitzungen entschied man sich gemeinsam für diese unten gezeigte Version.
Auf Anfrage von Funke erklärte Oliver Brüggen, PR-Direktor Adidas: „Wir wollen uns erst zum neuen Trikot äußern, wenn wir es vorstellen.“
Präsentation im November
Die Präsentation soll im November erfolgen. In welcher Stadt die neuen Kleider der deutschen Nationalmannschaft vorgestellt werden, stehe noch nicht fest. Während das neue Heimtrikot der Nationalmannschaft im klassischen Weiß gehalten ist, wird das Auswärtsdress grün sein. Das zweite Trikot orientiert sich ebenfalls am Vorgänger von 1990, unterscheidet sich dabei nur in winzigen Details, die mit dem bloßen Auge kaum zu erkennen sein werden.
Albertans will see a hike to the provincial carbon tax in the new year, but the next increase won't come until at least 2021, Environment Minister Shannon Phillips said Friday.
Under the NDP government's climate leadership plan, the broad-based carbon levy, introduced at a rate of $20 per tonne at the start of this year, will increase to $30 per tonne on Jan. 1, 2018.
“Thereafter, our carbon price increases will track with the federal legislation that will be in place at that time,” said Phillips at a federal funding announcement.
“We've been clear about that from Day 1.”
Under the federal Liberal government's plan mandating carbon pricing initiatives by the province, the tax would only move to $40 in 2021. In 2022, the price is slated to increase to $50 per tonne.
The Trudeau government originally planned to impose a mandatory carbon price of $10 per tonne in 2018, but federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna said Friday that provinces will only have to submit their plans by the end of next year.
Alberta is already compliant with the federal scheme, but the provincial carbon tax is no done deal. United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney has pledged to repeal the carbon tax in their first piece of legislation as premier if the UCP wins the 2019 provincial election.
In their speech after winning the Calgary-Lougheed byelection Thursday night, Kenney reiterated their call for the NDP to not move ahead with the carbon levy increase due on Jan. 1.
The NDP says axing the carbon levy would simply leave Alberta subject to a federal carbon pricing plan, rather than an initiative designed in Alberta.
Phillips made their comments at an announcement of $150 million in federal funding for Alberta for climate change projects, as part of the federal government's $1.4 billion Low Carbon Economy Leadership Fund.
The provincial government will reveal the specific projects that will receive support in the new year, but Phillips said the money will go to investments in areas such as affordable housing retrofits, new Indigenous climate leadership initiatives and industrial energy-efficiency measures.
“We had to put forward proposals to the federal government. We had to show they were additive to our efforts. The good news is we already had a number of programs in place,” they said.
Liberal cabinet minister Kent Hehr said such initiatives are crucial to lowering greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to fight climate change, but are still compatible with a healthy energy industry that is so important to Calgary.
“It takes compromise, it takes hard work, but it is possible,” said Hehr, the MP for Calgary Centre and minister for sports and persons with disabilities.

Economists at Citi put out a scary research note this week laying out their views on the Chinese economy and how it'll affect the world.
Chief economist Willem Buiter now thinks the most likely scenario is one in which China tugs the world into a "global recession."
Buiter and Citi are not defining a global recession as an actual drop in world output — they mean "an extended period of excess capacity: the level of potential output exceeds the level of actual output."
More simply, it means more people are out of work than needed. Global GDP would grow at about 2% or less per year for a couple of years.
To put that in perspective, GDP has grown by less than 2% only one year during the 21st century — 2009, when the full effect of the global financial crisis came crashing down and total global output actually fell.
For starters, Citi thinks China's true real GDP growth rate is more like 4%, or even lower, not the 7% or so that the Chinese government reports. Their "global recession" call suggests that growth will dip to just about 2.5% by the middle of 2016. China's growth hasn't been lower than that since 1976, when Chairman Mao was still alive.
That's a big problem for Beijing. The country's investment levels have gone through the roof since 2008 as the country tried to stimulate its economy, but there's been a lot of waste along the way. They weren't good investments, but they still need paying off, so debt levels have surged too.
China is going through a painful rebalancing phase, attempting to shift from being a low-income mega-exporter that turned its massive trade surpluses into investment, to an increasingly services-driven middle-income economy that saves less and consumes more. But that's hard. Here's Citi:
Can such a necessary structural rebalancing of aggregate demand (and a corresponding change in the structure of production from physical goods production to services and from capital goods to consumer goods and services) be achieved in China without passing through a recession? In principle, certainly. In practice, we consider this unlikely.
It's worth stressing just how incredibly low 2.5% growth is for China. In the early 1990s, the rate fell below 5%, but never that low. The average growth rate for the subsequent 20 years was about 10%. The relatively sudden slowdown is an incredibly jarring experience, even though it's not actually a contraction.
And here's why it matters to the world, in one chart:
Citi
The country's share in world trade is now higher than that of the US — based on the existing trend, it will soon be larger than that of the EU. It has practically tripled in about 15 years.
In 2011, the International Monetary Fund confirmed that China is the biggest source of real economic spillovers in the world.
That means that while it's not as financially interlinked as the advanced economies, big changes to China's economy ripple through trade channels and the rest of the world feels the effect.
Citi's analysts also explain that those figures don't even account for a lot of the trade that China does with the world: "A country could, however export nothing to China directly (and import nothing from China directly) yet export raw materials or intermediate goods and services to third countries that, directly or indirectly, depend on demand from (exports to) China."
It's a worrying prospect. Weak growth in the developed economies was being propped up by a handful of emerging markets, China most of all. But the tables are turning and emerging markets are going sour.
Worst of all, as the researchers note, in the event of an even worse scenario, mainstream acceptable monetary policy is already exhausted, and political constraints make fiscal stimulus unlikely.
As HSBC chief economist Stephen King warned previously, "the world economy is like an ocean liner without lifeboats."
Meet the protest profiteers
As people rise up against austerity, there's a booming market in repressing dissent, writes Anna Feigenbaum.
More than just bangs for your buck – there's money to be made in putting down protests with ‘less lethal' weapons, as visitors to the Milipol security expo know. © Francois Mori/AP Photos
Across the vast exhibition hall, rows of stalls stand neatly arranged. People pace the aisles, peering keenly over displays. Suited salespeople sip champagne, chatting over bowls of free breath mints branded with their company logos. Glanced from afar, one could be at any expo. There is even a hot dog vendor in the distance.
But, once past the extra security and on to the exhibition floor, a wall-mounted rack of machine guns suggests something more sinister. Along each side of the expo's alleyways are glass cases stocked full of colourful rows of teargas canisters, sound grenades and rubber bullets. Orange caps, blue caps, yellow caps, each signifying a different size and strength. Beside them stand life-sized mannequins, lips moulded into half smiles. Rather than donning the new season's fashion, however, these are draped in the latest line of body armour. Even the boudoir corset on display is made of heavy-duty rubber.
These expos take place all around the world, from Israel to India, Qatar to Canada. They form part of a rapidly growing internal security sector predicted to expand by 20 per cent by 2020
Welcome to Milipol, Europe's largest internal security expo. Operating since 1984 and now gearing up for its fourth decade, Milipol is one of the longest-running and most established security trade shows for military and policing. The 2013 event held in Paris featured over 900 exhibitors, drew 27,000 visitors and hosted 160 official delegations.

Exhibitions like these offer opportunities for government and corporate officials to peruse the latest in riot-control weapons and share strategies on surveillance and crowd control. These expos take place all around the world, from Israel to India, Qatar to Canada. They form part of a rapidly growing internal security sector predicted to expand by 20 per cent by 2020.
Corporate leaders in the ‘less lethal' market include Combined Systems Inc and Non-Lethal Technologies, both based in the US, Israel's ISPRA and Brazil's Condor Non-Lethal Technologies. Southeast Asian suppliers are expanding and many of the components that go into making these weapons come from China and India, where exports are cheap.
In recent years, international companies have increasingly begun to partner up. This allows them broader global reach, enabling corporations like Condor, located outside the European Union (EU), to share tenders with smaller companies inside the EU, where trade regulations between member states are more lax.
A market opportunity
Since 2011, the sales of less lethal technologies for crowd control have been on the rise. From the perspective of security salespeople, protest is highly profitable. ‘Civil unrest has become commonplace in many regions of the world, from protesters in Brazil to activists in the Middle East. Governments have responded by purchasing record amounts of non-lethal weapons,' reports marketwatch.com. ‘The prevailing uncertain economic circumstances, the complex political situation, and the deteriorating security condition across the globe have given rise to popular unrest and protests,' explain investment researchers at Markets and Markets.
Corporate marketing materials have likewise embraced these uprisings as promotion opportunities. In a magazine advertising their services, leading global defence company TAR writes that 2012-13 saw over 60 large-scale riots triggered by ‘poverty, oppression, hunger, race or religion'. To respond to these unstable environments, TAR encourages city and government leaders to turn to their ‘ONE-STOP SHOP that can deliver a full turnkey robust solution' for public safety.
The latest model – what will riot police be wearing this year? Advert ABACA ABACA PRESS/ABACA/Press Association Images
One such crowd-control solution prominently featured at Milipol 2013 was the Samson NL RW5 – a 360-degree rotating, modular, rapid-fire multi-lethal response system for what Israeli manufacturer Rafael calls ‘low-intensity conflicts violence'. Not yet ‘safety' approved for the commercial market, the modular system combines LRAD (long-range acoustic technology) with Combined Systems Inc's Venom grenade launcher for coloured smoke and flash bangs. With over 4,000 of their base systems already sold, Rafael's executives are expecting high demand for their product.
Multiple force response systems also come in small packages. Gracing the glass cabinets at Milipol 2013 were Condor's ‘hyper triple' grenades, Combined Systems' ‘multi-bangs' and ISPRA's ‘double purpose rounds' and ‘multi-effect' biodegradables that mix coloured smoke (CS) with flash bangs, causing distress to the eyes, ears, noise, skin and respiratory systems simultaneously.
‘These grenades operate in two stages with three effects,' the ISPRA product catalogue explains. ‘After throwing or launching, they emit a “High Flow” of CS Smoke. Few seconds later… surprisingly, the grenade explodes, creating a deterrent stunning noise by dispersion of either CS powder, rubber pellets, colouring agents, or sticky gel.'
Although manufacturers and governments claim that fewer lethals are safe, tasers and rubber bullets are often deadly. Teargas canisters and grenades get shot directly at people, causing great harm, and are fired into enclosed locations, resulting in suffocation and starting fires. These real-world practices are used to silence protest and deter dissent by policing the very air we breathe.
Anja Kanngeiser, a lecturer in sociology at Goldsmiths College in London, is an expert on sound technologies. ‘One of the key things that makes “less lethal” weapons dangerous,' they say, ‘is the presumption that there is a standard human body that gets affected in a standard set of ways – specifically in ways that are not as bad as those associated with conventional weaponry. The level of sound emitted by a flash-bang grenade, for instance, can cause permanent hearing damage.'
In addition to such risks, these new canisters are often designed to deal with what the industry terms the ‘throw-back phenomenon'. Bouncing or dancing around once they hit the ground, they are engineered to make it difficult for protesters to protect themselves by throwing them out of the crowd or back at police lines. With protests on the up, these incendiary canisters have quite literally become hot commodities.
Selling less lethality
For nations like Brazil, host of the 2014 Football World Cup and the 2016 Olympics, maintaining a façade of public order is crucial for diplomatic relations and tourism revenue. But cuts to public services and transport infrastructure, combined with corporate cronyism and forced removals, are causing waves of dissent across the country.
Rio-based Condor has already secured a $22-million contract as part of the World Cup's security budget, providing teargas, rubber bullets, light and sound grenades, and tasers
For Rio-based Condor, all this protest means big profits. The company has already secured a $22-million contract as part of the World Cup's security budget, providing teargas, rubber bullets, light and sound grenades, and tasers. ‘We always advise the right escalation of force,' promises Beni Iachan, a senior business analyst for Condor, as they point up at the company's giant new PR poster.
The looming print features a chart showing six levels of enforcement, each paired with Condor products. Like a lifestyle policing package, Condor offers a product for every riot control officer's needs to repress civil unrest. Supplying police with this full range of force provisions has helped Condor's business to grow by over 30 per cent in the past five years.
In an age of social media, fewer lethals are seen to decrease officer accountability. ‘The police can no longer just go in and beat people,' an executive from Combined Systems Inc explains. The spread of mobile video and social media platforms like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter means that acts of police violence can be recorded and rapidly disseminated. This has changed the stakes for police officers using physical force at protests.
To promote the use of fewer lethals, governments and manufacturers constantly make comparisons to greater forms of violence, acting as if coercive force is the only option for dealing with political dissent. This draws attention away from any deliberative or mediation-focused alternatives for protest policing. Instead, again and again we are offered a deadly ultimatum: ‘Would you rather a real bullet or a rubber one?'
Campaigning for change
Even NATO admits we do not know enough about the real human impacts of using fewer lethals. Their 2006 report concluded that much existing data ‘is unavailable due to proprietary or national security interests', and where data is available, it is often of ‘very little relevant quality'.
While more long-term, comprehensive medical studies are needed, decades' worth of research on the harms caused by these weapons does exist. Medical association journals and NGO groups such as Physicians for Human Rights have been releasing findings on teargas effects for years, and continue to call on governments to stop their use. Human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Omega, have published numerous reports on the abuse of such weapons by state forces.
Promoted as non-lethal, weapons such as tasers and flash-bang grenades can cause horrific injuries and even death. Anja Kanngeiser
The export chains that enable the sale of less lethal weapons are also often the target of campaigns seeking to intervene in what Amnesty International calls the ‘trade in torture'. Last year, the group Bahrain Watch launched a #stoptheshipment campaign targeting Korean manufacturer Dae Kwang Chemical Corporation, contracted to supply more than a million canisters of teargas to Bahrain – a country where over 40 people have died and thousands more have been injured as a result of teargas-related offences.
Also using transnational tactics to fight this transnational trade, the Facing Tear Gas campaign brings together organizations from the US, Bahrain, Egypt, Greece, Canada, Chile and Palestine ‘to form a global initiative to ban teargas'. In October last year they held the first protest against Urban Shield, an annual SWAT team training session and security sales expo that promotes the use of military tactics for protest policing.
Whether or not a full ban is called for, there is a pressing need to refuse the sinister logic of selling less lethality as the solution for dealing with political protest. ‘Confronting governments with the horrendous results of the sales they sanction is important,' says Ian Pocock of London Campaign Against Arms Trade. More pressure must be put on our officials to intervene in these practices of protest profiteering.

Whatever induced Adil Rashid to play that final shot? They had batted beautifully for 171 balls, with great maturity and judgment at total odds with their brief first innings, and then, on the 172nd, with the finishing line in sight, they cracked.
Did the Pakistan fielders, seven of them round the bat, finally get to him? It cannot have been that they saw easy runs, for they were an irrelevance and they had turned down plenty in the previous overs to stay on strike against Wahab Riaz.

It was totally correct, too, to keep the last man, Jimmy Anderson, away from Wahab, and let them play the spinner. But then the manner in which a player responds to the pressure situation is what defines any top-class sportsman or woman. Rashid can be proud of everything leading up to that last delivery, but it is the errant drive to cover that will haunt him.
It was not Rashid's error that cost them the game, however. Saving the game, in the circumstances, would have been the longest of long odds, and with only two wickets left at tea, it really was a matter of time. They did brilliantly well to hang on as long as they did, taking Pakistan into an anxiety zone. But the game was thrown away by an abject batting display on the third morning.
This correspondent, call it gut feeling or experience if you will, firmly believed after two days that Pakistan were already in control, but even then could not anticipate the nature of the collapse that saw the last seven first-innings wickets fall for 36, so that where England may have started the day with parity or better in mind, they found themselves with a deficit of 130. The pitch never actually got any more helpful for spinners thereafter, except out of the rough, but there was really no way back from that.
It was ever thus. On England's last visit the side contained four bowlers of world-class, yet they were whitewashed because of utterly inept batting. This time two of those bowlers, Graeme Swann and Monty Panesar, have gone, but the batting, albeit not against Saeed Ajmal in particular, has started to find its feet.
Alastair Cook and Joe Root, the latter returned to the top of the batting rankings, have been outstanding, and the manner in which Ben Stokes, for example, suddenly seemed to twig how to play the spin, was instructive. If they learned anything from the second innings, it is that patience rather than bombast is a virtue in such conditions: England have never scored more fourth-innings runs in Asia. Now they need to translate the fourth-innings attitude to their first effort. It may not be pretty but it will be more effective.
For all that, Pakistan have had two bowlers in Wahab and Yasir Shah, who have put England under constant pressure with the ball, backed up well by Imran Khan, not to be underestimated, and Zulfiqar Babar's left arm spin.
Meanwhile, the Pakistan batsmen have adopted a very clear strategy of taking few chances against the England seamers, while clambering into the spinners, who they see as the weak link, especially in the first innings when Moeen Ali and Rashid have combined figures of four for 476 at an economy rate of 4.36 runs per over. England almost sneaked a win in Abu Dhabi but that would have been very much against the head. Matches need to be set up in the first innings, and this England have not done.
Now comes a personal view, that irrespective of the batting, they have not given themselves the best chance with the ball by attempting to adhere to a template that they adopted last time and which Pakistan themselves use now.
In other words, they have been trying to fit players into a strategy rather than playing to their strengths. Last time, with Swann and, for two Tests, Panesar, the so-called balanced attack was without doubt the way to go.
Their strengths now lie elsewhere. To illustrate, let's have a look at the successful bowlers in the UAE since Pakistan made it their permanent base in 2010.
It is visiting seam bowlers who predominate, with Anderson (16 at 23.93), Broad (15 at 26.6), Dale Steyn (14 at 32.78), Shaminda Eranga (12 at 28.75), Suranga Lakmal (12 at 47.33, an anomaly), and Chanaka Welegedara (11 at 25.00), the only ones to take 10 or more wickets.
They do so at respective strike rates of 65, 69, 65, 65, 90(Lakmal again), and 60, and economy rates of 2.19, 2.31, 3.01, 2.64, 3.14, and 2.49. Of visiting spinners, only Rangana Herath, with 24, stands above Panesar and Swann, who have 14 and 13 apiece, although the New Zealander Mark Craig took 10 in the match in Sharjah played out in the immediate aftermath of the death of Phillip Hughes, and with little heart in it.
In their only series, Swann averaged 25.07, and Panesar 21.57, their respective economy rates at 2.83 and 2.14, and strike rates of 53 and 60.
So the argument becomes apparent. England are attacking this from the wrong angle. Even if Pakistan have just been determined to see off the seamers, they have still been the ones taking first-innings wickets. To this end, for the final Test in Sharjah from Sunday, England should abandon the idea of competing with spin, and concentrate on what they do best. This means that one of Moeen or Rashid has to go, and for matters of expedience in this series it cannot be Moeen.
The excellent runs scored by Rashid should not camouflage what their primary job has been, and he, as with Moeen, has just been too profligate and unproductive when it mattered. Replace them then with Liam Plunkett, who would add height and pace to the ubiquitous skills of Anderson and Broad, Wood's skiddy enthusiasm, and the optimistic endeavour of Stokes. Five seamers, 22 overs each with Moeen and Root if necessary.
There has to be a shift in the batting, too. Jos Buttler's keeping and batting have reached a nadir, one impacting on the other and they need time out now. For the final Test, Jonny Bairstow should keep wicket and move down the order either to No6 or No7, and James Taylor should come in instead of Buttler.
It might not make for eye-catching cricket, and the over-rate could struggle, but it will be more effective. Just consider which attack Pakistan would least like to face and you have your criterion.

President Trump's supportive comments about Confederate monuments have focused new attention on long-ignored Civil War statues of a mustachioed infantryman standing at rest, wearing a greatcoat and holding a rifle barrel.
The nameless figure, known to many as the Silent Sentinel, gazes over town squares and courthouse steps in dozens of Southern towns — but not just there.
Many of the South's Silent Sentinels turn out to be identical to the statues of Union soldiers that decorate hundreds of public spaces across the North. Identical, but for one detail: On the soldier's belt buckle, the “U.S.” is replaced by a “C.S.” for “Confederate States.”
It turns out that a campaign in the late 19th century to memorialize the Civil War by erecting monuments was not only an attempt to honor Southern soldiers or white supremacy. It was also a remarkably successful bit of marketing sleight of hand in which New England monument companies sold the same statues to towns and citizens groups on both sides of the Civil War divide.
It took some years before Southern customers caught on and sought to buy statues of soldiers who were more obviously Grays rather than Blues. Statue manufacturers eventually gave their Confederate models a slouch hat instead of the Union topper that looked more like a baseball cap, and a short shell jacket rather than the North's greatcoat, and a bedroll to replace the Union man's knapsack.
In 1900 in Elberton, Ga., an angry crowd pulled down and buried this statue of a Confederate soldier because it looked too much like a Union fighter. It was dug up in 1982 and now resides in a local museum. (Sarah Beetham )
[Romney calls on Trump to address the nation, apologize for Charlottesville comments]
But dozens of statues North and South are all but precise copies.
“I've spent hours staring at the creases on their pants and, Yankee or Rebel, they're often exactly the same,” said Sarah Beetham, an art historian at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts who has studied the mass production of Civil War monuments.
Indeed, the Union and Confederate versions of the soldier statue were probably constructed from the same prefabricated parts.
The meaning of a memorial is never set in stone. The people who commission it might have one message in mind, but those who view the monument in generations that follow may draw entirely different lessons. One generation's hero becomes another generation's symbol of inhumanity — one reason Americans eventually turned away from statues of great men on horses, instead choosing stones decorated with lists of those who made the ultimate sacrifice.
In the case of the Confederate statues that have turned into powerful and, to many, disturbing symbols more than 150 years after the war, the Southern women who paid for most of the statues between 1880 and 1920 said they wanted a place to honor their fallen husbands and fathers. But the communities that erected those statues were also looking for a way to assert their doctrine of white supremacy at a time when they were passing Jim Crow laws to codify the separation of the races.
To the Monumental Bronze Co. in Bridgeport, Conn., it was all just business. Union or Confederate, a customer was a customer, another $450 for a zinc statue that could mean whatever you needed it to mean. It was a business model that could appeal to President Trump — a highly profitable product that could dress up a drab little town and make many Americans feel great again.

As Civil War veterans gained political clout near the end of the 1800s, they lobbied for pensions. In the South, their wives, sisters and daughters, organized as the United Daughters of the Confederacy, raised funds and purchased statues, sparking an unprecedented monument boom.
“Because of technological innovations in the granite and bronze industries, the price of these statues came way down,” said Kirk Savage, an art historian at the University of Pittsburgh and author of “Standing Soldiers, Kneeling Slaves: Race, War, and Monument in Nineteenth-Century America.” “Tiny little hamlets in New England and the Southeast could suddenly afford monuments.”
Wealthier cities such as Richmond and Baltimore could afford to hire professional sculptors to create original works in bronze — often drawn from melted-down Civil War cannons — featuring generals such as Robert E. Lee or Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson. But those statues cost thousands.
The marketing mavens at Monumental Bronze served a much larger market with cheap soldier statues made of zinc — a bargain at $450 for a life-size model, $750 for the 8½ -foot jumbo version. Monumental offered something rare for the day: One-stop shopping. Order your soldier and Monumental would ship the prefabricated parts and send someone to your home town to put it all together and get that baby up on a pedestal before the folks in the next town over got theirs.
The monument makers “weren't interested in ideology or the moral cause,” Savage said. They just saw a market and lunged for it. Some Northern foundries had made armaments during the Civil War and were now searching for a new line. They made cemetery monuments, steady work but not a path to explosive growth. War memorials looked promising.
About 2,500 soldier statues were erected in the North and about 500 in the South, Beetham said. This celebration of ordinary soldiers was a revolutionary break from the classic commemoration of great men on horses.
Monumental sold its statues as “everlasting white bronze,” which they advertised as “a decided improvement” over marble and granite.
“This wasn't true,” Beetham said. The zinc statues tended to flake apart at the seams, or lean backward in a very unmilitary posture.
Still, those statues forever changed how Americans pictured Civil War combatants.
“Our concept of what a Yankee or a Rebel looked like comes more from these postwar representations in monuments than from what they actually wore,” Beetham said.
When Southerners saw statues that looked too much like those depicting Union boys, they rebelled. In 1900, in Elberton, Ga., an angry crowd gathered in the middle of the night and pulled down a statue of a Confederate soldier because the sculptor — a Southerner, as it turned out — had put a long overcoat (a staple of Union uniforms) on the young man, probably to save the labor of carving out two full legs.
“It was the sculptor's poor first attempt,” Beetham said. “The soldier looked like they were out of a Keebler elf cookie.”
To the good folks of Elberton, they looked like a Yankee interloper. Down they tumbled.
Townspeople dug a hole in the middle of Elberton's main square and buried the offending statue facedown. (It was dug up in 1982 and now resides in a local museum.) Elberton then replaced that statue with one from Monumental Bronze's catalogue.
“They replaced a monument made by a local Southern sculptor with a true Yankee interloper, made in Connecticut,” Beetham said.
Southern communities were generally quiet about the source of their Confederate statues. The United Daughters of the Confederacy had little choice but to buy from the North — or from Europe — because that's where the foundries were; for decades after the war, the South was still battle-ravaged and almost uniformly agricultural.
The Confederate monument boom was driven almost entirely by women. “It was politically dicey for Confederate veterans to be seen as advocating for their former cause,” Beetham said. “The men want to be able to own property. They want to be able to vote. They can only do that if they've clearly laid down their arms and sworn allegiance to the United States. Women don't have to worry about any of that — they can't own property, they can't vote. So they hide behind their femininity and say, ‘We just want a monument to have a place to lay our flowers.' ”
The monument business fell off after World War I. Although many towns bought doughboy statues, “the great man monument really fades out,” Savage said. Sculpted tributes to common soldiers remained the rule after World War II, as well — the iconic image of Iwo Jima, for example — but in the decades since, the influence of abstract art and rising cynicism about the role of great men in history have altered the nature of monuments. Abstract forms such as Washington's Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall and the 9/11 memorials in Manhattan and at the Pentagon became more common.
“Starting with World War I, there was a very strong anti-monument movement, in large part in reaction to the Civil War monuments,” which were seen as glorifying war, Savage said. Instead, living memorials became popular — public spaces such as parks, fountains, stadiums and auditoriums named for veterans.
But demand for statues never went away, especially from veterans groups. The motivation remains steady, Savage said: “We want our story, our pain, our sacrifice to be recognized.”
In a Detroit District Court today, 62-year-old engineer James Robert Liang pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the government, commit wire fraud, and violate the Clean Air Act. Liang, currently a California resident, worked for Volkswagen's diesel development department in Wolfsburg, Germany from 1983 to 2008.
Volkswagen Group has been beset by scandal since last September, when the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) made public that VW had been including illegal software in diesel Volkswagens and Audis. The software detected when the cars were being tested in a lab so that they could pass emissions tests, but once the cars hit real-world conditions, the software circumvented the emissions control system to spew large amounts of nitrogen oxide (NO x ) into the atmosphere.
According to the plea agreement (PDF), in 2006 Liang and others began building the EA 189 diesel engine that has been the center of the controversy. When the engineers realized they couldn't meet consumer expectations and US air quality standards at the same time, they began looking into using illegal software (often known in the auto industry as a “defeat device”). By 2008, Liang worked to “calibrate and refine the defeat device.” Later that year, they moved to the US to help with “certification, testing, and warranty issues” for the company's new diesels.
US prosecutors assert that when Liang and their fellow engineers met with the EPA regulators in 2007 in Michigan to describe the diesel technology that VW's cars used, they never mentioned any software that enabled the cars' emissions control systems during lab testing while reducing their efficacy during real-world driving.
The illegal software began showing up in 2009-model VW diesels and was present in VW diesels until the scandal was discovered and made public in 2015. “During this time, Liang and their co-conspirators knew that VW marketed VW diesel vehicles to the US public as ‘clean diesel' and environmentally-friendly, and [VW] promoted the increased fuel economy,” the plea agreement says.
Nearly 500,000 2.0 L diesels have illegal software on them. 3.0L diesel vehicles made by Volkswagen Group have also been discovered with defeat devices, but those models are not mentioned in Liang's plea agreement.
An interesting wrinkle in the prosecutors' claims is that early VW diesel owners began experiencing problems with their emissions control systems as their vehicles grew older, causing increased warranty claims for the company. Allegedly, some of Liang's peers thought this was because the cars weren't switching over to the more-polluting “road mode” and were getting stuck in “testing mode,” in which the emissions control system was fully effective. “Liang worked with their co-conspirators to enhance the defeat device to allow the vehicle to more easily recognize when the vehicle was no longer in testing mode,” the plea agreement states.
As part of the agreement, Liang will cooperate with the US in further investigations of the VW Group emissions scandal. If they comply, no further evidence can be used against him. He's set to be sentenced on January 11 and could get up to five years in prison.
Liang has submitted the first guilty plea for an individual in the Volkswagen scandal. Top executives at the company have blamed individual engineers for the defeat devices, but attorneys general in New York, Maryland, and Massachusetts claim that Volkswagen's top officials knew much about the secret software.
Update, 3:45 p.m. EDT: In an e-mail to Ars Friday afternoon, Liang's Lawyer, Daniel V. Nixon, commented "Mr. Liang came to court in Detroit today to accept responsibility for their actions.  They are one of many at Volkswagen who got caught up in the emissions scandal and they are very remorseful for what took place."
Puzzle Boat 2 In late March, Puzzle Boat 2 will set sail again. Like the first Puzzle Boat, this is a large-scale, Mystery Hunt-sized extravaganza intended for teams of 6-8 people to solve together over the internet. Puzzle Boat 2 will include over 100 puzzles, multiple metas, and an overall meta. In addition, Puzzle Boat 2 will offer team management (similar to Intercoastal Altercations 5) and a built-in hint system. Time and Date March 23rd, 2014 at 11AM. Puzzle Boat 2 will be available from that point onward. Puzzles As with Puzzle Boat and P&A Magazine, most of the puzzles are word, trivia, and logic puzzles covering a wide gamut of difficulty and genre. In addition, there will be a few audiovisual puzzles and curveballs thrown in. All of the puzzles have been written by me and tested by Mark Halpin, Justin Weinbaum, James McTeague, Roger Wolff, and Joon Pahk. Unlike the MIT Mystery Hunt, advanced scientific and computer knowledge will not be necessary. Hints In Puzzle Boat 2, I'll be trying out a new hint system. As your team progresses, you will discover three types of hint tokens: gold, silver and bronze. You can use these hints on any puzzle, with gold generally being flatout instructions, silver generally being a specific hint, and bronze generally being a more obtuse, general hint. You'll acquire hint tokens through solving as well as over time. Cost per Team The price per team is $60. That is a per team price...it's the same whether your team has only 1 person or 10. If your team captain is a subscriber to P&A magazine, however, the team will receive a $1 discount for every subscription they have ever purchased. (Thus if your team captain has purchased 6 subscriptions over the years, they will get a $6 discount.) Prizes The team that finishes first will receive a one-year subscription to P&A for both the team captain and for each registered player on the team (limited to 10 subscriptions). In addition, one random team that finishes in the first 30 days, other than the team that finished first, will receive two one-year subscriptions: One for the captain and one for the captain to dole out to the team member of their or their choosing. All prizes will go out 32 days after the hunt commences. What Should You Do? Continue to follow P&A on Facebook and Twitter for more information, and get those pencils sharpened. Sincerely,

Chandra Finds Evidence for Swarm of Black Holes Near the Galactic Center
January 10, 2005
NASA RELEASE: 05-002
A swarm of 10,000 or more black holes may be orbiting the Milky Way's supermassive black hole, according to new results from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory. This would represent the highest concentration of black holes anywhere in the Galaxy.
These relatively small, stellar-mass black holes, along with neutron stars, appear to have migrated into the Galactic Center over the course of several billion years. Such a dense stellar graveyard has been predicted for years, and this represents the best evidence to date of its existence. The Chandra data may also help astronomers better understand how the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way grows.
The discovery was made as part of Chandra's ongoing program of monitoring the region around Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way. It was announced today by Michael Muno of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in San Diego, CA.
Among the thousands of X-ray sources detected within 70 light years of Sgr A*, Muno and their colleagues searched for those most likely to be active black holes and neutron stars by selecting only the brightest sources that also exhibited large variations in their X-ray output. These characteristics identify black holes and neutron stars that are in binary star systems and are pulling matter from nearby companion stars. Of the seven sources that met these criteria, four are within three light years of Sgr A*.
"Although the region around Sgr A* is crowded with stars, we expected that there was only a 20 percent chance that we would find even one X-ray binary within a three-light-year radius," said Muno. "The observed high concentration of these sources implies that a huge number of black holes and neutron stars have gathered in the center of the Galaxy."
Mark Morris, also of UCLA and a coauthor on the present work, had predicted a decade ago that a process called dynamical friction would cause stellar black holes to sink toward the center of the Galaxy. Black holes are formed as remnants of the explosions of massive stars and have masses of about 10 suns. As black holes orbit the center of the Galaxy at a distance of several light years, they pull on surrounding stars, which pull back on the black holes.
The net effect is that black holes spiral inward, and the low-mass stars move out. From the estimated number of stars and black holes in the Galactic Center region, dynamical friction is expected to produce a dense swarm of 20,000 black holes within three light years of Sgr A*. A similar effect is at work for neutron stars, but to a lesser extent because they have a lower mass.
Once black holes are concentrated near Sgr A*, they will have numerous close encounters with normal stars there, some of which are in binary star systems. The intense gravity of a black hole can induce an ordinary star to "change partners" and pair up with the black hole while ejecting its companion. This process and a similar one for neutron stars are expected to produce several hundreds of black hole and neutron star binary systems.
"If only one percent of these binary systems are X-ray active each year, they can account for the sources we see," said Eric Pfahl of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville and a coauthor of a paper describing these results that has been submitted to the Astrophysical Journal Letters. "Although the evidence is mostly circumstantial, it makes a strong case for the existence of a large population of neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes within three light-years of the center of our Galaxy."
The black holes and neutron stars in the cluster are expected to gradually be swallowed by the supermassive black hole, Sgr A*, at a rate of about one every million years. At this rate, about 10,000 black holes and neutron stars would have been captured in a few billion years, adding about 3 percent to the mass of the central supermassive black hole, which is currently estimated to contain the mass of 3.7 million suns.
In the meantime, the acceleration of low-mass stars by black holes will eject low-mass stars from the central region. This expulsion will reduce the likelihood that normal stars will be captured by the central supermassive black hole. This may explain why the central regions of some galaxies, including the Milky Way, are fairly quiet even though they contain a supermassive black hole.
The region analyzed in this research near Sgr A* has been observed 16 times between 1999 and 2004 using Chandra's Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) instrument. Other members of the research team include Frederick K. Baganoff (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Niel Brandt (Penn State), Andrea Ghez and Jessica Lu (UCLA).

Introduction
At Revision 2013 we (Brain Control) released our newest production Turtles all the way down, which won the 64k-intro competition. A 64k-intro is an audio-visual presentation computed in real-time, where all code and data has to be contained in a single executable which size may not exceed 64 KB. Five guys spent a year of most of their spare-time on creating this 65.536 bytes counting piece of binary data. In this making-of you can read about the process we went through creating this intro and about the used technology. The party version of the intro can be watched either as a video (embedded below) or by downloading the binary from here. Note that you need a fast graphics card for good experience. We tested it on NVIDIA Geforce GTX 570, 670, AMD Radeon HD7870 and some mobile graphics cards. On the compo machine (Geforce GTX 680) we experienced serious stuttering in the underwater scene. If you have similar problems please contact us.
Beginnings
A few weeks after Revision 2012 payne came up with the idea of making an intro zooming from microcosm all the way out to macrocosm. Inspiration came from the famous Powers of ten video (1977) and the opening scene of the movie Contact (1997). It did not take long to convince the other team members, namely hunta, pap, strepto and skyrunner, of this idea and to start working on the intro.
All content creation, animation, sequencing, and post-processing was done solely with our demo-tool Enigma Studio 4 (depicted in the figure below). You can download the tool, the project files and the full source code from our website. The current version counts around 100.000 lines of code, is written in C++ and uses Direct3D 11 and Qt 5. We have actively developed Enigma Studio since 2005. Thus, during the last year we could mainly concentrate on creating the intro content because most of user-interface and fundamental engine code had been written already. Though, we had to face a lot of new challenges such as memory management, size optimizing shaders, level-of-detail (LOD) techniques, L-systems for plants and animals, realistic skin generation for shells and finally the planet rendering. Besides the graphics, payne rewrote once more our software synthesizer Tunefish, but more on that later.
The next step was to distribute the work to be done. Skyrunner is the main musician of our team. Hence, they were in charge of doing the soundtrack. Pap undertook the job of bringing life to the underwater scene. This task meant rewriting the L-system code of Transplant so that even animals (nautilus and shells) could be generated. Additionally, a swarm behavior simulation and a skin texture generator had to be implemented. Strepto decided to work on the terrain and the planet rendering on the basis of ray-marching. Payne was responsible for the intro content and all special effects shaders. Last but not least, hunta cared about all the remaining engine and tool code, as well as porting the texture generator from the CPU to the GPU on the basis of compute shaders.
One year of work
Payne began working on the scenes taking place in microcosm: atoms, molecules, DNA and chromosomes. For that purpose hunta implemented a dynamic LOD system. It allowed showing a lot of geometry distributed over a wide depth range. Payne implemented a microscope shader, which gave all the beginning scenes a bluish look. After a while we realized that this look is too boring to be used for all beginning scenes. Therefore, payne created a different style for the first two scenes (atom and molecules). Below are some screenshots of the first attempts depicted.

The more payne progressed with the beginning scenes, the more the additional effects for the underwater and the planet scenes were needed. Pap progressed fast with their code. It was already early possible to generate undersea animals with very realistic skin textures and to simulate swarm behavior for the fish. The skin texture generation was based on the book Algorithmic beauty of seashells. As pap knew their code and operators the best, they undertook the creation of the underwater scene geometry: placing plants, shells and nautilus, as well as simulating the fish swarms. All post-processing was added by payne. The caustics were faked by simply projecting an animated sum of two sine waves onto the ground and the water surface. The effect of sun shining diffusely through the water was faked by creating a halo post-processing shader, which added a shine over the final image. No real light source was used here. The same code was later used to create the sun glare in the space scenes. Below you can see some work-in-progress screenshots of the L-system and the underwater scene.

We knew early that every bit we could get would be needed to fit the whole code and data into 64 KB. Thus, it was clear that we also needed to come up with new ideas of how to synthesize audio.
Our old synthesizer Tunefish 3 was still relatively new and produced very satisfying sound. However, a range of different oscillators and the iFFT-based pad synth were simply too big. As throwing some of them out would have considerably reduced the final audio quality, payne sought a way to reduce the code size but not the audio quality. What if we found a way to produce all these nice sounds by coming up with just one type of oscillator instead of many? Classic oscillators can produce cool analog sounds, which we wanted to have. The iFFT-based pad synth algorithm can produce fat and rich sounds we did not want to miss neither. Though, it cannot produce the simple analog ones. Furthermore, it is not a real-time algorithm since it requires performing an iFFT on a table of 65536 frequencies. This was just not suitable for every kind of sound we needed, especially not for percussions. Consequently, the idea for the new generator of Tunefish 4 was born. What if we used an iFFT size that is
small enough to be evaluated in real-time, still produces fat sounds and, can also produce the simple square, sine and saw-tooth sounds that we all love?
After some days of experimenting it got clear that this was possible. The first attempts sounded more like alien sounds than anything we could possibly use to produce music. Though, it was only a question of time to get used to the new generator. What you hear in Turtles all the way down is not all Tunefish 4 is capable of by any means. There is still a lot of potential left in this approach. As the full source-code is public now, everybody can try out the VSTi and play with the knobs. Below is a screenshot of the Tunefish 4 VSTi depicted.
Let's go back to the graphics. The terrain and the planet were both rendered via ray-marching, without using a single triangle. The difficulty with this approach was that we needed to change from a planar noise function for the terrain surface to a spherical one for the planet. Noise derivatives were used to slightly modify the traditional fractional Brownian motion (fBm) construction in order to generate a realistic surface. For performance reasons it was essential to ray-march as few steps as possible. This is why we used sphere tracing to step along the ray, starting only from the top of the atmosphere. Shadows, water reflections and water refractions were ray-marched using the same algorithm. The planet shader was combined with atmospheric scattering and clouds to increase the realism. Finally, some flock of birds and a space station rendered using traditional rasterization were combined with the planet by performing a per-pixel depth test. For that purpose the camera used in the terrain/planet shader had to match 1:1 the camera used for rasterization. Big thanks to IQ for their articles on noise derivatives, terrain marching and the Elevated making-of. Below are some work-in-progress screenshots depicted.

After the terrain and the planet scene the outer space begins. As we were not sure yet about the ending of the intro, payne started freely creating new artwork. There were plenty of ideas for the end of the intro:
simply looping the intro,
ending with a galaxy cluster, morphing into the shape of the Brain Control logo,
the camera flies out of a computer screen.
In the end, mainly due to size problems, we opted for a simple fade-to-black after the credits. To cope with the large amount of geometry, especially for the asteroids, again hunta's LOD system was used. Below there are screenshots of some space scenes depicted which didn't make it into the final intro.

When payne began working on the space scenes we started having some bigger issues with the engine sub-systems. First of all, we exhausted more and more often the amount of available virtual memory and sometimes even video memory. The problem was that while working on the intro, all scenes and all intermediate operator results got loaded into memory over time. Therefore, hunta implemented an operator memory manager. The memory manager assigned every operator class which consumed a significant amount of memory (currently texture, mesh and scene-graph operators) a budget size. It automatically freed memory of those operators that were not part of any active operator stack, as long as their class' budget size was exceeded. The operators to be freed were chosen in a least-recently-used (LRU) fashion.
The second problem was massive turn-around times between successive stack updates, when working on large (e.g. 4096×4096) textures. For such texture dimensions the CPU texture generator, especially the Perlin noise implementation, was too slow. Thus, hunta finally did what they wanted to do already for a long time. They ported all texture operators as compute shaders to the GPU. This boosted the performance dramatically and consequently the turn-around times shortened. As a result we obtained much nicer nebula textures.
Around two months before Revision 2013 nero/Still began to help us. They offered to do what they called “color consulting”. Though, it turned out to be much more than this. Besides creating plenty of overpaints giving us new ideas of how to tweak colors and light to increase the overall scene quality, they provided tons of valuable feedback and tips on how to improve the flow and the style of the intro. Below you can see some of the original scenes and the corrections as overpaints as proposed by nero.

At the party place
Usually, we do a one week coding meeting directly before a demo party if we plan to release something at it. These meetings are of great value as they allow us to fully concentrate on the production. This year we did it again and progressed so well that we believed we would have plenty of time for boozing at Revision. It turned out we were wrong. After arriving at the party place we directly tested our intro on the compo machine. Unfortunately, it turned out that there was still a hell lot of work to do, if we wanted to make it for the deadline. We faced horrible stuttering issues in the underwater scene, discontinuities in the terrain scene and geometry popping issues in the chromosomes, DNA and molecules scenes. After three days of non-stop coding, we luckily managed to fix most of the issues. Unfortunately, we were not able to fix the stuttering, because this problem only appeared on the compo machine. After some blind attempts to fix it we simply ran out of time.
While hunta worked on fixing the issues mentioned above, pap and payne continued crunching even more content into the 64 KB. Pap worked hard on further size-optimizing the intro. This time they focused on the shaders. The first thing we did after Revision 2012 was changing from binary shaders to text shaders; size optimized by Shader Minifier. This approach saved us around 4 KB of compressed size in the player executable, but pap believed that there could be done more. Therefore, they crafted our own custom shader cruncher that applied a couple of more optimizations than Shader Minifier. It replaced e.g. all HLSL keywords by short macros and added a #define for that replacement to the shader, or it minified the variables declared in constant buffers. Our own shader cruncher saved another 2-3 KB just two days before the deadline right at the party place. This allowed us to add the space station and the spaceships. Overall, 58 shaders were used in the intro with a total, uncompressed size of 170 KB (comments counted). Below there are some work-in-progress screenshots of the space station depicted.

All in all we are very happy about the first place at Revision 2013. Though, for us it was even more important that Brain Control as a demo group did the next step when it comes to teamwork, technology, design and direction. We are already looking forward to the next 64k-intro competition and hope to see you at the next demoparty!
And Karl McCain started it. Kos responds to one of my reader's e-mails:
To all the concerned people emailing me about "being played", don't waste your time. I'm not about to revert to writing puff pieces about Obama thinking that their magic "new politics" bullshit will carry us to victory. They may or may not believe that crap, but I don't. We're going to win this thing the way campaigns are won -- by playing hardball. Politics is a blood sport.
Republicans understand this and never flinch from flinging the shit. We won't win until we learn to fight back in kind. And I'm more than happy to get down in the mud with our friends on the Right so Obama doesn't have to. Recent history vindicates the "tough and aggressive" path. We went toe to toe against Rove and their machine in 2006, and our math beat his. I have no doubt we're in for a two-peat this year, and it'll happen because we won't back off from exposing the GOP for the den of lies and corruption it has become.
I tend to agree more with Nate Silver. But I do think that Moulitsas' distinction between what the Obama campaign can do and what the rest of us can do is a fair one. I intend to be relentless for the next six weeks, morning, noon and night, weeks and weekdays, exposing the lies of the McCain-Palin campaign and showing their unfitness - in terms of competence, decency, intelligence, and experience - to become president and vice-president of the US. I will be making arguments and presenting facts in ways I do not expect and do not want Obama themselves to engage him.
But these last two weeks - and this absurd, insulting pick for veep - has roused me. As I know it has roused many. McCain needs to be more than defeated. They need to be exposed as the dishonest, despicable, desperate and dishonorable cynic they have become.

DNA tests confirmed that two babies were swapped at birth in a hospital in Shimla.
Five months after they were born and mixed up in a hospital in Shimla, two babies have finally been handed over to their biological parents.The couples whose children were swapped in Kamla Nehru Hospital had decided to amicably settle the case after DNA tests confirmed the doubt of the woman who had given birth to a boy on May 26, but was handed over a girl by the hospital staff. Them son had been handed over to another woman who had given birth to a girl a few minutes later.DNA tests were conducted on orders of the Himachal Pradesh High Court.In May, Sheetal, who works at the Indira Gandhi Medical College as staff nurse, was told by another pregnant woman Anjana in the labour room that they had given birth to a boy. But later, they were handed over a girl.Sheetal later came to know that Anjana had given birth to a boy minutes after their delivery, which led to their suspicion. They lodged a complaint with the hospital, but it dismissed their allegation. Sheetal then filed a petition with the Himachal Pradesh High Court which directed Shimla police to conduct an inquiry.DNA tests confirmed that Sheetal's son was given to Anjana. Last week, the High Court ordered both families to settle the matter out of court.The families had decided to exchange babies on Wednesday. Sheetal looked elated on finally getting custody of their son. "I am a nurse myself, this is sheer negligence and conspiracy of the hospital staff, they should be punished for putting me through all this pain," they said.Anjana, meanwhile, was in tears after handing over the boy. "I have been feeding the boy as my son for past five months, it's tough but I always wanted a girl as we already have a 10 year old son."Police has arrested a staff nurse and a mid-wife for swapping the babies and will present its investigation report about the conspiracy which was allegedly hatched by the woman and their husband who had given birth to the baby girl. BD Negi, Additional Superintendent of Police, Shimla, said, "We have arrested two people in connection with the swapping of babies, based on the investigation we will make more arrests in the case to bring out the real culprits who hatched the conspiracy."
"Change who controls the money, and you change everything," says the jacket flap of Digital Gold: The Untold Story of Bitcoin. Covering bitcoin's evolution from dismissible crackpot idea in 2008 to Bill Gates's first public acceptance in 2014, New York Times reporter Nathaniel Popper goes behind the scenes to tell the stories of the currency's creators, the earliest users, and investors: the mysterious Satoshi Nakomoto, MIT scientist Gavin Andreson, Argentinian entrepreneur Wences Cesares, Silk Road owner Ross Ulbricht, the Winklevoss twins, Bitcoin Foundation director Patrick Murck, and many more.
During those years, the exchange rate between bitcoin and US dollars veered crazily from 8.5 cents in 2009 to $940 in early 2014 to about $625 at the book's close; today it hovers around $235.
Cryptocurrency history
Popper begins with bitcoin's antecedents: 1990s discussions on the Cypherpunk mailing list and early experiments such as Adam Back's hashcash and David Chaum's Digicash, which both pioneered ideas that eventually became building blocks for bitcoin. The goal, both then and later, was to create a form of electronic money that could be used anonymously, that eliminated the costs and frustrations of dealing with banks and other financial institutions, and that was safe from government prying and appropriation.
Popper captures particularly well the varying meanings of bitcoin across the world. In the US, bitcoin segued relatively smoothly from libertarian gold-replacement dream to unromantic business interests grappling with regulators. In Argentina, bitcoin seemed a safer way to store assets than pesos, which were deflating so fast that supermarkets saw customers trying to pay up before the prices could change. In China, it appealed to a nation of bettors. Given bitcoin's wildly fluctuating prices against the world's major national currencies, the Chinese may have been the nearest right. At least, at the time: these days, people in suits are making a serious business case for the blockchain.
Popper also does an excellent job of explaining the technical concepts at the heart of bitcoin -- cryptography (as I know from personal experience) is arcane stuff and demanding to explain simply. They also do a good and entertaining job of following the stories of their colourful and dramatic characters.
In many ways, the story of bitcoin parallels the story of the development of the internet itself. From its experimental beginnings in the minds of impassioned idealists, bitcoin found rapid adoption among a variety of players who didn't share those ideals. While Silk Road customers -- for years the biggest users of bitcoin -- helped ramp the system up, the notoriety did bitcoin no favours in terms of public respectability. By the end of Popper's book, bitcoin's incoming pragmatic businesspeople are accepting that they will have to deal with regulators and participating in the first such discussions -- for example, at the 2014 Computers, Freedom, and Privacy Conference in Washington, DC, where Patrick Murck and lawmakers appeared together for the first time.
A good place to start
So: if you've been wondering about bitcoin, this book is a good place to start. Five years on from bitcoin's first release, it's clear that this is an important technology, even though its eventual impact is likely to be different from what its creators hoped. Yes, its price has crashed many times, but remember the 2000 dot-com bust: everyone agreed the internet had been hyped and its startup companies' share prices had been ridiculously bubbled. But everyone also believed it would be a whole lot bigger in 2010. Popper's warts-and-all account makes it clear that the same will be true of bitcoin.
It goes without saying that the Lions squad is full of great players. From the old heads of Sexton and AWJ to the young guns of Itoje and Sinckler. These 41 players are pound for pound the very best rugby players walking the earth right now. Cue New Zealanders furiously typing.
Now that that's out of the way let's tear them apart and find out why a team full of superstars is still not expected to win a series in New Zealand and might be hard pressed vs certain Super Rugby club sides.
Combinations and how they could fail or flourish.
The most obvious first thoughts are the combinations or the lack thereof within a multinational multi-team dynamic. But, let's take a look at the combinations the Lions have and even pointlessly theorise on a starting squad that can now not exist.
The initial look at the full squad showed a strong core of English players. But, even more than that, it initially showed a core of Saracens forwards. With Mako Vunipola and Jamie George in the frontrow, Itoje and Kruis as locks and the recently withdrawn Billy Vunipola at eight. It appeared that Gatland may have wanted this formidable set-piece core to be used against the All Blacks come test time. This would, for me, have been a very smart option for a team that needs to bring combinations together very quickly. A ready meal of excellence in the shape of Saracen's finest is now scuppered in part by Billy Vunipola's injury, a sight all rugby fans are sad to see. However, I can still see this core of European champions making a very strong showing over the next few weeks. On balance now it is likely that the Irish props will make a very strong front row combination and the core may have to adapt quickly to their rhythm.
There are two further combinations in the backs that I think will shine more than others, one is talked about a lot and the other is much less analysed. These combinations are Sexton with Henshaw, who combine at the provincial and national level like clockwork and Jonathon Joseph (JJ) with Anthony Watson, who bounce off each other at every opportunity and create a very effective defensive force alongside their well-known attacking prowess.
Utilising these friendships and combinations will be a very calculated event and Gatland has chosen in the initial game to test the JJ-Watson combination. Not only is this first game a test but it is also used as a slow build into test level rugby. Gatland is allowing them to expand their combination alongside Sexton using the short time they have to force cohesion into a side that could look lost if they aren't singing off the same hymn sheet. I can readily see the master tactician of Sexton being able to utilise the full potential of JJ and Watson and create a lethal attacking threat.
If we go deeper into the combinations chosen for this first game we will see that Sinckler and Marler have been chosen to provide a solid platform in the first game. Both being Quins boys they'll know each other's dark arts inside out. Now whilst this combination is not expected to be used at test level it should guarantee to be a strong and stable starting scrum with which the Welsh backrow can get used to playing off. This should allow Faletau, Warburton and Sexton to be able to focus on how they might link up at set piece when it comes to the biggest games of all. Stander, on the other hand, does not need this game time to build an understanding of Sexton's rhythm and could do with a small break to heal up.
On top of this solid pack the Lions will need an assured back three come test time. The combination for the first game of Seymour, Watson and Hogg could have a very interesting end result. Now whilst Seymour is a fantastic winger they aren't expected to start a test against New Zealand ahead of Watson, North, Nowell and Daly. However, they have a fantastic synergy with Hogg and this combination could go one of two ways. It could have a knock on effect where Hogg slips into a very comfortable and dangerous role during this first game and Watson follows suit playing off him. If this happens Watson and Hogg could very well put their names firmly into the ring as starting test players. The other way it could go is that Watson doesn't quite click with Hogg and Seymour, and so Seymour could outshine Watson and push their way ever closer to a starting test spot.
From this article alone there appears to be a lot of pressure on Watson to prove themselves and I think Gatland is certainly using this first game to discover more about Mr Anthony Watson and whether they have the mettle to take up that 14 shirt. Overall I like this first team selection by Gatland to test their known combinations and combine them with a few unknowns to build into the tougher matches.
Lastly, let us hope the delivery and synergy between Laidlaw and Sexton isn't too weak and wobbly or we might see an early collapse for all these very important combinations.
Come on the Lions!

Former Minnesota commit Tarek Baker announced via Twitter on Monday that they are now committed to play for the University of Wisconsin:
Extremely proud to announce my commitment to the University of Wisconsin thanks to all the family and friends! #GoBigRed — Tarek Baker (@Tbakes9) December 21, 2015
Baker is a '97-born forward that is originally from Verona, Wisconsin. They committed to Minnesota in September of 2013 while playing for the U16 Omaha Jr. Lancers. Since then, Baker has had average results playing in the USHL. Now in their second full season with the Bloomington Thunder, Baker has 5-9-14 in 25 games after scoring 17 points in 51 games as a rookie.
Baker did not sign a Letter of Intent with Minnesota during the most recent NCAA signing period this past November, and split ways with the Gophers last month due to their waning interest in him. With the Gophers no longer interested, that gave Wisconsin a second opportunity at recruiting the homegrown product after failing to land them the first time around. Baker will likely skate for the Badgers beginning next season.
Lamborghini built sport cars for a reason
Ferruccio Lamborghini became a millionaire thanks to vehicles. They made their fortune building tractors quite successfully after World War II. They also started manufacturing oil burners and air conditioning systems after their tractor plant started making lots of money. It turned out their second business also made big money so Ferruccio Lamborghini became one the wealthiest men in Italy. They could afford just about everything they wanted, at one point they had a different car for everyday of the week: the list included Alfa Romeos, Lancias, a Mercedes SL300, some Ferrari 250 GT, a Jaguar e-type, 2 Maserati 3500 GT. Not bad right?
They never really liked the Ferrari, though, they thought the quality was not exceptional in some areas of the car (like the clutch or the Spartan interior) and they thought a proper GT car should excel in those areas. They were clearly a big connoisseur of fast cars as they had any they fancied !! So I guess they were a good critic of them.
The legend started when one of their Ferrari started giving problems with the clutch, the local workshop couldn't fix this problem so Ferruccio decided to drive to Modena and confront Enzo Ferrari himself. But Enzo, who was known for their arrogance, told this ‘farmer': “The problem is not with the car but with the driver!” and went on advicing them to look after their tractors instead. We were not there to hear the accuracy of the words, but we are certain something like this happened, so for a mechanical genius like Mr Lamborghini, this kind of answer was not only insulting but an open challenge. Ferruccio should have been really furious when leaving Manarello premises and probably in the next few days they decided to show Enzo they could build GT cars better than him.
Ferrari 250 GTO above
Lamborghini GT cars
With millions of liras ready to invest, Lamborghini decided to build their own car with a V12 engine and founded an auto factory in the small town of Sant'Agata Bolognese (in Emilia Romagna). Lamborghini hired Ferrari's ex-employees Giotto Bizzarrini, Franco Scaglione, and Gianpaolo Dallara (nice threesome!). The task was very clear – to create a luxurious and powerful GT that would reach 150 mph on the Autostrada del Sole, the famous Italian motorway that connects Milan with Naples (quite scenery and beautiful too). The result was the Lamborghini 350GT, released in 1964. And all the rest is history.
It is also remarkable Ferrucio's understanding of cars and their taste for them. You can read more about them here.
Thank you Enzo and thank you Ferruccio, much appreciated your effort in this story.

Airlines cancel 7,500 flights as storms hits East
CLOSE Travelers from all over the world are stranded in Manhattan as snow blankets New York City.
This Monday morning screenshot of the USA TODAY Weather page shows the developing storm. (Taken Jan. 26, 2015) (Photo11: USA TODAY Weather)
Last update: Monday, 11 p.m. ET .
LATEST UPDATE: Storm grounds about 15% of all Tuesday flights in U.S.
Air travelers faced chaos in the Northeast this week, thanks to a major winter storm that threatens to wallop parts of the region with blizzard conditions.
Airlines reacted to the storm by cancelling more than 7,500 flights through Wednesday. Of those, at least 3,200 were already announced by Sunday – a day before the storm's first flakes fell along the East Coast.
Nearly every big airline also said they would waive change fees for customers scheduled to fly into dozens of airports the storm's path.
TODAY IN THE SKY: Airlines waive change fees as Northeast blizzard looms
LIST: Details of airline change-fee waivers for Northeast storm
FLIGHT TRACKER: Is your flight on time?
USA TODAY WEATHER: Northeast braces for monster storm
As of 11 p.m. ET, more than 2,845 flights had been canceled nationwide for Monday and another 4,340 on Tuesday, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware . Even for Wednesday, more than 300 flights had been preemptively canceled as airlines try to anticipate the storm's extended impact. In total, that put the airlines' collective storm-related cancellations at more than 7,495 for the period stretching from Monday through Wednesday.
It also began to appear increasingly likely that few flights would operate Tuesday at five major airports: New York JFK, Newark Liberty, New York LaGuardia, Boston and Philadelphia. Other airports in the region, including Hartford and Providence -- could also see most Tuesday flights grounded.
CLOSE A major winter storm system is making its way to the Northeast. Boston, New York and Washington will be hit with very heavy snow. Some areas could see historic levels, possibly as much as 30 inches of snow. VPC
As for the poor weather, the region's major air hubs were expected to see snow develop Monday, with conditions worsening into the evening. Tuesday was expected to be even worse – so bad that all flights may end up being grounded at some of the busiest airports.
American and United, the nation's two biggest carriers, each say they plan to do just that.
American, the nation's biggest carrier after merging with US Airways, tells Today in the Sky that it will have "very limited operations tomorrow (Tuesday) in the Northeast." The airline adds its current plan is "to suspend operations late this afternoon" and all day Tuesday at Philadelphia, Newark Liberty, New York LaGuardia, New York JFK and Boston."
American says it hopes to resume operations at those airports on Wednesday morning. Both Philadelphia and New York JFK are major hubs for the carrier, meaning disruptions are likely to ripple throughout American's U.S. route map.
It's a similar story for United, the nation's second-busiest carrier. United said in a Sunday evening statement that it "will limit operations beginning Monday evening at our Newark hub" as well as at New York's two other big airports: LaGuardia and JFK.
Newark is one of United's biggest hubs, making it likely that the fight disruption there will disrupt the carrier's schedule in other cities.
FlightAware CEO Daniel Baker thinks other carriers may end up halting all Tuesday operations at some Northeast airports too.
"We expect ... virtually all NYC flights to be cancelled tomorrow," they predicted in a Monday morning e-mail.
Some Tuesday flights remained on the schedule at LaGuardia and JFK airports as of 8:15 p.m. ET, but it was uncertain how many -- if any -- would actually fly come Tuesday.
Fliers at Boston Logan will face a similar situation.
"Just about every scheduled flight will be canceled tomorrow," airport spokesperson Matthew Brelis tells The Weather Channel.
Already, they say about 30% of today's flights at Boston have been canceled, with The Weather Channel adding there will be few flights operating in Boston after 7 p.m. ET.
"We're telling folks to call their airline and check on their flight status before they head to the airport. That's really important," Brelis says.
