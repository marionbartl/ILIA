Paul Joseph Chadick (May 25, 1918 – December 28, 1999) was an American basketball player. They played college basketball at Beacom College and Saint Joseph's University and later played for several different professional teams from 1939 to 1951. Regarded as one of Delaware's greatest basketball players, Chadick was inducted into the Delaware Sports Museum and Hall of Fame in 1984.
Early life and education
Chadick was born on May 25, 1918, in Wilmington, Delaware. Chadick first started playing basketball at the local Boy's Club. "They used to throw out about 15 balls on the court and I got a lot of practice," they later said. "The first team I ever played on was the Boy's Club Midgets–that was when I was about 12 or 13–and Elin Ostberg was the coach." However, their career was interrupted shortly afterwards. "My father had bought me a new red sweater and we were playing a game at the Boys' Club," Chadick said. "We had no lockers and after the game [and] I was unable to find it. When I returned home and told my father, they became so mad that they made me quit the club. The next year the club was moved to Elm and Jackson Streets, which was only about a block from my home, and I started to sneak around there again and play some basketball. After a time, my father learned I was going back to the club, but they didn't say any thing about it." In 1935–36, they were a member of the Boy's Club Reapers team which won the junior and senior division championships in the Delaware State Tournament.
Chadick attended Wilmington High School and was unanimously voted basketball team captain in January 1936. The Morning News reported in February 1936 that "Two Eagle-eyed performers, Captain Paul Chadick and Danny DiPace, have featured the [Wilmington HS] Red Devils' attack. Chadick is unquestionably one of the most outstanding players ever to perform for Wilmington High. They have no peer as a shotmaker and is in the thick of every offensive assault. Chadick also directs High's famed passing attack in a manner that has brought praise from everyone who has seen the team."
Chadick enrolled at Beacom College in late 1936. They played one season in basketball and was a top player under coach John D. Naylor.
Chadick transferred to St. Joseph's University in Pennsylvania in 1937. They made the starting lineup, heralded as the "Mighty Mites," in their first-year student season. They made their debut for the team in a 58–22 win over Loyola University Maryland and made two field goals and an assist. They played in the 1937–38 season and half of the 1938–39 season before leaving to enter the professional ranks.
Professional career
Chadick started their professional basketball career with Amsterdam in the New York State League (NYSL), appearing in nine games and scoring 87 total points in the 1939–40 season. For the 1940–41 season, they returned to Delaware and played for the independent St. Hedwig's Huskies. They also are a player-coach that season for the General Chemical team of the Industrial Basketball League (IBL), leading them to a 5–0 start. The General Chemical team eventually made the league championship, where Chadick's "sensational long-range firing of field goals" helped them win the final game 42–39 against DuPont. In the game, which was the third and deciding match of the series, Chadick scored 19 points in what was described as "one of the most exciting and bitterly contested games of the season." The Journal-Every Evening reported that "all of their action arches were from a distance with no less than half of them coming from the dead center of the court." Chadick was named the league's most valuable player in a poll and was named to the all-star squad. League president P. Newton Pew said that "Chadick's selection on the [all-star] team honors not only the best player in the league but one of the finest gentlemen as well. Chadick never complains to officials, never displays unsportsmanlike, and is always a gentleman." They also played for St. Paul's in the Catholic Basketball League (CBL).
On November 24, 1941, Chadick was signed by the Wilmington Blue Bombers of the American Basketball League (ABL). In mid-December, it was announced that Chadick was lost for the remainder of the ABL season, as they were employed by the Sun Shipbuilding Co. which had a team in the Delaware River Basketball League (Delri League) that played on the same days as Wilmington. They stated that it was impossible for them to play for both teams at once. In the four games they played in with the Blue Bombers, Chadick gave "a good account of himself," according to the Journal-Every Evening. Wilmington eventually won the league championship. From January to February 1942, Chadick played for the Milford Cardinals in the Eastern Shore Basketball League (ESBL). In a game against the Laurel Merchants, Chadick scored 43 points. They finished the ESBL season fourth in the league in scoring with 202 points.
For the 1942–43 season, Chadick returned to the Industrial Basketball League (IBL) and played for Pusey & Jones. Pusey & Jones eventually won the league championship in March, 57–37 against DuPont with Chadick scoring 12 points in the game. They also played for the Wilmington Y. M. C. A. basketball team. From January to April 1943, Chadick played for St. Ann's in the C. Y. O. Basketball League, leading them to the league championship against St. Thomas. In February, Chadick was named by league president Jim McGonegal as someone who would be on the Catholic League/C. Y. O. League all-time team. McGonegal also stated that the duo of Chadick and Bill McCahan on St. Ann's was the best combination in league history. Chadick additionally played with the Sun Ship team in the Delaware River Basketball League (Delri League), leading them to the first half league championship. Their play with Sun Ship led Chester Times journalist Bill Burks to write:
We have known it for a long time and so have most of you fans but we think it might be a good time to put it down in black and white. Paul Chadick is too good for the Delri League and is the main reason why Sun Ship has made shambles of competition by winning 23 of 24 games in two years of play. There are no players in the league who can match Chadick in all around ability, condition and competitive spirit. It is possible that Sun Ship could win the league without Paul, but the Robertshaw machine is a double-barrelled cinch with Chadick in harness. The Shippers have a clever assortment of court talent but the Wilmington whirlwind is like Joe DiMaggio with the Yankees—he is the extra punch that wins titles. It would benefit the league if Chadick was to retire. Possibly the second half struggle might result in a wide open scrap involving several teams, and this would be a tonic for the fans and the competitors. But it would be unfair to Chadick who has a perfect right to play. The fans like to watch peppery Paul, but unfortunately they make the other lads look bad.
Sun Ship eventually won the league championship game 44–40 against Ford Local, with two field goals made in the final minute by Chadick.
In October 1943, Chadick tried out for the Wilmington Blue Bombers of the American Basketball League (ABL). They made the team and scored their first points in the season opener, a win against the Brooklyn Indians. In November, Journal-Every Evening journalist Dick Rinard wrote that "Paul Chadick has proven to any skeptics who may have doubted their big league caliber that they can go in any competition." By the end of 1943 they were tied with Ed Sadowski for the team lead in scoring, with a newspaper writing that they "totalled[sic] only three points in the first three games of the season but has been banging them in steadily from the field since the fourth game." Chadick helped the team make the league championship round, where they went against the Philadelphia Sphas to capture the ABL title. In the championship series, Chadick scored 57 points, only behind teammate Moe Frankel (who scored 66) for the lead.
After the season ended, Chadick was accepted by the United States Marine Corps to serve in World War II, which caused them to miss the 1944–45 season. In October 1945, they wrote a letter to the Blue Bombers manager stating they were in Japan but hoped to return to Wilmington "before too much snow falls. While in Japan, they also played "quite a bit of basketball," according to The Morning News. They left Japan on December 4, 1945, and came to San Diego, California, on December 25. They were given honorable discharge from the Marine Corps on January 7, 1946, and arrived in Wilmington on January 16. They served overseas for 14 months. Upon returning to Delaware, Chadick signed with the Blue Bombers, making their return against the New York Gothams on January 20. In their first game back, Chadick appeared as a substitute and scored two points. A week later, against the Philadelphia Sphas on January 27, Chadick led the team with 20 points scored. After Wilmington was eliminated in the playoffs, Chadick signed with the Wilkes-Barre Barons of the Penn State League (PSL). They were a replacement for Wilkes-Barre's leading scorer, Jack "Rocco" Hogan, who had suffered an injury. With Wilmington in the 1945–46 season, they appeared in a total of 17 games and scored 174 points.
Chadick returned to the Blue Bombers for the 1946–47 season and was named team captain following the October workouts. On November 22, against the Trenton Tigers, they scored the game-winning shot with 10 seconds left to play to win 53–52. By December 13, Chadick was third in the ABL scoring with 147 points in 11 games, only behind Saul Cohen (173) and Bobby Dorn (155). They finished the season with 35 games played, 166 field goals and 71 free throws made for a total of 403 points. After the season ended, Chadick was named to the ABL all-star team.
Chadick was signed by the Elizabeth Braves in November 1947. In December, they requested a release, after not playing in any games, and subsequently signed with the Wilkes-Barre Barons. They were released by Wilkes-Barre in January 1948. Afterwards, they played in the Eastern Basketball League (EBL) for the Sunbury Mercuries. They appeared in 7 games for the team, recording 55 points scored. In March, Chadick was signed back into the ABL by the Trenton Tigers. Trailing 65–77 in the fourth period against the Philadelphia Sphas, Chadick scored four field goals and sparked a rally that won the game for Trenton 87–84. They ended the season with a 4.57 point average in 23 games played between Wilkes-Barre and Trenton. They scored a total of 105 points in the ABL season, with 41 field goals and 23 free throws made.
Chadick returned to Trenton for the 1948–49 season. They played in 13 games for Trenton before a ruptured disk in their back led to them missing the rest of the season. "I was virtually helpless," Chadick said. "I could hardly bend. It was so bad that my wife had to help me dress and undress. And even after the operation, which required a six-inch gash, I thought I'd never play again." In the games they did play in, Chadick recorded 42 field goals and 31 free throws for a total of 115 points. An October 1949 article in the Journal-Every Evening stated that "some basketball observers" rated Chadick as "the best player ever developed in Wilmington." They missed the 1949–50 season as a result of their injury, although they did take part in a benefit game with the Wilmington All-Stars. At the beginning of the 1950–51 season, Chadick received permission from doctors to play and signed with the Lancaster Rockets. Their release was reported on December 1. Shortly afterwards, they returned to Delaware and joined the St. John's team in the CYO League. In their first game with St. John's, Chadick scored 15 points and led the team to a 54–38 win over St. Paul's. By December 15, Chadick was second in the league scoring with 147 points on 56 field goals and 35 free throws. At 32 years old, Chadick was the oldest player in the league but was still described as being "as good as ever." Butch Bailey, who played with Chadick on St. Paul's in 1940–41 and was at the time their coach, said "Paul is as good a basketball player now as they ever are. He's still a hustler, still aggressive and still a great shotmaker. He's lost some of their speed, but they more than makes up for this with their experience. Except for last season, when they didn't play, I would say Paul was one of the best five players in the city in each of the last 15 years. He's always had it." On December 27, they were selected a CYO Major League All-Star. Chadick scored 18 points for the All-Stars (leading the team) in an exhibition against St. Mary's, helping them win 58–50 in a game that benefited the Delaware Day School for Handicapped Children transportation fund. In February 1951, they were selected to the Delaware All-Star basketball team that played against the Harlem Aces. In the CYO League, Chadick led St. John's to a third-place finish. St. John's was entered after the CYO season to the Delaware senior basketball tournament, where they advanced through the quarter-finals before being eliminated by Kappa Alpha.
Later life and death
Chadick retired following the 1950–51 season and became a coach for the Jewish Community Center basketball team a few years later.
Two of Chadick's sons, Mike and Paul Jr., played high school baseball at Salesianum.
In 1974, Chadick moved from Wilmington to Seminole, Florida, where they served 18 years as manager of a liquor store and operated a sporting goods shop.
Chadick was inducted into the Delaware Sports Museum and Hall of Fame in 1984.
Chadick died on December 28, 1999, at the age of 81, in Seminole, Florida.

The 1971–72 New York Knicks season was the 26th season for the team in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Knicks compiled a 48–34 record in the regular season to finish second in the Atlantic Division and earn a berth in the NBA Playoffs for the sixth consecutive year. New York had acquired Earl Monroe in a trade with the Baltimore Bullets in November 1971.
In the first round of the playoffs, New York faced the Baltimore Bullets, who had defeated the Knicks in the Eastern Conference Finals the previous year. The Knicks won the series in six games and advanced to the conference finals, where they faced the Boston Celtics. With a 4–1 series victory, New York made the NBA Finals for the second time in three seasons. In the Finals, the Knicks were opposed by the Los Angeles Lakers, whom they had beaten in the 1970 NBA Finals. After winning Game 1 of the Finals 114–92 in Los Angeles, the Knicks lost the next four games and the series. Willis Reed only played 11 games in the regular season and missed the entirety of the playoffs with a knee injury.

Peter Bain Kenen (November 30, 1932 – December 17, 2012) was an American economist, who was the Walker Professor of Economics and International Finance at Princeton University, and senior fellow in international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Early life
Kenen was born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1932, and attended The Bronx High School of Science. They earned their B.A. from Columbia University in 1954 and their Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1958. They taught at Columbia from 1957 to 1971, where they served as chairperson of the Department of Economics and was named as provost of the university.

Career
They were director of the International Finance Section at Princeton from 1971 to 1999.  They are best known for their work on the theory of optimum currency areas, in which they argued that groups of countries with diversified domestic production are more likely to constitute optimum currency areas than groups whose members are highly specialized. They were one of the first to advocate floating exchange rates for small countries.
Kenen's publications include British Monetary Policy and the Balance of Payments, which won the David A. Wells Prize at Harvard; Asset Markets, Exchange Rates and Economic Integration (with Polly Allen); The Theory of Optimum Currency Areas: An Eclectic View; Managing Exchange Rates; Economic and Monetary Union in Europe; The International Financial Architecture; and International Economic and Financial Cooperation (with Jeffrey Shafer, Nigel Wicks, and Charles Wyplosz). Recent publications include Regional Monetary Integration (with Ellen E. Meade), published in 2008 (Cambridge). They edited several books, including Managing the World Economy and Understanding Interdependence, and was co editor of the two volume Handbook of International Economics. They published numerous articles in scholarly journals, many of which have been reprinted in two volumes: Essays in International Economics and Exchange Rates and the Monetary System. In 1971, they co-authored the book International Economics with .
Kenen was a consultant to the Council of Economic Advisers, the Office of Management and Budget, the Federal Reserve, the International Monetary Fund, and the United States Department of the Treasury. They were a member of President Kennedy's Task Force on Foreign Economic Policy, the Review Committee on Balance of Payments Statistics, the Economic Advisory Panel of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Group of Thirty. They were president of the Eastern Economic Association in 2000–01.
They held research fellowships from the Ford Foundation, the Social Science Research Council, and the German Marshall Fund, and they were a fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, a Guggenheim Fellow, and Ford Research Professor at the University of California. In 1983–84, they were a professorial fellow at the Australian National University; in 1987–88, they were a visiting fellow at the Royal Institute of International Affairs; in 1991–92, they held the Houblon-Norman Fellowship at the Bank of England; and in 2002, they were professorial fellow at the Victoria University of Wellington and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.

William Fowler (May 9, 1830 – August 25, 1865) was the author of the popular Latter-day Saint hymn "We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet".
Fowler was born in Australia to an English father, John Fowler, and an Irish mother, Bridget Niel. Their father was in the British military, and when Fowler was three their father was relocated to India. When William was nine their father was honorably discharged from the army and the family moved to Sheffield, John Fowler's birthplace.
Two years after the move to England, John Fowler died, and less than four years later Bridget Fowler also died. Bridget had been raised in the Roman Catholic faith, but had joined the Wesleyan Methodist religion, as had John Fowler, who was originally an Anglican.
William Fowler was introduced to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) by Peter Poulucci, and they were baptized by J. V. Long in 1849. After being baptized, Fowler was fired from the factory in Sheffield where they had worked as a cutler.
Fowler and their wife Ellen Bradshaw had three children, Harriet Adeline Fowler (1856–1944), Henry Ammon Fowler (1857–1941), and Florence Ellen Fowler (1860–1946).
From 1850 to 1854 Fowler served as a missionary in England for the LDS Church.
Fowler wrote "We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet" sometime between 1860 and 1863. They emigrated to Utah Territory in 1863 and settled in Manti, Utah, where they were a schoolteacher. They died in Manti at the age of 35, and the LDS Church later erected a monument there in their honor.

Fictional character biography
Origins
Shooting Star was born Victoria Starwin, in El Paso, Texas.  They are the daughter of Remington Starwin, a wealthy Texas oil baron and amateur rodeo performer. When they were a child, their father encouraged their daughter's aspirations to perform professionally in rodeos. They hired scientists to build for them a special six-shooter that shoots star-shaped paralysis pellets for their sharp-shooting act. At some point in their performing career, they met a rodeo performer and former superhuman adventurer, the Texas Twister, and the two formed a dual act. Them father then had scientists design a pair of jet-boots that enabled them to stabilize their flight when swept up in the Twister's cyclonic vortex.
Rangers
Shooting Star and Texas Twister were the star attractions at Cody's Rodeo Extravaganza when they intercepted a shortwave radio message sent by Rick Jones meant for the hero team known as the Avengers. Jones was being held captive by the villainous Corruptor, who had the Hulk under their influence. Shooting Star and Texas Twister went to answer the distress call and discovered that three other individuals had responded as well — Firebird, the Phantom Rider (then called Night Rider), and Red Wolf. Although the five Southwestern adventurers were unable to stop the Hulk's rampage, they did enable them to defeat the Corruptor. At the battle's end, Texas Twister suggested that the five of them get together whenever a threat to the Southwest crops up. They agreed and took the collective name of the Rangers. However, because of the geographical separation among the members, the first incarnation of the Rangers did not last long.
Shooting Star's identity was at some point taken over by a demon named Riglevio in the employ of Master Pandemonium, who believed Firebird to be one of the possessors of their fragmented soul. To keep the Rangers from meeting regularly and perhaps posing a threat to them before they had completed their study of Firebird, Pandemonium dispatched the demon to take Shooting Star's place. Firebird nevertheless believed the demon to be hiding among the Avengers' West Coast branch and with their guidance the Rangers confronted the heroes, only to flush the demon in Shooting Star out of hiding. The demon claimed that Shooting Star was a human guise it had taken long before, that there never was a Victoria Star. The Avengers imprisoned the demon at their Compound and began an investigation of Master Pandemonium, but the Texas Twister, demonstrating a curious lack of concern, did not accompany them.
Soon, however, Texas Twister returned to the Avengers Compound at a time when Hawkeye was alone, demanding to see the captive demon. Twister declared their love for the demon, which turned back into Shooting Star. Texas Twister went on to explain that the demon had come to them months ago when Twister's powers seemed to be fading, making them afraid that he'd lose Shooting Star if their rodeo act broke up on account of their lost powers. The demon offered to augment the Twister's powers in exchange for their soul, and the Twister agreed, but after their powers were restored they begged to be spared, so the demon possessed Shooting Star instead, casting a spell that prevented Twister from telling anyone about this. Twister studied the occult until they found a means to expel the demon from Star. The demon then possessed Twister themselves and battled Hawkeye and Shooting Star. Ultimately, Star threatened to kill the demon rather than allow the possession to continue, and the demon reluctantly imprisoned itself in a statue. Texas Twister and Shooting Star were reunited.
Initiative/Secret Invasion
After the Civil War event, as a registered hero, Victoria Starwin trained at Camp Hammond, before becoming a member of Texas' new government-sponsored superhero team, the Rangers. Using a floating base called a 'Terrorcarrier', HYDRA attacks Crawford, Texas, a vacation spot for President George W. Bush. Shooting Star is seen attempting to convince the President to leave their home and get to cover away from the HYDRA attack, but they refuse, saying they have faith in the Initiative. The superhero and their fellow Rangers join a large group of heroes in attacking the carrier which is destroyed and the President is unharmed.
Shooting Star later helps the Initiative repel the Skrull invasion. They begin to succumb to a lethal gas used by the Skrull impersonating Yellowjacket, but is saved by the quick intervention of the super-speedster Whiz Kid (on the original script, they were yanked away in time by Great Lakes Avengers member Flatman and recovers immediately.
The Rangers come into conflict with Kaine, the Scarlet Spider, in Houston, then they joined forces with them to battle a monster made of pure energy.
Skills, abilities and equipment
Shooting Star has no known superhuman powers, although in their initial appearance they claimed to have "stellar powers".  They are an expert markswoman and rodeo rider. Shooting Star wears a pair of specially-designed "star shooters", which look like six-shooters but which actually shoot projectiles made of an unknown material, shaped like five-pointed stars. The stars paralyze living beings they hit, with one star capable of paralyzing a man for approximately 30 minutes. They wear boots which contain miniature gyroscopes, which keep them oriented correctly as they ride the winds generated by Texas Twister.
Other versions
In Fantastic Four Big Town, Shooting Star is a blonde superhero created by Professor X and Henry Pym. Them real name is "Vicki" and they possess flight and energy powers which manifest as glowing circles around them hands.

"Rock On" is the debut single by American country music artist Tucker Beathard. It was released in March 2016 as the first single from Beathard's debut EP Fight Like Hell. Beathard wrote the song with their father, Casey Beathard, and Marla Cannon-Goodman. It was included on their extended play, Fight Like Hell, released on October 7.
Critical reception
An uncredited Taste of Country review of the song was positive, saying that "Every note and guitar lick of this scorned country rocker feels genuine and sincere. There's little doubt they have a face in mind as they sing about the girl that got away, and then changes to the point that they don't want them back any more anyway."
Commercial performance
The song has sold 216,000 copies in the United States as of October 2016.
Music video
The music video was directed by Good One, a collaboration between brothers Ry and Drew Cox, and premiered in May 2016.

The Colegio Nacional de San Isidro (CNSI) is a public high school located in San Isidro, Buenos Aires, Argentina.
History
It opened in March 1916, by a decree approving the plan for it, and was officially founded on May 10, 1916, under the name of "Escuela Intermedia de San Isidro" (literally: Intermediate School of San Isidro), by a decree signed by Dr. Victorino de la Plaza, the President of the Argentine Nation, and Dr. Carlos Saavedra Lamas, the Minister of Justice and Public Instruction, at that time. This decree appointed Dr. José María Pirán as pro bono Principal (in Spanish: "Director ad honorem"). After one year, the name of the school was changed to "Colegio Nacional San Isidro", upon the passing of the new Budget Law of 1917, and a decree dated May 11 of 1917, signed by President Dr. Hipólito Yrigoyen and José C. Salinas, Minister of Justice and Public Instruction, appointed Dr. José María Pirán as the Principal (in Spanish: "Rector"), as well as appointing the Treasurer and several professors, by name.
Location
It is located at 165 Acassuso (the address in Spanish would show the street number last), in San Isidro City, Buenos Aires Province, near the San Isidro Cathedral. It is within walking distance to stops from bus lines 203, 333, 365, 168 and 707, to the San Isidro train station of the "Mitre" line (Actual Tba Company) or the Tren de la Costa. It is nearby the two main arteries, Del Libertador Av. and Centenario Av., that connect the northern suburbs of Greater Buenos Aires with the downtown federal district.
Admission exam
Every year, students who are interested in entering the Nacional San Isidro must attend a three-month-long admission course that meets daily. In this course, students are assessed in four different areas: Mathematics, Geography, Linguistics and History. This course is similar to the admission courses from the renowned Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires and Escuela Superior de Comercio Carlos Pellegrini. The average of all assessments is computed as the final grade for the course, and the top 500 students are admitted, though the passing grade is 4 (on a scale of 1-10). An average of about 1500 enroll in the admission course each year. The top 10 can choose the shift they will attend (morning or afternoon). The remaining 490 students are assigned a shift by means of a public drawing. However, students with a brother or sister enrolled in the school can choose the same shift as their sibling and avoid having to draw for a shift.
Curriculum
The C.N.S.I. is the only public high school in Argentina (excepting the Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires) that is not officially part of the Education System made by the Ministry of Education.

Caucahué is an island located in the Caucahué Channel, Chiloé Province, Los Lagos Region (Region of the Lakes), Commune of Quemchi in southern Chile. It has a population of 638 inhabitants according to 2001 Chilean census. The island supplies the city of Quemchi with farm and sea products.
The name Cahucahué comes from Mapudungun (the Mapuche language), and means “place of many seagulls”, from the words káwka or kawkaw, meaning "big seagull", and we, meaning place"'.
Caucahue Island used to be home to the now-extinct Caucahue people. The Caucahue were one of the canoe-going peoples that lived in the southernmost regions of Chile. They were hunter gatherers and made good use of the sea's resources, living off seafood, seaweed and minor game that they found on the island and its surrounding areas. Along with farming, today's inhabitants of the island still use the sea as a livelihood, and sell their seafood and farm produce at the Quemchi free market located right across the channel on Chiloé Island.
The island is divided into four parts: Queler, Morro Lobos Bajo, Morro Lobos Alto and Quinterquén. It has four schools, each with one teacher: "Escuela Queler", "Escuela Caucahué", "Escuela Morro Lobos" and "Escuela Quinterquén". It is connected to the mainland via the town of Quemchi. A daily boat service runs from Quemchi to the island and private boats are also available for the 20 minute trip.
Caucahue's natural vegetation is Valdivian temperate rain forest and it has a temperate climate with constant rain all year round.

Matthew Suckling (born 25 July 1988) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for the Hawthorn Football Club and Western Bulldogs in the Australian Football League (AFL). Suckling is known as a player with precision kicking and link-up play from defence. Characteristic of their style of play is their very long range, very accurate kicking.
Early life
Hailing from Wagga Wagga, Suckling played football with Isaac Smith in the Wagga Hawks for several years before both moved to the Wagga Tigers where they won two premierships.
Rookie
First drafted by the Hawthorn Football Club at pick 22 in the 2007 Rookie draft. They were struck down by osteitis pubis for most of 2007 but was retained on the rookie list for 2008. Suckling was redrafted to Hawthorn's rookie list by the club at pick 81 in the 2009 Rookie draft.
At the 2009 rookie draft, where Hawthorn had agreed to redraft Suckling; the club mistakenly read out the wrong player registration number and accidentally selected the Sandringham Dragons' best-and-fairest player, Matthew Suckling
They were then finally drafted to Hawthorn's senior list with pick 70 in the 2009 AFL draft.
Career
They made their debut for Hawthorn in the opening round of the 2009 AFL season in the rematch of the 2008 AFL Grand Final against Geelong. The 20-year-old defender was one of three Hawks playing their first game in the MCG blockbuster. Omitted the next week because of injury, Suckling was unable to break back into the side; they were listed as an emergency later in the year. In 2010 they played five games, and was on the verge of selection for most of the season.
2011 was a breakthrough year for Suckling; with their precision kicking and link-up play they became a key to Hawthorn's defence. Characteristic of their style of play is their very long range, very accurate kicking.
Suckling was selected as the Australia international rules football team's goalkeeper for the 2011 International Rules Series in Australia. Australia lost the series 2–0, with a 130–65 aggregate score. Suckling was one of two Hawthorn players selected for the team, along with Liam Shiels.
Suckling was one of three Hawthorn players to play every game in 2012.
During the 2013 NAB Cup pre season competition Suckling tore their anterior cruciate ligament whilst playing against Richmond. Suckling missed the entire 2013 season due to the injury that required a full knee reconstruction.
Suckling returned to the side in 2014, and would go on to claim their elusive premiership medal in the club's 2014 Grand Final win. They followed this up with a premiership win in 2015, starting the game as a substitute and coming on late in the third quarter for David Hale; with the abolition of the substitute rule at the end of the 2015 AFL season, this meant that Suckling became the last player to be substituted into a game.
Following the Grand Final, Suckling exercised their right as a free agent and joined the Western Bulldogs. In their first season at the Western Bulldogs Suckling was unfortunate to miss the Preliminary Final and Grand Final victories with an Achilles injury. Suckling became a regular in the Bulldog's backline but in 2018 after playing 11 games they suffered an achilles injury ultimately ended their season. They returned to form in 2019 playing 19 games but only managed 7 games in their final season.
Suckling was delisted by the at the conclusion of the 2020 AFL season, after 76 games for the club over their five years at the club.
Suckling retired at the conclusion of the 2020 season.

Ceratoichthys pinnatiformis is an extinct species of lookdown-like prehistoric jackfish that lived during the Lutetian epoch, of the Middle Eocene of Monte Bolca, Italy.
The dorsal and anal fins of C. pinnatiformis had very high, narrow crests, and it also had very long, thin pelvic fins. Its fins give it a superficial resemblance to a freshwater angelfish, leading some people to erroneously refer to C. pinnatiformis as an "angelfish," too.

The Petit Véhicule Protégé ("Small Protected vehicle") is a light, general-purpose armoured 4-wheel drive vehicle used by the French Army, made by Panhard. It is also designated as Auverland A4 AVL (Armoured Vehicle Light). Built by Auverland, it is one of the successors to the Peugeot P4.
It's intended mostly as personnel carrier, weapon carrier, and for reconnaissance, detection and communications purposes.
History
In 2004, the first batch of 314 vehicles was ordered. The first vehicles were delivered in February 2008 and production ended in July 2012. 100 vehicles will be fitted with the WASP light RWS. It is expected that the French DGA will order an additional 300 PVP vehicles.
The 2009-14 military budget originally called for a total of 1500 PVPs, but this was reduced to 1233 in 2010 and 1133 in 2012. In the end, 1073 were delivered to the Army at a total cost of €242.7m (~US$325m) for a unit cost of €167,000 (~US$220,000), or €226,000 (~US$300,000) including development costs.
Design
The PVP is modular, allowing extra seats to be added for more personnel, or to be used as a light truck. The armour, made of steel and aluminium, offers level 2 protection (STANAG 4569) for the crew and the engine. The floor is protected against antipersonnel mines (type DM 31).
Variants
PVP HD (Heavy Duty) – larger version, based on the same architecture but with level 3 armour. With 5 doors and more cargo area (2T payload, total internal volume of 7.9 m³). Gross vehicle weight is 7.6 tonnes.
PVP XL (Extra Large) – with a total internal volume of 9.4 m³ and a gross vehicle weight of 12 tonnes (max. payload: 3 tonnes). The maximum number of seats is 10. The basic armour of the XL model also offers a level 3 protection.
PVP APC – Based on the French Army's PVP but with a 150mm higher roofline to provide room for 6 troops. Developed in 2010.
Gavial – Unbuilt 5-door version with pneumatic suspension, to be licence-built by Rheinmetall. Offered to the Bundeswehr but they chose the LAPV Enok instead.
Colt – License-built by Ashok Leyland, first revealed in 2012. Variants of the original PVP as the Colt Light Tactical Vehicle, the PVP HD as the Colt Light Armoured Vehicle and the Colt Airmobile.
Operators
– 15 PVP delivered (Chilean Marines and Grupo de Operaciones Policiales Especiales)
– 1073 PVP delivered for the French Army and French police elite unit RAID
- Said to operate an unknown number of PVPs.
– 16 PVP delivered from 2012–15.
– 8 PVPs delivered in 2008 for Togolese forces deployed with MINURCAT.

Paje is a village on the Tanzanian island of Unguja, part of Zanzibar. It is located on the southeast coast between the villages of Bwejuu and Jambiani.
The lagoon is used to learn kiteboarding, since a very consistent side-onshore wind is blowing most of the year, the lagoon is shallow during low tide and has a sandy bottom, and the reef protects the lagoon from waves.

The Agency for International Trade Information and Cooperation (AITIC) was a Geneva-based intergovernmental organisation whose mandate was to assist the less-advantaged countries (LACs) to have a more active trade diplomacy by assisting them in better understanding the technicalities of trade rules and World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements. AITIC was founded to contribute to the improvement of their position in the multilateral trading system, to promote good economic governance and trade-led growth which will lead the LACs to benefit from globalisation process.
The AITIC resulted from a 2002 multilateral treaty known as the Agreement establishing the Agency for International Trade Information and Co-operation as an Intergovernmental Organisation. The AITIC was created in 2004 when the agreement entered into force. Due to the sponsoring states' dissatisfaction with the manner in which funds were being expended by the organisation, AITIC closed in early 2011.
Membership
The sponsoring states of AITIC were Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Taiwan ratified the agreement in 2009 and also became a sponsor state. From 2008 to 2010, all these states except Ireland denounced the agreement and left the organisation. Prior to the denunciations, there were 61 LACs that were participating countries in the organisation.
Activities
LACs have traditionally not had active participation in the multilateral trading system and face structural and institutional constraints regarding international trade issues. Most of these countries have small missions and not enough human resources to monitor the work of the trade-related organisations in Geneva. Some of them are so poor or so small that they do not even have a permanent representation in Geneva. AITIC therefore works to improve their participation and voice in trade negotiations. Through its Non-Residents' Unit (NRU), AITIC provides those members and observers of the WTO absent from Geneva a constant flow of relevant information on trade-related developments, the Doha negotiations as well as logistical and substantive support. AITIC organises a regular AITIC Session within the WTO's yearly Geneva Weeks.
As one size does not fit all, AITIC's personalised approach to assist the representatives of the LACs to better understand the rules of the MTS has been its trademark. One of the best known examples of the tools AITIC has developed to assist the LAC representatives is its Glossary of Most Commonly Used International Trade Terms with Particular Reference to the WTO, which is in its second edition and has been translated into the three official languages of the WTO (English, French and Spanish) and also into Portuguese, Russian and Macedonian. The agency's flexible structure allows it to provide tailor-made services to address the particular needs of the LACs for information and analysis on a wide range of issues concerning trade and development in the context of the WTO. Examples of such services are: organisation of workshops and “Flash Meetings”,<ref>[http://www.acici.org/aitic/index.html AITIC News'] </ref> on topics of interest to the LACs (i.e., Safeguards, Services, WTO Rules), publishing information notes (e.g., Aid for Trade, the Enhanced Integrated Framework for LDCs). In addition, its Official Fellowship Programme provides on-the-job training for LAC officials. AITIC's recent capacity building programmes have included courses for Geneva-based delegates on Services and Agriculture. Most of the AITIC activities (and website) are provided in the three official languages of the WTO. Finally, LACs have unrestricted access to the facilities of the Non-Residents' Unit. AITIC was an initiative of Switzerland's federal authorities to assist resource constrained developing countries and economies in transition to have a more active trade diplomacy. Originally set up as an association under Swiss private law, AITIC was transformed into an intergovernmental organisation in 2004 and has been funded during its first five-year budgetary cycle by seven Sponsoring Members (Denmark, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK). At present, AITIC has 59 Participating Members and four in the process of accession. AITIC has been the subject of two external evaluations by a Dutch consultancy, ECORYS, one in 2004 and the most recent one in 2007. A “perception audit” was performed by Burson-Marsteller in 2007.
AITIC has a tradition of collaboration with other trade-related organisations, in particular WTO, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), International Trade Commission, UNIDO, UNOHRLLS and has observer status in UNCTAD's Trade and Development Board; WIPO's Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore; the Inter-Parliamentary Union's Annual Conference on the WTO; and the Organisation Africaine de la Propriété Intellectuelle''.
AITIC's assistance has been acknowledged by several groups of LACs, in particular the Landlocked Developing Countries and the small and vulnerable economies.
Criticism and disestablishment
The Finnish government was reported as believing that it has been misled into financing the agency. It believed it was helping developing countries but, following an evaluation of AITIC's activities in February 2008, the donor countries discovered that the organisation had merely recruited rich nations as members and had predominantly spent the money on seminars and cocktail parties.
Another criticism of the agency stems from the fact that according to AITIC's most recent annual report, in excess of two thirds of the donor-funded budget is allocated to staff salaries.
As of 2009, AITIC lost the bulk of its funding, retaining only three donor states, which committed only to two further years of funding. By 2011, all sponsoring states except Ireland had denounced the agreement and the organisation ceased to operate.

Gascoyne Land Division was a land division of Western Australia defined under the Land Regulations of 2 March 1887. It included almost all of the modern Gascoyne region of the State. In the Land Act 1898, it was renamed Western to avoid confusion with the Gascoyne Land District which had just been created by the Department of Lands and Surveys, and on 1 February 1907, section 26 of the Land Act Amendment Act 1906 merged it into North-West Land Division.
It was defined thus in the Land Regulations in 1887:

Sewn Together is American rock band the Meat Puppets' twelfth full-length studio album, released on May 12, 2009, both on CD and vinyl. It was the follow-up to their 2007 reunion album Rise to Your Knees.
Recording and background
Background
Curt Kirkwood commented in an interview that the album was put together over a short period of time, comparing its production to the group's earlier albums. They said, "In the '80s, we used to just crap this stuff out. Those SST records cost, like, five grand apiece, if that much, and those are the records that made people like us. Now, if I can get away with it, I'll make a record as cheap as I can and put as little work as I can into it, which is what we did with this one. I don't like putting a lot of time into it. We cut a track, and if we've played it halfway right, we're done with it".
Recording and production
Sewn Together was recorded at drummer Ted Marcus' apartment and at The Saltmine Studios in Mesa, Arizona, United States.
Content
Musical style
Courtney Devores of Charlotte Observer delineated the sound of Sewn Together as "warm, psychedelic folk-rock".
Reception

Career
Formation and early career
Hey Moonshine was formed in 2016. Guitarist Bryan Gatmaitan and vocalist Gian Sison met thru a common friend. They started out as a five-piece band with Carlo Ybanez on bass, Ton Gregorio on guitars and Shaun Hilario on drums. They played for the very first stint was at the Concert at the Park in Rizal Park, Manila. When Bryan Gatmaitan went to the US, Aris Sison was added to the band as a guitarist. The band then decided to expound on their southern, soulful sound by including two female back-up vocalists Angela Rivera and later on, Athena Mae. Early in their career, they played in different local bars and several events such as the Fete De La Musique.
Signing with Viva Records
In September 2019, Hey Moonshine was signed under Viva Records. The band digitally released three of their songs under this label: We'll Break This War, Do Voodoo and Peace Sign.
We'll Break This War
After their signing with Viva Records, Hey Moonshine recorded a new version of We'll Break This War, which was launched in Alchemy Bistro Bar in Poblacion, Makati in October 2019. In February 2020, the band released a music video for the song We'll Break This War. This was directed by award-winning Director Arvin Belarmino and featured veteran actors Raul Morit and Erlinda Villalobos and up and coming actors Coleen Perez and Bodson Lefoi Reyes. The music video was launched at El Chante Manila in Poblacion, Makati in Metro Manila, Philippines.
Song releases in 2020
Aside from We'll Break This War, Hey Moonshine released six other singles in 2020: Ilang Beses, Astig Ka Dude, Wicked Man, Peace Riot, Mercy and Ilang Beses (feat. Sheryn Regis)
Members
The band is composed of professionals by day. Bass Player Carlo Ybanez is a trial lawyer. Backup vocalist Angela Rivera is a medical doctor. Vocalist and Harmonica Player Gian Sison is a Chef. Founder, songwriter and lead guitarist Bryan Gatmaitan is an engineer and so too is guitarist Aris Sison although both are no longer practicing and had chosen to concentrate on music. Backup vocalist and guitarist Athena Mae is a journalist, drummer Shaun Hilario is a teacher while guitarist Ton Gregorio is a web designer.
Some of the members are also veterans in the music scene. Bryan Gatmaitan played for Cynthia Alexander and Shaun was the drummer of Karl Roy.
Other milestones
Wicked Man Brew
In June 2020, Manila based beer-maker Boondocks Brewery released a beer inspired by one of Hey Moonshine's songs, Wicked Man. Wicked Man is made with locally sourced dalandan and further crafted with modified malts and hops from Kent, England. Beer enthusiasts who reviewed the beer stated that it has a "slight banana aroma, low to medium bitterness with a hint of citrus"; and "upfront citrus aroma, nice color, good head, malty feel and dry finish".
Collaboration with Sheryn Regis
In 2021, Hey Moonshine collaborated with Sheryn Regis, the Crystal Voice of Asia and released a song entitled Ilang Beses. This song is a remake of Hey Moonshine's single Ilang Beses which they released early 2020 where the band reminded listeners that it doesn't matter how many times you fall, but the number of times you rise above.

Westfália is a municipality in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.
History
The namesake of the municipality is derived from the Westphalia region in Germany where many of the early immigrants came from, although others from across Germany came as well. Westfália was founded in 1858 as the Colônia Teutônia, along with some of the other nearby towns. In 1996 Westfália emancipated from the nearby localities, Teutônia and Imigrante, to form its own independent municipality.
Economy
Westfália is primarily an agricultural town, although the town does bring in a fair amount of tourism and other economical activities are present such as industry and services.
The main agricultural productions are cattle, poultry, and swine, as well as eggs and milk. Westfália also has a high productivity of corn.
The industry sector closely follows the agricultural one, with some of the bigger industries in town being the productions of frozen meats and foods, followed by furniture and lumber.
Tourism is primarily based around the town's Germanic flare and heritage, as well as some eco-tourism. Lately business has become big in the town with locals attracting visitors with their handicrafts. Some common examples include mementos like baskets and wooden shoes (which features as a symbol for Westfália) and local delicacies such handmade cheeses, jams, and candy.
Culture
Westfália stands out in the region due to its very German essence which not only stands out in the architecture, but in how the town functions and in locals as well. Most events around town are based on the residents' German heritage and local German is still spoken to some degree, in fact since the year 2016, Plattdüütsch is the co-official language according to the law 1302. Much of the town is also descended from Germans, with the 2010 IBGE census stating that 97.84% of the population considers themselves descended from European immigrants (mostly German, although Italians, Portuguese, and others are very much present). Westfália also has a very high percentage of Lutherans, with 79.10% of the population claiming to follow that faith, one of the highest not just in the state, but all of Brazil.

Holy Trinity Church is a Grade II* listed building in Trefnant, Denbighshire, Wales. It forms part of a group of listed structures in the village, including a parsonage and school, that were designed by George Gilbert Scott and which are recognised as a significant parochial architectural group.
The church was designed by George Gilbert Scott and constructed between 1853-1855 to commemorate the life of John Lloyd Salusbury of Galltfaenan Hall. The works are variously said to have been financed by their two daughters, Mrs Townsend Mainwaring and Mrs Charles Mainwaring, and by the former's husband, Townshend Mainwaring. Giles Gilbert Scott designed a vestry for the church in 1907, which was financed by Charles Salusbury Mainwaring, an heir to Townshend.
Scott senior was also responsible for the design of the parsonage for Holy Trinity, which was constructed in 1860 on land donated by Townshend Mainwaring and is Grade II listed in its own right. The same year saw the construction of Scott's school design in the village, again substantially supported by Townshend Mainwaring; the school opened in February 1861 and is Grade II listed, as is the attached Scott-designed schoolhouse.

Marian Small (born 1948) is a Canadian educational researcher, academic, author, and public speaker. They have co-authored mathematics textbooks used in Canada, Austria, and the United States, and is a proponent of a constructivist approach to mathematical instruction within K–12 classrooms.
Career
Small began teaching at the University of New Brunswick's Faculty of Education in 1973. Within that faculty they served as department chair, acting associate dean, acting dean, dean, and acting vice-president.
Small served two terms on New Brunswick's School District 18.
Approach to mathematics instruction
Small advocates a "constructivism" approach to mathematics instruction, which encourages students to construct explanations to math problems. "There is a strongly held belief in the mathematics education community", wrote Small, "that mathematics is best learned when students are actively engaged in constructing their own understandings. This is only likely to happen in classrooms that emphasize rich problem-solving and the exchange of many approaches to mathematical situations, and that give attention to and value students' mathematical reasoning".
To demonstrate this approach, Small provides an example of students learning to add 47 and 38. A traditional approach to math instruction would show students how to add these two numbers by "grouping the ones, trading, and then grouping the tens". Small explains that in a constructivist classroom, "the teacher might provide students with a variety of counting materials and pose a problem such as, "one bus has 47 students in it; another has 38. How many students are on both buses?" and allow students to use their own strategies to solve the problem". This would be followed by a classroom discussion where the various approaches used by students were shared and additional ideas were added.
Small's approach is enhanced by skillful questioning by the classroom teacher.
Controversy
Small's style of math instruction has been described as a "random abstract approach" by those favouring more traditional skills-based pedagogy. Toronto's Globe and Mail stated: "in the latest—arguably fiercest—of the "math wars" to break out in Canada, they would be Public Enemy No. 1 for those who think kids are fast losing their number sense because of the "fuzzy-math, basic-skills-lite" teaching Dr. Small and many of their contemporaries promote".
Regarding their role in the math wars, Small has acknowledged the "concern about less emphasis on memorizing the facts and allowing calculator use" as well as the "very loud and impassioned debate on these matters". Regarding the different approaches along the continuum of math instruction, Small stated "neither is better—they are different. In fact, the more tools and approaches that we have, the more likely we are to be successful at a task".

Storeria hidalgoensis, commonly known as the Mexican yellow-bellied brown snake or the Mexican yellowbelly brown snake, is a nonvenomous snake in the family Colubridae. It is endemic to the Sierra Madre Oriental of Mexico.
Taxonomy
First considered a Mexican population of Storeria occipitomaculata by Storer in 1839, Storeria hidalgoensis was described as separate species in 1942 by Taylor. In 1944 it was reassigned as a subspecies of Storeria occipitomaculata by Trapido, and then in 1993 Flores-Villela reinstated it to full species rank, based partly on allopatry. Some feel that this re-evaluation to full species rank requires additional study.
The holotype of this species is deposited at the University of Illinois Museum of Natural History (Specimen no. 25061). It is a male collected by E.H. Taylor on 13 August 1938.
Geographic range
It is found in the eastern and south-central regions of the central Mexican plateau where it ranges from Nuevo León, through Tamaulipas and eastern San Luis Potosí to northeastern Hidalgo at elevations between above sea level.
Description
Adults are small and somewhat slender with a maximum length of . Dorsal body color varies from gray to light brown, tan, reddish, or dark brown (grayish to dark brown in preservative) usually with small gray flecks but no dark spots or crossbands. Ventral coloring is either gray to pink, or may have dark gray pigment at least laterally. Its head is black, especially posteriorly, with small gray flecks. A dark wedge-shaped mark lies behind each parietal and a light spot is usually present within the mark. Labials are either gray, or contain variable amounts of dark pigment with the fifth supralabial being the lightest of the series. The dorsal scales are without pits with some faintly keeled.
Habitat
This is a terrestrial species that occurs in primary and secondary cloud forest, pine forest, pine-oak forest and fir forests.
Reproduction
Storeria hidalgoensis are viviparous.
Diet
The biology of these snakes is poorly known and further study has been recommended.
Etymology
The specific name, hidalgoensis, is composed of hidalgo-, which refers to the Mexican state in which the type specimen was collected, and the Latin suffix -ensis, which means "belonging to".

Crawford County is a county located in the central portion of the U.S. state of Georgia. As of the 2010 census, the population was 12,630. The county seat is Knoxville.
Crawford County is included in the Macon, GA Metropolitan Statistical Area.
History
Crawford County, in west central Georgia, is Georgia's fifty-seventh county. The county was created on December 9, 1822, from Houston County, which had been formed from land given up by the Creek Indians in the 1821 Treaty of Indian Springs. The county is named for statesman William H. Crawford who had served as a U.S. senator, minister to France, and secretary of the treasury.
The first white settlers in the area were Indian agent Benjamin Hawkins. Arriving in 1803, they developed a five-square-mile compound on the Flint River, with slave labor. The compound included a shop and plantation, which became known as the Creek Agency Reserve. Although Hawkins was well liked by the Creeks, they believed, as did many white men of their time, that the Indians should embrace a European-American way of life. Their efforts to persuade the Creeks, however, were largely unsuccessful. Hawkins died at the reserve in 1816. David B. Mitchell was appointed in 1817 to replace the deceased Hawkins.
Knoxville, Georgia was established on the Federal Road, the main stagecoach route from Washington, D.C., to New Orleans, making the town a natural choice for county seat. Although the chief center of population is now Roberta, a mile to its west, Knoxville (no longer an incorporated city) retains its designation as the county seat. The current courthouse, built there in 2002, replaced one built in 1851, which still stands. The Old Courthouse is designated as a historical site and is used as a museum.
Roberta, originally called New Knoxville, is the only incorporated city in the county. It was incorporated on December 26, 1890. Roberta started out in 1886 as a railroad office and warehouse, "Roberta, ca. 1900," at the Atlanta and Florida Railway's "89 Fort Valley" milepost. Two years later, after a freight depot and passenger station were completed at the site, people began to settle in the immediate area. Townspeople gave the honor of naming the new town to Hiram McCrary, who had given the railroad the rights to come through their land. McCrary chose to call it Roberta in honor of their young daughter.
Most of the inhabitants of Knoxville, a mile away, moved to Roberta when the railroad arrived. For years, while passenger train service was an important mode of transportation, Roberta served as a thriving tourist stop on the route to Florida. After passenger train service gave way to the private automobile, Roberta relaxed into a quiet residential town. The rail tracks were taken up during the 1980s and only the rail bed remains. During 1950 through 1965 the tourist industry was revived by tourist traveling to and from coastal resorts by way of Highway US 341. This all ended when the interstate system diverted traffic away from Roberta to Macon, Georgia. The many diners and motels built to meet the tourist needs all but disappeared. Roberta is now a quiet, small Southern town. Other communities in Crawford county are Musella, Gaillard, Horns, Lee Pope, and Zenith.
Musella officially first appeared on the Georgia map in 1895. It appears that the Atlanta and Florida Railway (A&F) named the community Musella to identify it as a flag stop. The A&F began laying of track from Atlanta to Fort Valley in 1880. The railroad wanted to bring the track from Culloden to Knoxville, which was the most direct and economical route, but Crawford County rebelled. Crawford Countians didn't want the railroad passing through their county seat, so, the A&F laid the tracks to Musella instead. When Musella became a flag stop, the railroad offered better opportunities for farmers to market their products, so many of the residents of nearby Ceres, Georgia, (named after the Roman goddess of agriculture; settlement also called Hopewell) migrated to Musella. Since cotton could be shipped by rail, the cotton gin at Ceres was disassembled and moved approximately two miles to Musella. Soon, a general store and post office were built there, and Musella quickly became a hub of economic activity in northern Crawford County. Now it is a snapshot of the past.
During the county's early days, settlers relied first on agriculture (cotton and oats) then on cattle ranching, timber harvesting, and sand extraction as economic mainstays. Agriculture continues to be important, as are manufacturing and health and social services. Many residents also work in neighboring areas.
Well-known figures from Crawford County include Jefferson Franklin Long, Georgia's first African-American congressional representative and the first African American to speak from the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. Long, of mixed African and Caucasian ancestry, was born into slavery in Knoxville. As a freedman after the Civil War (1861–65), they became a tailor. Their interest in equal rights led them to politics. They were elected to Congress in December 1870 and served until March 1871 during the Reconstruction era.
John Pemberton, the inventor of Coca-Cola, was also born in Knoxville. Pemberton was a veteran Confederate States of America lieutenant colonel who served on the first Georgia pharmacy licensing board after the war. Their state-of-the-art laboratory for chemical analysis and manufacturing became the first state-run facility to conduct tests of soil and crop chemicals.
Joanna Troutman, who designed the first Lone Star flag (later adopted as the Texas State Flag), was born in Crawford County. They presented their flag to a Volunteer Georgia Battalion, who went to Texas in 1835 to assist Texans in their fight for independence. The flag was first flown at Velasco January 8, 1836, and was hoisted along with the Bloody Arm flag at Goliad on news of the declaration of independence March 8, 1836. Although Troutman lived most of their life in Knoxville, their remains were moved to the Texas State Cemetery in Austin, where a bronze statue was erected in their honor. A portrait of Troutman also hangs in the Texas State Capitol.
In 1775 naturalist William Bartram, traveling across Georgia, found a previously unknown plant in Crawford County. They named the plant Hydrangea Quercifolia—now commonly called Oakleaf Hydrangea. Bartram described the area near Sweetwater Creek as a "delightful diversified rural scene," noting that it "promises a happy, fruitful and salubrious region." See The Botanical Explorations of William Bartram in the Southeast by David H. Rembert Jr., Department of Biology, University of South Carolina—article and picture courtesy of Bartram Trail Conference.
Crawford County pottery was a thriving business in Crawford County during the 1800s and early 1900s. Men such as Long, Becham, Merritt, Pyles, and Dickson were known throughout the area for their utilitarian jugs and crocks. Clay from Crawford County and the Rich Hill alkaline glaze used by the early "jug makers" is still prized today.
Historic places to visit:
Knoxville: The Old Jail (Est 1843) Museum and the Old Courthouse (Est 1832), which was re-built in 1851 after a fire, houses documents and local history. Knoxville is also the home of the annual Crawford County Pottery Jug Fest.
Roberta: Historic Old Town Buildings, Replica of the original Train Depot and Passenger Station, Bejamin Hawkins Monument. Currently renovating a rail car Caboose for a railway Museum.
West of Roberta off Highway US 80: The Museum of Southeastern Indians with its collection of Indian artifacts and Appalachian settler history.
Musella: Dickey Farms (Est. 1897) has one of Georgia's oldest, continuously operating peach packing houses (built in 1936). Hays General Store (Est. 1900) has 110 years of continuous operation, and is one of the oldest stores of its kind in Georgia still in operation. Musella Baptist Church was founded in 1884; the current building was constructed in 1908, and is a beautiful example of traditional country church architecture.
Geography
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.5%) is water.
The fall line of the eastern United States roughly bisects the county, meaning that northern portions of the county are generally hillier than southern portions of the county, which tend to be flatter and have a lot of farmland and agriculture. The Fall Line Freeway runs across a very small portion of the southern part of the county along Georgia State Route 96.
The western portion of Crawford County, west of Musella and Knoxville, is located in the Upper Flint River sub-basin of the ACF River Basin (Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin). The northeastern portion of the county, northeast of Byron, is located in the Upper Ocmulgee River sub-basin of the Altamaha River basin. A southeastern corner of Crawford County, north of Fort Valley, is located in the Lower Ocmulgee River sub-basin of the same Altamaha River basin.

Darker is a single-player futuristic flight simulator video game published by Psygnosis in 1995 for MS-DOS. The player assumes the role of Tolly, a civilian shuttle pilot in the city of Delphi, the only city situated on the dark side of a planet in synchronous rotation around the local star. The player must defend Delphi from the Halons, inhabitants of the planet's light side, who are invading Delphi. The game takes place over a number of missions on the planet's surface and in tunnels.
The game supports the VFX-1 virtual reality headset.
Plot
Darker's story is revealed over the course of the game as information gathered by reconnaissance. The people of Delphi are not militarised, having never had reason for military action, and so technology for combating the Halon menace is developed over the course of the game. The Halon people are revealed to be invading in order to expand their cities away from the light side, which they have polluted beyond the point where it can sustain life. Eventually Tolly pilots a Halon craft to the light side of the planet, where they destroy the Halon aircraft factories.
Gameplay
The bulk of the game is played piloting a Caero shuttle. Because of the scarcity of energy on the dark side of the planet, power to the shuttle is transmitted wirelessly through a network of pylons situated on a regular grid across the city.

Martin Sean Indyk (born July 1, 1951) is a diplomat and foreign relations analyst with expertise in the Middle East. They were a distinguished fellow in International Diplomacy and later executive vice president at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C from 2001-2018. They took leave from the Brookings Institution to serve as the U.S. Special Envoy for Israeli–Palestinian Negotiations from 2013 to 2014.  They are currently a distinguished fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Indyk served twice as the United States ambassador to Israel and also as Assistant Secretary of State for Near East Affairs during the Clinton Administration.
Biography
Martin Indyk was born in 1951 in London, United Kingdom, to a Jewish family who had immigrated from Poland. Their family moved to Australia, where they were raised, growing up in the Sydney suburb of Castlecrag. Their older brother is the Australian academic and publisher Ivor Indyk.
They graduated from the University of Sydney in 1972. During the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Indyk spent time volunteering in a kibbutz in southern Israel, an experience they have called "a defining moment in my life." They returned to graduate school and received a PhD in international relations from the Australian National University in 1977. They married Jill Collier, with whom they had two children, Sarah and Jacob. They have divorced.
Indyk immigrated to the United States by 1982 and started work with a lobbying group in Washington, DC. They became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1993 a week before joining the United States National Security Council. Indyk is a Reform Jew.
Political and diplomatic career
In 1982, Indyk began working as a deputy research director for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a pro-Israel lobbying group in Washington. From 1985 Indyk served eight years as the founding Executive Director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a research institute specializing in analysis of Middle East policy.
They have been an adjunct professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, where they taught Israeli politics and foreign policy. Indyk has also taught at the Middle East Institute at Columbia University, the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies at Tel Aviv University, and the Department of Politics at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. Indyk has published widely on U.S. policy toward the Arab–Israeli peace process, on U.S.–Israeli relations, and on the threats to Middle East stability posed by Iraq and Iran.
They served as special assistant to President Bill Clinton and as senior director of the Near East and South Asian Affairs at the United States National Security Council. While at the NSC, they served as principal adviser to the President and the National Security Advisor on Arab–Israeli issues, Iraq, Iran, and South Asia. They were a senior member of Secretary of State Warren Christopher's Middle East peace team and served as the White House representative on the U.S. Israel Science and Technology Commission.
They served two stints as United States Ambassador to Israel, from April 1995 to September 1997, and from January 2000 to July 2001. They were the first and so far, the only, foreign-born US ambassador to Israel.
They have served on the board of the New Israel Fund. Indyk currently serves on the Advisory Board for DC based non-profit America Abroad Media.
On July 29, 2013, Indyk was appointed by President Barack Obama as Washington's special Middle East envoy for the resumption of peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas favored their appointment. They resigned from this position June 27, 2014, returning to the Brookings Institution as its vice president and director for foreign policy. In 2018, they left Brookings for the Council on Foreign Relations.
Controversy
In 2000, Indyk was placed under investigation by the FBI after allegations arose that they improperly handled sensitive material by using an unclassified laptop computer on an airplane flight to prepare their memos of meetings with foreign leaders. There was no indication that any classified material had been compromised, and no indication of espionage.
Indyk was "apparently ... the first serving U.S. ambassador to be stripped of government security clearance." The Los Angeles Times reported that "veteran diplomats complained that Indyk was being made a scapegoat for the kinds of security lapses that are rather common among envoys who take classified work home from the office." Indyk's clearance was suspended but was reinstated the next month, "for the duration of the current crisis," given "the continuing turmoil in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza [Strip] and for compelling national security reasons."
Criticism
Receiving donations from Qatar
In 2014, Indyk came under scrutiny when a New York Times investigation revealed that wealthy Gulf state of Qatar made a $14.8 million, four-year donation to Brookings Institution, in order to fund two Brookings initiatives, the Brookings Center in Doha and the Project on U.S. Relations with the Islamic World. The Times investigation found that Brookings was one of more than a dozen influential Washington think tanks and research organizations that "have received tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments in recent years while pushing United States government officials to adopt policies that often reflect the donors' priorities." A number of scholars interviewed by the Times expressed alarm at the trend, saying that the "donations have led to implicit agreements that the research groups would refrain from criticizing the donor governments."
The revelation of the think tank's choice to accept the payment from Qatar was especially controversial because at the time, Indyk was acting as a peace negotiator between Israel and the Palestinians, and because Qatar funds jihadist groups in the Middle East and is the main financial backer of Hamas, "the mortal enemy of both the State of Israel and Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah party." Hamas political chief Khaled Meshaal, who directs Hamas's operations against Israel, is also harbored by Qatar. Indyk defended the arrangement with Qatar, contending that it did not influence the think tank's work and that "to be policy-relevant, we need to engage policymakers." However, the arrangement between Qatar and Brookings caused Israeli government officials to doubt Indyk's impartiality.
Of views on Israel
Indyk's career has "featured two abiding, and at times competing, characteristics: their support for Israel, and their disdain for Israel's West Bank settlement activity." Indyk's views "have irked both Israel and the Palestinians at various times."
Isi Leibler criticized Indyk in a 2010 Jerusalem Post op-ed, calling them a "anti-Israel apologist." In 2014, Ha'aretz reported that "Indyk is being identified in Jerusalem as the anonymous source" in an article by Nahum Barnea of the Yedioth Ahronoth, 'in which unnamed American officials blamed Israel for the failure of the peace talks." The anonymous source in Yediot Acharonot was quoted as saying: "The Jewish people are supposed to be smart; it is true that they're also considered a stubborn nation. You're supposed to know how to read the map: In the 21st century, the world will not keep tolerating the Israeli occupation. The occupation threatens Israel's status in the world and threatens Israel as a Jewish state...The Palestinians are tired of the status quo. They will get their state in the end – whether through violence or by turning to international organizations." The remarks angered Israeli officials.
Media appearances
While promoting their book, Innocent Abroad: An Intimate Account of American Peace Diplomacy, on 8 January 2009, Indyk engaged in a discussion of Israeli–Palestinian peace negotiations with Norman Finkelstein of Democracy Now!. Indyk indicated they felt "sandbagged" by not being informed "that I was going to be in some kind of debate with Norman Finkelstein. I'm not interested in doing that. I'm also not here as a spokesperson for Israel".

"Everyday People" is a 1968 song composed by Sly Stone and first recorded by their band, Sly and the Family Stone. It was the first single by the band to go to number one on the Soul singles chart and the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. It held that position on the Hot 100 for four weeks, from February 9 to March 8, 1969, and is remembered as one of the most popular songs of the 1960s. Billboard ranked it as the No. 5 song of 1969.
Overview
The song is one of Sly Stone's pleas for peace and equality between differing races and social groups, a major theme and focus for the band. The Family Stone featured Caucasians Greg Errico and Jerry Martini in its lineup, as well as females Rose Stone and Cynthia Robinson; making it an early major integrated band in rock history. Sly and the Family Stone's message was about peace and equality through music, and this song reflects the same.
Unlike the band's more typically funky and psychedelic records, "Everyday People" is a mid-tempo number with a more mainstream pop feel. Sly, singing the main verses for the song, explains that they are "no better / and neither are you / we are the same / whatever we do."
Sly's sister Rose Stone sings bridging sections (using the cadence of the "na-na na-na boo-boo" children's taunt) that mock the futility of people hating each other for being tall, short, rich, poor, fat, skinny, white, black, or anything else. The bridges of the song contain the line "different strokes for different folks", which became a popular catchphrase in 1969 (and inspired the name of the later television series, Diff'rent Strokes). Rose's singing ends each part of the bridge with the words: "And so on, and so on, and scooby dooby doo".
During the chorus, all of the singing members of the band (Sly, Rosie, Larry Graham, and Sly's brother Freddie Stone) proclaim that "I am everyday people," meaning that each of them (and each listener as well) should consider themselves or themselves as parts of one whole, not of smaller, specialized factions.
Bassist Larry Graham contends that the track featured the first instance of the "slap bass technique", which would become a staple of funk and other genres. The technique involves striking a string with the thumb of the right hand (or left hand, for a left-handed player) so that the string collides with the frets, producing a metallic "clunk" at the beginning of the note. Later slap bass songs – for example, Graham's performance on "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Again)" – expanded on the technique, incorporating a complementary "pull" or "pop" component.
"Everyday People" was included on the band's classic album Stand! (1969), which sold over three million copies. It is one of the most covered songs in the band's repertoire, with versions by the Winstons, Aretha Franklin, the Staple Singers, William Bell, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, the Supremes and the Four Tops, Peggy Lee, Belle & Sebastian, Pearl Jam, and Nicole C. Mullen, Ta Mara and the Seen and many others. Hip-hop group Arrested Development used the song as the basis of their 1992 hit, "People Everyday", which reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart and No. 8 on the Hot 100. Dolly Parton's previously unreleased 1980 cover of the song was included as a bonus track on the 2009 reissue of their 9 to 5 and Odd Jobs album. Rolling Stone ranked "Everyday People" as No. 145 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. "Everyday People" was prominently featured in a series of Toyota commercials in the late 1990s as part of their "Everyday" slogan campaign. In 2021, the song appeared in another TV commercial, this time for Aspen Dental.
The third verse of Sly and the Family Stone's 1969 "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)", a No. 1 hit by February 1970, references the titles of "Everyday People" and several of the band's other successful songs.
Notable versions
Soul singer Billy Paul covered the song on their 1970 album Ebony Woman.
Joan Jett's version appears on their 1983 release Album.
"Everyday People" by Ta Mara and the Seen was a minor hit in the Philippines in 1988.
Aretha Franklin performed a version of the song for their 1991 album What You See Is What You Sweat.
A unique instrumental rendition of "Everyday People" is featured on the 1998 album Combustication by jazz fusion trio Medeski Martin & Wood.
Hip hop group Arrested Development released an adapted version of "Everyday People" on their 1992 album 3 Years, 5 Months & 2 Days in the Life Of... titled as "People Everyday".
The 2005 Sly and the Family Stone tribute album Different Strokes by Different Folks features a cover by Maroon 5, accompanied by samples from the original recording.
A version by Jeff Buckley is included in the posthumously released album You and me.
Jon Batiste and Stay Human performed the song along other guest musicians on the first episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.
The Staple Singers released a version on their 1970 album We'll Get Over.

Jeroen René Victor Anton Dijsselbloem (; born 29 March 1966) is a Dutch politician and economist serving as Mayor of Eindhoven since 13 September 2022, succeeding John Jorritsma (VVD). A member of the Labour Party (PvdA), they have also been Chairman of the supervisory board of Wageningen University since 1 April 2019.
Dijsselbloem was Minister of Finance in the Second Rutte cabinet, serving from 5 November 2012 to 26 October 2017. They also served as President of the Eurogroup from 21 January 2013 to 12 January 2018 and President of the Board of Governors of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) from 11 February 2013 until 12 January 2018. They were successively Chairman of the Dutch Safety Board from 1 May 2019 to September 2022.
Early life and education
Jeroen René Victor Anton Dijsselbloem was born on 29 March 1966 in Eindhoven, Netherlands. Their parents were both schoolteachers. They were raised as a Roman Catholic.
Dijsselbloem went to a Roman Catholic primary school in Son en Breugel and the Catholic secondary school Eckartcollege (1978–85) in Eindhoven. They studied at the Wageningen University between 1985 and 1991, where they obtained an engineer's degree ("ingenieur") in agricultural economics in 1991, majoring in business economics, agricultural policy, and social and economic history.
Dijsselbloem subsequently did research in business economics at the University College Cork (1991) in Ireland, but they did not graduate from this university.
Political career
Dijsselbloem's interest in politics began in 1983, spurred by the mass protests against U.S. Pershing cruise missiles that drew hundreds of thousands of Dutch youth into leftwing movements. In 1985, they became a member of the Labour Party (PvdA).
From 1993 to 1996 they worked for the parliamentary group of the Labour Party. From 1994-96 they were a member of the municipal council of Wageningen. From 1996 to 2000 they worked at the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Fishery under Minister Jozias van Aartsen and State secretary Geke Faber.
From 2000 to 2012, Dijsselbloem was elected to the House of Representatives for the Labour Party, with a brief interruption after the 2002 general elections where the Labour Party suffered a major defeat. They reentered the lower house in November that year due to Peter Rehwinkel's resignation. In 2007, they led a parliamentary inquiry on education reform. They focused on matters of youth care, special education and teachers. Following the resignation of Job Cohen as party leader and parliamentary leader of the Labour Party in the House of Representatives on 20 February 2012, they became the interim parliamentary leader, serving until 20 March 2012 when Diederik Samsom was elected as the next party leader of the Labour Party.
Minister of Finance (2012–2017)
On 15 November 2012, Dijsselbloem was appointed by Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands to serve as Minister of Finance in the Second Rutte cabinet. From the start, Dijsselbloem emphasised their commitment to fiscal discipline.
On 1 February 2013, they nationalized the financial institution SNS Reaal, preventing its bankruptcy. Shareholders and owners of subordinated debt are expropriated with no compensation and others banks of the country have to contribute to the takeover up to one billion euros. By December 2013, Dutch press named Dijsselbloem politician of the year, describing them as "intelligent, balanced and good at finding compromises". In a response, they said that they were surprised about winning the prize because they "does not work on the forefront".
In the Netherlands, they were later named as a possible European Commissioner following the 2014 European elections; the post instead went to Foreign Minister Frans Timmermans.
They were succeeded as Minister of Finance by Wopke Hoekstra (Christian Democratic Appeal) on 26 October 2017. They resigned from the House of Representatives the day before, while having been reelected during the 2017 Dutch general election in March; William Moorlag entered the States General to fill the vacancy.
President of the Eurogroup (2013–2018)
On 21 January 2013, Dijsselbloem took office as President of the Eurogroup, a grouping of the Ministers of Finance of the Eurozone, those member states of the European Union (EU) which have adopted the euro as their official currency; they succeeded Jean-Claude Juncker. Spain was the only country not to back their candidacy.
Dijsselbloem struggled early in their two and a half-year term and faced criticism for their handling of the "Cyprus bail-in." In March 2013, they took the lead in the negotiation, conclusion and subsequent public promotion of the bailout. They attracted criticism for the precedent of taking depositors' balances as part of bank rescues but said "I am pretty confident that the markets will see this as a sensible, very concentrated and direct approach instead of a more general approach... It will force all financial institutions, as well as investors, to think about the risks they are taking on because they will now have to realise that it may also hurt them."
On 24 March 2013, the Financial Times and Reuters reported that Dijsselbloem saw the Cyprus bail-in as a template for resolution of a bankruptcy. However, it was the interviewer that had used the word "template" and not Dijsselbloem himself. On 26 March 2013, Dijsselbloem said explicitly that they did not consider the Cyprus case to be a template.
As Eurogroup head, Dijsselbloem later represented European creditors in negotiations with Greece over its bailout packages following Syriza's victory in the January 2015 legislative election. Initially the Greek government formed by Syriza and the Independent Greeks pursued bilateral talks with creditors and later the Eurogroup agreed on an extension of the bailout for four months. The negotiations for a new bailout package failed to meet the deadline for a €1.1 billion repayment to the IMF on midnight 1 July 2015 (Athens time). After the 5 July Greek referendum in which the then outstanding bailout offer from the Eurogroup was rejected by 61% of voters, a crisis summit was held on 12 July to negotiate Greece's new bailout request. Ahead of the summit, Dijsselbloem questioned whether the Greek proposals were credible.
A deal for a new bailout package between the parties was finally agreed on Monday 13 July. During the debate on the third bailout agreement in the House of Representatives of the Netherlands on 15 July, Dijsselbloem criticised the Syriza government as ideologues, saying that their "every sentence had ideological baggage". They also received criticism for subterfuge in return from Greece's chief negotiator, the Finance Minister Yannis Varoufakis, who published this account in their book Adults in the Room: "From my first Eurogroup, Jeroen Dijsselbloem began an intensive campaign to bypass me altogether. They would phone Alexis Tsipras, my prime minister, directly – even visiting them in their hotel room in Brussels. By hinting at a softer stance if Tsipras agreed to spare them from having to deal with me, Dijsselbloem succeeded in weakening my position in the Eurogroup – to the detriment, primarily, of Tsipras".
In August 2014, German Chancellor Angela Merkel gave their backing to Spain's Economy Minister, Luis de Guindos, in their bid to succeed Dijsselbloem as head of the Eurogroup from 2015; De Guindos is a member of the same center-right political European People's Party political bloc. Meanwhile, on 5 June 2015, Dijsselbloem announced they would seek a second term, prompting de Guindos saying they would mount a challenge. In a subsequent letter requesting that they be reappointed to serve another two-and-a-half years as Eurogroup chair, Dijsselbloem pledged that they would push for eurozone-wide social and fiscal reforms designed to promote the smooth functioning of the currency union. Once they picked up 10 votes at a Eurogroup meeting in July 2015, the remaining countries decided to vote unanimously for a second term.
In June 2015, Dijsselbloem, alongside Mario Draghi of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Juncker at the European Commission and Donald Tusk at the European Council, issued the so-called "Five Presidents' Report" on the future of the European Monetary Union, including proposals that mostly echoed calls by Germany and other northern eurozone countries to enforce spending rules across the eurozone. On 4 December 2017, Mário Centeno was elected as their successor as President of the Eurogroup.
Following the resignation of Christine Lagarde as managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2019, Dijsselbloem and Kristalina Georgieva were the final candidates considered by European governments as potential successors; Dijsselbloem was supported by a group of countries led by the Netherlands and Germany. Georgieva eventually got the backing of 56% of EU states which however represented only 57% of the bloc's population, falling short of one requirement. However, Dijsselbloem conceded defeat.
Interview controversy
In March 2017, they told the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung "As a Social Democrat, I attribute exceptional importance to solidarity. But those who call for it also have duties. I cannot spend all my money on drinks and women and then hold my hand up for help. That principle applies on a personal, local, national and also on a European level" while referring to Southern European countries affected by the European debt crisis. This statement led to strong reactions by many European figures, as Gianni Pittella, head of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament (to which Dijsselbloem's party belongs) said "there is no excuse or reason for using such language, especially from someone who is supposed to be a progressive".
Manfred Weber, leader of the European People's Party Group, tweeted "Eurozone is about responsibility, solidarity but also respect. No room for stereotypes". The Portuguese Prime Minister, António Costa, said their words were "racist, xenophobic and sexist" and that "Europe will only be credible as a common project on the day when Mr. Dijsselbloem stops being Head of the Eurogroup and apologises clearly to all the countries and peoples that were profoundly offended by their remarks". Former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi also called on Dijsselbloem to quit, saying that "if they want to offend Italy, they should do it in a sports bar back home, not in their institutional role".
In response, Dijsselbloem said: "Everyone knows that I did not say that all southern Europeans spend their money on drinks and women. That is not what was in the interview and it was not my message. The anger about the interview is anger about eight years of policies to deal with the crisis. [...] I would have rephrased it otherwise probably. But it was my way of making clear that solidarity is not charity. It is not for nothing that the aid programs of the European emergency fund are accompanied by strict conditions: You get very cheap loans provided you take action to restore order. That is an important principle. For the ones who keep zooming in on those two words my message might be inconvenient. [...] It will not end well with the Eurozone if we keep breaking our previous agreements. [...] My choice of words was not right, I am sorry if you took offense, but I am still behind the message."

A wall hanging craft is a decoration, an amulet, a religious or a symbolic object that is hung from the ceiling or another structure. The sculptor Alexander Calder invented the mobiles, popular in the nursery, to give infants something to entertain them and give them external visual stimulation. Kakemono, a Japanese hanging, is intended to be hung against a wall as part of the interior decoration of a room.
Hanging crafts can project abstract shapes fashioned from sheet metal, wood, paper or plastic materials, connected by wire or chord, whose individual elements are capable of moving independently or as a whole when prompted by air movement or direct contact. Heavy hangings are hung with a lag bolt with deep grooves in the threads for maximum grip, or with a toggle bolt that uses a large collapsible nut to increase clamping pressure of the bolt.
A hanging craft trend that used to be in fashion in the 60s and 70s to provide a bohemian style to interiors is back on trend

The Fulton County school district is the only non-contiguous school district in the state, having a 17-mile (27 km) separation (Atlanta Public Schools) between the north and south.
As of the 2012–2013 school year, Fulton has 11,500 full-time employees, including 7,500 teachers and other certified personnel, who work in 99 schools and 15 administrative and support buildings. Approximately 94,000 students attend classes in 58 elementary schools, 19 middle schools, 19 high schools, and seven charter schools.
Fulton County Schools is overseen by a seven-member board, all of whom are elected by geographic electoral district to four-year terms. Members of the Fulton County Board of Education are elected to four-year terms. Elections are held in even-numbered years. As of 2019, the school members include: District 1 - Katha Stuart, District 2 - Katie Reeves, District 3 - Gail Dean, District 4 - Linda Bryant, District 5 - Linda McCain, District 6 - Kimberly Dove, District 7 - Julia Bernath.
Territory
The district's territory spans about .
Operations
The district headquarters is in Sandy Springs. The district has another Sandy Springs office and one in Union City.
Previously the school district was headquartered in Atlanta. The district moved its headquarters in the period September 2014 through June 2015, citing how the majority of students live in the northern portions of the counties. The district maintains the Union City office for people living in the southern portion. Wayne Washington of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote in 2013 that "There have long been complaints from some parents that the southern part of the [...] district has been neglected in favor of the faster-growing, more affluent northern part."

Carl Friedrich Weitzmann (10 August 1808 – 7 November 1880) was a German music theorist and musician.
Life and work
Weitzmann was born in Berlin and first studied violin in the 1820s with Carl Henning and Bernhard Klein. From 1827 to 1832 they studied composition in Kassel with Louis Spohr and Moritz Hauptmann. In 1832 they founded a Liedertafel (a peculiarly German type of male singing society) in Riga (now in Latvia) with Heinrich Dorn. In Revel (now Tallinn, Estonia), they became music director of the opera where they composed three operas. From 1836 they began a ten-year association with the Saint Petersburg court orchestra. At this time they began to collect music books and folksongs. Weitzmann toured in Lappland and Finland (then part of the Russian empire) and performed with orchestras in Paris and London, returning to Berlin in 1848 to research music history and theory. In 1857 they took a teaching position with the Stern Conservatory (now part of the Berlin University of the Arts).
Weitzmann published their first major theoretical work Der übermässige Dreiklang (the augmented triad) in 1853. In this treatise, they suggested that the minor triad was merely an inversion of the major triad and that both are generated by a common fundamental tone in the middle. Weitzmann's demonstration of the efficacy of each of the four possible perfectly-even augmented triads in resolving to six major and minor triads each using single- or double-semitone displacement has been a significant influence on modern neo-Riemannian theorists. In Weitzmann's own lifetime, composer Franz Liszt showed considerable interest in new theories regarding dissonant sonorities, referencing Weitzmann's "Der übermässige Dreiklang" in an analysis of their own Faust Symphony (a composition famously saturated with augmented triads). This has led to a strong conceptual association between Weitzmann's work and the Zukunftsmusik ("Music of the Future") for which they attempted to account.
Weitzmann later extended their theories to scales, noting how a descending minor scale starting from the fifth degree is an inversion of an ascending major scale. Because their theories relate major and minor, it is called a "dualist" explanation. Later dualist theorists include Arthur von Oettingen and the early work of Hugo Riemann.
Weitzmann differed from most theorists in their ideas of tuning and temperament. Most theorists viewed equal temperament as a compromise or a necessary evil. Weitzmann viewed it positively. They looked for acoustical properties of 12-note equal temperament, presumed enharmonic equivalence, and de-emphasized traditional rules of voice leading and treatment of dissonance leading to a theory where any chord can follow another chord.
Their most lasting contribution to music theory (researched by contemporary American theorist Richard Cohn) concerns chord relations. Traditionally, a C-major triad was thought to be related most closely to a G-major triad through the circle of fifths and traditional tonic-dominant (V-I) resolution. Weitzmann suggested a-minor and e-minor triads were more closely related to C-major because they shared two common notes. This theory elegantly accounted for third relation and common tone progressions in earlier music of Schubert and Beethoven, and it paved the way for later chromatic composers who explored the compositional possibilities of tonal regions related by symmetrical augmented triads and diminished seventh chords.

John Todd (October 9, 1800 – August 24, 1873) was an American minister and author of over thirty books, including the popular work of moralistic advice, The Student's Manual (1835).
Todd, the youngest child of Dr. Timothy and Phebe (Buel) Todd, was born in Rutland, Vt., October 9, 1800. In their childhood, their father died, and it was only by their own exertions that they were able to secure a liberal education. They graduated from Yale College in 1822. From college they went to Andover Seminary, where they completed the three years' course, and afterwards remained for nearly a year engaged in advanced study. On the 3d of Jan., 1827, they were ordained first pastor of the Union Church in Groton, Mass., and in the following March was married to Mary S., daughter of Rev. Joab Brace, of Newington, Conn. They resigned their charge at Groton, Jan. 8, 1833, and on the 30th of the same month was installed over the Edwards Church, Northampton, Mass. Here they remained until Nov. 4, 1836, when they removed to Philadelphia, where they were installed pastor of the First Congregational Church, on the 17th of the same month. This position they resigned in Nov, 1841, and soon after removed to Pittsfield, Mass., where they took charge of the First Congregational Church, Jan. 1, 1842, and was installed, Feb. 22. In 1870 they proposed to the church to lay down the active duties of pastor, but at their request their resignation was deferred, until in March, 1872, impaired health enforced their retirement. They died in Pittsfield, after an illness of three months Aug. 24, 1873, in their 73d year. Their widow survived him, with five of their nine children, one of whom graduated from Yale in 1855. In 1845 Mr. Todd received the degree of D.D. from Williams College, and was elected one of the trustees of that institution, which office they held until 1872. Dr. Todd was remarkably successful as a pastor, and also wielded a powerful influence as an author. They published over thirty volumes, besides many sermons and pamphlets. Their most widely known book, "The Student's Manual," was first published in 1835.
The Reverend Doctor Was also notable for having taken part of the Golden Spike Ceremony at Promontory Point, Utah on May 10, 1869. During the event, Dr. Todd gave a prayer that was broadcast throughout the nation.

"Safe" is a song recorded by American singer Sage. The song features their sister, Kesha, and independent rapper Chika. It was released on October 12, 2018.
Background
"Safe" was written during Sage's senior year of high school after the mass shooting in a high school in Parkland, Florida. They played the first version of the song for their sister, Kesha, who instantly felt the power of the track and wanted to help the cause by lending their voice to the song and movement. Chika is an independent female rapper and contributed the verses to finish the song. The song was released in partnership with the March for Our Lives organization.
Kesha tweeted about the song the day before it was released: "I wrote the song 'Safe' with my younger brother @SageSebert after the tragic mass shooting in Parkland, Florida. This song is coming tomorrow in partnership with @AMarch4OurLives. Let's end senseless gun violence".
Music video
The music video features a school shooting, in a continuing cycle. The song repeats 3 as the whole cycle of the shooting starts again. Each time the song and video replays, there are a slight difference. The signs in the beginning all advocate for gun restriction laws and urging people to vote. The second time it goes through shows names of victims of the Parkland Shooting. The third time it plays displays the lyrics at the bottom of the screen.

Nenad Kecmanović, PhD, (Serbian Cyrillic: Ненад Кецмановић; born 9 September 1947) is a Bosnian Serb political scientist, sociologist, political analyst, publicist, professor of political science, retired politician, member of the Senate of Republika Srpska, since 1996 and former member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, from 17 June 1992 until 6 July 1992. Kecmanović was the rector of the University of Sarajevo from 1988 until 1992 and the Bosnian War, since when they reside in Belgrade, Serbia.
Academic career
Kecmanović was born in Sarajevo, PR Bosnia and Herzegovina, FPR Yugoslavia on 9 September 1947. They graduated in sociology in 1971 as a student of the generation, and in political science in 1973, from the University of Sarajevo, after which they worked as an assistant at the Faculty of Political Science. They received their doctorate in "Convergence of Political Systems" in 1975. In 1976, Kecmanović became an assistant professor at the same Faculty, an associate professor in 1979, becoming full professor in 1984. Until the Bosnian War, they were a professor of political science and dean of the Faculty of Political Science in Sarajevo. They were the rector of the University of Sarajevo from 1988 until the start of the Bosnian War in 1992 and the breakup of Yugoslavia. In 1991, they received an honorary doctorate from the University of Michigan.
In Belgrade, Serbia, they worked as a professor and head of the Department of Political Science at the Faculty of Political Sciences, University of Belgrade.
 They are currently active as a full professor at the University of East Sarajevo. Kecmanović was also the former dean of the University of Banja Luka, where they currently work as an associate professor. They have been a member of the Senate of Republika Srpska since September 1996. They were elected an expert of the United Nations Center for Peace and Development in Paris in 1998, and in 2006 they became a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow.
Political career
In mid-1990 and the introduction of the multi-party system in Yugoslavia, Kecmanović founded a Bosnian branch of Ante Marković's centre-left Union of Reform Forces of Yugoslavia party. Kecmanović was president of the party's Bosnian branch and its leader at the 1990 general election. In 1990, at the last Yugoslav Presidency elections, they were elected a member of the Presidency of Yugoslavia, but was immediately removed from that position through the State Security Service, under the pretext of "insufficient security culture". When Biljana Plavšić and Nikola Koljević (both from the Serb Democratic Party) resigned their post as Serb members of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina in June 1992, Kecmanović was elected new member of the Presidency, as the Serb delegate with most votes at the 1990 election, after Plavšić and Koljević, serving with Mirko Pejanović of the Social Democratic Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 6 July 1992, Kecmanović resigned their post as Serb member of the Presidency, and was succeeded by Social Democratic Party member Tatjana Ljujić-Mijatović.

Fernando Antonio Pisani (born December 27, 1976) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey right winger. They played professionally in the National Hockey League for their hometown Edmonton Oilers for seven NHL seasons, and one for the Chicago Blackhawks.
Playing career
After posting 103 points in 58 games with the St. Albert Saints of the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL), Pisani was drafted in the eighth round, 195th overall, by their hometown team, the Edmonton Oilers in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft. Upon being drafted, Pisani played four years of collegiate hockey for Providence College.
In 2000–01, the Oilers assigned them to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Hamilton Bulldogs. Pisani spent two seasons in Hamilton, before being called up in their third AHL season in 2002–03. They scored their first NHL goal on February 5, 2003, in a 2-1 win against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. They finished the season with the Oilers, playing in 35 games with 13 points. Pisani is generally considered a "late bloomer", because they did not see their first NHL action until the age of 27.
Due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Pisani went overseas to Europe and played in the Swiss Nationalliga A and Italian Serie A with HC Asiago.
2006 Stanley Cup Playoffs
As NHL play resumed in 2005–06, Pisani scored a career-high 18 goals, 19 assists and 37 points. Although the Oilers entered the playoffs as the eighth and final seed in the Western Conference, they embarked on a cinderella run to the 2006 Stanley Cup Finals against the Carolina Hurricanes. Pisani became a playoff hero in the process, significantly elevating their game. Against the first-seeded Detroit Red Wings, Pisani scored two third period goals (his fourth and fifth of the series) in game six, series-clinching 4-2 victory. Advancing to the second round against the San Jose Sharks, Pisani recorded another two-goal effort, including the game winner, in a 6-3 game five win. Reaching the finals against Carolina, the Oilers faced elimination in the fifth game. Going into overtime on the penalty kill, Pisani intercepted a pass and scored their second goal of the game on a breakaway to stave off elimination. It was the first time in Stanley Cup Finals history that an overtime game was decided by a shorthanded goal. Pisani then scored the Oilers' only goal in a game seven loss. They just missed tying the game with three minutes left in regulation time when their shot, on the rebound from the initial shot by Raffi Torres, were both saved by Carolina goalie Cam Ward.
Pisani finished the playoffs with a league-leading 14 goals including 5 game-winners, nearly matching their regular season output of 18 goals in 80 games. They were re-signed by the Oilers in the off-season to a four-year, $10 million contract on July 1, 2006.
Ulcerative Colitis
Pisani followed their 2006 playoff performance with a 28-point season in 2006–07, but the Oilers failed to qualify for the post-season. Prior to the start of the 2007–08 season, they were diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, sidelining them for the first 26 games of the campaign. They returned to the Oilers lineup on December 2, 2007, and was nominated that year for the Bill Masterton Trophy, an award given for perseverance and dedication to hockey.

An election for the leadership of Kadima was held on 17 September 2008 as a concession to Kadima's coalition partner, Labour, which had threatened to bring down the government if Prime Minister Ehud Olmert didn't stand aside following police investigations into alleged corruption during their terms as minister and as mayor of Jerusalem.
As Kadima remained the largest party in the Knesset and the coalition, Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, the designated new leader after balloting, had the chance to form a government without a need for elections.
The election was the party's first official leadership election. Previously, in 2006, there had been a leadership vote, but it was for interim leader.
Candidates
Tzipi Livni, foreign minister of israel
Avi Dichter, Internal Security Minister
Shaul Mofaz, Transport Minister
Meir Sheetrit, Minister of the Interior
Campaign
The two front-runners throughout the campaign consistently remained Mofaz and Livni, with Livni always holding a consistent lead in the polls.
While both frontrunners supported a two-state solution, Mofaz attacked Livni for wanting to divide Jerusalem in a final peace deal with the Palestinians, and claimed that their military experience would make them a more qualified Prime Minister. Livni and their supporters claimed that a vote for Mofaz is the same as a vote for the Likud due to Mofaz's hawkish and more right-wing positions. Livni also enjoyed a "clean" reputation, being seen as having honesty and integrity, and being free from corruption allegations. Outgoing Prime Minister Ehud Olmert remained neutral in the primary, but was alleged to privately favor Mofaz.
Results
Exit polls released after the poll indicated a double-digit victory for Livni. The actual vote count turned out much closer, amid very low turnout, with Shaul Mofaz coming within a few hundred votes of winning an unexpected victory over Livni. Supporters of Mofaz called for a recount but Mofaz rejected any legal challenge of the declared result and called Livni to congratulate them on their victory, as did Sheetrit and Dichter.
Aftermath
After Mofaz's loss, they announced that they would be taking a break from politics and leaving the government and Knesset. However, they would remain a member of Kadima. Soon after, however, they announced their return and won the 2nd place in Kadima's Knesset list for the 2009 elections. In a rematch in 2012, they won the leadership, and in the 2013 election led the party to a stunning collapse, winning 2 seats.
After their election, Livni failed to form a governing coalition, having failed to reach an agreement with Shas. Subsequently Knesset elections were held on 10 February 2009.

Yale-East was a provincial electoral district in the British Columbia legislature that appeared only in the 1894, 1898 and 1900 elections. It and its sister ridings Yale-West and Yale-North were created from the older three-member Yale (provincial electoral district), which was one of the province's first twelve ridings as of 1871. For the 1903 election the riding-name Yale was restored on an adapted version of Yale-West. The area of Yale-East is now part of various ridings in the Nicola, Similkameen and Okanagan areas.

Cornelis Johannes (Cor) van Dijkum (born 1950) is a Dutch sociologist, consultant and academic at the Utrecht University, known for their contributions in the field of methodology for complex societal problems.
Biography
Van Dijkum obtained their MSc in Physics from the University of Amsterdam in the 1970s, and in 1988 their PhD in Social Sciences from the Utrecht University with the thesis entitled "Paradoxen : een methodologische studie naar vicieuze cirkels in denken en handelen" (Paradoxes: a methodological study to vicious circles of thought and action).
After their graduation Van Dijkum had started their academic career at the Utrecht University, where they became Professor at the Department of Methodology and Statistics. They have been director of the NOSMO (Dutch Organization for Methodological Research in the Social Sciences) for about a decade. In 2000 they also founded Sokrates Consultancy and Engineering. Van Dijkum was also Editor-in-Chief of the International Scientific Journal of Methods and Models of Complexity journal.
Van Dijkum's research interests are in the field of "nonlinear modeling, computer simulation, methodology, epistemology of science, and action research health care."
Work
NOSMO
The Dutch Organization for Methodological Research in the Social Sciences (NOSMO) started in the early 1980s as Stichting Nederlandse Organisatie voor Sociaal-Wetenschappelijk Methodologisch Onderzoek (NOSMO). Their initial focus was on qualitative research. Over the years working groups were created around the following subjects:
Data collection, Instrumentation & Research design
Qualitative Research (formerly SIM)
Longitudinal Models
Nosmo Methodology of Societal Complexity
Simulation & Game
Social Network Analysis, and
Sociocybernetics
Notable academics who cooperated in NOSMO beside Van Dijkum were Gerhard van de Bunt, Dorien DeTombe, Stasja Draisma, Frans van Eijnatten, Henk Flap, Joop Hox, Edith de Leeuw, Cora Maas, Gerty Lensvelt-Mulders, Han Oud, Tom Snijders and Fred Wester.
One of the offspring of NOSMO is the KWALON platform for qualitative research, and the journals Journal for the improvement of methodology in applied research and International Scientific Journal of Methods and Models of Complexity.
Complexity science
In their 2013 speech on the EURO Mini-Conference Graz 2013, entitled "Complexity is more than complicated," Van Dijkum stipulated that:
... social scientists realized in the last decennia, inspired by colleagues in the natural sciences, that many phenomena in the social world can be viewed as complex social systems.
And furthermore:
Through systems theory one recognizes that events are interrelated, interact with each other and make up systems. With dynamic systems theory one understand that social systems evolve in time, moved by cause-effect relations between events that can be described mathematically in differential equations."
Van Dijkum believed that "with the idea of ‘complex social systems' one comprehend that those differential equations are non linear, reflecting systems that are difficult to follow and predict, just as many phenomena in the world. It is the start of a promising program of research in the social sciences including system dynamics."

The Kalmyk Project was the name given to Soviet plans to launch a surprise attack on the North-West Frontier Province of British India via Tibet and other Himalayan buffer states in 1919–1920. It was a part of Soviet plans to destabilise the British Empire and other Western European imperial powers by unrest in South Asia. British Indian intelligence sent agents, such as F. M. Bailey, to Central Asia to trace the early Bolshevik designs on India.
Soviet Russia intended to nurture political upheaval in British India in its strategy against British imperialism. In 1919, it sent a diplomatic mission headed by the orientalist N. Z. Bravin. That was while Afghanistan had seen a coup d'état, which placed the young Prince Amanullah Khan in power and precipitated the Third Anglo-Afghan War. Bravin proposed to Amanullah a military alliance against British India and a campaign for which Soviet Turkestan would bear the costs. The negotiations, however, failed to reach concrete conclusions, and the Soviet advances were also detected by British Indian intelligence. Among other works, the Bravin expedition established links at Herat with the Austrian and German remnants of the Niedermayer–Hentig Expedition and liaised with the Indian revolutionaries of the Provisional Government of India in Kabul.
A later plan considered by the Soviets had the raising a force of nearly 40,000 cavalry troops from Turkestan or the Urals and advance to India through Afghanistan, with help from Afghan tribes that rallied against Amanullah. Leon Trotsky, then head of the RMC of the RSFSR, was a proponent of this version of the plan. However, the plans presented their own problems. Other routes to India that were explored included plans to foment unrest in Tibet and the Himalayan buffer states of Bhutan, Sikkim, Nepal, Thailand and Burma through the Buddhist Kalmyks and to use the places as a staging ground for revolution in India and the shortest route to Bengal, which was the centre of the revolutionary movement in India. That was to proceed under the cover of a scientific expedition under the Indologist Fyodor Shcherbatskoy, and it would arm the indigenous people in the North-East Frontier with modern weaponry before a regular supply could be arranged. The Kalmyk project may have been the brainchild of Raja Mahendra Pratap, who had led the Niedermayer-Hentig Expedition into Afghanistan in 1915 and later established the nationalist Provisional Government of India at Kabul in December that year. Pratap liaised with the Nascent Bolshevik Government and the Kaiser after 1917 to explore the scopes of a joint Soviet-German invasion of India through Afghanistan. The most notable meeting was Pratap's audience with Lenin, which was arranged by the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs in 1919, when they met them with a group of Indian revolutionaries from the Berlin Committee. The project had the approval of Lenin. Pratap had a strong obsession with Tibet and had made efforts as early as 1916 to penetrate into the Himalayan Kingdom to cultivate anti-British propaganda. Their efforts were resumed after their return from Moscow in 1919. They were close to Fyodor Shcherbatskoy and Sergey Oldenburg, intended to participate in the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs planned expeditions to Tibet in summer 1919, and was privy to its designs for the region.
However, the project was ultimately curtailed after the Czechoslovak uprising in the Trans-Siberian Railway. Pratap themselves set out alone unsuccessfully to pursue their goal in Tibet.

The Sunyaev–Zeldovich Array (SZA) in California is an array of eight 3.5 meter telescopes that was operated as part of the now closed Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA). Its initial goals were to survey the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) in order to measure its fine-scale anisotropies and to find clusters of galaxies. The survey was completed in 2007, and the array is now used primarily to characterize clusters via the Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect. Observations commenced at the SZA in April 2005.
One of the most important developments of the last few years has been the detection, through observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and supernova studies, of a form of energy that is accelerating the expansion of the universe. Dubbed dark energy by analogy with dark matter, it is believed to account for roughly 70% of the universe's energy content.
While dark energy cannot be observed directly, its basic properties can be inferred from its effect on structure formation in the universe. Just as an ecologist can learn about the food supply by studying how animal populations evolve with time, physicists can learn about dark energy by studying the population statistics of the universe's inhabitants — in this case, galaxy clusters.
The SZA gets its name from the means by which it measures galaxy clusters: the scattering of CMB light as it passes through the hot ionized cluster gas, known as the Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect (SZ effect). In short, the CMB is used as a backlight against which galaxy clusters can be seen by the shadows they cast. Since the SZA sees the shadow rather than the light emitted by the cluster itself, it can be used to measure sufficiently large clusters nearly independent of their redshift, all the way back to the epoch at which clusters first began to form.
Experiment
The SZA has been used for multi-wavelength observations of over 100 galaxy clusters, both on its own and as a part of the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA), which was decommissioned after 3 April 2015. From 2005 to 2007, SZA undertook a deep 31 GHz (Gigahertz) survey of several patches of sky.
Instrument
The SZA is not a single telescope, but an array of 8 telescopes operating together as an interferometer. An interferometer does not detect light in quite the same way as an ordinary telescope, by measuring the total power collected by a single dish; instead, it looks at differences between the light falling on pairs of telescopes. Like water waves, light waves can interfere with each other, producing a complex pattern of intensity enhancements where the waves constructively interfere, and nulls where they destructively interfere.
As light from a source washes over the array, an interferometer detects this interference pattern — hence the name. The source's structure on the sky can then be inferred from the interference pattern in much the same way that one might infer the size and shape of a stone thrown into a pond from the pattern of ripples left in its wake.
The native resolution of an interferometer depends not on the size of the individual telescopes (as with a traditional single telescope), but on their separation. Pairs of telescopes with large separations provide sensitivity to small-scale structure, while short spacings are sensitive to large-scale structure on the sky. The 8 SZA telescopes are small enough to be placed very close together, which provides maximum sensitivity to the (large-scale) SZ signal from clusters. When the SZA was combined with the other telescopes in the CARMA array, which had longer separations and were sensitive to finer angular scales, it formed a complete picture of galaxy clusters at very high resolution.

Towards the Last Spike was written in 1952 by Canadian poet E. J. Pratt. It is a long narrative poem in blank verse about the construction of the first transcontinental railroad line in Canada, that of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), from 1871 through 1885.
The poem won Pratt the Governor General's Award, Canada's top literary honor, for poetry in 1952.
It is written in an epic style, where characters engage in both verbal and physical struggle. The poem also has a political context, illuminated by the debates between Prime Minister John A. Macdonald (for the railway) versus Edward Blake (against). The physical tests throughout the poem are a battle between the forces of nature (the Canadian Shield is personified as a prehistoric monster) versus the combined might of the construction team headed by William Van Horne.
In their introduction to Pratt's 1968 Selected Poems, literary critic Peter Buitenhuis says of the piece:
In this poem man has the chance to learn from their mistakes and to employ their sinews and their technology to throw their thin lines of steel across muskeg and mountain. Again Pratt is using a mosaic technique of organizing their diverse material; but because Towards the Last Spike contains a great deal of political material, it is looser in form than the other epics. The gigantic nature of their theme tends to make the poem too impersonal, even though forces like the North Shore Laurentian monster and Lady British Columbia are personified.... Fortunately, the gigantism of these forces is almost matched by the human figures that Pratt has chosen as their heroes, William Van Horne and Sir John A. Macdonald. The two men are complementary in the poem: Macdonald, rhetorician and parliamentarian, supplies the dream of continental union; Van Horne, engineer and administrator, supplies the force and skill that makes the dream come true.
The poem ends with the famous driving home of the last spike at Craigellachie:
The stroke released the trigger for a burst
Of sound which stretched the gamut of the air.
The shouts of engineers and dynamiters,
Of locomotive-workers and explorers,
Flanking the rails, were but a tuning up
For a massed continental chorus.
When Towards the Last Spike appeared, Canadian literary critic Northrop Frye wrote that
Pratt has shown an increasing interest in techniques of communication, an interest which may well go back to their early days as a student of psychology.... The theme of the epic act of communication in Canadian history, the linking of east and west by a great railway, was thus a logical one for Pratt to choose for their latest poem.... But while the choice of theme may have been easy, the theme itself is fantastically difficult. The poem is in the epic tradition, without any of the advantages of epic to sustain it. No narrative suspense is possible where the ground has all been surveyed; no heroic action can be isolated in so concentrated an act of social will.... The real hero of the poem is a society's will to take intelligible form; the real quest is for physical and spiritual communication within that society. I have a notion that the technical problems involved in Towards the Last Spike are going to be central problems in the poetry of the future. And I think that the ingenuity with which these problems have been met would make the poem a historical landmark even for readers who disliked it as a poem."
"There would be much more to say about the poem if I had the space," Frye added. "There is the contrast between the desperate, quixotic, east-west reach from sea to sea which is the vision of Macdonald ... and the practical, short-sighted vision of Blake, which sees the country realistically, as a divided series of northern extensions of the United States.... There is the portrait of Strathcona as a Canadian culture-hero, a combination of Paul Bunyan and Sam Slick.... Above all, Pratt is a poet unusually aware of the traditional connection between poetry and oratory." They concluded: "The faults of the poem are obvious and commonplace; its virtues are subtle and remarkable."
Frye later wrote that Pratt had "expressed in Towards the Last Spike the central comic theme ... of the Canadian imagination."
Three years after its publication, fellow Canadian poet, F.R. Scott, critiqued Pratt for overlooking the thousands of indentured Chinese labourers who actually built the railway in their poem "All the Spikes but the Last."

The Fidelipac, commonly known as a "NAB cartridge" or simply "cart", is a magnetic tape sound recording format, used for radio broadcasting for playback of material over the air such as radio commercials, jingles, station identifications, and music. Fidelipac is the official name of this industry standard audio tape cartridge. It was developed in 1954 by inventor George Eash (although the invention of the Fidelipac cartridge has also been credited to Vern Nolte of the Automatic Tape Company), and commercially introduced in 1959 by Collins Radio Co. at the 1959 NAB Convention. The cartridge was often used at radio stations until the late 1990s, when such formats as MiniDisc and computerized broadcast automation predominated.
History
The Fidelipac cartridge was the first audio tape cartridge available commercially, based on the endless-loop tape cartridge design developed by Bernard Cousino in 1952, while Eash shared space in Cousino's electronics shop in the early 1950s. Instead of manufacturing the Fidelipac format themselves after developing it, Eash decided to license it for manufacture to Telepro Industries, in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. Telepro then manufactured and marketed the format under the Fidelipac brand name.
Tape format
Fidelipac was originally a analog recording tape, two-track format. One of the tracks was used for monaural program audio, and the other being used for a cue track to control the player, where either a primary cue tone was recorded to automatically stop the cart, a secondary tone was recorded to automatically re-cue the cart to the beginning of the cart's program material (in some models, two secondary tones, one after the program material, and one before it, were recorded to have the cart machine automatically fast-forward through any leftover blank tape at the end of a cart's program), or a tertiary tone, which was used by some players to trigger another cart player or another form of external equipment. Later versions used three tracks, two for stereo audio, and the third for the cue track.
The standard tape speed for Fidelipac carts used in the radio broadcasting industry is 7.5 ips, although some cart players and recorders can be set to record at other speeds, such as 3.75 or 15 ips.
Cartridge format
Unlike the consumer-marketed 8-track cartridge developed in 1964 by Bill Lear which had the pinch roller integrated into the cartridge, the Fidelipac cartridge had a hole in the right-hand bottom front corner of the cartridge, where the pinch roller built into the player would swing up into place to hold the tape against the drive capstan. While later machines from ATC, ITC, Harris, and others had the pinch roller automatically engage the cartridge when the play button was pressed (the capstan motor was already running when the cart was inserted), early machines such as Sparta, Spot-matic, and others required the operator to also push or pull a separate lever to move the pinch roller into place before playback could begin. The 8-track cartridge tape speed was slower ( ips compared to Fidelipac's ips) and did not have adequate tape support pads, and thus was not "broadcast quality." The lower speed and narrower tracks in 8-track cartridges led to higher noise and reduced frequency response. The 8-track design also lacked a cue track.
There were three sizes of Fidelipac carts available — the 4-inch-wide A size (Fidelipac Model 300, 350 and MasterCart), which was a standard 8-track size cart with maximum minute playing time at 7.5 ips (this was the most common and widely used size of Fidelipac cart); the 6-inch-wide B size (Fidelipac Model 600), a larger cartridge designed for holding longer programs; and the even larger 8-inch-wide C size (Fidelipac Model 1200), often used for background music applications like the Rowe Customusic.
The size Fidelipac cartridge was later adapted by Earl "Madman" Muntz in partnership with George Eash in 1963 for their Stereo-Pak cartridge system (also known as a 4-track cartridge), which differed in two ways — the number of tracks used (four in this case, with two played back at a time to provide a total of two programs of stereo audio), and the tape speed ( ips—the same speed as 8-track cartridges, as opposed to Fidelipac's standard ips). Unlike the Fidelipac players which used a stationary head, the Stereo-Pak system used a movable head to switch between the two programs (much like the 8-track format, which also used a movable head to select its four stereo programs).

The Track Imaging Cherenkov Experiment (TrICE) is a ground-based cosmic ray telescope located at Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago, IL. The telescope, which contains a Fresnel lens, eight spherical mirrors, and a camera with 16 multianode photomultiplier tubes, uses the atmospheric Cherenkov imaging technique to detect Cherenkov radiation produced when cosmic rays interact with particles in the Earth's atmosphere.
The telescope is primarily a research and development tool for improving photomultiplier tube cameras and electronic systems for future gamma and cosmic ray telescopes. It is also used to study the energy and composition of cosmic rays in the TeV–PeV range, and the collaboration is currently conducting pioneering work in detecting direct Cherenkov signals from cosmic rays.

Bossiaea foliosa, commonly known as leafy bossiaea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae and is endemic to south-eastern Australia. It is an erect shrub with small, broadly egg-shaped to round leaves, and bright yellow flowers.
Description
Bossiaea foliosa is an erect shrub that typically grows to a height of up to about and has hairy branches. The leaves are arranged alternately along the stems, broadly egg-shaped to more or less round, long and wide with more or less persistent triangular stipules long at the base. The flowers are long and arranged singly in leaf axils, each flower on a pedicel up to long with a few crowded bracts about long. The sepals are long with narrow elliptic bracteoles long at the base of the sepal tube. The petals are uniformly bright yellow, the petals more or less equal in length. Flowering occurs from October to December and the fruit is a more or less round pod long.
Taxonomy
Bossiaea foliosa was first formally described in 1825 by Allan Cunningham who found it growing in "brushy forest-land near Bathurst" and published the description in the chapter "On the Botany of the Blue Mountains" of Barron Field's book, Geographical Memoirs on New South Wales. The specific epithet (foliosa) means "leafy".
Distribution and habitat
Leafy bossiaea grows in open forest and woodland, sometimes in Sphagnum bogs, at high altitudes south from near Orange in New South Wales through the Australian Capital Territory to the ranges in the east and north-east of Victoria.

The Gotteszell–Blaibach railway is a railway line in the state of Bavaria in southern Germany that runs from Gotteszell in Lower Bavaria to Blaibach in the Upper Palatinate.
Construction of the line from Gotteszell to Viechtach
Following the construction of the Schwandorf–Furth im Wald railway in 1861 and the Bavarian Forest Railway in 1877 a desire grew to link the valley of the Black Regen between Teisnach and Blaibach with these two lines. The Royal Bavarian State Railways had decided in favour of a branch line (Lokalbahn) from Cham to Kötzting, however.
So the Lokalbahn AG in Munich was tasked to carry out the project work. Their plan envisaged the railway line branching off from the Bavarian Forest Railway at Gotteszell and reaching its terminus after 24.97 kilometres in Viechtach. On 28 April 1889 the concession for the construction of the Gotteszell–Viechtach Lokalbahn.
The line cost the Lokalbahn AG exactly 1,783,148 gold marks to build. On 20 November 1890 the railway was taken into service. In its first full operating year 107,630 passengers and around 25,000 tonnes of goods were transported, resulting in a profit of 27,181 marks. In 1900 the profit even reached 76,278 marks. The Teisnach paper factory played a large part in that.
Extension to Blaibach
For years efforts had been made to have an extension built to Blaibach. On 21 October 1904 the Minister of Transport, Heinrich von Frauendorfer, set so many conditions that the attempts were initially dropped.
In 1919 the track of the branch line was replaced. Instead of Bavarian Type V rails with a weight per metre of , Bavarian Type IX rails were used with a weight per metre of . The rail length was now 15 metres instead of 9. And now there was at last a plan to build a railway line through the Zeller Valley, the proponents for which pressed for an extension to Blaibach. From 1924 to 1925 the extension of the railway was assessed.
In order to build the extension the station in Viechtach had to be extended by 150 metres. In July 1926 work began. Only relief workers (Notstandsarbeiter) were allowed to be used for its construction. The largest structure on the 14.8 kilometre long extension was the bridge over the River Regen near Blaibach, an unsupported concrete bridge with a 70-metre span. On 20 December 1927 the line was opened to traffic. On 2 January 1928 goods services began and they were followed by the first passenger services on 1 February 1928.
In addition, the Gotteszell–Viechtach railway and Deggendorf–Metten railway were joined by the Regentalbahn AG on 1 February. On 3/4 March 1928 the actual opening celebrations took place. The railway was subsequently known as the Regentalbahn.
Operations, closure and hiking trail
When the Blaibach line opened four pairs of trains ran daily between Viechtach und Blaibach. On the old line three pairs of trains ran daily on weekdays and four on Sundays and public holidays. The vehicle fleet used was particularly interesting, because they used second-hand stock that could be procured cheaply from other railways. The first railbus ran through the Regen valley as early as 1902.
In Gumpenried in 1984 the line was raised and straightened as part of work to build a power station. On 2 February 1991 the section from Blaibach to Viechtach was closed due to damage to the Regen Bridge near and on 30 April 1991 the Viechtach–Gotteszell was also closed. In 1992 the line was finally shut from Viechtach to Blaibach. The districts of Cham and Regen procured the line and built a cycle path on it in 1997. On the remaining section of the line the Wanderbahn im Regental company operates the Gotteszell-Viechtach tourist line.
Trial operation
In 2014, the Bavarian Minister of Infrastructure, Martin Zeil, announced a two-year trial of rail services between Gotteszell and Viechtach from September 2016 to September 2018. This was the result of local requirements to improve local infrastructure. Two options were envisaged. If the trial were successful, achieving a minimum usage of 1000 passengers per day, the Bavarian ministry would authorise regular rail services between Gotteszell and Viechtach and provide all the funding. If the trial failed, the county of Regen would have to shoulder 10% of all costs for the service. As a result of protests because of the change from school buses to trains, which meant longer journeys for schoolchildren, a vote was held in February 2015 to ascertain the views of the local population. Over 63% of those who voted said they would welcome regular train services.
Following this result, the first steps were taken to prepare for regular services: railway lines, bridges and the tunnel were repaired, signal boxes were built at several level crossings, and stations were renovated or rebuilt. According to current plans, the trains will operate a hourly and stop over at the stations of Ruhmannsfelden, Patersdorf, Teisnach Technologiecampus (new), Teisnach (crossing station), Gumpenried-Asbach and Schnitzmühle. The Regentalbahn will be operating the route with modern RegioShuttles called Waldbahn ("forest railway") trains.

Lifesaving is the act involving rescue, resuscitation and first aid. It often refers to water safety and aquatic rescue; however, it could include ice rescue, flood and river rescue, swimming pool rescue and other emergency medical services. Lifesaving also refers to sport where lifesavers compete based on skills, speed and teamwork. Lifesaving activities specialized in oceanic environment is called surf lifesaving or coastal lifesaving.
Those who participate in lifesaving activities as a volunteer are called lifesavers, and those who are employed to professionally perform lifesaving activities are called lifeguards.
History
Origins
The first life saving organisation, the Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck, was established in England in 1824 by Sir William Hillary. While living on the Isle of Man in 1808, they became aware of the treacherous nature of the Irish Sea, with many ships being wrecked around the Manx coast. They soon drew up plans for a national lifeboat service manned by trained crews, but received little response from the Admiralty.
However, on appealing to the more philanthropic members of London society, the plans were adopted and, with the help of two members of Parliament (Robert Wilson and George Hibbert), the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck was founded in 1824.
One of the Institution's first rescues was of the packet St George, which had foundered on Conister Rock at the entrance to Douglas Harbour. Hillary took part in the successful operation and everyone was ultimately rescued. Thirty years later the Institution's title was changed to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the first of the new lifeboats to be built was stationed at Douglas in recognition of Hillary's work.
Spread
Similar services were established in other countries, in Belgium (1838), Denmark (1848), United States (1848), Sweden (1856), France (1865), Germany (1885), Turkey (1868), Russia (1872), Italy (1879) and Spain (1880). In 1891 the Royal Life Saving Society was created to affiliate British and Irish lifesaving and lifeguarding clubs. It expanded its operations to Canada and Australia in 1894. In 1913 the DLRG was founded in Germany.
The first international lifesaving conference was held in Marseilles, France in 1878, but it was not until 1910 that the first international lifesaving organisation, FIS (Fédération Internationale de Sauvetage Aquatique), was founded.
In 1971 Australia, Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States founded another international organization called World Life Saving (WLS). FIS and WLS merged into a new organisation, International Life Saving Federation (ILS) in 1993 with its headquarters in Leuven, Belgium.
International Life Saving Federation
The International Life Saving Federation (ILS) was established on 27 March 1910 in Paris, France. The ILS is primarily known as the world authority and head in the global effort to "prevent drowning and regroups national life saving organisations/federations aiming at improving water safety, water rescue, lifesaving and lifeguarding and lifesaving sport".
Activities
Surf lifesaving developed in Australia and is often simply called "lifesaving". It focuses on drowning prevention and rescue in a coastal setting. General lifesaving does not limit its activities to beaches - its aim is to promote water safety around ponds, lakes, rivers, pools, in the home, at school and in any other applicable environments. This is why landlocked countries like Switzerland, Austria, Kazakhstan, Macedonia, Serbia, Azerbaijan, Czech Republic and Slovakia, are also full members of ILS.
Lifesavers are volunteers and usually stationed at a club house. They provide training for lifesaver/lifeguard qualifications as well as educating the general public.
As a sport
Lifesaving has become a growing sport in many countries. The sport can be contested in swimming pools or on beaches in the surf, each being a separate discipline of the sport.
Lifesaving is one of the official sports of The World Games, a quadrennial multi-sport event for sports and disciplines that are not in the Olympic programme.
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, otherwise known as CPR is the most common form of life saving. CPR can be easily understood through this simplified table.
DRSABCD
All collapsed victims should be carefully assessed to decide what emergency care is needed. This method of assessment is known as DRSABCD, this method is explained in the following table.

Gregorio Jover Cortés (Teruel, 25 October 1891 – Mexico, 22 March 1964) was an Aragonese anarcho-syndicalist and a member of the CNT during the first third of the 20th century. During the Spanish Civil War they were commander of the Ascaso Column and later the militarized 28th Division, which fought on the Aragon front.
Biography
Early years
As a child they emigrated to Valencia, where they joined socialist and later anarchist youth organizations. Around 1911, after completing military service as a conscript, they again emigrated to Barcelona, where they worked as a carpenter, joining the corresponding CNT union. Persecuted for their activism, they took refuge in Valencia for a time, and then returned to Barcelona, where they were elected delegate of the Catalan Wood Union, although they were also active in the Los Valencianos group. On 12 August 1923 they took part in the regional congress of the CNT held in Manresa, rejecting the post of secretary offered to them because they were declared illiterate.
With the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera increased the repression against the labor movement as groups of gunmen, organized by the Sindicatos Libres, began to mortally attack the most exposed union activists. As a means of defense, Jover helped found the illegalist direct action group Los Solidarios, organized in independent cells in defense and support of armed with the group of Spanish anarchists of the CNT-FAI. With Buenaventura Durruti, they took part in organizing the assassination of the prime minister Eduardo Dato e Iradier (8 March 1921), although they did not take part directly in the action. It was during one of these "operations" that on 24 March 1924, Jover was arrested in Barcelona, but managed to escape and go into exile in Paris together with Francisco Ascaso, Buenaventura Durruti and most of the militiamen of Los Solidarios. There they worked in a mattress factory and turned down an offer to become a factory supervisor. They were also one of the organizers of the failed expedition to Bera (7 November 1924) and the attempted assault on the Drassanes barracks (24 November 1924). Meanwhile, in 1923 and 1924, their partner Nieves Castella had two children, Emma and Liberto.
In order to avoid expulsion from France, along with Buenaventura Durruti and Francisco Ascaso they emigrated to Latin America, where they created another illegalist group Los Errantes, which organized the first expropriation robbery in the country's history. The group returned to Paris in 1926. In 1927 Jover took part in the organization of the assassination attempt on Alfonso XIII, but despite the order of summons and search, they managed to escape arrest. In 1931, with the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic, they returned to Barcelona and rejoined the CNT.
From November 1932 they were a member of the committee of the Barcelona Metallurgical Union. As a member of the Nosotros group, they were the protagonist of many anti-capitalist direct actions and several uprisings, which cost them some periods of imprisonment.
Spanish Civil War
After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936, they quickly joined the Confederal militias and went on to lead the Ascaso Column in its advance from Barcelona to the Aragón front, also participating in the politics of the towns nearby, where they were able to organize their libertarian ideas in practice. Jover's column, together with other militias, headed towards Huesca, establishing positions around the city while besieging it.
Along with other anarchists such as Liberto Callejas, Ada Martí and Maximo Franco, commanders of the Red and Black Column, and together with the POUM, they participated in the so-called Barcelona May Days of 1937, during which the Friends of Durruti Group (with about 5,000 militants) was established.
After the militarization of the militias decreed by the republican government, in 1937 they went on to lead the 28th Division, which fought on the front of Aragon, in Teruel, in the Levante and in Estremadura. In May 1938 they were promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. From the spring of that year they were in command of the 10th Army Corps, fighting on the Segre Front until the fall of Catalonia in January 1939.
Exile
Exiled to France, Jover was arrested on 10 February 1939 in La Guingueta d'Ix on the pretext that they had already been expelled from France twelve years earlier. They were interned for 41 days in Perpignan prison, from which they were released on 4 April after being sentenced to 15 days. They were then sent to Le Vernet concentration camp until 10 July 1939, but thanks to the permission of the sub-prefect of Prades they were granted permission to reside; here they were supported thanks to the monthly subsidies of 2,000 francs sent to them by the Spanish Refugee Evacuation Service (SERE). However, in October 1939, the police again identified them as the Gregorio Jover that was expelled from France in 1925 and on October 18 they were interned again in the Sant Cebrià de Rosselló camp.
The internment made them see that they were suffering a persecution that made their life impossible in France. They then decided to leave for the Americas, before embarking for Santo Domingo and then Mexico. They were elected secretary of the subdelegation of the CNT in Mexico and the Committee on Relations and Aid, on whose behalf in 1945 they requested the entry of the CNT into the Spanish Republican government in exile. Gregorio Jover Cortés died in Mexico on 22 March 1964.

Sausmarez Manor is a historic house in Saint Martin, Guernsey.
The original manor house
The first mention of the Sausmarez family in Guernsey is at the consecration of the Vale church in 1117 attended by Guillaume de Sausmarez, followed by a letter dated 1254 in which Prince Edward, Lord of the Isles, afterwards King Edward I, ordered an enquiry into the rights of the Abbot and Monks of Mont-Saint-Michel to "wreck" in the Islands of Guernsey and Jersey. The enquiry was duly held before "Dominus Henry le Canelu, Dominus Gulielmus De Saumareis, milites". The William de Saumareis is almost certainly the same person as William de Salinells who was Seigneur de Samarès, then called Saumareys, in the parish of Saint Clement in Jersey, who was born towards the end of the reign of Richard Coeur de Lion. It is not known when they acquired their new fief in St Martin's parish in Guernsey, but its manor-house was on much the same site as the present one.
In 1313 an inquisition of Edward II and again in 1331 Matthew de Sausmarez was Captain of the Castle at Jerbourg and the Seigneur of the Manor. The fief was mentioned in the Extente (land value assessment) of 1331 in the reign of Edward III of England as having belonged "from time immemorial" to the family of their grandson Matthew. The capture of the Island by the French in 1338 resulted in 1341, after a battle was lost in Les Hubits, St Martin, to Sir Peter de Sausmarez escaping via Petit Port to Jersey, returning after the Island was retaken in 1345.
Of this oldest manor-house only a fragment remains. Its rough but remarkably solid stonework forms the basis of an outhouse on the north-east side of the main buildings and surrounds an arched doorway which was later blocked in with a different form of stone. This is one of the most ancient fragments of unrepaired Norman masonry in the island and can be fairly confidently dated to the mid 13th century.
The Tudor house
Both manor and fief remained in the possession of the family until 1557. In that year the Seigneur, George de Sausmarez, died without issue and left their estate to their sister Judith; sixteen years previously they had married an Englishman called John Andrews. who had come to Guernsey from Northamptonshire as Lieutenant to Sir Peter Mewtis, the Governor of the Islands. Their son John, who became known in Guernsey as John Andros, was in 1557, in accordance with Guernsey law, declared Seigneur in their mother's right. Their rights to the title and manor being confirmed by a Royal Commission that reported in 1607. It was they who built the second house, running down the slope of the shallow valley towards the fish pond, at right angles to the original one. In a party-wall on the ground floor of this building there is carved, on a lintel over a door leading from the main-hall to a smaller room, the initials I.A. and the date 1585. The lower end of the house is now used as a craft metal workshop, and the upper, which was restored and altered, once in 1759 and again exactly two hundred years later, is still inhabited.
The Queen Anne house
Including John Andros six members of their family were Seigneurs of Sausmarez over a period of nearly two hundred years. The third of these, Amyas Andros, who was a staunch royalist throughout the Civil War, played a distinguished part as liaison between the King's forces which controlled Jersey and the brave royalist garrison of Castle Cornet. After the Restoration, they were made Bailiff by Charles II, being one of the only two prominent Guernseymen who were not obliged to seek pardon from their Sovereign for their conduct during the Grand Rebellion. Their son, Sir Edmund Andros, was in 1674 both Bailiff and Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey and at the same time Governor of the Colony of New York as well as New England, North Carolina, Virginia, Massachusetts, New Plymouth and New Jersey. In fact it was he, who changed the name from New Amsterdam to New York, when they were its first British Governor. Very little of their time seems to have been spent in Guernsey, for they retired to live in Westminster. One of their reasons for doing so appears from the following clause in their will, dated 1713.
Clearly Sir Edmund did not consider the old Tudor Manor House to be worthy of a man of their station. Moreover, they contemplated rebuilding it himself. The great beauty of the building and the strong touches of New England influence that it displays indicate that the plans were prepared for them in London before their death in 1714. The work was duly carried out by John Andros during the next four years, though the clause quoted suggests that they did so with some reluctance and under the threat of sanctions!
The façade, built of grey granite with red granite coigns is of beautiful proportions. The house, all the outer walls of which are two feet thick in thickness, is four storeys high and has two rooms on each floor. It originally had no communication with any of the earlier buildings. The main entrance is from a flight of eight steps leading to the oaken front door on the first floor. This door opens upon a hall whence a typical Queen Anne staircase rises to the top of the house, and ends with a door giving access to a widows walk, from which can be had a fine view of the greater part of the Island.
The next Seigneur, Charles Andros, succeeded their uncle John in 1746. Within two years they had sold the house and fief back to the de Sausmarez family to whose history we must now return.
Having lost their connection with the manor house and fief as a result of their cousin Judith's marriage to John Andros, some members of the younger branch of the de Sausmarez family became, like so many of the fellow islanders in the 16th and 17th centuries, wool merchants with their chief markets in France. In the days of Charles II a Michel de Sausmarez (b.1655) had a shop in Paris where they sold woollen goods, principally stockings, provided for them by a cousin from an efficiently organised Guernsey cottage industry. Among their customers was Prince Rupert of the Rhine who ordered some of their clothes from the French Capital.
Yet despite this high patronage the wool trade was by then in decline as a consequence of a change in fashion greatly stimulated by the French King, Louis XIV, who made their nobles dress in silk and satin in order to attend their court at Versailles.
The firm faced ruin, but Michel's eldest son Matthew (b.1685), from whom all members of the family today are descended, was a man of imagination and energy. They married Anne Durell, the daughter of a rich Jersey Jurat and niece of Sir Edward de Carteret, retired Governor of New Jersey, and with the money they brought them fitted out some of the earliest of those Guernsey privateers on the activities of which, legal or otherwise, the wealth of the island was in the 18th century so largely to rely on. It is not unreasonable to suppose that Matthew, on some visit to France, noticed how profitable the corsairs were proving to the citizens of the port of St. Malo and decided to take a leaf out of their neighbours' book. In addition to being a pioneer of privateering they were also in practice in Guernsey as an advocate.
Their eldest son, John, was like them a member of the Guernsey bar and for 38 years held succession the two Law Offices of the Crown, those of Controller and Procurer. Their second son, Philip, was the first of many of the family to serve in the Royal Navy. The latter, after a most promising career, in the course of which they sailed round the world with Commodore George Anson in , was put in command of the great Spanish galleon, the richest prize ever, captured during their voyage. They were killed in action and left a considerable fortune, derived from prize money, to their family. This windfall certainly helped John to buy back the fief and Manor House from Charles Andros in 1748. A third son, Matthew, was the father of Admiral James Saumarez, 1st Baron de Saumarez.
Having regained the house of their ancestors John de Sausmarez celebrated their return by putting up the gates which are a well known feature of Sausmarez Road. Their outer pillars each bear the family crest of a falcon displayed, the two inner ones a unicorn and a greyhound, the supporters of the family arms. These were all the work of Sir Henry Cheere, the celebrated 18th-century sculptor who also made the memorial to Philip Saumarez in Westminster Abbey. In 1759 John restored the upper end of the Tudor manor house and added a new entrance to it.
The Regency house
John's heir, their eldest son Matthew, was Seigneur from 1774 to 1820. Their main contribution to the estate was the building of the walls which enclose the potager, (vegetable garden) the orchard and the tennis court and the restoration of the old barn facing the Tudor house and to the south-west of it. When they died they were succeeded by their brother Thomas who, like their father, was both Controller and Procureur, though for an even longer period of fifty-five years.
Thomas had been a fiery youth who, in 1790, had fought a successful duel against their cousin Robert le Marchant, a son of the bailiff of that day, the repercussions of which provoked considerable discussion in fashionable London circles. Thomas eventually settled down to have an enormous family. Their two marriages brought them twenty-eight children. Though some of these died in infancy, they still had many who were not yet of age when they moved into the Manor. They therefore found the Andros house too small for their needs, and was obliged to build on to the back of it. Their plans for it show it to have been a pleasant addition. It had a large breakfast room on the first floor and several bedrooms on this and the two upper floors. A central passage separated it on each floor from the Queen Anne house. On the ground floor, what is now part of a kitchen was originally used as the Procureur's office.
Little (it is impossible to say how much) of this Regency house, which began in the last year of George III's reign, remains. Some of the doors and one of the bedroom windows are still clearly identifiable as is part of the roof. But the greater portion of it was pulled down by Thomas's youngest son, General George de Sausmarez who, having bought their brothers' shares of the property, became Seigneur and in 1873 began building the last and final additions to the family home with typical mid-Victorian gusto, employing a Parisian garden designer who had ambitious plans which would not be fulfilled.
The Victorian house
The General had had a distinguished career in the service of the East India Company. An expert in small-arms training and a reformer in military administration they never saw a shot fired in war. In the Indian mutiny his, the Madras, command was the only one which had no mutineers. Yet though they won no great glory like Havelock and Colin Campbell, theirs was a lucrative post which enabled them on their return to Guernsey to indulge to the full their somewhat liberal and not always irreproachable taste.
Having pulled down most of their father's Regency house, they replaced it on the first floor with a large dining-room and still larger drawing-room. Despite the unfortunate appearance which their windows and general design present from outside, in strong contrast to the Queen Anne facade, the interiors of these rooms have a peculiar charm. The same startling mixture of happy and unhappy touches of inspiration characterise the large entrance-hall which the General built on the north-east side of the Queen Anne house to link it with the Tudor one. The main feature of this hall and gallery is a riotous medley of wood-carving, some of it Burmese, some of it copies of the same by a local craftsman and some of it consisting of Old Testament figures and scenes, believed to have been acquired from Breton churches where they had been put up for sale. The whole presents an effect which, one feels, would meet with the approval of John Betjeman with their sympathetic eye for such Victorian fantasy.
After the General's death their widow lived on at the Manor, as Dame, with their sister and brother until their death in 1915. They were succeeded in the Seigneurie by their nephew, Sir Havilland de Sausmarez who, after a distinguished judicial career in the service of the Foreign Office, including serving as Chief Judge of the British Supreme Court for China for 16 years became the second member of their family to hold the office of Bailiff of Guernsey. They died during the German occupation of the Island. Their persistent refusal to install electric light saved the manor from being requisitioned by the occupying power. Their nephew, the late Seigneur, Cecil de Sausmarez (1907-1986), after a distinguished career in the Diplomatic Service and whilst a successful people deputy carried out an extensive programme of restoration and modernisation of the property.

Tomboy is the fourth solo album by American musician Panda Bear (aka Noah Lennox), released on April 4, 2011 initially as an online stream and later physically. It was mixed by UK musician Sonic Boom. In contrast to the sample-based composition of the previous Panda Bear album Person Pitch (2007), the recording of Tomboy features a stripped-down sound built around guitar processed through Korg M3-M workstation modules.
The album peaked at no. 29 on the Billboard 200. It was included on 2011 best-of lists by publications such as Pitchfork and Rolling Stone.
Background
Following the success of their previous album Person Pitch (2007) and Animal Collective's Merriweather Post Pavilion (2009), Lennox was looking to move beyond the restrictions of composing with a sampler and record something "with a heavy focus on guitar and rhythm," influenced by bands like Nirvana and the White Stripes; they later qualified that these artists' influence should not be taken too literally, as "their sound is over-driven and buzzed out and that wasn't something I was really into. But […] it was exciting to see that from a simple set up, these bands can crank out some really heavy jams. I think I just took inspiration from that kind of approach.” They also mentioned being inspired by the singing of "Frank Sinatra or crooner guys. It's a really singular thing, but really powerful, too."
In contrast to Person Pitch, which was recorded in their well-lit apartment overlooking Lisbon, Tomboy was recorded in a basement studio where "there was no light, it was really dark and it was kind of lonely." During the sessions, Lennox ran their guitar through a Korg M3-M workstation module, which is commonly part of a synthesizer. They explained that they "had this idea of a triangle where the voice was at the top, some sort of guitar element on one side, and then some sort of really basic rhythm on the other side. The song "Benfica" is a reference to the Portuguese football club S.L. Benfica.
Production
In an interview with NYCTaper in September 2010, Josh Dibb of Animal Collective revealed that they and bandmate Dave Portner had been requested to mix the album on its completion. However, due to the fact that both of them were busy at the time, it was later reported that the album was being mixed by Sonic Boom, former Spacemen 3 member and producer of MGMT's second album, Congratulations.
Lennox noted that their original mix of the album "sampled a lot of these little children's movies that my daughter was watching at the time […] I just remember hearing this sonic clutter in the house all the time." They noted that Sonic Boom's mix made these less obvious but "I'm hoping that those sorts of things will make it feel a little more weird, like a broadcast coming from space."
Release
Lennox had mentioned that Tomboy'''s release would be similar to that of Person Pitch in that several singles would be released on different labels prior to its release, "Doing the singles helps me focus on every song and also helps me move along in the process." The first single, "Tomboy" was released on Paw Tracks July 13, 2010, with a digital release following a week later. The first and only pressing sold out quickly. Another two singles, "You Can Count on Me" and "Last Night at the Jetty", were released later in the year on Domino and FatCat respectively. "Surfer's Hymn", the last of the four planned singles, was released by Kompakt on March 28 with a remix by London musician Actress. According to their website, Tomboy was slated for release "near the end of 2010".
On January 14, 2011, Lennox announced via Facebook that the album would be released on April 19 of that year, and it was later moved up a week to April 12 so it would be available on Record Store Day. Two listening parties for the album were held in New York City on February 16, and another two in Los Angeles on February 28. The first 1000 pressings of the vinyl were printed on translucent wax, and initial copies of the album came with a download card redeemable for a free digital copy of Live at Governor's Island, a recording of a New York show by Panda Bear from September 11, 2010. A limited edition box set for the album was released on November 1, 2011 with all proceeds going to the American Cancer Society. It contains four LPs featuring: the Tomboy full length with slightly different mixing on two LPs, Noah's single mixes on one LP, and several Tomboy unreleased instrumentals and a cappellas, plus "The Preakness" and a 16-page art booklet.
ReceptionRolling Stone stated that "the rapturous beauty on the Animal Collective singer's fourth solo disc is built on basic stuff: Lennox's choirboy tenor – multiplied into billowing harmonies – and sweet melodies," but called it "a bit less stunning" than Person Pitch. The Guardian called the album "dense, oppressive and utterly hypnotic," and praised Lennox's "honeyed, glowing vocal harmonies, repeated and repeated until they induce not a headache, but a calming trance." Entertainment Weekly stated that the album "stretches out Beach Boys-style pop into a kind of slo-mo sound installation. The woozy, reverb-rich result makes for great headphone swimming." According to The Quietus, the album reflected "a more streamlined assimilation of all the classic Panda Bear touchstones: 60s psych-pop, drone, techno and folk," stating that 'by shedding many of their more irksome tropes, they let their true craftsmanship shine through."Paste noted that the album "scales back on many of the infectious samples that made their third LP such an appealing record, instead inviting us into their own lush ambient-pop landscapes," but cautioned that Lennox occasionally "succumbs to the weight of their somewhat ambivalent, drudging experiments." Slant Magazine claimed that "it's difficult not to be slightly disappointed by the despondent nature of Lennox's fourth solo album," adding that "though rich and dreamlike, Panda Bear's latest is too tedious, too bloated, and far too serious to be anything more than an above-average record."
Pitchfork placed the album at number 32 on its list of the "Top 50 albums of 2011".Rolling Stone'' placed the album at number 37 on its list of the "Top 50 albums of 2011".

Big Plain is an unincorporated community in Fairfield Township, Madison County, Ohio, United States. It is located at , at the intersection of West Jefferson-Kiousville Road and Big Plain-Circleville Road, approximately four miles north of Kiousville.
History
The community was originally laid out by Thomas Chappel, Robert Thomas and William D. Pringle in the spring of 1849, and was then named California, after the recent gold rush in the state of the same name, and the community was later expanded by Pringle. As of 1875, the community had one church, two dry goods stores, one drug store, two blacksmith and wagon shops, two physicians, and one shoe shop. Due to there already being a post office named California elsewhere in the state, the Big Plain Post Office was established on June 17, 1850, named after large prairies in the area known as the "Big Plains". To prevent any confusion, the name of the community was changed to match the name of the post office some time between 1875 and 1905. The post office was discontinued on December 14, 1905. The mail service is now sent through the London branch. As of 1915, the community contained a church, a Knights of Pythias lodge, and the township hall.
Demographics
As of 1875, the population was about 125, and as of 1915, the population was 200.

Hurricane Diana was the first major hurricane to hit the East Coast of the United States in nearly 20 years. Diana was the ninth tropical cyclone, fourth named storm, first hurricane, and first major hurricane of the 1984 Atlantic hurricane season. It caused moderate damage in North Carolina while it looped offshore and after it made landfall as a Category 2 hurricane. Forming on September 8, Diana moved northward and wandered across North Carolina for a couple of days during mid-September, dropping heavy rainfall. Once it left the state and accelerated east-northeast, Diana quickly evolved into an extratropical cyclone. Watches and warnings were issued for the storm along the East coast between eastern Florida and Virginia. Damages to the United States totaled $65.5 million (1984 USD). Three indirect fatalities were caused by the cyclone.
Meteorological history
The origins of Hurricane Diana can be traced back to a stalled out area of low pressure just north of the Bahamas along the tail end of a cold front on September 6. Shower and thunderstorm activity began to increase the next day but was generally disorganized. Around 1200 UTC on September 8, a ship in the vicinity of the low reported a sustained wind speed of 40 mph (65 km/h). A few hours later, based on satellite observations, the low was designated Tropical Storm Diana. With weak steering currents, Diana gradually intensified as it slowly moved towards the west over the next day, coming within 50 miles (85 km) of Cape Canaveral, Florida, before taking a sharp turn towards the north-northwest. As Diana neared Saint Augustine, Florida, it turned towards the northeast and intensified into a hurricane.
Under weak steering currents while detached to the front, Diana drifted westward, and came within 50 miles (85 km) of the Florida coast. Rather than continuing westward, where it would have hit near Cape Canaveral, Diana turned to the northwest where it paralleled the coastline. The storm, continually strengthening over the Gulf Stream, turned to the northeast and became a hurricane on September 10. On September 11 and September 12, Diana rapidly intensified to a peak of 130 mph (215 km/h) winds while remaining offshore.
An approaching frontal system caused Diana to execute a cyclonic loop, where cool, dry air caused it to weaken. The hurricane hit Wilmington, North Carolina as a weakening hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (150 km/h) on September 13, and quickly weakened to a tropical storm over land. The high pressure system that built in after Diana looped weakened, allowing the storm to move to the north and east. After crossing the Outer Banks, Diana accelerated to the northeast, and after restrengthening to a storm, became extratropical near Nova Scotia on September 16.
Preparations
Soon after advisories were initiated, gale warnings were issued between Cape Canaveral, Florida and Virginia Beach, Virginia during the afternoon of September 8. During the morning of September 9, gale warnings were lowered south of St. Augustine, Florida. As Diana strengthened into a hurricane, hurricane watches and gale warnings were raised between St. Augustine and Oregon Inlet, North Carolina. By the morning of September 10, gale warnings were upgraded to hurricane warnings between Brunswick, Georgia and Oregon Inlet. All warnings and watches south of Brunswick were dropped at that time. By the morning of September 11, hurricane warnings were lowered south of Savannah, Georgia. That afternoon, all warnings were lowered south of Cape Romain, South Carolina.
On the morning of September 12, all warnings were lowered south of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Early in the morning of September 13, gale warnings were raised between Cape Romain and Myrtle Beach. Later that morning, hurricane warnings were lowered between Wilmington, North Carolina and Oregon Inlet, and all warnings were dropped between Cape Lookout and Virginia Beach. Gale warnings were then in effect between Wilmington and Cape Lookout. Once inland, all warnings were lowered on the afternoon of September 13. As the tropical storm moved offshore, gale warnings went into effect between the mornings of September 14 and September 15 between Cape Lookout and Chincoteague, Virginia.
Along the North Carolina coastline, state troopers were deployed to assist residents in evacuating and preparing for the hurricane. South Carolina governor Mike Daniel declared a state of emergency and placed the national guard on standby. Schools throughout the Carolinas and Georgia were closed. Most beaches were closed due to strong rip currents and beach erosion. Residents on barrier islands were urged to evacuate as waves in excess of were expected to inundate them. Approximately 94 families were relocated from their mobile homes near Beaufort, North Carolina by state officials. A 24-hour emergency operations center was also established. The Coast Guard moved all available boats in the area to a position where they could be deployed immediately if needed.
Along the Georgia coastline, The Golden Isles of Georgia were evacuated due to large swells produced by Diana. Two nursing homes in Tybee Island were evacuated and a voluntary evacuation was issued for all residents in the town. Several shelters were also opened at schools in a few counties; however, relatively few families sought refuge in them. Local schools and beaches were also closed for the duration of the storm's passage.
Impact and aftermath
With Category 4 winds of , Diana threatened to become the most intense hurricane to strike North Carolina since Hurricane Hazel in 1954. However, it looped and weakened just offshore and made landfall as a Category 2 hurricane. Because of this, Diana only caused $65.5 million in damage (1984 USD) due to heavy flooding from up to of rain, tree damage, and downed power lines. Most of the damage was experienced between Wilmington, North Carolina and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. The Carolina Power and Light Brunswick Nuclear Power Plant recorded winds of over 75 mph, making Hurricane Diana the first hurricane to bring hurricane-force winds to a nuclear power plant. Some yard damage was seen, but the plant was mostly unaffected.
Three indirect deaths were reported from Diana. One person died from a heart attack while making hurricane preparations, and the other two were from automobile accidents. Following the storm, President Ronald Reagan declared five North Carolina counties as a federal disaster area, allowing the affected regions to receive government funds and assistance. Funds were also allocated for the repairing of roads and sewers.

Terry Wayne Baker (born May 5, 1941) is a former American football and basketball player. They played college football and basketball at Oregon State University in Corvallis, where they were a member of Phi Delta Theta. Baker played as a quarterback for the football team from 1960 to 1962, winning the Heisman Trophy as senior. In the spring of their senior year, they led the basketball team to the Final Four of the NCAA tournament. To date, they are the only athlete to win a Heisman Trophy and play in the Final Four. Baker was the first overall pick in the 1963 NFL draft and played with the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League (NFL) from 1963 to 1965. They then played for one season in the Canadian Football League (CFL) with the Edmonton Eskimos in 1967. Baker was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1982.
Early life and education
Born in Pine River, Minnesota, Baker was raised in Portland, Oregon, and attended its Jefferson High School, where was a standout three-sport athlete. Baker was a three-year letter winner in basketball, and led the Democrats to the Portland Interscholastic League city championship their senior year. Baker was also a great baseball player; they lettered all four years and led Jefferson to the 1959 state championship.
Football was Baker's most dominant sport and they played quarterback and tailback for the Democrats. In their junior and senior seasons, the Democrats were 23–0 and won consecutive state championships. As a senior, they threw for 1,261 yards and ran for 438 yards.
College career
Baker played point guard on the Oregon State basketball team, and quarterback in football, but was a halfback as a sophomore in 1960. They threw for 3,476 yards and 23 touchdowns and rushing for 1503 yards and 15 touchdowns, and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering in 1963.
On November 27, 1962, Baker won the Heisman Trophy for their achievements during the 1962 season. They were the first player from a school west of Texas to win the award. In addition to winning the Heisman, they also won the Maxwell Award and the W. J. Voit Memorial Trophy in 1962, was a consensus first team All-American, was named as the Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year, was a Helms Foundation Award recipient and won 14 players of the year awards, including from AP, UPI and The Sporting News. They also played in the College All-Star Game in Chicago on August 2, 1963, the last time the collegiate stars defeated the reigning NFL champion.
Baker's 99-yard run in the first quarter against Villanova in the frigid Liberty Bowl (in Philadelphia in mid-December 1962), the only score in Oregon State's 6–0 victory, remains an NCAA record. Because plays from scrimmage can never start from the goal line, the record can never be broken, only tied.
Professional career
Baker was the first overall pick in the 1963 NFL Draft, taken by the Los Angeles Rams, They were also the ninetieth pick of the AFL draft in the twelfth round by the San Diego Chargers). The Rams had drafted Roman Gabriel in 1962 and had Zeke Bratkowski on the roster as well.
Before going into training camp with the Rams, they led the College All-Stars to victory in the Chicago College All-Star Game that matched them against the defending NFL champion (Green Bay Packers), the last time the college team would beat an NFL team before the game was discontinued in 1976. When Baker arrived in camp, they dazzled in the presentation of calling out signals and handing the ball out while doing soft throws for warm-up lobs. However, as camp went on, it was discovered that they did not have a strong arm to throw the ball hard more than a general lob, as their arm was used to rolling out to throw in college rather than throwing a straight pass from the pocket. The result was that while they could throw short passes capably, their attempts at long passes would turn into easy balls for interceptions due to low velocity. A game against the Detroit Lions saw them picked apart for three interceptions (one returned for a touchdown). They went 6-of-12 for 72 yards while rushing four times for 21 yards in a 23-2 loss. Four games later, they went 5-of-7 for 68 yards with one interception versus the Chicago Cardinals while running five times for 25 yards. These were their only two games where they served as a primary quarterback (aside from two games where they were sent to throw one pass). They scored their only touchdowns in their final season of 1965. They caught 8 passes for 82 yards against the Chicago Bears on September 26; they caught a ten-yard pass from Bill Munson in the fourth quarter that served as the go-ahead points in a 30-28 win. The next week against the Minnesota Vikings, Baker caught a 38-yard pass from Gabriel in the first quarter, but the Rams lost 38-35 while they caught four passes for 61 yards. They scored their last touchdown on October 17, 1965, rushing the ball one yard in their only carry against the San Francisco 49ers in a loss.
In total, Baker rushed 58 times for 210 yards in their career with thirty catches for 302 yards in three seasons with the Rams as quarterback-turned-halfback-turned-receiver before they were released in the summer of 1966. They went to the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League (CFL), while earning a J.D. at the University of Southern California Law School, studying at night during football and full-time in the offseason. A pulled muscle in the groin alongside a dispute about a contract while they tried to take the bar exam in Oregon led to the end of their career. They then returned to Portland where they were a founding partner at the law firm Tonkon Torp.
Later years
Baker was inducted into the State of Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1980, the College Football Hall of Fame in 1982 and the Oregon State University Sports Hall of Fame in 1988. Oregon State has retired their No. 11 football jersey, the only number retired by the football team.

The blue-and-black tanager (Tangara vassorii) is a species of bird in the tanager family Thraupidae. It is found in the Andes of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela, where it inhabits montane evergreen forest, dwarf forest, and secondary forest at elevations of . It inhabits the highest altitude of any Tangara species, and is the only species from the genus that is found near the tree line. Adults are long and weigh on average, and are mostly blue with black masks, wings, and tails. The species shows slight sexual dimorphism, with females being slightly duller than males.
The blue-and-black tanager feeds on fruit and arthropods, with the most favored fruit being Miconia. It forages in mixed-species flocks in pairs or groups of 3–6 individuals, especially with Iridosornis or Anisognathus. It breeds from February to August, making cup nests out of moss and rootlets. Begging young have been reported in January, while fledglings have been reported in May. The blue-and-black tanager is listed as being of the least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) on the IUCN Red List due to its large range, relative commonness, and lack of significant population declines, but is threatened by habitat destruction.
Taxonomy and systematics
The blue-and-black tanager was first described as Tanagra (Euphone?) vassorii by Auguste Boissonneau in 1840. The generic name Tangara comes from the Tupí word tangara, meaning dancer. The specific name vassorii is in honor of the French collector M. Vassor. Blue-and-black tanager is the official common name designated by the International Ornithologists' Union. Other names for the species include "blue and black tanager" and "blue-black tanager".
The blue-and-black tanager is one of 27 species in the genus Tangara. Within the genus, it is part of a species group with the spangle-cheeked tanager, green-naped tanager, and beryl-spangled tanager. In the group, it is sister to the clade formed by the other three species. This placement is supported by mitochondrial DNA evidence.
Subspecies
There are three recognized subspecies of the blue-and-black tanager. The subspecies are differentiated mostly by differences in plumage.
T. v. vassorii (Boissonneau, 1840): The nominate subspecies. It is found from southern Venezuela to northern Peru.
T. v. branickii (Taczanowski, 1882): Found from central Peru to Bolivia. It is similar to the nominate, but has a dull bluish green top and side of head, tinged with gray.
T. v. atrocoerulea (Tschudi, 1844): Also known as the spot-bellied tanager, it is found from the Andes of northern Peru to southern Amazonas and La Libertad. It can be distinguished by its lighter shade of blue, a yellowish, sometimes white, spot on the nape, and black streaking along its breast. It is considered to be a separate species by some authorities.
Description
The blue-and-black tanager is an average-sized species for its genus, with an mean length of and mass of . It shows slight sexual dimorphism, with females being slightly duller than males. Adult males are mainly cobalt blue with a black mask. The wing and tail feathers are black with blue edges. Subadults are mostly gray, but have black wings, tails, and lores. The bill is very short compared to other species of Tangara. The iris is brown, the bill is black, and the feet are wine gray.
The blue-and black tanager may be confused with the masked flowerpiercer, but can be distinguished its brown eye, more extensive black on the wing, and shorter and thicker bill. Populations of the subspecies atrocoerulea may also be confused with the golden-naped tanager, but can be distinguished by their blacker back and lack of cinnamon underparts.
Vocalizations
The blue-and-black tanager's calls include a thin, high-pitched tsit, a slightly lower swit, a repeated swit-swit-swit, and a hard SWIT-it. The song is 2–3 second long series of rhythmic, high-pitched notes that begin slow and then speed up into a zieeu-zie-zie-zizizizee trill, given every 15 seconds.
Distribution and habitat
The blue-and-black tanager is found in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela in the northern and central Andes, at elevations of . It inhabits the highest altitude of any Tangara species, and is the only species from the genus that is found near the tree line. It mostly inhabits montane evergreen forest, dwarf forest, and secondary forest. It also inhabits forest edges, vegetation in clearings, and patches of growth near the tree line. It generally stays in the canopy.
Behavior and ecology
The blue-and-black tanager joins large mixed-species flocks while foraging, most often in pairs or groups of 3–6 individuals. Mixed-species flocks can contain up 15 blue-and-black tanagers, and they have been reported as being the nuclear species (species that helps form and maintain a mixed-species flock) in Colombia. It is found more often with Iridosornis or Anisognathus species than other Tangara.
Diet
The blue-and-black tanager feeds on fruit and arthropods, especially fruit from plants in the genus Miconia. It is an active forager that moves through foliage constantly. It forages in all strata, but favors the canopy. Foraging for arthropods occurs by hopping on moss-covered branches and inspecting areas such as the undersides of branches, leaves, moss, and small bromeliads. The species feeds on fruit by reaching out and grabbing them quickly, after which they feed on them while sitting upright.
Breeding
The blue-and-black tanager breeds from February to August. It makes cup nests out of moss and rootlets, lined on the outside with Chusquea bamboo leaves and on the inside with fibers and animal hair. Nests have been recorded in May and June, and are wide and tall on the outside and wide and deep on the inside. Nests have been recorded at heights of above the ground on small trees. Eggs are laid in clutches of two, and are pale blue with cinnamon splotching. They measure and weigh . Begging young have been reported in January, while fledglings have been reported in May.
Status
The blue-and-black tanager is listed as being of the least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) on the IUCN Red List due to its large range, relative commonness, and lack of significant population declines. The subspecies atrocoerulea, which is considered a distinct species by the IUCN, is also listed as least concern for the above reasons. However, the species is threatened by habitat destruction that is reducing its population.

Skindive are an Irish electronic rock band formed in the late 1990s in Dublin. The band incorporates electronic sounds into often harsh and atmospheric music and comparisons are often drawn to the band Garbage because of the juxtaposition of heavily distorted guitars and clean female vocals.
Formation
Skindive was formed in 1999 by Gerry Owens. Owens had previously been living in London playing with a series of groups which met with little or no success. Once returning to Dublin, Owens began working on writing their own music which eventually formed into the creation of the band.
Owens found their bassist (Alan Lee) and drummer (Ger Farrell) during the first four months of recruiting but found it tougher to pick the right voice to go with their music and lyrics. After much auditioning, Owens got a recommendation to try out Danielle Harrison who was living in Los Angeles at the time. Inevitably, Danielle was the voice Owens was searching for and they moved to Dublin to join them. Gerry Owens said on creating the band:
"I've been in several bands at this stage, and they all implode because of the personalities involved. It was very important to me to think in the long-term for Skindive. It took a long time to put the right people together."
Over the next year, the newly formed Skindive, would play gigs in and around Dublin and perfect their stage performance. During this time, the band journeyed to America in pursuit of a record deal with Chris Blackwell's Palm Records. After Blackwell had heard the band's demo, they traveled to Ireland to watch them in concert. They immediately signed the band to Palm Records and they began working on recording their first album entitled Skindive.
Debut album
Skindive first recorded and released the Tranquilizer EP in January, 2001 followed by their eponymous debut album released in February, 2001 on Palm Records. Owens took on most of the production and recording themselves along with Adrian Sherwood (Nine-Inch Nails, Sinéad O'Connor) and Alan Branch co-producing a number of tracks. The Album was mixed and mastered by Dave 'Rave' Ogilvie (Marilyn Manson, Nine-Inch Nails, Skinny Puppy) in Vancouver.
After the release of Skindive, the band went on tour in Ireland and the UK playing concerts such as Ozzfest and supporting Snow Patrol.
Follow up and break up
In 2002, after touring, the band suddenly found themselves lacking support from Palm Records. Danielle has said in an interview with Cluas.com:
"One by one it seemed all of the people who had been championing us left the company until we were left on our own. And with them in New York and us over here it was very difficult to keep things moving."
In the end, the band asked Palm Records to release them from their contract which happened successfully. During this period, Skindive was close to breaking up but Gerry Owens and Danielle continued to write new music.
Eventually the band signed to the independent label AlphaMale Recordings, prepared for their follow-up album entitled Falling Down and releasing a single called Precious'' (which received regular air play on Pet Sounds, Today FM). One month after releasing the album in September, 2003, the band decided to break up for reasons unknown.
Gerry Owens has since gone on to write and produce for their new project 'Lluther' whose live band included ex-Skindive drummer Ger Farrell.

Willie Williams (September 12, 1931 – February 27, 2019) was an American sprinter who set the 100 metres world record in 1956 with a new time of 10.1s, one-tenth of a second faster than the record held jointly by 8 men.
Biography
Williams grew up in Gary, Indiana, attending Roosevelt High School where they played football and was first in the state in the 100m as a senior. They attended the University of Illinois, from which they gained a degree in physical education. They were in the U.S. army in special services when they broke the world record at the International Military Track Meet in West Berlin in August 1956. They left the army later that year, and became athletics director at Ogden Park, Chicago, before teaching and coaching sports in their home town. They became head track coach at West Side High School, then in 1982 returned to the University of Illinois to coach track. Although they trained the Saudi Arabian Olympic track team in the summer of 1988 for the Seoul Olympics, they declined the opportunity to move to Saudi Arabia and stayed with Illinois, becoming associate head coach in 1997 before retiring in 2000.
They resided in Urbana, Illinois. Williams died on February 27, 2019, at the age of 87.

In the kingdom of England, a feudal barony or barony by tenure was the highest degree of feudal land tenure, namely per baroniam (Latin for "by barony"), under which the land-holder owed the service of being one of the king's barons. The duties owed by and the privileges granted to feudal barons are not exactly defined, but they involved the duty of providing soldiers to the royal feudal army on demand by the king, and the privilege of attendance at the king's feudal court, the precursor of parliament.
If the estate-in-land held by barony contained a significant castle as its caput baroniae and if it was especially large – consisting of more than about 20 knight's fees (each loosely equivalent to a manor) – then it was termed an honour. The typical honour had properties scattered over several shires, intermingled with the properties of others. This was a specific policy of the Norman kings, to avoid establishing any one area under the control of a single lord. Usually, though, a more concentrated cluster existed somewhere. Here would lie the caput (head) of the honour, with a castle that gave its name to the honour and served as its administrative headquarters. The term honour is particularly useful for the eleventh and twelfth centuries, before the development of an extensive peerage hierarchy.
This type of barony is different from the type of feudal barony which existed within a county palatine. A county palatine was an independent franchise so its baronies were considered the highest rank of feudal tenure in the county and not the kingdom, such as the barony of Halton within the Palatinate of Chester.
Creation
William the Conqueror established their favoured followers as barons by enfeoffing them as tenants-in-chief with great fiefdoms to be held per baroniam, a largely standard feudal contract of tenure, common to all their barons. Such barons were not necessarily always from the greater Norman nobles, but were selected often on account of their personal abilities and usefulness. Thus, for instance, Turstin FitzRolf, the relatively humble and obscure knight who had stepped in at the last minute to accept the position of Duke William's standard-bearer at the Battle of Hastings, was granted a barony which comprised well over twenty manors.
Lands forming a barony were often located in several different counties, not necessarily adjoining. The name of such a barony is generally deemed to be the name of the chief manor within it, known as the Caput, Latin for "head", generally assumed to have been the seat or chief residence of the first baron. So, for instance, the barony of Turstin FitzRolf became known as the barony of North Cadbury, Somerset.
The exact date of creation of most feudal baronies cannot be determined, as their founding charters have been lost. Many of them are first recorded in the Domesday Book survey of 1086.
Servitium debitum
The feudal obligation imposed by the grant of a barony was termed in Latin the servitium debitum or "service owed" and was set as a quota of knights to be provided for the king's service. It bore no constant relation to the amount of land comprised by the barony, but was fixed by a bargain between the king and the baron.
It was at the discretion of the baron as to how these knights were found. The commonest method was for them to split their barony into several fiefs of between a few hundred acres possibly up to a thousand acres each, into each of which they would sub-enfeoff one knight, by the tenure of knight-service. This tenure gave the knight use of the fief and all its revenues, on condition that they should provide to the baron, now their overlord, 40 days of military service, complete with retinue of esquires, horses and armour. The fief so allotted is known as a knight's fee. Alternatively the baron could keep the entire barony, or a part of it, in demesne, that is to say "in-hand" or under their own management, using the revenues it produced to buy the services of mercenary knights known as "stipendiary knights".
Under- and over-enfeoffment
Where a baron had sub-enfeoffed fewer knights than required by the servitium debitum, the barony was said to be "under-enfeoffed", and the balance of knights owing had to be produced super dominium, that is "on the demesne". This does not mean they were resident within the baron's demesne, but that they had to be hired with the revenue arising from it.
Conversely, a barony was "over-enfeoffed" where more knights had been enfeoffed than was required by the servitium debitum, and this indicated that the barony had been obtained on overly-favourable terms.
Cartae Baronum
The Cartae Baronum ("Charters of the Barons") was a survey commissioned by the Treasury in 1166. It required each baron to declare how many knights they had enfeoffed and how many were super dominium, with the names of all. It appears that the survey was designed to identify baronies from which a greater servitium debitum could in future be obtained by the king. An example is given from the return of Lambert of Etocquigny:
To their reverend lord, Henry, king of the English, Lambert of Etocquigny, greeting. Know that I hold from you by your favour 16 carucates of land and 2 bovates by the service of 10 knights. In these 16 carucates of land I have 5 knights enfeoffed by the old enfeoffment:
Richard de Haia holds 1 knight's fee; and they withheld the service which they owe to you and to me from the day of your coronation up to now, except that they paid me 2 marks.
Odo de Cranesbi holds 1 knight's fee.
Thomas, son of William, holds 1 knight's fee.
Roger de Millers holds 2 knight's fees.
And from my demesne I provide the balance of the service I owe you, to wit, that of 5 knights. And from that demesne I have given Robert de Portemort of 1 knight's fee. Therefore I pray you that you will send me your judgement concerning Richard de Haia who holds back the service of their fee, because I cannot obtain that service except by your order. This is the total service in the aforesaid 16 carucates of land. Farewell.
Summons to Parliament
The privilege which balanced the burden of the servitium debitum was the baron's right to attend the king's council. Originally all barons who held per baroniam received individual writs of summons to attend Parliament. This was a practical measure because the early kings almost continually travelled around the kingdom, taking their court (i.e. administration) with them.
A king only called a parliament, or council, when the need arose either for advice or funding. This lack of a parliamentary schedule meant that the barons needed to be informed when and where to attend. As baronies became fragmented over time due to failure of male heirs and descent via co-heiresses (see below), many of those who held per baroniam became holders of relatively small fiefdoms. Eventually, the king refused to summon such minor nobles to Parliament by personal writ, sending instead a general writ of summons to the sheriff of each shire, who was to summon only representatives of these so-called lesser barons. The greater barons, who retained sufficient power to insist upon it, continued to receive personal summonses. The king came to realise, from the complacency of the lesser barons with this new procedure, that in practice it was not tenure per baroniam which determined attendance at Parliament, but receipt of a writ of summons originated by himself.
The next logical development was that the king started issuing writs to persons who did not hold per baroniam and who were not therefore feudal barons, but "barons by writ". The reason for summoning by writ was based on personal characteristics, for example the man summoned might be one of exceptional judgement or have valuable military skills. The arbitrary summons by personal writ signalled the start of the decline of feudalism, eventually evolving into summons by public proclamation in the form of letters patent.
Deemed feudal barons
The higher prelates such as archbishops and bishops were deemed to hold per baroniam, and were thus members of the baronage entitled to attend Parliament, indeed they formed the greatest grouping of all. Marcher lords in Wales often held their lordships by right of conquest and appear to have been deemed feudal barons. The Barons of the Cinque Ports were also deemed feudal barons by virtue of their military service at sea, and were thus entitled to attend Parliament.
Baronial relief
Baronial relief was payable by an heir so that they might lawfully take possession of their inheritance. It was a form of one-off taxation, or more accurately a variety of "feudal incident", levyable by the King on their tenants-in-chief for a variety of reasons. A prospective heir to a barony generally paid £100 in baronial relief for their inheritance. The term "relief" implies "elevation", both words being derived from the Latin levo, to raise up, into a position of honour.
Where a barony was split into two, for example on the death of a baron leaving two co-heiresses, each daughter's husband would become a baron in respect of their moiety (mediaeval French for "half"), paying half of the full baronial relief. A tenant-in-chief could be the lord of fractions of several different baronies, if they or their ancestors had married co-heiresses. The tenure of even the smallest fraction of a barony conferred baronial status on the lord of these lands. This natural fragmentation of the baronies led to great difficulties within the royal administration as the king relied on an ever-increasing number of men responsible for supplying soldiers for the royal army, and the records of the identities of these fractional barons became more complex and unreliable. The early English jurist Henry de Bracton (died 1268) was one of the first writers to examine the concept of the feudal barony.
Abolition and surviving vestiges
The power of the feudal barons to control their landholding was considerably weakened in 1290 by the statute of Quia Emptores. This prohibited land from being the subject of a feudal grant, and allowed its transfer without the feudal lord's permission.
Feudal baronies became perhaps obsolete (but not extinct) on the abolition of feudal tenure during the Civil War, as confirmed by the Tenures Abolition Act 1660 passed under the Restoration which took away knights service and other legal rights.
Under the Tenures Abolition Act 1660, many baronies by tenure were converted into baronies by writ. The rest ceased to exist as feudal baronies by tenure, becoming baronies in free socage, that is to say under a "free" (hereditable) contract requiring payment of monetary rents. Thus baronies could no longer be held by military service. Parliamentary titles of honour had been limited since the 15th century by the Modus Tenenda Parliamenta act, and could thenceforth only be created by writ of summons or letters patent.
Tenure by knight-service was abolished and discharged and the lands covered by such tenures, including once-feudal baronies, were henceforth held by socage (i.e. in exchange for monetary rents). The English Fitzwalter Case in 1670 ruled that barony by tenure had been discontinued for many years and any claims to a peerage on such basis, meaning a right to sit in the House of Lords, were not to be revived, nor any right of succession based on them. In the Berkeley Case in 1861, an attempt was made to claim a seat in the House of Lords by right of a barony by tenure, but the House of Lords ruled that whatever might have been the case in the past, baronies by tenure no longer existed, meaning that a barony could not be held "by tenure", and confirmed the Tenures Abolition Act 1660. Three Redesdale Committee Reports in the early 19th century reached the same conclusion.
There has been at least one legal opinion which asserts the continuing legal existence of the feudal barony in England and Wales, namely that from 1996 of A W & C Barsby, Barristers of Grays's Inn.
Geographical survivals
Survivals of feudal baronies, in their geographical form, are the Barony of Westmorland or Appleby, the Barony of Kendal, the Barony of Arundel and the Barony of Abergavenny. The first two terms now describe areas of the historic county of Westmorland, in the same way that the word "county" itself has lost its feudal meaning of a land area under the control of a count or earl.
Lists
Ivor J. Sanders searched the archives, for example Exchequer documents such as fine rolls and pipe rolls, for entries recording the payment of baronial relief and published their results in English Baronies, a Study of their Origin and Descent 1086–1327 (Oxford, 1960). They identified a number of certain baronies where evidence was found of payment of baronial relief, and a further group which they termed "probable baronies" where the evidence was less clear. Where they could not identify a caput, Sanders named the barony after the name of the baron, for example the "Barony of Miles of Gloucester". The following lists include all of Sanders' certain and probable baronies.

National Cycle Network (NCN) Route 141 is a Sustrans Regional Route. It is long. It provides a connection between Route 14 and Route 72 along the south bank of the River Tyne through Gateshead. The full length of the route is part of the Keelmans Way. It is fully signed and open; however, the section between Wylam and Ryton Golf Course is currently closed due to a landslip.
Route
NCN 141 starts at National Cycle Route 72, in Wylam on the north bank of the River Tyne. It crosses the river on Wylam Bridge before heading east via an off road route along the south bank of the Tyne. It passes Tyneside Golf Club, Ryton Willows and Blaydon before reaching its eastern trailhead at Derwenthaugh (in Swalwell) where it meets National Cycle Route 14.
The eastern end of the route was opened in 2012 so cyclists could avoid having to cross the busy Newburn Bridge to reach route 72. There are public artworks as the route passes the site of the Blaydon racecourse.
2021 Closure
The route is closed between Wylam and Ryton due to a landslip that occurred in February 2021. A diversion route is being devised but has not yet been agreed.

Country and West is a studio album by American country music artist Dottie West. It was released in May 1970 on RCA Victor Records and was produced by Danny Davis. Them fourteenth studio album, Country and West spawned one single that became a minor hit on the national publication charts in 1970. It was also one of three studio albums West would release in 1970.
Background and content
Country and West was recorded at RCA Studio B in February 1970. The sessions were produced by Danny Davis and was West's second studio album to be fully produced by him. Davis had also written the liner notes for the project. "Being their producer for recordings I am probably more critical of what they sing than any of their listeners, and to me they are 'something wonderful'," they commented. The album was a collection of 11 tracks. Some of the songs were recordings while others were cover versions. Country and West included cover versions of Merle Haggard's "Today I Started Loving You Again", Tammy Wynette's "I Stayed Long Enough", Dolly Parton's "As Long as I Love You" and Ernest Tubb's "Tomorrow Never Comes". It was one of West's few RCA studio releases to not include a self-penned track. West's songwriting collaborator, Red Lane, did contribute to composing the single "It's Dawned on Me You're Gone".
Release and reception
Country and West was released in May 1970 on RCA Victor Records, becoming their fourteenth studio recording. It was issued on a vinyl LP, featuring six songs on "side one" and five songs on "side two" of the record. The album did not reach any peak positions on the Billboard charts following its release. However, it did spawn one single. Spending ten weeks on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart, "It's Dawned on Me You're Gone" would peak at number 37 in September 1970. Following its release, the project was reviewed favorably by Billboard magazine. In their June 1970 issue, writers called the album "a powerful package", praising West's vocals and Davis' production. "The vocalist has a style which radiates individuality and warmth and they are excellently produced by Danny Davis," writers commented.

Patrick Karhan (born 19 June 2003) is a Slovak footballer who plays for Spartak Trnava as a midfielder.
Club career
Spartak Trnava
Karhan made their Fortuna Liga debut for Spartak Trnava in a home fixture at Štadión Antona Malatinského on 2 May 2021 in a traditional derby against Slovan Bratislava. They came on in the 86th minute to replace Martin Bukata with the score set at 3-0, following a two penaltiy goals by Milan Ristovski and a second-half strike by Bamidele Yusuf. Less than two minutes into their debut, Karhan was involved in an in-play incident with Bulgarian international Vasil Bozhikov during an attempt to header the ball. Karhan had struck Bozhikov, who suffered an injury and had to be taken off the pitch. Subsequently, Erik Gemzický had awarded Karhan with a red card. This foul was judged as a youthful over-motivation or inexperienced misjudgment after the match by the media. The result meant that Slovan was denied the opportunity to celebrate title retention.
In June 2022, Karhan signed their first professional contract with Spartak along with Marek Ujlaky, whose father Marek played over 400 matches for Spartak and collected caps for Slovakia. Both players were to succeed their fathers in their careers and serve as a motivation for other Academy players of Spartak Trnava, according to club President Peter Macho.
Personal life
Karhan was born in Wolfsburg, Germany. Karhan is the son of Miroslav Karhan, who managed Spartak Trnava and played over 200 matches for them, featured in over 280 matches in the Bundesliga, while playing for Wolfsburg and Mainz 05 and was the first player to collect 100 caps for the Slovak national team (107 in total), holding the record for the most capped player until it was beaten by Marek Hamšík in 2018. They also have a younger brother named Alex Thomas.
They studied high school at a sports gymnasium in Trnava.

Haywood is an unincorporated community in southeastern Chatham County, North Carolina, United States. It is part of the Moncure census-designated place. Along with several other unincorporated communities, it lies along the panhandle of Chatham County between Lee County and Wake County. Haywood lies at an elevation of .
History
Haywood was settled in 1796 at the confluence of the Deep and Haw rivers, which marks the beginning of the Cape Fear River. Before it was settled, Haywood was one of the sites considered in 1788 as a possible location for North Carolina's new capital, although Raleigh was ultimately chosen. Not only did the town lose the opportunity of hosting the state capital, in 1792 Haywood was also passed up as the location for what would become the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. During its first four years after settlement, the community was renamed twice, from Lyons to Haywoodsborough to Haywood.
The new town pinned its hopes on the shipping industry, as Haywood's location at the confluence of two rivers was suitable for an inland port. The state government gave the Cape Fear Navigation Company the right to build and operate locks on the Cape Fear River. The rivers, however, proved difficult to navigate, and by 1834 the company had lost interest in improving the river above Fayetteville. In 1852, the Cape Fear Navigation Company formally abrogated its rights to that section to the newly formed Cape Fear and Deep River Navigation Company. The Deep River Company was troubled financially and never developed a port for Haywood. The final blow to the shipping industry came with the completion of the railroad. Haywood made a critical mistake by denying trains access to the town; consequently, the railroad station would be located in Moncure, to the west.
Haywood reached its economic peak in the period before the Civil War. Reconstruction briefly brought about a racially integrated election in 1870 as well as integrated political meetings. The 20th century was marked by economic decline and the dissolution of the local government.
The Obediah Farrar House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.

Woolmer Hill School, formerly Woolmer Hill Technology College, is the main secondary school in the area of Haslemere, Surrey.
Funding
A non-fee paying school, WHS's funding is received predominantly via pro rata Education Funding Agency annual allocation from general taxation. Since 1989 the school has benefited from the Woolmer Hill School Friends Association, a Charities Commission registered fund raised by parents and fundraising across the region. Funds are enhanced by successful registration or selection for pupil premiums and grants restricted to central and local government-funded schools. Free school meals eligibility: 5.6% (band: low).

Kholosi is an Indo-Aryan language spoken in two villages in southern Iran that was first described in 2008. At its current status, the language is considered endangered. In 2008, it was only spoken in the neighboring villages of Kholus and Gotav. As it is located on the Iranian Plateau and surrounded by Iranian languages, it draws heavily from them.
Classification
Kholosi is definitively known to be an Indo-Aryan language albeit with significant lexical borrowing from Iranian languages given its geographical location. At the lexical level, it seems to share vocabulary largely with the Sindhi languages, which are the source of other Indo-Aryan migrations to the Middle East such as Luwati in Oman.
Phonology
While no published phonology has been found on Kholosi, the following phonology has been constructed from examples provided in the sources below.
Kholosi also contains the diphthongs /ɑi, ɑw, ow/ and possibly others.
Note*: The phonemes marked with an asterisk are assumed based on the structure of the attested phonemes.
Grammar
Anonby and Bahmani (2013) made some brief notes on Kholosi grammar, but so far no grammatical sketch nor a full grammar of the language has been documented.
Morphology
Nouns and noun phrases
Nouns have inherent grammatical gender, and adjectives agree in gender with the head noun. Attributive adjectives follow the head noun, unlike other Indo-Aryan languages. Numerals precede the head noun.
Verbs and verb phrases
Kholosi uses several light verbs to form noun-verb compounds. This is a common feature of Indo-Iranian languages.
The adverb precedes the verb it modifies.
Case and adpositions
Kholosi has noun-suffixed postpositions (e.g. the genitive marker -jo which agrees with the gender of the possessor) as characteristic of Indo-Aryan languages.
Syntax
Kholosi is a verb-final language with SOV word order.
Vocabulary
Kholosi has roughly twice the number of Indo-Aryan terms in its basic lexicon than Iranian borrowings. The primary source of Iranian borrowings is Persian, but Larestani and Bandari (in the same geographical area) also appear to have contributed vocabulary.

"My Heart Would Know" is a song written and recorded by Hank Williams. It was released as the B-side to "Hey Good Lookin'" in June 1951 on MGM Records.
Background
Williams recorded "My Heart Would Know" on March 16, 1951 at Castle Studio in Nashville with Fred Rose producing. They were backed on the session by members of their Drifting Cowboys band, including Jerry Rivers (fiddle), Don Helms (steel guitar), Sammy Pruett (electric guitar), Jack Shook (rhythm guitar), Ernie Newton or "Cedric Rainwater," aka Howard Watts (bass), and either Owen Bradley or Rose on piano.
The song's subject manner is similar to "I Can't Help It (If I'm Still in Love with You)" (which was recorded at the same session) in that the narrator admits that they are still madly in love with a woman who no longer loves him. The song begins with an impossibly high steel guitar lick played by Don Helms, which became one of the hallmarks of the Hank Williams sound courtesy of Fred Rose:
They gave Don Helms the golden rule for accompanying Hank. "Fred said it was useless for me and Hank to be in the same register," said Helms. "He said, 'When Hank is singing something low why don't you play high, and if he's singing high, you play something low,' so the steel was always in a different register."
The song became well known due to the success of the "Hey Good Lookin'" single, which became Williams' sixth number one country hit.
The song later appeared in Disney-Pixar's Cars when McQueen was chased by Sheriff on the way to Radiator Springs.
Cover versions
Joni James covered the song for their 1959 MGM album Sings Songs of Hank Williams.
Hank Williams, Jr. recorded the song as a duet with Lois Johnson.
Charlie Rich released a version of the song in 1967.
Don Gibson recorded the song for their 1971 LP Hank Williams as Sung by Don Gibson.
A version by Merle Haggard appears on the box set Hag: The Studio Recordings 1969-1976.
The The recorded the song for their Williams tribute LP Hanky Panky.

The 1975 Royal Tru-Orange season was the maiden season of the franchise in the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA).
First Conference standings
Summary
The Royal Tru-Orangemen were among the top four teams which made it to semifinal round in the PBA's very first conference. They lost all their six games in the two-round semifinals and placed fourth behind champion Toyota, runner-up Crispa, and third place U-Tex. In the second conference, Royal had a pair of Harry Brown and Steve Smith as their imports. The Orangemen were in their second semifinal stint and this time, they won two out of their six assignments, not enough to make it even in a playoff berth. Royal played Noritake in the best-of-five series for third place and after winning Game One, 125-122, the Orangemen lost the next two games and with Crispa forfeiting Game four of the finals against Toyota, the Orangemen ended up fourth place again. They completed a fourth place finish in all three conferences of the season as the Orangemen, despite beating U-Tex in the round-robin All-Philippine championship, they lost to U-Tex in five games in their series for third place.

Filmography
Recognition
Sify stated of Ashta Chamma, that it was a "complete family entertainer" inspired from the works of Oscar Wilde and that it "is fun to watch due to the cute subject". They expanded that it was a "completely dialogue-based comedy coupled with good performances, music, and lyrics, keeping audience through the twists nevertheless. The first half is more enjoyable than the second half that has numerous twists." Concurring, GreatAndhra wrote that the film's theme was silly, but dealt with hilariously. The film's music received special mention, in that with the song Aadinchi Astachemma Odinchavamma "composition and lyrical value is interesting and captivating", and the song Hello Antoo Pilichi was "purposefully taken in old style."
Rediff Movies stated that based upon the novel The Men Within by Harimohan Paruvu, the film Golconda High School is brilliant, and India Glitz praised the film, calling it "inspirational".
Of Uyyala Jampala, The Deccan Chronicle wrote that while "a predictable love story" it was "narrated well." Both written and produced by Ram Mohan P, it was stated that the film "is an earnest love story without unnecessary embellishments. There are no big action scenes, no vulgar dialogues, no unpredictable twists and turns; the story, told in flashback, unfolds simply." It was concluded "All in all, the movie impresses despite having a predictable plot with good dialogues, a reasonable length — thanks to clever editing — and amazing cinematography. A much better fare than your staple masala flick – go for it." The Hindu made note that for a low-budget film it compared well with large-budget efforts, and released during the Christmas season, it resonated well with viewers, and International Business Times shared numerous positive reviews of the film and wrote that overall it was a "breezy love story worth watching".
Personal life
Their brother Harimohan Paruvu is an English writer.

Most influential piano professors in Taiwan today can trace their roots back to their teachings. They died in Taipei in 1986.
Life
Genealogy
Robert Scholz was born in Steyr, Austria, on 16 October 1902. Their father, Karl Scholz, was a store manager, their mother, Johanna Mayr, a soprano who met and corresponded with Anton Bruckner. Their elder brother, the pianist Heinz Scholz (1897-1988), was president of the Mozarteum Salzburg in 1964. Some genealogical research of the Scholz family from 1750 until the present time has been undertaken by the composer Martin Fiala in Steyr.
Early Years in Austria
Scholz received their first piano lessons from their mother in 1906 but failed to find a more professional piano teacher in Steyr during the war years. Together with their brother Heinz they participated in charity concerts to raise funds for the Red Cross and to help the wounded. They graduated from highschool ("Realschule") in 1920. In 1921 they took about ten piano lessons with Austrian pianist Friedrich Wührer in Vienna, each time traveling 16 hours from Steyr, and was later admitted to the Mozarteum in Salzburg where they studied with Felix Petyrek. After only ten lessons Scholz returned to Steyr studying without a teacher. Just nine months after they entered it, Scholz passed the Mozarteum's final exams in piano and composition with distinction ("mit Auszeichnung") and also received a teaching certificate. Subsequently they taught piano and composition at the Mozarteum from 1924-1937. In 1935 they even became the first teacher for harpsichord at an Austrian music college.
Robert and Heinz Scholz had a distinguished career as a piano duo which began with a European tour in 1923. They performed concertos for two pianos by Mozart, Robert Scholz themselves and others with world famous conductors such as Clemens Krauss, Dimitri Mitropoulos in Athens, Herbert von Karajan in Aachen, Bruno Walter and Arturo Toscanini at the Salzburg Festival. During their tours till 1938, including tours in the US and Canada, they often performed a two-piano arrangement of Bach's The Art of Fugue by Erich Schwebsch. In 1937, the year when Robert Scholz received an Honorary professorship, they gave a recital on Mozart's original piano at Salzburg Residenz, a concert which was attended by Walter and Toscanini. In 1927 the Viennese Universal Edition commissioned the Scholz brothers to edit Mozart's piano works based on their manuscripts.
America
In 1938 Robert Scholz emigrated to the US settling in New York where they began to teach at the David Mannes Music School. During the same time they started teaching the eight-year old Martin Canin, who was to become a famous piano teacher and performer. The idea of Scholz was to bring Salzburg's music tradition to New York. Collaborating with violinists Ivan Galamian and Louis Persinger as well as pianist Isabelle Vengerova they founded a Mozart orchestra and later a chorus at the Music School of the Henry Street Settlement, a project that was intended to foster talented children from underprivileged backgrounds. Between 1945 and 1950 this orchestra and chorus performed annual concerts at New York Town Hall. Scholz, who took conducting lessons with George Szell in 1940 and taught in summer-camps together with Ivan Galamian, also collaborated with Bruno Walter and their orchestra.
Robert Scholz composed large-scale works during this period and arranged Bach's The Art of Fugue for orchestra. Having performed Bruckner's Fourth Symphony and Te Deum with the Mozart orchestra and chorus of the Henry Street Settlement they were presented with the Bruckner Medal of Honor on 12 March 1950 by the Bruckner Society of America. In 1953 Robert Scholz founded the professional American Chamber Orchestra with which they regularly appeared at New York Town Hall and toured the US and Canada. In 1956 they recorded various works by Mozart with this orchestra for Westminster Records, among others the Haffner Serenade and also recorded Mozart piano concertos with Dame Myra Hess.
Late Years in Taiwan
In 1963, through the recommendation of the US State Department and the Fulbright Program, Robert Scholz was invited to Taiwan where they would live until their death in 1986. They accepted a professorship for piano and chorus at Taiwan Provincial Teachers' College (now National Taiwan Normal University). They also taught at the National Academy of Arts (now National Taiwan University of Arts) and later at the College of Chinese Culture ("Hwa Kang", now Chinese Culture University). Besides piano, which they also taught privately, Scholz taught conducting, chorus conducting, composition, theory and vocal accompaniment. Seminaries were arranged by the United States Information Service. Taiwanese composer has called Robert Scholz a "missionary of music" and compared them to the French Jesuit missionary Amiot in Qing China.
Unlike in New York Scholz did not found an orchestra in Taiwan, but served as a principal and guest conductor of all leading local orchestras, especially the Taiwan Provincial Symphony Orchestra (now National Taiwan Symphony Orchestra), the Ministry of Defense Symphony Orchestra, but also school orchestras, building a foundation for their rehearsal methods, repertoire expansion, etc. Hsu Tsang-Houei wrote that Scholz "laid the foundation stone of orchestra culture in Taiwan". During their time in Taiwan they conducted numerous concerts and gala concerts collaborating with most leading local performers, such as pianists Francis Wu, Azusa Fujita and Liu Fu-Mei.
In 1969 Robert Scholz married Emane Wu (吳漪曼, Wu Yi-Man, 1931-2019), a well-known pianist and professor in Taiwan. Them father, Wu Bochao (吳伯超), was a famous Chinese composer who perished in the Taiping Steamer's voyage to Taiwan, 1949, while fleeing advancing Chinese Communist forces during the Chinese Civil War. Scholz later conducted their works. In 1970 Robert Scholz conducted the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra and accepted a professorship at Musashino Academy of Music whose orchestra and chorus they led as well. They returned to Taiwan in 1971. In 1973 they also appeared as a guest conductor in Seoul.
During the last years of their life Robert Scholz became interested in philosophical studies. Their writings were compiled by Bernhard Fuehrer and Bernhard Pohl and posthumously published by the Robert Scholz Music Foundation as "Posthumous Works of Robert Scholz", in 8 volumes, 1993. On October 11, 1986, Robert Scholz died at the National Taiwan University Hospital in Taipei.
Teaching
As a piano teacher Robert Scholz emphasized controlled breathing and watched the harmonious movement of the student's arm and body. They also insisted on notating phrasing, pedal marks and fingering in the score before the student learned the piece. Many students of Professor Scholz left Taiwan on a program organized by Taiwan's Ministry of Education as "gifted children" ("資賦優異天才兒童") before their sixteenth birthday to study in Austria or other countries and many of them are pianists today or leading professors in Taiwan and abroad, among others Tai-Cheng Chen, Se-Se Chang, Lucy Revers, Judy Chin, Han-An Liu, Lina Yeh, Lee-Hwei Wang. Conductors who studied with Professor Scholz include Felix Chen and Dau-Hsiong Tseng and composers Tyzen Hsiao.
Works
Most important compositions and writings of Robert Scholz were published by the Robert Scholz Music Foundation and the R.O.C. National Committee of the Asian Composers League. Their personal book collection and annotated musical scores were donated to the National Central Library by Emane Wu. These include personally annotated musical scores dating back to 1938, a 10-volume set of selected works, manuscripts on the thought of Prof. Scholz, musical recordings, and materials on the professor's musical theory, biography, literature and lyrics.

The Oradea ghetto was one of the Nazi-era ghettos for European Jews during World War II. It was located in the city of Oradea () in Bihor County, Transylvania, now part of Romania but administered as part of Bihar County by the Kingdom of Hungary from the 1940 Second Vienna Award's grant of Northern Transylvania until late 1944. The ghetto was active in the spring of 1944, following Operation Margarethe.
History
Aside from the Budapest ghetto, this was the largest ghetto in Hungary. There were in fact two ghettoes in the city. The first, for Oradea's Jews, numbered 27,000 inhabitants and was situated near the Orthodox synagogue and the Great Square. The second contained nearly 8,000 Jews from the many rural communities of a dozen districts: Aleșd, Berettyóújfalu, Biharkeresztes, Cefa, Derecske, Marghita, Oradea, Săcueni, Sălard, Salonta, Sárrétudvari and Valea lui Mihai. Many Jews from these communities were also placed around the Mezey lumberyard.
The ghetto was strikingly overpopulated. The Oradea Jews, who formed 30% of the city's population, were crowded into an area sufficient for one-fifteenth of the city. Conditions were such that one room had to shelter fourteen or fifteen Jews. As in other ghettoes, Oradea's suffered from a lack of food and drink. The local authorities, unusually vehement in their anti-Semitism, created victims with their punitive measures. They often interrupted the flow of electricity and water to the ghetto. Furthermore, the gendarmes, commanded by lieutenant-colonel Jenő Péterffy, were especially sadistic in their searches for valuables, which took place right by the ghetto in the Dréher brewery. Internal administration took place under the auspices of a Judenrat headed by Sándor Leitner, leader of the local Orthodox Jewish community. In the spring of 1944 the ghetto was evacuated in nine transports, the first two from the lumberyard and the remainder from the city: May 23 (3,110), May 25 (3,148), May 28 (3,227), May 29 (3,166), May 30 (3,187), June 1 (3,059), June 3 (2,972), June 5 (2,527), June 27 (2,819). Thus, with 6,258 Jews in the first category and 20,957 in the second, a total of 27,215 Jews were sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp.
The June 27 transport involved Jews from the part of Bihar County that remained in Hungary following the Treaty of Trianon. Coming from small communities south and southeast of Debrecen, such as Derecske and Konyár, they were brought to Oradea on June 16–17. Thus, while the ghetto was originally part of the Cluj military district, it was transferred to the Debrecen district during the period when this last group of deportees lived there.

John Zenevisi or Gjon Zenebishi ( or Gjin Zenebishi; died 1418) was an Albanian magnate that held the estates in Epirus, such as Argyrokastro (Gjirokastër) and Vagenetia.
Name
Zenevisi can be found with different spellings in historical documents. Their name in modern English is usually John Zenevisi or John Sarbissa. In Italian, their name was spelled as Giovanni Sarbissa. In Albanian, their name is mostly spelled as Gjin Zenebishi (less commonly as Zenebishti), their given name scarcely spelled Gjon, as well. In Serbian their name is spelled like Jovan Zenović.
Life
The Zenevisi family was from the Zagoria region, between Përmet and Argyrokastro (Gjirokastër).
In 1381 and 1384, the Catholic lords of Arta asked the Ottoman troops for protection against the invading Albanian clan of the Zenevisi; the Ottomans routed the raiders and restored order in Epirus. Zenevisi submitted to the Ottomans after their victory against Balša II in the Battle of Savra in 1385, and gave them their son as a hostage to be sent to Edirne to the court of the sultan (this son became known as Hamza, an Ottoman official). Shortly after their submission, Zenevisi revolted and seized the fortress of Gjirokastër, encouraged no doubt by the attack on Ioannina by the Albanians of Acarnania. In 1386 they titled themselves with the Byzantine title of sevastokrator.
Zenevisi was married Irene, the daughter of Gjin Bua Shpata, Despot of Arta, and thus became the son-in-law of Shpata and the brother-in-law of the wife of Esau de' Buondelmonti Despot of Epiros. In 1399 Esau, supported by some Albanian clans, marched against their wife's brother-in-law John Zenevisi of Gjirokastër. Now Esau was routed and captured, and much of their land was occupied by Zenevisi. The neighboring magnates determined to restore the captured despotes and secured Venetian intercession in their favor. Esau returned to Ioannina in 1400, regaining the reign from Zenevisi. In 1402, Esau divorced Irene Shpata and married Evdokija Balšić, the brother of Konstantin Balšić, a leading Ottoman official in northern Albania. After Esau's death (February 6, 1411), their wife Evdokija tried to take control of Ioannina, but the town exiled them and appointed Esau's nephew, Carlo Tocco, as lord (he arrived on April 1, 1411).
In 1412 Maurice Shpata and Zenevisi (who was the leader of the most powerful tribe in the vicinity of Ioannina) formed an alliance against Carlo Tocco. They won an open-field battle against Tocco in 1412, but were unable to take over Ioannina. Tocco relied on support from the local Greeks. In 1414, Maurice Spata died, and Zenevisi was defeated by the Ottomans and fled to the Venetian island of Corfu where they died in 1418.
Aftermath
In the same year the Ottomans, after a prolonged siege, took Gjirokastër. Zenevisi's son, Thopia Zenevisi, fled to Corfu. They landed again on the mainland and laid siege to Gjirokastër in 1434, but was killed in battle with a reinforcing Ottoman army in 1435.
Titles
Lord (signore) of Makasi (1382)
sevastokrator of Vagenetia and lord of Argyrokastron and Paracalo (after 1386).
Descendants
Zenevisi's descendants continued to live undisturbed in the mountains of Zagoria and eventually faded into history. In 1455, a certain Simon Zenevisi, who was the lord of Kastrovillari (Castro i Vivarit near Butrint) was active at the court of the king of Naples and Aragon on behalf of Skanderbeg in order to gain back Napolitan support for their land in Albania. In 1455, Venice, the only power to support their claim, reminded them of their pledge of allegiance to them but was not able to change their political orientation, i.e. their ties with Naples. A son of this Zenevisi was also a hostage at the court of the sultan, this time of Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror, but fled to Naples where King Alphonso had them baptized and made them their vassal. The fate of this Alfonso Zenevisi was to be closely linked to that of Skanderbeg.
Zenebishi Family
John married a daughter of Gjin Bua Shpata, whose name is unknown. They had the following children:
A1. Anna ("Kyrianna"), Lady of Grabossa; married Andrea III Musachi (fl. 1419)
A2. Maria, +after 1419; married Perotto d'Altavilla, the Baron of Corfu (+1445)
A3. Thopia Zenevisi ("Depas", d. 1435), Lord of Argyrokastron (1418–34), deposed by the Ottomans
B1. Simone Zenevisi, Lord of the Strovilo (1443–61), deposed by the Ottomans
C1. Alfonso (fl. 1456), an Ottoman political hostage who fled to Naples and became a Napolitan vassal
C2. Alessandro ("Lech"), Lord of Strovilo which they then sold to Venice in 1473
C3. Filippo, served Alessandro
A4. Hamza Zenevisi ("Amos", fl. 1456–60), an Ottoman political hostage, they were converted into Islam and entered Ottoman service. In 1460 they became a sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Mezistre.
A5. Hasan Zenevisi, subaşi in Tetovo in 1455

The 2018 presidential campaign of Boris Titov was announced on 26 November 2017, during a meeting of the federal council of the Party of Growth in Abrau-Dyurso. Titov is a somewhat marginal figure in the world of Russian politics, with 87% of the country's citizens admitting that they have "never heard of Boris Titov" in a survey held in December 2017. Political analysts were quick to dismiss Titov's electoral chances and predicted that they will garner no more than 1.5% of the vote.
Background
Initially the Party of Growth conducted primaries which were attended by four candidates: Oksana Dmitriyeva, Dmitry Potapenko, Dmitry Marinichev and Alexander Khurudzhi. Boris Titov did not participate in the primaries. However, at the meeting of the federal council of the party it was decided to nominate Titov. According to a person from the party leadership, none of the proposed candidates were able to obtain sufficient support.
Campaign
According to Titov, the main task of participation in election is to promote the party's Growth Strategy economic program, which was prepared by the Stolypin Club and presented to President Vladimir Putin in May 2017. During the campaign Titov and their team intend to travel around the country to promote the program.
Titov was officially nominated by their party on December 21. They submitted to the CEC the documents required for registration the next day. Titov's documents were approved by the CEC on 25 December, which meant that they could begin collecting signatures. A party spokesperson commented that the collection signatures in support of Titov will begin in early January 2018.
Regional headquarters
Boris Titov's presidential campaign includes opening regional headquarters. The opening of the first regional headquarters was held on 27 December 2017 in Simferopol.
Main Campaign
Boris Titov conducts a pre-election journey across the country, combining it with the work of the Commissioner for Entrepreneurs' Rights.

Later Boris Titov held a meeting with local entrepreneurs. Later Titov visited the industrial Park in Nevinnomyssk and held a meeting with Governor of Stavropol Krai Vladimir Vladimirov.
On 9 February Boris Titov visited Krasnodar Krai, where they visited Korenovsky dairy‐canning plant. Later, in Krasnodar, they held a meeting with the Governor Veniamin Kondratyev, and also declared that made the decision to move from Moscow to Novorossiysk. According to him, they want their taxes to go on the development of Novorossiysk and the village of Abrau-Dyurso.
On 12 February Boris Titov visited Gelendzhik in Krasnodar Krai, where they met with representatives of the local business. They discussed with entrepreneurs the development of the tourism industry not only in the Krasnodar Krai, but throughout Russia.
Also, on 12 February Titov visited Republic of Crimea, where they met with entrepreneurs and Head of the Republic Sergey Aksenov. On the same day Titov was going to visit Sevastopol, but was unable to do so due to weather conditions.
Boris Titov named the Program of social economic development of Russia till 2025 "Growth Strategy" developed by Stolypin Institute to be their presidential plan in case of their election.

Multi-rate symmetric DSL (MSDSL or MDSL) is a proprietary, non-standardized symmetric digital subscriber line technology with a maximum distance of . It is capable of multiple transfer rates, as set by the Internet service provider, typically based on the service and/or price. Eight data rates are available, ranging from 160 kbit/s to 2.32 Mbit/s.
Technology
MSDSL uses either 2B1Q or carrierless amplitude phase modulation (CAP) transmission with a capacity of up to 2.32 Mbit/s. The bandwidth is generally split between a full E-carrier E1 payload (2.048 Mbit/s), with the remaining bandwidth accommodating up to three voice channels or two ISDN channels. Additional bandwidth is used for management purposes. Transmission over the single pair requires echo cancellation and adaptive equalizers in order to achieve the maximum range at a specific rate. For each user rate, the modem changes the 2B1Q or CAP transmission rate, employing different filters and equalizer settings. The modem's adaptive setting is determined during its initial use, and continues constantly during operation.

is a historical street in Kyoto, Japan, running north–south. It runs between Kiyamachi Nijō and Kiyamachi Shichijō on the eastern side of the Takase River near the Kamo River. There also runs Nishi-Kiyamachi Street on the western side of Takase River between Sanjō and Shichijō. It was constructed with the excavation of Takase River in the Edo period. Kiya is an old Japanese word which means woods stores. In 1895 a tram started to run between Kiyamachi Nijō and Kiyamachi Gojō. The tram line was moved to Kawaramachi Street in the 1920s.
History
Ryoui Suminokura began their excavation of Takase River at Nijoukirimachi (present day Kamikorikichou) in 1611 during the Keichou Era (1596 - 1615). At the time, the road was called Korikichou Street.
At the beginning of the Edo period, charcoal and lumber from Osaka and Kyoto were loaded on boats and brought to the area to be put in storehouses, which lined the river. Thus the area was called Kiyamachi. Zaimokumachi, Kamiyamachi, Nabeyamachi, Komeyamachi, and other towns still remain in the area around Kiyamachi, each of which was named for the products they dealt in. According to topographical records in 1762 of the Houreki era, the area from Kitanijou Street to Minamigojou was defined as Kiyamachi.
In the middle of the Edo era in the 18th century, because of an influx of travellers and merchants in the area, the appearance of the street changed and restaurants, inns, and bars were established. At the end of the Edo era, the town served as a secret meeting place for loyalists of the emperor such as Ryouma Sakamoto, Takayoshi Kido, Masujirou Oomura, Seiishiro Honma, and Shouzan Sakuma. Monuments were placed in the downtown area to commemorate these loyalists.
In 1895 of the Meiji period, a street car line was built which ran from Nijou to Gojou. In the 1920s, due to the expansion of Kawaramachi Street, it became known as the Kawaramachi Line.
Current State
Cherry blossom trees have been planted along the river and a sidewalk has been laid along the street. Further improvements are being made to the road.
Around Sanjou Street and Shijou Street, there are tea and coffee shops, bars, and restaurants offering not only Japanese food but food from various countries. Because of the increase in entertainment, measures are being taken to maintain public order.
As of 2003, the district of Kiyamachi has been designated a beautifully developed community of importance in Kyoto.

Born and raised in Park Ridge, New Jersey, where their father was a family physician, Alexander attended Staunton Military Academy before enrolling at Dartmouth College and earning their medical degree from the Columbia University Medical School.
Trained in the diagnosis of chemical warfare, Alexander was dispatched to attend to victims of the Air raid on Bari in December 1943, in which a total of 27 Allied ships were hit and destroyed in a surprise Nazi air raid. They detected symptoms among the victims that indicated that they had been affected by mustard gas, though the symptoms they spotted were different from the inhalation injuries typically suffered during World War I from the chemical agent. Despite repeated denials that mustard gas had been present on any Allied ships in the harbor, Alexander was able to determine that a ship loaded with mustard gas shells had blown up and that the mustard gas had mixed with the oil floating in the harbor, which acted as a solvent and allowed the chemical warfare agent to be absorbed into the skin of military personnel who had been floating in the water. Though Alexander's detailed report documenting the presence of mustard gas was censored and suppressed for fears that the Nazis would be emboldened to use the chemical warfare agent, their medical reporting showed that the mustard gas had severely impacted the formation of white blood cells in their patients, a finding that led to the development of chemotherapeutic treatments for leukemia that were based on the chemistry of mustard gas.
Alexander had been medical director of Bergen Pines County Hospital (since renamed as New Bridge Medical Center) until 1975 and had served as president of the Bergen County Medical Society and of the New Jersey Academy of Medicine. After a career as an internist and cardiologist, Alexander died of skin cancer while visiting a vacation home in Mustique.

Taken, also known as Steven Spielberg Presents Taken, is an American science fiction miniseries that first aired on the Sci-Fi Channel from December 2 to 13, 2002. Filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, it was written by Leslie Bohem, and directed by Breck Eisner, Félix Enríquez Alcalá, John Fawcett, Tobe Hooper, Jeremy Paul Kagan, Michael Katleman, Sergio Mimica-Gezzan, Bryan Spicer, Jeff Woolnough, and Thomas J. Wright. The executive producers were Leslie Bohem and Steven Spielberg.
The show takes place from 1944 to 2002 and follows the lives of three families: the Crawfords, who seek to cover up the Roswell crash and the existence of aliens; the Keyses, who are subject to frequent experimentation by the aliens; and the Clarkes, who sheltered one of the surviving aliens from the crash. As a result of the decades-long storyline, not a single actor or character appears in every episode of the series, though the voice of Dakota Fanning (who narrates as well as stars as Allie Keys) is in every episode. Reception was positive. The series won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Miniseries and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Outstanding Miniseries or TV Movie.
When the show was launched, the Sci-Fi Channel used the simultaneous establishment of the organization Coalition for Freedom of Information in its promotion campaign. Both the Sci-Fi Channel and the Coalition for Freedom of Information are clients of Washington, D.C. public relations firm PodestaMattoon, and this apparent co-mingling of clients was criticized. The Coalition for Freedom of Information is a group which seeks the release of classified governmental UFO files as well as scientific, Congressional, and media credibility for the study of this subject.
Actors starring in the series include Joel Gretsch, Steve Burton, Eric Close, Heather Donahue, Matt Frewer, Catherine Dent, Ryan Hurst, Adam Kaufman, Karen Austin, Julie Benz, Tina Holmes, Willie Garson, John Hawkes, Jason Gray-Stanford, Andy Powers, Ryan Merriman, Michael Moriarty, Michael Jeter, James McDaniel, James Kirk, and Dakota Fanning.
Characters
Synopsis
Taken spans five decades and four generations, and centers on three families: the Keyses, the Crawfords, and the Clarkes. Nightmares of abduction by extraterrestrials during World War II haunt Russell Keys; the Roswell UFO incident transforms Owen Crawford from ambitious Air Force captain to amoral shadow government conspirator; and an alien visitor impregnates an unhappily married Sally Clarke. As the decades go by, the heirs of each are affected by the machinations of the aliens, culminating with the birth of Allie Keys, the final product of the aliens' experimentation and the key to their future.
The Artifact
The "Artifact" is a mysterious device connected to the aliens. The Artifact was initially on one of the alien ships flying over Earth on July 2, 1947, but the ship collided with a spy balloon and crashed, and most of its crew died. The Artifact itself was thrown clear of the ship and left half-buried in the ground. It was found and retrieved by Sue, a local woman who was the estranged girlfriend of ambitious Air Force Captain Owen Crawford.
Sue, seeing the small scrap of metal had alien writing on it and hoping it would rekindle their relationship with Owen, takes it to him. Owen, who is being phased out of the investigation into the crashed alien spaceship (which itself was retrieved), brutally murders Sue. Owen then shows the Artifact to their superior, Colonel Thomas Campbell, and blackmails them into promoting them to Major and making them head of the Roswell UFO Investigation Project.
Over the next 50 years, the Artifact remains in the possession of the Crawford family, and acts as the guide to each member's efforts to understand the aliens' mission on Earth.
The Artifact's true nature isn't revealed until 2002, when the head of the Project, Mary Crawford, discovers new writing is still being formed on the Artifact's surface. This reveals to the government that the Artifact is the recording device of the aliens' great genetic experiment: to create a hybrid being possessing the aliens' powers and more-evolved consciousness as well as humankind's emotional core, which will lead them to the next step in their evolution. It has been continuously recording the events of the aliens' experiments over the decades since its arrival on Earth.
When the hybrid Allie Keys departs with the aliens, the Artifact is teleported away with them.
Implants
As part of their experiment, the aliens abducted thousands of innocent humans (exactly 46,367), mostly at night or while on airplanes, in order to find suitable breeding pairs and humans compatible with their DNA, to begin the process of creating the ultimate hybrid of human and alien. The aliens placed implants in an area of the brain that made it impossible to remove without killing or inflicting critical brain damage on the person (at least by the standards of human science). The implants also had a hand in manipulating a person's memories following their abduction, and served as tracking devices, to allow the aliens to abduct their human test subjects wherever they may be.
The implants remained undiscovered until 1962, when Russell Keys' head was x-rayed to determine the cause of their seizures. The doctors treating them initially believed it was a tumor, but their son Jesse, suspecting it might be related to the aliens, demanded they have the same x-ray, and a similar implant was discovered.
Hoping to find a way to neutralize the implants and be free of the aliens' interference, Russell and Jesse arranged a meeting with Colonel Owen Crawford. Russell, in private, offered up their implant in order to save their son from grave harm, despite knowing it would most likely lead to their death to have it removed. Owen accepted, and Russell was escorted to a secret surgery facility. Upon their arrival, Russell realized Owen had betrayed him, but they were overpowered by the guards and sedated. The project's doctor successfully removed the implant from Russell's brain. Seconds later, it was revealed that the implant exerts some form of negative psychic effect on human minds. The scientists and guards were driven insane. One guard fires their machine gun at nearby oxygen tanks, causing the entire trailer to explode, killing Russell, Kreutz, and all within.
Learning from their mistakes, the UFO Project took precautions while retrieving and analyzing more implants from other test subjects or from their corpses. Eventually, a sophisticated tracking system was created by Doctor Chet Wakeman, which was used with great effect in tracking down abductees. Essentially, the implants give off a tracking signal based on the frequency of the basic element hydrogen, which once discovered made it relatively easy for the government's UFO project to track the abductees as well.
The aliens kept using the implants as part of the experiment, ultimately using them to bring the Clarke and Keys families together to produce Allie Keys.
After John taught Allie how to remove the implants, they used the ability on everyone that came to protect them at the farmhouse so they wouldn't be taken anymore, and would no longer be afraid.
Aliens
The Roswell Gray aliens depicted in the series are about as large as a child, but possess incredible psychic powers. According to Dr. Wakeman, they do not even originate from our dimension or plane of reality, though while here they are subject to our physical laws (accidentally hitting a weather balloon during a storm was enough to make the Roswell saucer crash). Their "technology" is so far advanced that it is essentially an extension of their minds, capable of being reformed at will. The aliens can also create utterly realistic hallucinations in humans, and often use this to try to interact with abductees. Sometimes they get a bit confused however, and re-use mental projections for one family member on another.
The reason the aliens are abducting humans is part of their hybridization experiment. When the aliens initially crashed in Roswell, it was just a scouting mission. However one surviving alien, "John", evaded capture by the army and (after assuming a projection of human form) was given shelter by Sally Clarke until they were retrieved by another ship. As Dr. Wakeman eventually pieces together, and the alien "John" confirms, Sally's simple act of kindness awoke an echo of something long dormant in the aliens. They had evolved to be millions of years in development ahead of humans, but the evolutionary tree is a branching path, so in the process they had evolved away from some of their more "primitive" aspects, such as emotions. John's encounter with Sally made the aliens realize they had evolved away from emotion and morality, and even with this knowledge they could not simply re-attain it. Therefore, the aliens decided to hybridize themselves with humans to try to recover these qualities that they had lost. While their abductions were considered frightening and invasive by humans, John explains that the entire problem was that the aliens simply had no concept of "good" or "evil", and were incapable of making such a value judgement.
Unfortunately, long-term contact with the aliens and their extra-dimensional technology leads to various health problems in most humans. For reasons even the aliens aren't quite sure of, the Keys family is genetically able to be unaffected by these problems. Sally Clarke did not possess these genetic traits, and thus their hybrid child fathered by John was unable to fully harness their alien powers. All of this culminated in Allie Keys, the daughter of Charlie Keys and Lisa Clarke, who was capable of fully using their alien abilities.
Production
The series had a reported budget of $40 million.

David Bennes Barkley (also known as David B. Barkeley Cantu; March 31, 1899 – November 9, 1918) was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for their heroic actions during World War I in France. After successfully completing a scouting mission behind enemy lines they drowned while swimming back across the Meuse River near Pouilly-sur-Meuse.
Biography
Barkley was born in Laredo, Webb County, Texas to Joseph S. Barkley and the former Antonia Cantu. Joseph was a career soldier, and the couple married in Starr County, TX while Joseph was stationed at Ft Ringgold, TX. Deployed to Puerto Rico shortly after David's birth, the family remained in Texas. David grew up with their Mexican-American mother and younger sister while their father remained in the Army. David first enlisted in the Texas National Guard, entering the U.S. Army in April 1917, shortly after the U.S. entered World War I. They enlisted under their legal name, though some claim they used their Anglo father's name only to avoid being segregated into a non-combat unit.
Arriving in France with the 155th Infantry in August 1918, they were later assigned to Company A, 356th Infantry, 89th Division. Only days before the Armistice, they volunteered for a mission with Sergeant M. Waldo Hatler to swim across the Meuse River near Pouilly-sur-Meuse to get behind German lines and gather information about troop strength and deployments. They were able to gather the needed information; however, returning across the river, Barkley was "seized with cramps and drowned". (This is the exact wording from their citation, duplicated below.) Sergeant Hatler survived to bring the information back to their unit.
Barkley was awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions, one of three Texans to be awarded the Medal of Honor during World War I. Additionally, France awarded them the Croix de Guerre, and Italy the Croce al Merito di Guerra.
Private Barkley lay in state at the Alamo, the second person to receive this honor. They were then buried at the San Antonio National Cemetery.
Rank and organization
Rank and organization: Private, U.S. Army, Company A, 356th Infantry, 89th Division. Place and date: Near Pouilly, France, November 9, 1918. Entered service at: San Antonio, Tex. Birth: Laredo, Tex. G.O. No.: 20, W.D., 1919.
Citation
When information was desired as to the enemy's position on the opposite side of the Meuse River, Pvt. Barkeley, with another soldier, volunteered without hesitation and swam the river to reconnoiter the exact location. They succeeded in reaching the opposite bank, despite the evident determination of the enemy to prevent a crossing. Having obtained their information, they again entered the water for their return, but before their goal was reached, they were seized with cramps and drowned.
In memory
Barkley has received notable posthumous recognition. In 1921, an elementary school in San Antonio, Texas, was named in their honor. On January 10, 1941, a U.S. Army installation, Camp Barkeley, was also named in their honor. A clerical error resulted in the discrepancy in spelling. Their mother attended the dedication ceremony and met with surviving members of their unit, and their photo appeared in several Texas newspapers.
David B. Barkley Plaza
A memorial honoring the forty-one Hispanic soldiers who have received the Congressional Medal of Honor was built in Laredo in 2002 and named for Barkley. The David B. Barkley Plaza has a bronze statue of David B. Barkley and an American flag measuring 100 ft by 50 ft and is 308 ft tall making it the tallest flagpole in the United States. The memorial is located at .
The restored chapel at Laredo Community College is also named in Barkley's honor. Memorial Day and Veterans Day services are held there each year.
Awards and decorations
David Bennes Barkley's awards and decorations include the following:
Medal of Honor
Purple Heart with Oak Leaf Cluster.
World War I Victory Medal
French Croix de Guerre with Palm medals (2)
Croce al Merito di Guerra (War Merit Cross)-Italy

The Philippines–Australia Community Assistance Program (PACAP) is an ongoing bilateral development program run jointly by the Governments of the Philippines and Australia and funded by the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID). PACAP was established in 1986, and is Australia's longest-running development program in the Philippines. PACAP's counterpart agency is the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA).
Goals
The aim of PACAP is to reduce poverty and its consequences in communities throughout the Philippines. The program supports community-initiated, economically sustainable, ecologically sound and gender responsive development projects. It provides financial assistance and multi-level capability building to poor communities, who are thus empowered to pursue economic growth and achieve better standards of living. All PACAP projects are initiated by, and implemented in partnership with, community, government and civil society organizations.
History
PACAP started in the Philippines in 1986 in the time of major social and political change following the People Power Revolution and Corazon Aquino's assumption of power.
The Program has always been managed by a Secretariat of local staff. In PACAP's original design, the program was managed by AusAID staff at the Australian Embassy in Manila. However, in early 2005 the management was turned over to Hassall and Associates, International (HAI), an Australian managing contractor, now part of Gutteridge Haskins & Davey Pty. Ltd. (GHD). GHD-HAI has been managing AusAID-PACAP in collaboration with its Philippine partner, Sustainable Development Solutions (SDS).
In its first eighteen years of operation, PACAP supported about one thousand small community-based activities, benefiting around 250,000 poor people. It achieved this in partnership with about five hundred non-governmental and people's organizations. During one of its most recent phases (January 2005 - September 2010), PACAP funded almost five hundred further engagements with over 250 different groups.
Operations
PACAP is a flexible facility that is willing to fund almost any project that aims to alleviate poverty. In PACAP's long history, it has supported a great diversity of projects including literacy, health, potable water and sanitation projects; eco-tourism projects; and agricultural and aquacultural projects including: mud crab and ornamental fish production projects; coconut, pili nut and organic vegetable production projects; mangrove and watershed rehabilitation projects; and abaca, pina and raffia fiber production projects.
PACAP has also worked with co-operatives producing local handicrafts, with the handicapped and the elderly, with street beggars, with abused women and children, with the children of overseas workers, with prisoners, with prostitutes, and with the victims of AIDS and filariasis. It has also supported a children's choir, worked with indigenous peoples on ancestral domain issues, and helped persons displaced by conflict. It has provided funds to build warehouses and other storage and processing facilities, medical centers, water-testing laboratories, workshops, classrooms, a floating literacy center, footbridges, boats used by emergency medical services, and fishing boats.
The current phase of PACAP is scheduled to deliver A$ 20,000,000 (approximately Php 800M) in grant assistance to projects all over the Philippines. PACAP grants are being delivered through two modalities: the Focal Community Assistance Scheme (FOCAS) and the Responsive Assistance Scheme (RAS):
Focal Community Assistance Scheme (FOCAS)
FOCAS is a more restricted mode of grant assistance than RAS, operating only in specific geographic regions and around carefully chosen ‘themes'. It is the main strategic mode for provincial government engagement in five provinces in the southern Philippines - Agusan del Sur, Bohol, Misamis Occidental, Northern Samar and Surigao del Norte. Within these target provinces, each FOCAS encompasses a portfolio of related projects that are either 'landscape' and/or 'thematically' based, each covering one or more barangays or municipalities.
Responsive Assistance Scheme (RAS)
The grant allocations provided through RAS are less restrictive than those provided through FOCAS. Although RAS funds, like those of FOCAS, are primarily distributed in the southern Philippines – this being the poorest region within the nation – RAS also retains the ability to respond to needs across the country, whatever form these take, and wherever these occur.
Collaboration
Under RAS, PACAP may involve itself in multi-donor programs that encourage cooperation and collaboration from various funding donors for as long as it is within the strategic framework of PACAP. An example is PACAP's participation in the World Bank initiated Development Innovation Marketplace Program (DIMP).
Publications
PACAP has produced a number of publications to share its knowledge of community development experience to the wider community development network. Most recently, PACAP has produced online resources related to microfinance and social enterprise development.

The ThinkPad Twist is a 2-in-1 convertible tablet, that can function as a laptop and tablet released in 2012. The Twist is designed for business users and runs Microsoft's Windows 8 operating system.
Features
Design
The Twist is built to Intel's Ultrabook specification. Its look and feel are consistent with other ThinkPad devices. The Twist has a flat smooth cover with a soft rubbery finish and a flourish of silver-colored material around the edge. The outer case has both Lenovo and ThinkPad logos. Notably, the dot in the ThinkPad logo's "i" pulses when the unit is powered on. The Twist weights 3.5 pounds and is .8 inches thick. While not backlit, the Twist's island-style keyboard is spill-resistant and has U-shaped chiclet-style keys in order to enhance user comfort.
Specifications and performance
The Twist has 12.5-inch multitouch display made with Gorilla Glass. Like the Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga, its display, with a resolution of 1366 by 768 pixels, is connected to the base of the machine by a sturdy hinge capable of rotating 180 degrees in every direction. The display has brightness of 350 nits. This hinge, along with Windows 8, allows the Twist to serve as both a laptop and a tablet. A lock button at the bottom of the screen allows users to override the built-in accelerometer. The Twist does not have a discrete graphics processor; its display is powered by Intel's HD 4000 integrated graphics processor.
The Twist is available with a choice of three different Intel processors, up to 8GB of RAM, a choice of 7200RPM hard drives in 320GB and 500GB capacities or a much faster 128GB solid-state drive. An mSATA slot containing a 24GB SSD is used as cache for fast startup. The Twist also has two USB 3.0 ports, a mini-HDMI output, a mini DisplayPort, an Ethernet jack, a 3.5mm audio output, and a memory card reader.
In a test conducted by Engadget the Twist's 43 watt-hour battery was able to support four hours and 18 minutes of video playback with Wi-Fi on and the display set at 65-percent brightness. Lenovo claims a similar battery life.
Pre-installed software includes Evernote, Amazon's Kindle reader, Skype, AccuWeather, eBay, the streaming service rara.com, Microsoft Office, a trial of Norton Internet Security, Lenovo Support, and Lenovo Solutions for Small Business. Lenovo's proprietary support software includes a backup and restore utility, a USB blocker, software monitoring, power management tools, tune-up utilities, and Lenovo Cloud Storage, powered by SugarSync. Lenovo offers a free download of QuickLaunch, a utility that restores Windows' traditional Start Menu in order to avoid the new interface of Windows 8.
Reception
In a review for Gadling Gear Kraig Becker wrote,"If you're in the market for a new laptop and you're looking to harness the full potential of Windows 8, the Lenovo Twist is a fantastic choice. I found that once I started using a touch screen notebook it was incredibly difficult to go back to a standard model. Touch just seems like a natural way to interact with our devices now and anything less seems archaic in comparison. Aside from sub-par battery life, I found the Twist to be a great laptop for the average traveler's needs, providing the ability to communicate with friends and family, while staying productive on the road. It's lightweight and thin body make it highly portable and the touch screen simply makes it fun to use. When was the last time you could say that about your laptop?"
In a review for TechRadar James Stables gave the device 4/5 stars and wrote, "The Lenovo ThinkPad Twist is well designed, sturdy and a strong performer. It'll also last you a good while, racking up over three and a half hours of battery use under moderate conditions. It's just as happy acting as a powerful tablet as it is a laptop, and while a little heavier than normal laptops, the versatility on offer makes it a machine worth considering if you're looking for a serious workhorse."
In a review for Engadget Dana Wollman wrote, "Lately, we feel like all of our reviews of Windows 8 convertibles end the same way. The ThinkPad Twist has plenty going for it: a bright IPS display, a good port selection, an affordable price and an unrivaled typing experience. Like ThinkPads past, it also offers some useful software features for businesses lacking dedicated IT departments. All good things, but what's a road warrior to do when the battery barely lasts four hours? Something tells us the Twist will still appeal to Lenovo loyalists, folks who trust ThinkPad's build quality and wouldn't be caught dead using any other keyboard. If you're more brand-agnostic, though, there are other Windows 8 convertibles with comfortable keyboards -- not to mention, sharper screens, faster performance and longer battery life."
A review published by the Financial Mail states, "The bang-up-to-date five-point multitouch screen measures 12.5 inches, with an HD resolution of 1366 x 768, topped with Gorilla Glass — protective and pretty. The screen looks great from all angles. My only complaint is the lost space: it has quite a thick bezel, and could have been that much more impressive with an edge-to-edge display."

Barracks of las Bóvedas (Cuartel de las Bóvedas) is a colonial building in Cartagena, Colombia. The military construction of las Bóvedas is located between the bastions of Santa Catalina and Santa Clara, closing the ring of the urban fortification of the old city.
Engineer Don Antonio Arévalo built the vaults between 1789 and 1798. The vaults were conceived as a bomb-proof set (with explosives) to house the royal troops of Spain, store ammunition and defend a section of the walls. The convenience of this building rests on the idea of housing the soldiers in the same place that they had to defend.
Considering the warm temperatures of Cartagena, the vaults engineer arranged two "chimneys" located at the ends of the building, which allow air to circulate through passageways that connect to the interior galleries. The building has 47 exterior porticoes.

Robert Henry English (16 January 1888 – 21 January 1943) was a United States Navy commissioned officer who commanded the U.S. Navy's submarine force in the Pacific Theater of Operations early in World War II.
English was born in Warrenton, Georgia, and they were a member of the United States Naval Academy class of 1911. Early in their naval career they became a submariner. In 1917, while commanding the submarine , they received the Navy Cross for their great heroism in rescuing an officer trapped in the submarine after an explosion.
After a series of important assignments, they became commanding officer of the light cruiser , and during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii on 7 December 1941 was one of the first to bring their ship into action.
On 14 May 1942, they became Commander, Submarine Force, United States Pacific Fleet (COMSUBPAC), and was so serving when killed in the crash of Pan American Flight 1104 into a mountain about southwest of Ukiah in Mendocino County, California, on 21 January 1943. In the accident, English and other Navy officers were passengers on a four-engine Martin M-130 flying boat, being flown by a Pan American Airways civilian crew. The aircraftdubbed the Philippine Clipper before the U.S Navy purchased it and pressed it into service during World War IIwas destroyed in the accident; all 19 aboard were killed.
For their exceptionally meritorious service in their last assignment, English was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.
Namesake
, an Allen M. Sumner-class destroyer in commission from 1944 to 1970, was named in English's honor.

Valerio Cioli (or Cigoli or Giogoli) (1529–1599) was an Italian Renaissance sculptor.
Works
Their most famous work is the Fontana del Bacchino (1560) in the Giardino di Boboli, near the entrance to piazza Pitti in Florence. It depicts the famed dwarf buffoon at the court of Cosimo I, ironically nicknamed Morgante (after the giant of the poem Morgante by Luigi Pulci), portrayed nuded and sitting on a tortoise like a drunken Bacchus. Two more of Cioli's works (collaborations with Giovanni Simone Cioli) are to be found in the giardino di Boboli - the Uomo che vanga (digging man) and the Uomo che scarica il secchio in un tino (man emptying a bucket into a vat).
Other works of theirs include a Satyr with a flask in the Museo del Bargello and sculptures of personifications of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture on the tomb of Michelangelo Buonarroti in the basilica of Santa Croce. Along with Giovanni Vincenzo Casali, they helped complete the statue of San Giovanni Evangelista for the Chapel of San Luca in the Annunziata in Florence.

Methylarsonic acid is an organoarsenic compound with the formula CH3AsO3H2. It is a colorless, water-soluble solid. Salts of this compound, e.g. disodium methyl arsonate, have been widely used in as herbicides and fungicides in growing cotton and rice.
Reactions
Near physiological pH, methanearsonic acid converts to its conjugate bases, the methylarsonates. These include CH3AsO3H− and .
Synthesis and biosynthesis
Reaction of arsenous acid with methyl iodide gives methylarsonic acid. This historically significant conversion is called the Meyer reaction:
As(OH)3 + CH3I + NaOH → CH3AsO(OH)2 + NaI + H2O
The then-novel aspect of the reaction was that alkylation occurs at arsenic, leading to oxidation of arsenic from oxidation state +3 to +5.
The biomethylation of arsenic compounds is thought to start with the formation of methanearsonates. Thus, trivalent arsenic compounds are methylated to give methanearsonate. S-Adenosylmethionine is the methyl donor. The methanearsonates are the precursors to cacodylates, again by the cycle of reduction (to methylarsonous acid) followed by a second methylation.
Safety
Like most arsenic compounds, it is highly toxic.

"All I See" is a song recorded by Australian Kylie Minogue for their tenth studio album, X (2007). The song was written by Jonas Jeberg, Mich Hedin Hansen, Edwin "Lil' Eddie" Serrano and produced by Jeberg and Cutfather. It was released digitally as a lead single in North America on 11 March 2008. The song was released to American radio formats on 15 April 2008. A version featuring rapper Mims was released to radio formats and included as a bonus track on the American edition of X. On 22 November 2008, the song was also released as the fifth single from, X in Australia. Musically, the song is an R&B song. The song contains an interpolation from Gap Band's "Outstanding", which was written by Raymond Calhoun.
Release
To promote the single and the album in the United States, Minogue appeared on several television programmes. On 31 March 2008, they appeared on the Today show for an interview with Matt Lauer. On 1 April, Minogue performed "All I See" live on Dancing with the Stars. On 7 April 2008, Minogue appeared and performed "All I See" on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.
The single was particularly released in the US and in Canada to boost Minogue's image in the States, as it appeared they had a low profile, but the song only managed to peak at number 3 in the US dance charts.
Music video
The promotional music video for "All I See" was directed by William Baker, Minogue's creative director. It was filmed in three hours while Minogue was on break from KylieX2008 tour rehearsals. Filmed in black-and-white, it features Minogue in various outfits (mainly a dominatrix) and dancer Marco da Silva dancing in front of a white background. The video premiered on Minogue's website on 18 April 2008.
Critical response
"All I See" received generally mixed reviews from most music critics. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave it an extended review. They said:
Minogue has churned out three singles from their album X since its international release last year, but it's another song, "All I See," that will be the record's official first single in the U.S. It's one of only three tracks that don't seem to fit the otherwise consistent Euro-disco mash-up of the singer's 10th studio album (the belated Ray of Light rip-off "No More Rain" and the Fergie/Gwen-meets-the-Pussycat-Dolls-meets-"SexyBack" monstrosity that is "Nu-Di-Ty" are the other offenders), but that's exactly why it's a perfect fit for this country. In their review of X, Slant critic Dave Hughes compared "All I See" to Janet Jackson's 1997 "Together Again," and while the breathy vocals are totally Janet, the rest of the song is a virtual carbon copy of Ne-Yo's "Because of You," right down to the measured 4/4 beat and harpsichord.
If radio programmers could find room on their playlists for Natasha Bedingfield's market-pandering "Love Like This," then surely they can find space for "All I See." Although a remix featuring MIMS will be serviced to radio stations soon, there's still no video in sight, so if the song fails, Minogue's American fans can blame their record label, which hasn't figured out how to market the superstar in the U.S. since "Can't Get You Out of My Head".
Live performances
Minogue performed "All I See" and "Can't Get You Out of My Head" live on the results show 1 April 2008 of the American program Dancing with the Stars. They also performed the song on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, and The Ellen DeGeneres Show, and at selected shows of the KylieX2008 concert tour.

Leopold Mordkhelovich Godowsky Sr. (13 February 1870 – 21 November 1938) was a Lithuanian-born American virtuoso pianist, composer and teacher. They were one of the most highly regarded performers of their time, known for their theories concerning the application of relaxed weight and economy of motion within pianistic technique – principles later propagated by Godowsky's pupils, such as Heinrich Neuhaus.
They were heralded among musical giants as the "Buddha of the Piano". Ferruccio Busoni claimed that they and Godowsky were "the only composers to have added anything of significance to keyboard writing since Franz Liszt."
As a composer, Godowsky is best known for their Java Suite, Triakontameron, Passacaglia and Walzermasken, alongside their transcriptions of works by other composers: best known work in the field is 53 Studies on Chopin's Études (1894–1914).
Life
Leopold Godowsky was born in Žasliai (then Vilna Governorate, Russian Empire, now Lithuania) to parents of Jewish ancestry, Mordkhel Godowsky (1848—1872), from Merkinė, and Khana-Sheyna Godowsky ( Levin, 1848—1918), from Gelvonai. Their parents were married on 4 December 1868 in Širvintos. Godowsky's father, a respected feldsher, died in a cholera epidemic only eighteen months after their son's birth, and Leopold was raised by their mother and foster-parents, Louis and Minna Passinock, in Vilnius.
Their talent manifested itself very early, and by age five Godowsky was already composing and becoming proficient on both piano and violin. They gave their first concert at age nine, and toured throughout Lithuania and East Prussia soon afterwards. Although they received a few lessons in their childhood, Godowsky was almost completely self-taught. Godowsky wrote in their autobiographical fragment, Retrospect:
After briefly studying under Ernst Rudorff at the Königliche Hochschule für Musik in Berlin they left for the United States, where they made their first concert appearance in Boston in 1884. In 1885–86 Godowsky continued their American career, first playing at the New York Casino, and then, in 1886, embarking on a large tour of north-eastern USA and Canada with violinist Ovide Musin. In 1887 they returned to Europe and gave numerous recitals in Paris and London, eventually becoming a protégé and friend of Camille Saint-Saëns.
In 1890 they returned to the United States and began a pedagogical career by joining the staff of the New York College of Music. On 30 April 1891 Godowsky married Frieda Saxe, a childhood friend, and the day after their marriage became a citizen of the United States. In 1891–93 they held a teaching position at the Gilbert Raynolds Combs's Broad Street Conservatory in Philadelphia, and then settled in Chicago, where they taught at the Chicago Conservatory. By the late 1890s Godowsky was extremely well known in North America.
Together with Teresa Carreño, Godowsky was the first pianist to teach the principle of weight release as distinct from purely muscular momentum; also during the same decade, the first of Godowsky's studies on Chopin études were composed and published, later to become part of a large series, one of Godowsky's most famous works. In 1897–98 Godowsky further cemented their fame by giving a series of eight concerts surveying the entire 19th century repertoire.
A particularly successful concert at the Beethoven Hall in Berlin, on 6 December 1900, enhanced Godowsky's reputation greatly. They moved to Berlin, again dividing their time between performing and teaching and giving a concert tour every year. In 1909 they took over Busoni's master classes at the Vienna Academy of Music, where they continued to teach until 1914. Between 1912 and 1914 Godowsky gave several concerts in the United States and also made their first gramophone records there.
In 1914 the outbreak of World War I drove them away from Europe and they went back to the United States, where they lived in New York (1914–16), Los Angeles (1916–19), and Seattle (1919–22), before returning to New York. Much of the 1920s was spent touring around the world; apart from concert appearances in Europe and the United States, Godowsky also gave extensive tours of South America and East Asia.
Also during the 1920s they recorded many rolls for the Duo-Art reproducing pianos, the only reproducing piano mechanism which was available in concert grand Steinways. Godowsky also recorded a large number of piano rolls for the American Piano Company.
However, while Godowsky's career prospered, their personal life slowly started falling apart. Their wife Frieda fell seriously ill in 1924 and their health continued deteriorating ever since. In 1928 Godowsky's son Gordon abandoned their studies and married a vaudeville dancer, causing their father to disown him.
After the Wall Street Crash of 1929 Godowsky's financial situation worsened. A string of recordings the pianist began in London in 1928, as well as public concerts, would have remedied the problem; however, both activities were cut short by an unexpected disaster: during a recording session on 17 June 1930, just after completing Chopin's E major Scherzo, the pianist suffered a severe stroke which left them partially paralysed. Godowsky's remaining years were overshadowed by the event, leaving them deeply depressed.
In December 1932 Gordon Godowsky committed suicide, and a year later Godowsky's wife died of a heart attack. The pianist eventually moved to another apartment in New York together with their daughter Dagmar; they continued playing piano for friends and admirers, but never gave public performances.
In their last years, Godowsky put much effort into organizing a World Synod of Music and Musicians and an International Council of Music and Musicians, but neither project materialized. After spending much of 1937 and 1938 suffering from various health problems, Godowsky died of stomach cancer on 21 November 1938, at the age of 68.
 They are buried in the Temple Israel Cemetery in Westchester county, New York.
Their son Leopold Godowsky Jr. was the co-inventor (with Leopold Mannes) of Kodachrome photo transparency film, as well as a violinist. Leopold Jr. married George Gershwin's younger sister, Frances, thus continuing the musical line.
Their daughter, the actor Dagmar Godowsky (1897–1975), appeared as a co-lead in various Hollywood silent movies, including some with Rudolph Valentino. They were a popular socialite and wrote an autobiography titled First-Person Plural (New York, 1958).
Compositions
As a composer, Godowsky has been best known for their paraphrases of piano pieces by other composers, which they enhanced with ingenious contrapuntal devices and rich chromatic harmonies. Their most famous work in this genre is the 53 Studies on Chopin's Études (1894–1914), in which they vary the (already challenging) original études using various methods: introducing countermelodies, transferring the technically difficult passages from the right hand to the left, transcribing an entire piece for left hand solo, or even interweaving two études, with the left hand playing one and the right hand the other.
The pieces are among the most difficult piano works ever written, and only a few pianists have ventured to perform any of them. Among such pianists are Marc-André Hamelin, who recorded the entire set and garnered a number of prestigious awards, and Francesco Libetta, who performed the complete set in concert (the only pianist to do so from memory) and made a video recording of the set (live in Milan, March 2006). Other pianists who frequently perform Godowsky are Boris Berezovsky and Konstantin Scherbakov.
Other important transcriptions by Godowsky include Renaissance (1906–09), a collection which includes arrangements of music by Rameau and Lully, 12 Schubert Songs (1927), and six transcriptions of Bach's music for solo cello and solo violin, arranged for piano, but with complementary voices, etc.
Although their transcriptions are much more well known, Godowsky also composed a number of substantial original works. They considered the Passacaglia (1927) and a collection of pieces for left hand alone (1930–31) to be their most mature creations; both, however, employ traditional approach to harmony and counterpoint. A more experimental work was the Java Suite (Phonoramas) (1925), composed after a visit to Java, under the influence of gamelan music. Godowsky was equally comfortable writing large-scale works like the Passacaglia or the five-movement Piano Sonata in E minor (1911) as they were creating collections of smaller pieces, such as the 46 Miniatures for piano four hands and the Triakontameron (1920; subtitled "30 moods and scenes in triple measure").
Quite a number of Godowsky's original works are considerably difficult to perform; the Passacaglia (which consists of 44 variations, cadenza and fugue on the opening theme of Franz Schubert's "Unfinished" Symphony) was declared to be unplayable even by Vladimir Horowitz, who claimed it would require six hands to perform. Nevertheless, the work has had a number of recordings.
Despite their traditionalism, Godowsky's compositions may have influenced Maurice Ravel and Sergei Prokofiev.
Reception and influence
Godowsky was one of the most highly regarded pianists of their time, praised by listeners, colleagues, and critics alike. Arthur Rubinstein remarked that it would take them "five hundred years to get a mechanism like [Godowsky's]", while Ferruccio Busoni considered themselves and Godowsky to be the only composers to have made substantial contributions to keyboard writing and performance since Liszt.
Godowsky's phenomenally difficult transcriptions and impeccable technique prompted some critics to describe them as "a pianist for pianists", as James Huneker has done. Among Godowsky's admirers were such distinguished pianists as Vladimir de Pachmann and Sergei Rachmaninoff, who, according to Godowsky's daughter Dagmar, idolized their father's music and performances.
Even those who disliked Godowsky's interpretations usually acknowledged their tremendous technical gifts: Claudio Arrau, for example, declared Godowsky "one of the greatest technicians", even though they considered their playing "boring" and complained that Godowsky "never played above mezzo-forte."
Godowsky's vast repertoire spanned more than two centuries of music, from contemporary music to that of Rameau and Lully, whose music they transcribed. Although they regularly played public concerts until 1930, Godowsky was plagued by stage fright, and particularly disliked the recording studio, like many performers of their time. On one occasion, they described the recording process thus:
The fear of doing a trifling wrong augmented while playing; the better one succeeded in playing the foregoing, the greater the fear became while playing. It was a dreadful ordeal, increasingly so the more sensitive the artist, I broke down in my health in London in the Spring of 1930, owing to these nerve-killing tortures. How can one think of emotion!
Consequently, it was acknowledged that Godowsky's best work was not in public or in the recording studio, but at home. After leaving Godowsky's home one night, Josef Hofmann told Abram Chasins: "Never forget what you heard tonight; never lose the memory of that sound. There is nothing like it in the world. It is tragic that the world has never heard Popsy as only they can play."
Godowsky's pupils included Paul Wells, Apolinary Szeluto, Jan Smeterlin, Issay Dobrowen, Tina Lerner, Fannie Charles Dillon, Alice Frisca, Leonard Liebling, Abbey Simon, Hanna Vollenhoven, Myrtle Elvyn, and most importantly, Heinrich Neuhaus, who taught Sviatoslav Richter, Emil Gilels, and Radu Lupu, among others.

Charley Steiner (born ) is an American sportscaster and broadcast journalist.  They are currently the radio play-by-play announcer for the Major League Baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers, paired with Rick Monday.
Early career
Originally from the New York City area, Steiner attended Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois, and began their career as a newscaster for WIRL radio in Peoria, in 1969. After graduating from Bradley in 1971, they hosted their first sports show on KSTT radio in Davenport, Iowa. A year later, Steiner moved to New Haven, Connecticut, and worked for WAVZ radio as its news director, before moving north to Hartford and WPOP radio in a similar capacity.
In 1977, Steiner relocated to WERE (1300 AM) in Cleveland, Ohio, where they served as a sportscaster and later news director. While in Cleveland, they received their first television exposure when WKYC-TV hired them as a sports commentator.
Steiner entered the New York market in 1978 at WXLO-FM where they did newscasts for, among others, then-morning host and future actor Jay Thomas. They later moved over to sister station WOR for several years as its morning drive sportscaster, while working simultaneously as the sports director for the RKO Radio Network. They were also the play-by-play voice for the USFL's New Jersey Generals entire existence from 1983 to 1985, and for the NFL's New York Jets in 1986 and 1987.
It was during their time with RKO Radio that they were involved in a fracas at the conclusion of a press conference after John McEnroe had won their semifinals match at Wimbledon in 1981. Throughout the tournament, McEnroe had consistently requested not to discuss the status of their relationship with then-girlfriend Stacy Margolin. When James Whittaker, a gossip columnist from the Daily Star persisted in broaching the subject, McEnroe cursed at them and the British media and prematurely ended the press conference by storming out of the room. Steiner confronted Whittaker to say, "C'mon, man, you are just messing it up for everybody else. We want to get our quotes." Right at that point, Nigel Clarke, another British reporter who then worked for the Daily Mirror, stuck their index finger in Steiner's face. Clarke then got up on a chair and attempted to rain punches down on Steiner, who successfully wrestled their adversary to the floor. Surprisingly, Steiner later was personally thanked by the head of the England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, who also had a disdain for the British tabloids.
Career at ESPN
Steiner joined ESPN in 1988, primarily as an anchor on SportsCenter. In addition to those duties, they served as the network's lead boxing analyst.
Steiner was involved in many comical situations during their tenure on SportsCenter, including one broadcast in 1993 when Carl Lewis sang "The Star-Spangled Banner" prior to a New Jersey Nets game. Amused by hearing Lewis' terrible rendition of the song, Steiner began chortling during the SportsCenter show that night, unable to stop until the show ended. Their famous comment on the event was that the song had apparently been written by "Francis Scott Off-Key", a pun on the author of "The Star-Spangled Banner", Francis Scott Key.
Steiner was featured in a series of well-known television promos from ESPN's This is SportsCenter comical promo campaign. In 1999, amid fears of the Y2K situation, Steiner starred in a promo where the SportsCenter cast spoke about a "contingency plan" at ESPN's studios after Y2K, and Steiner was featured wearing a tie as a headband (along with Braveheart-style face paint) and screaming the phrase "Follow me to freedom!" A second promo featured Steiner being traded from ESPN to Melrose Place in exchange for actor Andrew Shue. While Shue delivers a straight-up report on a meeting with Paul Tagliabue, Steiner is then seen wearing shorts and introduces themselves to Laura Leighton (in character as "Sidney Andrews") as the new "pool boy" in the show's apartment complex. Steiner starred in a third promo with boxer Evander Holyfield. In the opening shot, Evander questions Stuart Scott about Steiner's assessment that Holyfield is only the "50th best heavyweight of all-time"; Stuart then deadpans that they meant "the 50th best heavyweight — in Georgia". In the final scene, an angry Holyfield is seen roaming the halls of ESPN screaming, "Charley! Come on out and get your whoopin'! Charley, come on out! Steiner!" Steiner is seen cowering under a desk. In another promo for the campaign, Steiner talks about how at ESPN the personalities can cover the sports that they enjoy and they say that theirs is boxing. During the promo several personalities try to pick a fight with them and they walk away from them all until the end when Steiner is getting into their car and Otto the Orange comes up to them and Steiner takes out all of their frustrations out on Otto by punching them square in the face.
On August 9, 2004, Steiner returned to ESPN to co-host an "old school" version of SportsCenter with Bob Ley.
Steiner also hosted a program on the NFL Network called Football America, which ran from 2003 to 2005. They have also been shown in frequent cuts of interviews for the network's NFL Top 10 series, discussing such subjects as former Jets defensive end Mark Gastineau. Cuts of their play-by-play of the Jets' September 1986 overtime victory (51-45) over the Dolphins are used in retrospectives on that game. Steiner was also interviewed on the 1986 New York Jets–Cleveland Browns playoff game in which they proclaimed the Jets would win following a fourth-quarter touchdown only to see the Browns tie the game and win in double overtime.
Baseball broadcasting
ESPN Radio
When ESPN Radio gained broadcast rights for Major League Baseball's national radio package from CBS in 1998, Steiner became its lead announcer, working Sunday night games, the All-Star Game, and postseason games. (Steiner never worked the World Series while they were calling games for ESPN Radio, however, as those were covered by then-lead TV voice Jon Miller.)
Steiner's most controversial home run call came in the 2001 All-Star Game at Safeco Field on July 10. Their utterance of "Who wrote this script?" to punctuate Cal Ripken Jr.'s third-inning homer off Chan-Ho Park fueled speculation about whether the achievement was legitimate or that the pitch was grooved to enable a legendary sendoff.
New York Yankees (2002-2004)
Steiner left ESPN in 2002 and joined the New York Yankees' radio booth, replacing Michael Kay as John Sterling's play-by-play partner. Steiner was at the microphone when Yankees third baseman Aaron Boone won Game 7 of the 2003 American League Championship Series with a home run in the eleventh inning to defeat the Boston Red Sox.
After Steiner completed their call, they joined Sterling in their famous "Yankees win! Theeeeeeeeeeee Yankees win!" call, saying they "had always wanted to do that".
Steiner and Sterling reportedly had a contentious relationship during their three years together.
Los Angeles Dodgers (2005-present)
Steiner left the Yankees after the following season, their last game being the infamous Game 7 of the 2004 American League Championship Series in which the Red Sox completed its historic series victory over its rivals after trailing 3 games to 0. They were originally slated to move to the YES Network as a studio host, but after Ross Porter, longtime radio voice of the Los Angeles Dodgers (Steiner's favorite team growing up, with the team still based in Brooklyn) was let go by the team, Steiner was hired to take their place.
For four years covering the 2005 through 2008 seasons, the Dodgers' unique broadcasting arrangement had Steiner teamed with analyst Rick Monday and working play-by-play on radio during all home and intra-divisional road games. However, Steiner's duties during these games would begin with the fourth inning and cover the remainder of the game, as the first three innings were a radio/television simulcast voiced by Vin Scully. Steiner handled television play-by-play on all other games (with analyst Steve Lyons), primarily road contests east of the Rocky Mountains. For the 2009 season, the Dodgers had Steiner and Monday as their radio team for all 162 games, though the Scully simulcast of the first three innings would remain. Starting in 2014, Steiner was paired with Orel Hershiser on the television broadcast for all games Scully did not call, and broadcast on the radio with Monday the other games.
Steiner also used to host Baseball Beat on XM Satellite Radio's MLB Home Plate channel, where they talked exclusively to writers, authors, columnists, broadcasters, or celebrities on their thoughts and analysis of the current state of baseball. Steiner's last episode of Baseball Beat aired on January 16, 2009.
Following Vin Scully's retirement from the Dodgers after the 2016 season, the team split its radio-TV duties between Steiner and Joe Davis, with Steiner remaining on the radio side but switching to television on those occasions Davis has a Fox Sports assignment.
Awards and accomplishments
Steiner, an Emmy Award recipient, was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame on November 9, 2013, becoming the 17th sportscaster admitted into the Hall. In December 2010 they were awarded an honorary Doctorate in Humane Letters from their alma mater Bradley University, where they gave the commencement address. Steiner received the United Press International award for "Best Sportscaster for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut" in 1981, 1983, and 1985. Their football play-by-play work earned them the New York State Broadcasters Association Award for "Best Radio Play-by-Play" in 1983, 1984, and 1987. During their fourteen years at ESPN, Steiner won a CableACE award for a documentary on Muhammad Ali and a Clarion award for their coverage of the Mike Tyson rape trial. Bradley named its school of sports communication for Steiner at a ceremony in March, 2015.

Olearia obcordata is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae and is endemic to Tasmania. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of less than . It usually has wedge-shaped leaves arranged alternately along the branchlets, the narrower end towards the base, with three or five teeth on the ends. The flowers are arranged singly in leaf axils and are few in number with up to six ray florets.
It was first formally described in 1847 by Joseph Dalton Hooker who gave it the name Eurybia obcordata in the London Journal of Botany from specimens collected by Ronald Campbell Gunn. In 1867, George Bentham changed the name to Olearia obcordata in Flora Australiensis. The specific epithet (obcordata) means "inverted heart-shaped".
Olearia obcordata grows in drier mountain areas of Tasmania.

The 1997 UK & Ireland Greyhound Racing Year was the 71st year of greyhound racing in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
Roll of honour
Summary
The National Greyhound Racing Club (NGRC) released the annual returns, with totalisator turnover at £73,754,098 and attendances recorded at 3,523,900 from 5412 meetings.
Some Picture trained by Charlie Lister was voted Greyhound of the Year after winning the 1997 English Greyhound Derby and the 1997 Scottish Greyhound Derby in addition to reaching the 1997 Irish Greyhound Derby final. The black dog was also voted the leading dog in Ireland and won the Irish Dog of the Year and only just missed out on a £100,000 bonus prize offered by sponsors Regal to any greyhound winning the Scottish, English and Irish Derby.
Linda Mullins won the Greyhound Trainer of the Year for the second successive year.
Tracks
The year started badly when on 4 January the London Stadium closed its doors. The stadium had been rebuilt had huge cost and was now subject to rumours of fraud and malpractice. The reasons for administration was subject to investigation and even appeared on 'The Cook Report', a popular TV show hosted by Roger Cook.
On 27 October Eastville Stadium owned by the BS Group was sold for development, plans were announced for a new Bristol greyhound stadium that never came to fruition. The BS Group management switched the entire operation, including trainers, racing office staff and bookmakers forty miles up the M4 to the newly acquired Swindon, bought from British Car Auctions who had owned the track since 1983, even the Bookmakers Afternoon Greyhound Service (BAGS) contract switched to Swindon. Bristol trainers Terry Kibble, Ron Dix, Marjorie Millard and Peter Swadden all moved Swindon.
The racing ended at Dunmore Stadium in March 1997 and the last meeting attracted 3,000 patrons.
News
Catford Racing Manager Jim Snowden left to be General Manager at Portsmouth replacing the retiring Bill Francis. Snowden was replaced by the Assistant Racing Manager Phil Donaldson. In Wimbledon the Merton council produced a feasibility study into putting a football stadium on Wimbledon Stadium which was dismissed by Wimbledon chairperson Sam Hammam. A first season trainer called Seamus Cahill joined Catford.
Competitions
The BBC severed their ties with greyhound racing as they continued to cut their sporting programs. Sky stepped in and would show the TV Trophy for the first time which led to the bizarre scenario whereby the event was held twice; once in April (BBC) and then again in October (Sky). The relationship with Sky was closely guarded by the Greyhound Racing Association who gained the upper hand in negotiations for the industry.
Derby semi-finalist Toms The Best hit a great run of form in the summer winning the Midland Gold Cup at Monmore and the Sussex Cup at Hove before heading for the Irish Derby and claiming the competition for Nick Savva.
Spring Rose continued to perform well, reaching the Grand Prix final at Walthamstow and St Leger final at Wembley but they were upstaged by Tralee Crazy. The white and black bitch trained by Nick Savva won both the Cesarewitch at Catford and the St Leger.
Sheffield (71 points) won the Red Mills Supertrack defeating Walthamstow (64) and Midlenhall (54) in the final.

A primary metabolite is a kind of metabolite that is directly involved in normal growth, development, and reproduction. It usually performs a physiological function in the organism (i.e. an intrinsic function). A primary metabolite is typically present in many organisms or cells. It is also referred to as a central metabolite, which has an even more restricted meaning (present in any autonomously growing cell or organism). Some common examples of primary metabolites include: lactic acid, and certain amino acids. Note that primary metabolites do not show any pharmacological actions or effects.
Conversely, a secondary metabolite is not directly involved in those processes, but usually has an important ecological function (i.e. a relational function). A secondary metabolite is typically present in a taxonomically restricted set of organisms or cells (plants, fungi, bacteria, etc.). Some common examples of secondary metabolites include: ergot alkaloids, antibiotics, naphthalenes, nucleosides, phenazines, quinolines, terpenoids, peptides and growth factors.
Plant growth regulators may be classified as both primary and secondary metabolites due to their role in plant growth and development. Some of them are intermediates between primary and secondary metabolism.

Nigel Sylvester (born August 23, 1987 in Queens, New York) is an American professional BMX athlete;  They are best known for their progressive bicycling skills as well as their digital content featuring their unique BMX stunts and adventures around the globe. Their most notable film series is GO, which gives viewers a first-hand POV of Nigel's riding, featuring some of the most recognizable locations and attractions in the world. Nigel is considered a generational talent; unlike traditional BMX athletes, they do not compete. They built their career through cinematic content and by leveraging their creative expression through the use of social media.
In 2017, Forbes Magazine included Sylvester in the "30 Under 30” list in the sports category. In 2014, they became the first BMX athlete to be featured in the ESPN Body Issue. They were included alongside Venus Williams and Michael Phelps.
Sylvester is sponsored by multiple global brands including Nike, Inc., Mercedes-Benz, Oakley, Inc., Ethika, DFNS, Specialized Bicycle Components, XSET, Buzzfeed, and Animal Bikes.
Sylvester launched their lifestyle and travel video series, GO, in 2015. The film series has over 80 million views, as of October 2020. Their videos are shot entirely from their POV with a GoPro and take fans on an immersive, first-hand view of their riding experiences. This includes BMX as well as other extreme racing: sports cars, go-karts, ATV's, jet ski's, and planes. The first episode in the series launched in their hometown of New York City; it is followed by episodes in LA, Tokyo, Dubai, London to Paris, and Miami. Influential friends across music, entertainment, and sports are featured throughout the series, including Victor Cruz, ASAP Ferg, Nick Young, Jamie Chung, Rob Dyrdek, Steve Aoki, DJ Khaled, Rick Ross, J. Balvin, Ben Baller, Octavian, and Salt Bae. The videos are co-directed by Harrison Boyce. Sylvester continues to expand GO into a lifestyle brand including live events and merchandise.
Brand collaborations
Sylvester has collaborated with Nike on multiple shoe releases throughout their career, with the first one being the Nike SB x Sylvester Dunk High “S.O.M.P.” released in March 2014. The partnership marked the first time Nike SB teamed up with a BMX rider to redesign the iconic sneaker.
In August 2018, Sylvester partnered with the brand again to release a signature Nike Air Jordan 1. This was the first ever collaboration of its kind for a BMX athlete with the Air Jordan brand. The design was heralded as a powerful reflection of their hard work and ambition, with each shoe hand-distressed to reflect the scuff marks on their Air Jordan 1's from when they ride. Nigel does not have breaks on their BMX bicycles and uses the Air Jordan 1's as their breaks. This collaboration also produced a one-of-one BMX bicycle under the jointly formed Jordan Biking Co. label.
In October 2019, Sylvester followed up with another Nike collaboration, this time for the iconic Air Force 1 under the Nike ID program. They based their design around their favorite film, Paid In Full, incorporating the colors and textures featured within the cult-classic movie.
Tapped for their high-speed lifestyle and vivid content, Electronic Arts partnered with Sylvester to promote the release of "Need For Speed Heat" video game in October 2019, featuring the city of Miami. As part of this collaboration, Sylvester formed a crew of drivers including Shiggy, Greg Yuna, and Aleali May to take over the streets of Miami in a fleet of Mercedes-Benz vehicles and produce a series of content.
In May 2019, Sylvester released a one-of-one, and the first official, Fendi BMX bike covered in the iconic Double F Zucca print leather, which was first designed by Karl Lagerfeld in 1965. This collaboration was released as part of their "F is For Fendi" collective and featured Nigel riding this bespoke bicycle in a short film on the top of Fendi Headquarters in Rome.
In March 2018, Sylvester was featured in Samsung's television commercial which aired during the Oscar's to promote its Galaxy S9 smartphone.
In September 2017, Sylvester was featured in the campaign for the Kith x Nike Air Jordan 1 collaboration.

The 3rd Regiment California Volunteer Infantry was an infantry regiment in the Union Army during the American Civil War. This regiment was organized at Stockton and at Benicia Barracks, from October 31 to December 31, 1861, to serve three years. The regiment was first commanded by Colonel Patrick Edward Connor. After the formation of the regiment at Stockton, four companies were sent to Humboldt County during the month of November, 1861. During the month of July, 1862, Colonel Connor was sent, with their regiment, to the District of Utah, in which it was on duty for the balance of its term of service.
It spent its entire term of service in the western United States. Its largest engagement was the Bear River Massacre or Battle of Bear River on January 29, 1863, in southeastern Washington Territory (present-day Franklin County, Idaho).
On the expiration of its term of service, the original members of the regiment (except veterans) were mustered out, and the veterans and new recruits were consolidated into a battalion of four companies on October 29, 1864, and was afterwards known as the Third Battalion of Infantry, comprising companies, A, B, C, and D. On December 9, 1865, Companies C and D were consolidated, leaving only three companies in the battalion. The battalion was finally mustered out July 27, 1866.

During July 1862 it was en route to Fort Ruby, Nevada, where it arrived August 1, 1862. Early in January 1863 it was at Camp Douglas, where it remained until it finally mustered out, July 27, 1866.
Company A, was organized at Stockton, October 31, 1861, and went to Benicia Barracks in December, 1861. It went to Fort Baker, in Humboldt County, California, during the month of December, 1861.
On April 6, 1862 Captain Ketcham, with a scouting party of Company A, found the rancheria of the Indians that had previously robbed Cooper's Mills of two thousand five hundred pounds of flour near Yager Creek. The Indians had just fled, leaving seven hundred pounds of the flour, together with belting from the mill, mill files, baskets, bullets, lead, shot pouches, bullet molds, etc., all of which were burned, there being no means of packing them.
On the April 27, Captain Ketcham, of Company A, returned to Fort Baker from a scout to the southward of Van Dusen Fork, with twenty-four Indian prisoners, all women and children, except two young men. In attacking the rancheria four Indians were killed, including a woman, shot by mistake. During the scout Captain Ketcham came upon a rancheria which had been fortified by piles of logs around it, but which the Indians had deserted.
On the same day Lieutenant Staples, with a detachment of the same company, came upon a large band of Indians by surprise (having previously managed to kill their scout or sentinel without giving alarm); killed fifteen of them and took forty prisoners, three of whom they left behind, being unable to travel.

Reproductive labor or work is often associated with care giving and domestic housework roles including cleaning, cooking, child care, and the unpaid domestic labor force. The term has taken on a role in feminist philosophy and discourse as a way of calling attention to how women in particular are assigned to the domestic sphere, where the labor is reproductive and thus uncompensated and unrecognized in a capitalist system. These theories have evolved as a parallel of histories focusing on the entrance of women into the labor force in the 1970s, providing an intersectionalist approach that recognizes that women have been a part of the labor force since before their incorporation into mainstream industry if reproductive labor is considered. Some Marxist anthropologists and economists such as George Caffentzis have gone as far as to suggest that reproductive labor creates value in a similar way to the way in which productive labor creates value, by increasing the value of labor power.
Definitions
The division between productive and unproductive labor is stressed by some Marxist feminists including Margaret Benston and Peggy Morton. These theories specify that while productive labor results in goods or services that have monetary value in the capitalist system and are thus compensated by the producers in the form of a paid wage, reproductive labor is associated with the private sphere and involves anything that people have to do for themselves that is not for the purposes of receiving a wage (i.e. cleaning, cooking, having children). These interpretations argue that while both forms of labor are necessary, people have different access to these forms of labor based on certain aspects of their identity.
These theories argue that both public and private institutions exploit the labor of women as an inexpensive method of supporting a work force. For the producers, this means higher profits. For the nuclear family, the power dynamic dictates that domestic work is exclusively to be completed by the woman of the household thus liberating the rest of the members from their own necessary reproductive labor. Marxist feminists argue that the exclusion of women from productive labor leads to male control in both private and public domains.
The concept of reproductive labor as it relates to cleaning, cooking, child care, and the paid domestic labor force has been written about and discussed in writing and history prior to the term being codified. This includes works like Virginia Woolf's essay, "A Room of One's Own".
A distinction has been made between nurturant and non nurturant reproductive labor. Nurturant reproductive labor jobs include positions in childcare, domestic work, and healthcare. Non nurturant reproductive labor includes jobs in food preparation and cleaning. Minority men, specifically black and Hispanic men, make up the majority of non nurturant reproductive laborers. Nurturant reproductive labor jobs are more likely than non nurturant to have women fill the positions for low wages. There is a gendered division in nurturant labor. In healthcare men are likely to be seen as surgeons while women are likely to have the positions of medical assistants and registered nurses.
Wages for housework
Focusing on exclusion from productive labor as the most important source of female oppression, some Marxist feminists devoted their activism to fighting for the inclusion of domestic work within the waged capitalist economy. The idea of creating compensated reproductive labor was present in the writings of socialists such as Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1898) who argued that women's oppression stemmed from being forced into the private sphere. Gilman proposed that conditions for women would improve when their work was located, recognized, and valued in the public sphere.
Perhaps the most influential of the efforts to compensate reproductive labor was the International Wages for Housework Campaign, an organization launched in Italy in 1972 by members of the International Feminist Collective. Many of these women, including Selma James, Mariarosa Dalla Costa, Brigitte Galtier, and Silvia Federici published a range of sources to promote their message in academic and public domains. Despite the efforts beginning with a relatively small group of women in Italy, The Wages for Housework Campaign was successful in mobilizing on an international level. A Wages for Housework group was founded in Brooklyn, New York with the help of Federici. As Heidi Hartmann acknowledges (1981), the efforts of these movements, though ultimately unsuccessful, generated important discourse regarding the value of housework and its relation to the economy.
Universal Basic Income has been proposed as a possible solution.
Sharing reproductive labor
Another solution proposed by Marxist feminists is to liberate women from their forced connection to reproductive labor. In their critique of traditional Marxist feminist movements such as the Wages for Housework Campaign, Heidi Hartmann (1981) argues that these efforts "take as their question the relationship of women to the economic system, rather than that of women to men, apparently assuming the latter will be explained in their discussion of the former." Hartmann (1981) believes that traditional discourse has ignored the importance of women's oppression as women, and instead focused on women's oppression as members of the capitalist system. Similarly, Gayle Rubin, who has written on a range of subjects including sadomasochism, prostitution, pornography, and lesbian literature as well as anthropological studies and histories of sexual subcultures, first rose to prominence through their 1975 essay ''"The Traffic in Women: Notes on the 'Political Economy' of Sex"'', in which they coin the phrase "sex/gender system" and criticizes Marxism for what they claim is its incomplete analysis of sexism under capitalism, without dismissing or dismantling Marxist fundamentals in the process.
More recently, many Marxist feminists have shifted their focus to the ways in which women are now potentially in worse conditions after gaining access to productive labor. Nancy Folbre (1994) proposes that feminist movements begin to focus on women's subordinate status to men both in the reproductive (private) sphere, and in the workplace (public sphere). In an interview in 2013, Silvia Federici urges feminist movements to consider the fact that many women are now forced into productive and reproductive labor, resulting in a "double day". Federici (2013) argues that the emancipation of women still cannot occur until they are free from their burdens of unwaged labor, which they propose will involve institutional changes such as closing the wage gap and implementing child care programs in the workplace. Federici's (2013) suggestions are echoed in a similar interview with Selma James (2012) and these issues have been touched on in recent presidential elections.
International division
Evelyn Nakano Glenn provided the insight that reproductive labor was divided based on race and ethnicity, a pattern they called the "racial division of reproductive labor." Industrialization in the nineteenth century morphed society's roles assigned to men and women, with men being seen as the primary breadwinners for their family and women as homemaker. However, many middle-class white families in the United States were able to afford to outsource some of the more unpleasant household chores to domestic servants. This racial and ethnic background of the women hired in these roles varied by location. In the Northeast United States, European immigrants, mainly from Germany or Ireland, made up the majority of domestic servants until the beginning of the twentieth century. Throughout time, as the social status of the role declined and the overall working conditions worsened it started to become more racially stratified. The role was mainly taken on by African American women in the South, Mexicans in the Southwest, and Japanese people in northern California and Hawaii. In addition to workers in this position making low wages, they were also often treated as subordinates by their employer, the woman of the house, and the only women that would take these jobs did so because there were no other opportunities available to them. There was an ideology produced that said Black and Latina women were “made” to work and serve for white families as domestic workers. This changed in the late 20th century, where the amount of women working as domestic servants first declined due to modernization, development, and an increase in other job opportunities for the women previously taking on this role However, Saskia Sassen-Koob explained that when the economy shifted to service based, it created a demand for immigrant women because low wage jobs were made available in developed countries. Mainly these roles were being taken on largely by immigrants from Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.These jobs drew a female workforce to them because of the low wage, so that they are viewed as “women's jobs.” Drawing on the work of Glenn and Sassen-Koob's work, Parrenas brought together Glenn's ideas about the racial division of reproductive labor and Sassen-Koob's ideas about feminization and globalization and used them to analyze paid reproductive work.
The term international division of reproductive labor was coined by Rhacel Parrenas in their book, Servants of Globalization: Migrants and Domestic Work, where they discuss Filipino migrant domestic workers. The international division of reproductive labor involves a transfer of labor among three actors in a developed and developing country. It refers to three tiers: wealthier upper class women who use the migrants to take care of domestic work and the lower class who stay back home to watch the migrant's children. The wealthier women in developed countries have entered the workforce at greater numbers which has led to them having more responsibilities inside and outside of the home. These women are able to hire help and use this privilege of race and class to transfer their reproductive labor responsibilities over to a less privileged woman. Migrant women maintain a hierarchy over their family members and other women who stay back to watch the migrant's children. Parrenas' research explains that the sexual division of labor remains in reproductive labor since women are the ones migrating to work as domestic workers in developed countries.
Parrenas argues that the international division of reproductive labor arose out of globalization and capitalism. Components of globalization including privatization and feminization of labor also contributed to the rise of this division of labor. They explain that globalization has led to reproductive labor to be comodified and demanded internationally. Sending countries are stuck with losing valuable labor while receiving countries take advantage of this labor to grow their economies. Parrenas highlights the role United States colonialism and the International Monetary Fund play in developing countries, such as the Philippines, becoming exporters of migrant workers. This explanation of the root of the concept is crucial because it explains that the financial inequalities the women across the three tiers face are rooted in the economy.
The concept has been expanded by others and applied to locations other than the Philippines where Parrenas conducted their research. In a study done in Guatemala and Mexico, instead of a global transfer of labor, a more local transfer was done between the women who work in the labor force and those other women relatives who take care of the children. A “new international division of reproductive labor” is said to have occurred in Singapore because of outsourcing and taking advantage of a low skilled labor force which has led to the international division of reproductive labor. In order to maintain a strong, growing economy in Southeast Asia, this transfer of reproductive labor is needed. In Singapore, hiring migrant help is a necessity to sustain the economy and the Singaporean woman's status.

Ekman-Larsson began their career at the Tingsryds AIF hockey club of the HockeyAllsvenskan during the 2007–08 season, recording 8 points in 27 games. They continued their career with Leksands IF, where they scored 44 points in two seasons in 2008–09 and 2009–10 in a total of 81 games. This season would be their last, as they would they drafted by the National Hockey League's Phoenix Coyotes.
Phoenix / Arizona Coyotes (2010–2021)
Ekman-Larsson was selected sixth overall by Phoenix in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. On 24 May 2010, it was announced the Coyotes had signed Ekman-Larsson to an entry-level contract. In the season following their draft selection, Ekman-Larsson produced the second-most points among junior players in the Allsvenskan, despite missing several games while competing in the 2010 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships for Sweden.
Ekman-Larsson recorded their first career NHL point through an assist on a Kyle Turris goal on 23 October 2010. They scored their first career NHL goal on 17 January 2011, against goaltender Antti Niemi of the San Jose Sharks.
For the duration of the 2012–13 NHL lockout, Ekman-Larsson (on the last year of their entry-level contract) was assigned to Phoenix's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Portland Pirates.
On 6 March 2014, Ekman-Larsson scored their 100th NHL career point in a 5–2 victory over the Montreal Canadiens. With Ekman-Larsson's contribution, it was the first time since 9 December 1998 the Coyotes had defeated Montreal. At the conclusion of the 2013–14 season, Ekman-Larsson finished seventh in balloting for the James Norris Memorial Trophy, awarded annually to the NHL's top defenceman during the regular season. Their votes included three first-place votes, one second-place vote and two third-place votes. On 16 December 2014, during the 2014–15 season, Ekman-Larsson tied the Coyotes' franchise record for overtime-winning goals by a player in a single season after scoring their third of the season with 0.03 seconds left in overtime in a 2–1 win over the Edmonton Oilers. Ekman-Larsson represented Arizona in the 2015 NHL All-Star Game, assisting on a goal by Bobby Ryan. Ekman-Larsson finished the 2014–15 season with 23 goals and 20 assists. With this career milestone, Ekman-Larsson broke Nicklas Lidström's NHL record, becoming the first Swedish-born defenceman in NHL history to score more than 20 goals in one season. Ekman-Larsson's 23 goals were the most scored by an NHL defenceman that season and tied Phil Housley's franchise record for most goals scored by a defenceman in a season.
On 29 January 2015, during a game against the Toronto Maple Leafs, Ekman-Larsson scored the fastest shorthanded goal to start a period in NHL history, against Jonathan Bernier five seconds into the third period. On 19 December 2015, during a game against the New York Islanders, Ekman-Larsson scored the lone goal of the game, which proved to be the game-winning goal. With this goal, Ekman-Larsson surpassed Teppo Numminen's franchise record for the most game-winning goals by a defenceman with the 20th in their career. On 12 January 2016, Ekman-Larsson assisted on all three goals of rookie Max Domi's first career hat-trick, and would later go on to set a career-high four-point night by scoring the overtime-winning goal against the Edmonton Oilers. On 24 March, Ekman-Larsson inadvertently scored the game-winning goal in a 3–1 win over the Dallas Stars. Initially credited to teammate Martin Hanzal, after further review the goal was shown to bounce off a Dallas player and into the net. With this game-winning goal, Ekman-Larsson set an NHL record for the most game-winning goals by a defenceman in a single season with eight, surpassing Tim Horton, Al MacInnis, Ray Bourque, Derek Morris and Dion Phaneuf. They became just the second defenceman in franchise history to record 20 or more goals in consecutive seasons, after Phil Housley. Ekman-Larsson finished the 2015–16 season ninth in balloting for the James Norris Memorial Trophy.
In the 2016–17 season, on 18 March 2017, during a game against the Nashville Predators, Ekman-Larsson scored their 40th career powerplay goal (against Pekka Rinne), tying Fredrik Olausson for the most by a defenceman in Arizona Coyotes/Winnipeg Jets history. On 3 April 2017, with the Coyotes out of playoff contention, Ekman-Larsson was granted a leave of absence for the remaining three regular seasons games in order to return to their native Sweden due to the death of their mother, following a prolonged battle with cancer.
On 14 October 2017, in a game against the Boston Bruins, Ekman-Larsson scored their first powerplay goal of the season against Anton Khudobin and moved ahead of Fredrik Olausson for the franchise record for powerplay goals scored by a defenceman with their 41st. On 10 January 2018, Ekman-Larsson was selected as the lone Coyotes representative at the 2018 NHL All-Star Game. On 10 March, Ekman-Larsson was fined $5,000 for slashing Sven Andrighetto. After the regular season concluded and the Coyotes again failed to make the playoffs, Ekman-Larsson was nominated for the King Clancy Memorial Trophy, awarded to the player who best exemplifies leadership qualities on and off the ice and gives back to their community. On 1 July 2018, Ekman-Larsson signed an eight-year, $66 million contract extension with the Coyotes; they were set to become a free agent the following season. They were later named captain of the Coyotes.
Vancouver Canucks (2021–present)
On 23 July 2021, Ekman-Larsson waived their no-movement clause and was traded, along with Conor Garland, to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for Jay Beagle, Loui Eriksson, Antoine Roussel, a 2021 first-round pick (Dylan Guenther), a 2022 second-round pick and a 2023 seventh-round pick. Arizona retained twelve percent of Ekman-Larsson's salary as part of the transaction. They scored their first goal as a Canuck on October 13, 2021 in a 3-2 shootout loss to the Edmonton Oilers. On April 7, 2022, Ekman-Larsson played their first game back at the Arizona Coyotes and got an assist in a 5-1 win.
International play
Ekman-Larsson represented Sweden at the 2010 World Junior Championships, where they were the highest-scoring defenceman on the team, scoring five points in six games.
At the 2010 World Championships, Ekman-Larsson played in nine games for the bronze medalists and was deemed to be Sweden's best player in the game against Norway.
In 2019, at the 2019 World Championships, Ekman-Larsson was named captain of Sweden's international team.
Personal life
Ekman-Larsson's maternal grandfather, Kenneth Ekman, also a defenceman, was selected to represent Sweden at the 1972 Winter Olympics. Swedish international footballer Amanda Ilestedt is Ekman-Larsson's cousin. Ekman-Larsson's younger brother, Kevin, was previously signed with the Coyotes' AHL affiliate, the Tucson Roadrunners. They now play in Sweden with second-tier club BIK Karlskoga.
In 2013, Ekman-Larsson founded OEL, a luxury clothing line based in Sweden. Ekman-Larsson donates a lot of their free time as well as free tickets to Arizona Coyote games to various charities like Big Brothers Big Sisters, the Arizona Burn Foundation, the Wounded Warrior Project and Best Buddies. In 2017 Ekman-Larsson lost their mom to cancer mid-season. In 2019 Ekman-Larsson and fellow Arizona Coyotes welcomed a terminal cancer patient Leighton Arcardo into the organization, with Ekman-Larsson insisting they do the team's face-off. In 2019, they sold their $6.5 million house in Paradise Valley, Arizona to Milwaukee Brewers left fielder Christian Yelich.

Keki Abdi Pasha (sometimes spelled 'Abidi; died April 1789, Aleppo) was an Ottoman statesman. They served as the governor of the Sanjak of İçel (1779–80, 1781–82), Adana Eyalet (1780–81), Diyarbekir Eyalet (1782–84, 1785, 1786), Aleppo Eyalet (1784), Rakka Eyalet (1784–85), Sivas Eyalet (1785–86), and Egypt Eyalet (1787–88, 1789).
Background
Earlier in their career, they served as kapıcıbaşı (master of ceremonies) for the Ottoman sultan. They became a vizier in 1782.
Governorship of Aleppo
Abdi Pasha was appointed as the governor of Aleppo Eyalet by the sultan in 1784. Upon taking office, their militias killed several Janissaries. They then had the leaders of Aleppo's Christian communities arrested and ordered them to wear special clothing, only reversing this upon receiving a heavy fee from them. The local Janissaries began to fight back and barricaded Abdi Pasha in the governor's palace, which they were only able to leave through the mediation of their kadı (judge). They were then expelled from Aleppo, going to Rakka (modern Raqqa, Syria), where they soon became governor. Aleppo would remain without a governor for just over a year after their expulsion.
Campaign in Egypt
In 1786, while Abdi Pasha was the governor of Diyarbekir Eyalet, the Kapudan Pasha (grand admiral of the Ottoman Navy) Cezayirli Gazi Hasan Pasha was ordered by the sultan Abdülhamid I to take troops to Egypt and drive out the Mamluk emirs led by Ibrahim Bey (Mamluk) and Murad Bey, who had become de facto rulers of the province, frequently deposing the Ottoman governors at their pleasure.
As grand admiral Hasan Pasha moved towards Egypt, Abdi Pasha and their troops joined him. While waiting for the emirs to appear in order to engage them in battle on 24 October 1786, the news reached Abdi Pasha that the sultan had appointed them to be the governor of Egypt. However, Abdi Pasha wished to continue commanding their troops, so they told grand admiral Hasan Pasha that they could not take office until the Mamluks had been defeated and set out with their army to find them, leaving Hasan Pasha to continue being the de facto governor. Soon, their troops located the Mamluk emirs and defeated them in battle, causing celebration in Egypt.
Governorship of Egypt
After the Mamluk emirs were defeated, which would prove to be temporary, Abdi Pasha entered the Cairo Citadel and took office as governor of Egypt on 30 April 1787 while the pro-Ottoman Mamluk Emir Ismail Bey became Shaykh al-Balad (civil governor) and de facto ruler.
On 2 December 1788, a courier arrived from Istanbul, the Ottoman capital, that Abdi Pasha had been replaced as governor by Ismail Pasha the Tripolitanian, the former kethüda (deputy or assistant) of Kapudan Pasha Cezayirli Gazi Hasan Pasha. When the Mamluk emirs, who had secured a negotiation with Abdi Pasha as to their power, found out that they had been replaced by Ismail Pasha, they refused to honor the deal. Abdi Pasha, angry over their dismissal and this turn of events, sent agents to Istanbul to persuade the sultan to reappoint them as governor. This was successful, and within a month, on 3 January 1789, news arrived that Abdi Pasha had been reappointed the governor of Egypt and that they should drive the Mamluk emirs out of southern (Upper) Egypt.
However, less than a month later, on 30 January 1789, messengers from Istanbul appeared carrying an order for the re-dismissal of Abdi Pasha and the reappointment of Ismail Pasha, this being the result of the persuasions of Cezayirli Gazi Hasan Pasha, Ismail Pasha's former superior and friend, who had undone what Abdi Pasha's agents had done to have them reappointed. Now governor again, Ismail Pasha had Abdi Pasha's accounts audited and found that they owed money to the provincial treasury, which Abdi Pasha negotiated to half of the original amount. They paid the sum and prepared to leave Cairo.
Abdi Pasha left Egypt on 30 March 1789, headed for Diyarbekir (modern Diyarbakır), in order to gather troops to fight against the Russian Empire in the Russo-Turkish War (1787–92).
Death
After gathering troops for the war with Russia, they traveled to Aleppo that same month (March) and died there in April.

Kunta Kinteh Island, formerly called James Island and St Andrew's Island, is an island in the Gambia River, from the river mouth and near Juffureh in the Republic of the Gambia. Fort James is located on the island. It is less than 3.2 km (2 miles) from Albreda on the river's northern bank. As an important historical site in the West African slave trade, it is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, together with related sites including a ruined Portuguese chapel and a colonial warehouse in Albreda, the Maurel Frères Building in Juffureh, and Fort Bullen and Six-Gun Battery, which are located at the mouth of the Gambia River.
History
The first record of European interaction with the island is in May 1456, when a Portuguese expedition led by Italian explorers Alvise Cadamosto and Antoniotto Usodimare moored off the island. They buried one of their sailors, named Andrew, on the island, giving it its first European name—St Andrew's Island. Diogo Gomes also anchored off St Andrew's Island on their expedition in 1458. A Portuguese settlement, San Domingo, was built on the northern bank of Gambia River, opposite St Andrew's Island, in the 15th century.
The first European settlers on the island came from the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, a vassal state of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, who also had other colonial possessions in the area, although the English Crown had granted the island to two separate companies in 1588 and 1618. In 1651, the settlers built a fort that they named Jacob Fort after Jacob Kettler, Duke of Courland, and used it as a trade base. Major Fock, a Courland soldier, was placed in charge of the first settlement and oversaw the construction of fortifications on St Andrew's Island, which were built following the recognised contemporary rules of military engineering. The main building was in the shape of a rectangle, and was flanked at each corner by a bastion, each of which was triangular. However, the fort had no water supply, and was forced to rely on the good will of the King of Barra in order to stay operational.
It was the intention of the Duke of Courland to establish a permanent settlement on St Andrew's Island, and so married couples were sent out to the island as well as a pastor. The first pastor was Gottschalk Eberling, who was replaced in 1655 by Joachim Dannefeld. The island had a small church built out of cane and with a thatched roof, from which Eberling and Dannefeld preached. There was a supposed deposit of gold at the river, so the Duke of Courland resolved to launch a full expedition to the Gambia. As few Courlanders had experience of Africa, they were forced to rely on foreigners. On 6 September 1652, they appointed the Dutchman Jacob du Moulin as their Director in the Gambia, while a Courlander, Frederick William Trotta von Treyden was appointed as their lieutenant.
Three ships, the Crocodile, the Patientia, and the Chur, were placed at Moulin's disposal. There were a number of issues with the expedition, and in December 1652, Treyden wrote to the Duke of Courland describing Moulin as a "light-hearted knave". After setting sail in March 1653, the expedition shortly after ran out of supplies and was forced to return. Moulin was subsequently arrested for their various misdeeds, including embezzling the Duke's money. A second expedition was attempted in 1654, under the command of a Danish explorer, Philip von Seitz. However, Seitz abandoned the expedition in Hamburg, managing to extract 15,000 rixdollars from the Duke.
After these two failed expeditions, the Duke turned to their own people. Captain Otto Stiel, a Courlander who had previously visited the Gambia, was appointed as its Governor and as Commandant of St Andrew's Island. In 1658, the Duke of Courland and their family were captured by a Swedish mercenary after becoming embroiled in the “Deluge”, the Swedish invasion of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and communication between Courland and St Andrew's Island was cut off for around two years.
As a result of this, the Dutch West India Company made an agreement with the Duke's representative in Holland, Henry Momber, by which it would both resupply and take over St Andrew's Island. Momber agreed, in the absence of any instructions from the Duke. The Dutch sent a ship of soldiers to the island to seize it. Stiel objected, but on learning that the Dutch West India Company would guarantee them their pay, the garrison mutinied and returned to Holland on the ship that had brought out the new garrison.
In 1660, the Dutch lost control of the island after a French privateer in Swedish service had surprised the fort at night, expelled the garrison and plundered the island. The privateer subsequently met a merchant ship of the Groningen chamber of the Dutch West India Company, who, in a breakdown of communications, refused to buy back the island and said that it belonged to the Duke of Courland, rather than the Amsterdam chamber of the same company. Momber got in touch with Stiel, who had been living in Holland, and they traveled back to St Andrew's Island in a ship provided by the Groningen chamber.
Several weeks later, three ships of the Amsterdam chamber anchored off the island and demanded that Stiel surrender. They refused, and the Dutch effected a landing, bringing a large amount of firepower to bear on the fort. With only a handful of men, Stiel was forced to surrender. However, when the King of Barra saw Stiel evicted again, they decided to come to their aid by capturing a party of Dutchmen who had landed at Juffure for fresh water. The King demanded that Stiel be re-instated and was joined by a large number of other native kingdoms, including the King of Kombo. The Dutch relented after a four-week stand-off, and the commander of the fort left it without provisions and partially destroyed before turning it back over to Stiel and the Courlanders. Over the next eight months, the garrison was reduced to just seven Europeans.
The Dutch briefly held the fort from 1659 until the English captured it in 1661. The Dutch ceded the fort to the English in 1664.
The English renamed the island James Island and the fort Fort James after James, the Duke of York, later King James II of England. The chartered Royal Adventurers in Africa Company administered the territory, which used it first for the gold and ivory trade, and later in the slave trade. On 1 August 1669, the company sublet the administration to the Gambia Adventurers. In 1684, the Royal African Company took over the Gambia's administration.
In 1695, the French captured Fort James after a battle with English sailors, but by 1702, Fort James was once again definitively under English control. It was destroyed and rebuilt several times in this period, both in conflicts between the English and French and by pirates. On 13 June 1750, the Company of Merchants Trading to Africa assumed the administration of the Gambia. Between 1758 and 1779, the Gambia was part of British Senegambia.
The Six-Gun Battery (1816) and Fort Bullen (1826), now included in the James Island UNESCO World Heritage Site and located on both sides of the mouth of the River Gambia, were built with the specific intent of thwarting the slave trade once it had become illegal in the British Empire after the passing of the Slave Trade Act in 1807. They are the only known defensive structures in the region built to stop slaving interests, as opposed to enforcing them. These sites along with the island itself were abandoned in 1870.
On 6 February 2011, at the request of New York artist Chaz Guest to Gambian President Yahya Jammeh, it was renamed to Kunta Kinteh Island to give the island a Gambian name. At the renaming ceremony, Guest revealed the miniature replica of their 9-m (30-foot) statue of Kunta Kinte that would be displayed on Kunta Kinte Island.
Legacy
Kunta Kinteh Island is suffering heavy erosion, and is now approximately 1/6 of its size during the time when the fort was active. Ruins of several of the British administrative buildings (including a single cell, apparently used to house the most troublesome captives), a small jetty and a number of skeletal baobab trees remain. The ruins have been stabilised and protected by a capping. Because the island is low-lying, during high tide and storms sometimes waves will beat against some of the surviving structures.
Kunta Kinte, a character described in Alex Haley's book and TV series Roots, has become associated with James Island. The book states that Kunta Kinte was among 98 slaves that the slave ship Lord Ligonier brought to Annapolis, Maryland in 1767.

The Saint Helena crake (Zapornia astrictocarpus) is an extinct bird species from the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean, one of two flightless rails which survived there until the early 16th century.
After American ornithologist Alexander Wetmore described bones of the large Saint Helena rail (Aphanocrex podarces) from Prosperous Bay, Saint Helena, in 1963, American paleontologist Storrs Olson found almost complete skeletons of the Saint Helena crake in the same region in 1973. These skeletons consist of bones which were smaller than the bones of Aphanocrex podarces. Due to the peculiar shape of the carpometacarpus Olson named this species Porzana astrictocarpus.
Olson proceeded on the assumption that the Saint Helena crake was a derivative of the Baillon's crake (Zapornia pusilla), which is widespread in Europe and Africa. As there were no predators on Saint Helena, it had lost its ability to fly. However, when Saint Helena was colonised around 1502, the settlers brought a lot of mammals to the island, leading to the out-competition and eventual extinction of the Saint Helena crake.

Crepidotus praecipuus, is a species of fungi in the family Crepidotaceae first described in 2018. It is commonly known as a rusty-gilled conch, along with other kidney shaped, rusty-brown spored species of Crepidotus. It is saprobic on wood, like other Crepidotus species.
Description
Cap: The cap (pileus) of C. praecipuus is generally about 1-7 cm in diameter and is convex in shape with an even margin that curls inwards. The cap can range from flabelliform too semicircular to kidney-shaped depending on the surface from which they grow. If they grow on a vertical surface, they are more likely to form a typical shelf-like structure, appearing in the commonly described ‘kidney' shape while visually remaining semicircular from above. This shape is different if they protrude from underneath their substrate material, usually a log, appearing instead more circular and as if the point of attachment is directly on top of the cap surface. The cap surface is covered in fibrillose scales that range yellowish-brown to brown in colour. To one side the cap has a tomentellous (finely felted) surface. This scaly side is where the stipeless cap laterally attaches to substrate.
Gills: On the underside, the gills (lamellae) appear somewhat fringed and are classified as free (see description box) with no stipe to connect to. The colour of the gills depends on the maturity of the spores ranging from off-white when young to yellow-brown/rusty-brown as the spores mature.
Spores: The spore print is yellow-brown, reflecting the colour of the gills. The ellipsoid-shaped basidiospore of C. praecipuus are 6.3-7.8 by 5.1-6.6 µm in size and are described as having smooth exteriors to their thick walls. The top of the basidiospore (apex) can be blunt, depressed or periodically pointed. (See figure 2.)
Basidium: The basidia of C. praecipuus is 26-65 by 4-14 μm in size, club-shaped, cylindrical with four spores attached to the top of each basidium top.
Basidiomata: C. praecipuus can have a basidiomata that is relatively larger than other species (see similar species), ranging from 1 -7 cm in length. Being a defining characteristic, it helps set C. praecipuus apart from other species.
Absent features- No stipe (stem) or annulus (ring).
Distribution
C. praecipuus has been recorded in 3 countries as of 2022: New Zealand, Australia, and South Korea.
In New Zealand, Landcare Research has declared the species as indigenous but non-endemic because C. praecipuus is also present in Australia.
In 2021, the Ministry of Environment of South Korea reported this species was found on the island of Daecheongdo which is 210 km northwest from land in the Yellow Sea. This island was completely cleared through bombing in the Korean War in 1950. Because there has been no artificial reforestation since the 1970s, all that is currently there has been naturally established.
Habitat
In the southern hemisphere C. praecipuus is generally found in southern beech forests on dead woody material. The forests in which C. praecipuus is found in Korea are primarily made up of Carpinus turczaninoxii, Camellia japonica and Quercus sp. with a high distribution of pine trees (Pinus densiflora) throughout these forests. However, in these sorts of forests in Korea, C. praecipuus has only been found on dead deciduous branches.
Ecology
Despite being found on woody material, C. praecipuus is not parasitic as the spores only establish themselves on dead material, not when the organism is alive. Saprotrophic fungi like C. praecipuus are important to their habitat because they can decompose organic material into different molecules that can be reused by other organisms while also clearing space for them.
Life cycle
Fruiting season: Autumn (May in New Zealand, September in Korea) and on occasion after spells of warm rains.
The mushroom part of the fungus, the part that is most often used to identify the organism, is only the fruiting body. Fruiting occurs only at certain times per year to disperse basidiospores; otherwise the majority of the organism remains generally out of sight within its substrate.
The initial release of spores is triggered with various climatic fluctuations such as water drops hitting the cap, shaking the spores from their basidium, mist triggering the detachment and wind picking up spores off the gills. The spores can then travel at high altitudes over vast distances including entire oceans. The distance the spore travels in total usually depends on mass of the spore and the velocity of travel. The travel ends the same way it begins: with a steady rain clearing the atmosphere of most suspended particles.
Once the spore lands on an adequate substrate it germinates through its apex in the presence of water and continues to grow outwards in all directions through the substrate. The hypha behind the tip is continuously dying due to nutrition only being obtained from the tip. Once the hypha finds another mycelium of the same species it fuses with it and creates a mushroom body in its fruiting season.
Taxonomy
C. praecipuus is closely related to C. tobolensis, C. macedonicus and C. lutescens; these species sometimes are mistaken for each other. Less closely related is the North American C. croceitinctus and the European C. cesatii. C. praecipuus has no subspecies and it can be told apart from other species by appearance.
Similar species and genera
Crepidotus tobolensis : Although C. tobolensis can look almost identical to C. praecipuus with its brightly pigmented cap, the major differences are visible under a microscope. C. tobolensis has a smaller basidiomata length at 0.7-4.3 cm long; however, C. tobolensis produces on average 22% more spores than C. praecipuus. C. tobolensis also differs in distribution to C. praecipuus appearing in the Tyumen Region of Russia.
Crepidotus macedonicus : C. macedonicus has a more muted cap colour yet its main difference from C. praecipuus is in its spore characteristics. C. macedonicus has a spore quantity similar to that of C. tobolensis, in addition to a more elongated shape that sets it apart from not only C. praecipuus but also C. lutescens.
Crepidotus lutescens : C. lutescens is a Chinese species of this genus that primarily differentiates itself from C. praecipuus by its basidomata size as its spore shape can resemble that of C. praecipuus.
Conchomyces bursaeformis (common name Ivory conch): Similar in size, the white spore print is a clear indicator as its heavily reduced but present (0.1 cm in length) stipe can make it difficult to identify what genus and species it is.

Jack Goff (born 6 March 1991) is a British auto racing driver. They were the 2012 Renault Clio Cup United Kingdom champion. They made their debut in the British Touring Car Championship on 31 March 2013 at Brands Hatch, driving for RCIB Insurance Racing.
The 2017 and 2018 British Touring Car Championship seasons saw Jack driving for Eurotech Racing in a Honda Civic Type R. In 2019, Jack will be racing for Team HARD, after a last minute deal saw them replace Mike Bushell.
Racing career
Renault Clio Cup UK
Goff joined the Renault Clio Cup United Kingdom championship for the 2010 season, securing a drive with Team Pyro after comparing well with race winner Dave Newsham in testing.
They remained in the championship in 2011. Goff stayed with the championship contenders for much of the season, and they took their maiden victory in the championship at Oulton Park. They later added a double win at Rockingham, but their results were not enough to mount a title challenge and they ended the season fifth in the championship, 52 points shy of fourth placed driver James Dixon.
Goff remained in the championship for 2012, finishing in the top five in the first eight races of the year, including wins at Brands Hatch and Donington Park. Goff was leading the title challenge at the halfway point of the season but their nearest rival Paul Rivett took four consecutive wins after the mid-season break, at Snetterton and Rockingham. Both endured a poor weekend at Silverstone meaning the title would be decided at Brands Hatch a fortnight later; with Rivett retiring in the first race, Goff took the title in the second race of the weekend by nine points.

RCIB Insurance Racing/CHROME Edition Restart Racing (2013–2014)
On 19 December 2012, it was announced that Goff would drive an NGTC Vauxhall Insignia for Team HARD in the 2013 British Touring Car Championship season. This came just over a month after they tested the car at Silverstone. Two minutes into qualifying for the first round at Brands Hatch, they collided with Colin Turkington who had spun on the exit of Druids and was stationary on the racing line. They hadn't set a time and started at the back of the grid for the first race. Jack finished 17th in the Drivers Championship.
2014 arrived and Goff stayed with the Insignia for the first 5 rounds, however this time racing under the Team BMR outfit. Come round 6 at Snetterton, Goff swapped their Insignia for a VW CC Passat. Goff achieved 10 top ten finishes during the year and finished 14th in the Championship.
MG 5-Star Cases Racing (2015)
It was reported that Jack Goff would be joining Triple Eight Racing for the 2015 British Touring Car Championship season alongside Andrew Jordan. This was the year when Jack got their first win in the BTCC in race 3 at Snetterton. This year, Jack also got 21 top ten finishes and 4 podiums including their maiden victory. They finished 9th in the Championship overall.
Team IHG Rewards Club (2016)
It was confirmed that Jack Goff would be joining West Surrey Racing and Team IHG Rewards Club for the 2016 British Touring Car Championship season and be driving a BMW 125i M Sport. The first event of the season at Brands Hatch went well for Goff as they came away with a podium in the last race of the day, finishing 3rd. Goff also had a good time at Knockhill in the first race finishing 2nd behind Jason Plato in the new Silverline Subaru. But as all drivers have bad weekends, Goff's came at Rockingham. The problems started in Qualifying for all 3 of the cars when rain got into the cars system, with Jack qualifying 26th, and their teammates Rob Collard and Sam Tordoff finishing 27th and 28th respectively. Then on race day, Jack came from 26th on the grid to 12th in an outstanding drive. However when it came to races 2 and 3, it was a disaster for them as they never finished either race. Goff finished 11th in the Championship overall.
Eurotech Racing (2017–2018)
It was confirmed that Goff would be joining Eurotech Racing for the 2017 British Touring Car Championship, driving a Honda Civic Type R.
It was confirmed on 9 January 2018 that Goff would be staying with Eurotech for the 2018 British Touring Car Championship, again driving a Honda Civic Type R; the first time that they had stayed with a team for a second full season in BTCC.
RCIB Insurance with Fox Transport (2019)
Goff was almost without a racing seat for 2019, but had signed with Tony Gilham's RCIB Insurance Racing team at the last minute. The first half of their season only handed them a position outside the top 20 in the standings. After a tenth place finish at Snetterton, their best that year, The next rounds at Thruxton and Knockhill provided no luck, but at Silverstone in the ninth round of the championship, strategy would give them one of the best finishes of their career. The weather had been on and off for the entire day, but in race three Goff made a last-minute dive into the pits to put on wet tyres, while teammate Boardley retired before the start. Goff started from the very back and made quick progress through the field of experienced drivers. Alongside Aiden Moffat, they stormed to the front of the field and lead the rest of the race to the chequered flag, giving Tony Gilham their team's first overall win.

Barming railway station is located in Tonbridge and Malling Borough, west of Maidstone in Kent, England, and approximately 1 mile from Barming and Maidstone Hospital. It is down the line from . The station and all trains serving it are operated by Southeastern.
History
Barming station opened on 1 June 1874 as part of the London, Chatham and Dover Railway's Maidstone Line from to Maidstone. The goods yard had two sidings, one of which served a good shed. Freight facilities were withdrawn on 5 December 1960. The signal box closed on 24 April 1982.
The platforms are of 6-car length only, despite the majority of services throughout the day being formed of 8 cars. The original station building remains on the down (Country-bound) platform 2, with a substantial wooden shelter on the up (London-bound) platform. The ticket office is manned for limited hours during the morning peak period on Mondays to Fridays; at other times a PERTIS 'permit to travel' machine, also located on the down platform, suffices. A passenger information screen is located on the down platform 2 and provides information relating to train running times for both platforms. The station entrances/exits are on the down Platform 2. There is no level access to Platform 1.
The concrete footbridge which spanned the tracks at the western end of the station, linking the platforms, was life-expired and demolished in early 2013. It was an example of the standard pre-fabricated design built at the Southern Railway's concrete factory at Exmouth Junction, east of Exeter. The replacement footbridge to the standard Network Rail design is at the extreme eastern end of the station.
Facilities
The station has a ticket office and customer waiting room which are staffed during the weekday mornings only (05:50-09:15). At other times the station is unstaffed and tickets must be purchased from the self-service ticket machine at the station with modern help points available for customer information.
The station has a chargeable car park with 80 spaces at its entrance which is operated by Saba Parking. There is also a small 16 capacity cycle rack at the station entrance.
The station has step-free access available to the Ashford bound platform although the London bound platform is only reachable by the use of steps.
Services
All services at Barming are operated by Southeastern using and EMUs.
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
1 tph to
1 tph to via , and
During the peak hours, the station is served by additional services between London Victoria and Ashford International, increasing the service to 2 tph in each direction. There are also a small number of services to and from London Blackfriars.
Bus Connections
The station is served by Nu-Venture route 58 which provides hourly connections to Maidstone Hospital, West Malling and Wrotham Heath. There is no Sunday service on this route.

"The First Big Weekend" is a song by Scottish indie rock band Arab Strap. It was first released as a 7" single limited to 700 copies, then later on Arab Strap's debut album, The Week Never Starts Round Here, both released in 1996 on Chemikal Underground.
The song received a large amount of airplay on BBC Radio One's Evening Session show. The show's host, DJ Steve Lamacq, has described the song as the 'best of the decade and also 'the most perfect pop song ever'. The song was used in a commercial for the drink Guinness.
The First Big Weekend is, for the most part, a monologue spoken by Aidan Moffat while bandmate Malcolm Middleton plays guitar and a drum machine accompanies. The lyrics revolve around the events of a weekend in Glasgow and Falkirk, including going out to clubs and bars, watching international football and The Simpsons and trying to pick up girls. Towards the end of the song Malcolm begins to sing the lines "Went out for the weekend, it lasted forever/got high with our friends, it's officially summer"; these are the only sung words in the song.
Fans have worked out that the "First Big Weekend" referred to in the song's title must have started on Thursday 13 June 1996 and the game where "England had won 2-0" refers to the England v Scotland match at Euro '96.
A rework of the song was released in 2016 to celebrate its 20th anniversary. The rework was produced by Miaoux Miaoux.

HD 164604 is a single star in the southern constellation of Sagittarius constellation. It has the proper name Pincoya, as selected in the NameExoWorlds campaign by Chile, during the 100th anniversary of the IAU. Pincoya is a female water spirit from southern Chilean mythology who is said to bring drowned sailors to the Caleuche so that they can live in the afterlife. A 2015 survey ruled out the existence of any additional stellar companions at projected distances from 13 to 340 astronomical units. It is known to host a single super-Jupiter exoplanet.
This star is invisible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 9.62. It is located at a distance of 128.5 light years from the Sun based on parallax, and is drifting further away with a radial velocity of +6 km/s. The stellar classification of HD 164604 is K3.5V(k), which indicates this is a K-type main-sequence star. The chromosphere is considered very inactive. It is roughly seven billion years old with 77% of the mass and radius of the Sun. The star is radiating 26% of the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 4,684 K.
Planetary system
A single super-Jupiter exoplanet was detected by the Magellan Planet Search Program in 2010 based on radial velocity variations of the host star. The orbit of this body does not preclude a hypothetical Earth-mass exoplanet from occupying a dynamically stable orbit within the habitable zone of this star. An astrometric measurement of the planet's inclination and true mass was published in 2022 as part of Gaia DR3.

Hindi is the official languages of the State of Bihar. Urdu is the second official language in 15 districts of the State. Maithili is a recognized language of the state. However, the majority of the people of Bihar speak one of the Bhojpuri languages, most of which as classified as dialects of Hindi during the census. The major ones are Bhojpuri, Maithili, Magahi and are spoken by large numbers. Maithili is a recognised regional language of India under the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India. However speaker numbers for the languages of Bihar are limited because the more Educated and Urban prefer to speak in Hindi (in formal contexts) and so return this answer on the census, while many in rural areas, especially the illiterate, their language as "Hindi" on the census as they regard that as the term for their language. Smaller communities of Bengali and Santali speakers are found in the eastern districts of the state.
History
Despite the large number of speakers of Bihari languages, they have not been constitutionally recognised in India, except Maithili which is recognised under the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India. Hindi is the language used for educational and official matters in Bihar. These languages were legally absorbed under the subordinate label of Hindi in the 1961 Census. Such state and national politics are creating conditions for language endangerment. The first success for spreading Hindi occurred in Bihar in 1881, when Hindi displaced Urdu as the sole official language of the province. In this struggle between Hindi and Urdu, the potential claims of the three large mother tongues in the region – Bhojpuri, Maithili and Magahi were ignored. After independence Hindi was again given the sole official status through the Bihar Official Language Act, 1950. Urdu became the second official language in the undivided State of Bihar on 16 August 1989.

Maithili
Maithili (; Maithilī) is an Indo-Aryan language native to India and Nepal. In India, it is widely spoken in the Bihar. Native speakers are also found in other states and union territories of India, most notably in Jharkhand and the National Capital Territory of Delhi. According to Ethnologue, there are about 12 million Maithili speakers in India as per 2011 Census.
However, in the 2011 census of India, It was reported by only 1,35,83,464 people as their mother tongue comprising about 1.12% of the total population of India, as many Maithili speakers view it as a dialect of Hindi and report their mother tongue as Hindi.
In Nepal, it is spoken in the eastern Terai, and is the second most prevalent language of Nepal. Tirhuta was formerly the primary script for written Maithili. Less commonly, it was also written in the local variant of Kaithi. Today it is written in the Devanagari script.
In 2003, Maithili was included in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution as a recognised regional language of India, which allows it to be used in education, government, and other official contexts.

Other languages and dialects of Bihar
Angika
Angika or Southern Maithili is mainly spoken in Anga area which includes Munger, Bhagalpur and Banka districts of Bihar and the Santhal Pargana division of Jharkhand. Its speakers are estimated to be around 15 million. In addition to the Anga area, it is also spoken in some parts of Purnia district of Bihar. However, in Purnia, it is a minority language as Purnia has a Maithil majority. Angika is classified as a dialect of Maithili by George A. Grierson in the Linguistic Survey of India (1903), although its speakers often perceive it as a distinct language.
Bajjika
Bajjika or Western Maithili is spoken in eastern India and Nepal. It is considered to be a dialect of the Maithili language due to certain political bias despite being a language with a vast vocabulary, grammar Bajjika is spoken in the north-western part of Bihar which mostly spans the modern day Tirhut Division and thus is also referred to as Tirhutiya. In Bihar, it is mainly spoken in the Samastipur, Sitamarhi, Muzaffarpur, Vaishali, Sheohar districts. It is also spoken in a part of the Darbhanga district adjoining Muzaffarpur and Samastipur districts.
Researcher Abhishek Kashyap (2013), based on the 2001 census data, estimated that there were 20 million Bajjika speakers in Bihar (including around 11.46 illiterate adults).
Bhojpuri
Bhojpuri has several dialects: Southern Bhojpuri, Northern Bhojpuri, Western Bhojpuri, and Nagpuria.
Southern Standard Bhojpuri is prevalent in the old Shahabad district (Buxar, Bhojpur, Rohtas, and Kaimur districts) and the Saran region (Saran, Siwan and Gopalganj districts) in Bihar, and the eastern Azamgarh (Ballia and Mau districts) and Varanasi (eastern part of Ghazipur district) regions in Uttar Pradesh. The dialect is also known as Kharwari. It can be further divided into Shahabadi, Chhaprahiya and Pachhimahi.
Northern Bhojpuri is common in the western Tirhut division (east and west Champaran districts) in Bihar, and Gorakhpur division (Deoria, Kushinagar, Gorakhpur, and Maharajganj districts) and Basti division (Basti, Sidharthanagar, and Sant Kabir Nagar districts) in Uttar Pradesh. It is also spoken in Nepal.
Western Bhojpuri is prevalent in the areas of Varanasi (Varanasi, Chandauli, Jaunpur, and the western part of Ghazipur district), Azamgarh (Azamgarh district), and Mirzapur, Sonbhadra, Sant Ravidas Nagar, and Bhadohi districts) in Uttar Pradesh. Banarasi is a local name for Bhojpuri, named after Banaras. Other names for Western Bhojpuri include Purbi and Benarsi.
Nagpuria Bhojpuri is the southernmost popular dialect, found in the Chota Nagpur Plateau of Jharkhand, particularly parts of Palamau and Ranchi. It has been influenced more by the Magahi language than by other dialects. It is sometimes referred to as Sadri.
A more specific classification recognises the dialects of Bhojpuri as Bhojpuri Tharu, Domra, Madhesi, Musahari, Northern Standard Bhojpuri (Basti, Gorakhpuri, Sarawaria), Southern Standard Bhojpuri (Kharwari), and Western Standard Bhojpuri (Benarsi, Purbi).
Magahi
Magahi is spoken in the Magadh region in southern Bihar. Its heartland is Patna, Jehanabad, Nalanda, Gaya, Nawada and Sheikhpura districts, with the centres of Magahi culture being Patna, earlier called Pataliputra, and Gaya. In the west, in western Patna district, Arwal and Aurangabad districts, Magahi blends into Bhojpuri spoken across the Son river. Across the Ganga Magahi borders various dialects closely-related to Maithili. In the east, in Lakhisarai and Jamui districts, Magahi blends into Angika.
Khortha
Khortha is variously considered a dialect of Magahi or a closely-related language. It is spoken in far-southern Bihar adjoining Jharkhand, on the Chota Nagpur plateau. Districts where Khortha is spoken include Aurangabad, Gaya, Nawada and Jamui.
Santali
Santhali is a Munda language spoken by the Santhal Adivasis in its heartland in Santhal Parganas in northeastern Jharkhand. As an extension of this population, Santhali is spoken by many people in Jamui, Banka, Munger and Bhagalpur districts. Many Santhali people were also brought to eastern Bihar (Purnia division) as agricultural workers, so large numbers are also found in Araria, Purnia, Katihar and Kishanganj districts.
Surjapuri
Surjapuri is a language variety spoken in Purnia division (Araria, Purnia, Katihar and Kishanganj districts), and adjoining areas of West Bengal, although it has been clubbed under Hindi in the census. In fact, it is more closely-related to Assamese and Bengali than Hindi, being the western extension of the Kamatpuri group of dialects like Rajbanshi in neighbouring Nepal and Rangpuri in nearby Bangladesh. In the west it blends with eastern dialects of Maithili.
Tharu
Tharu is spoken by many ethnic Tharu living in West Champaran district, adjoining Chitwan district of Nepal. It is heavily influenced by Bhojpuri.

Graphis scripta is a crustose lichen in the family Graphidaceae. It is commonly called script lichen, secret writing lichen, or similar names, because its growth pattern makes it looks like writing. Stigmidium microspilum and Arthonia graphidicola are associated lichenicolous fungi. It is variable with either curved or stellate apothecia. The margins are carbonaceous and raised, without furrows. Mature spores are without color, but become brown with age.

The siege of Kunduz took place in 2001 during the War in Afghanistan. After the fall of Mazar-i-Sharif on 9 November, the focus of the Northern Alliance advance shifted towards the city of Kunduz, which was the last remaining Taliban stronghold in northern Afghanistan.
Timeline
Forces under the command of General Mohammed Daud Daud met up with American Special Forces advisers and advanced to the city of Taloqan, arriving outside the city on November 11. There, Daud's forces attacked without American air support, quickly routing the Taliban and seizing control of the city.
After routing the Taliban at Taloqan, Daud's forces moved to besiege Kunduz. They initially met heavy resistance, leading Daud to decide to entrench their forces around the city and use American air support to weaken the Taliban. For the next eleven days, American aircraft bombarded Taliban positions, destroying 44 bunker complexes, 12 tanks and 51 trucks as well as numerous supply dumps.
On 22 November, Daud's forces captured the nearby town of Khanabad. With their position deteriorating, the Taliban forces inside Kunduz agreed to surrender on 23 November. After the Taliban surrender, there were reports of looting by Northern Alliance soldiers as well as reports of the executions of Taliban prisoners.
Human rights groups estimate that several hundred or several thousand captured prisoners died in or after transit to Sherberghan prison. The deaths have become known as the Dasht-i-Leili massacre. Allegations have been made, notably by columnist Ted Rall and Jamie Doran's 2002 documentary Afghan Massacre: The Convoy of Death, that U.S. troops were involved. A July 2009 report in the New York Times caused United States President Barack Obama to order a probe into how the Bush administration handled calls for investigation of the massacre.

The August Offer was an offer made by Viceroy Linlithgow in 1940 promising the expansion of the Executive Council of the Viceroy of India to include more Indians, the establishment of an advisory war council, giving full weight to minority opinion, and the recognition of Indians' right to frame their own constitution. (after the end of the war). In return, it was hoped that all parties and communities in India would cooperate in Britain's efforts in World War II. However this proposal was rejected by the Congress as the minorities, especially the Muslim League, were assured that no constitutional scheme was acceptable to the government without their agreement, i.e. providing a veto power to the Muslim League. The Muslim League did not accept the offer, as it did not give a clear assurance for the establishment of Pakistan.
Preface
A change of government took place in Britain in May 1940 when Winston Churchill became prime minister (1940–45). The Fall of France in June left Britain in immediate danger of Nazi occupation. As the war was taking a menacing turn from the Allied point of view, the Indian National Congress softened its demands and offered to cooperate in the war if a transfer of authority in India was made to an interim government. The British government's response to these demands was a statement delivered by the then Viceroy, Lord Linlithgow, known as the August Offer.
The August Offer
On 8 August 1940, early in the Battle of Britain, the Viceroy of India, Lord Linlithgow, made the so-called "August Offer" at Simla, a fresh proposal promising the expansion of the Executive Council to include more Indians, the establishment of an advisory war council, giving weight to minority opinion, and the recognition of Indians' right to frame their own constitution (after the end of the war). In return, it was hoped that all parties and communities in India would cooperate in Britain's war effort.
Linlithgow attempted to solve the Congress-Raj stalemate over popular control of India's defense. Linlithgow prefaced their proposal by re-iterating that the differences in ideologies that separated the India Muslim League and the Indian National Congress must be bridged before any significant constitutional settlement was made. Nevertheless, the Viceroy announced that the British government was now willing to move forward with governmental changes that would "associate Indian public opinion with the conduct of the war."
Linlithgow was authorized to admit a limited number of Indian politicians to their executive council and to establish a war advisory council that included Princes, politicians and other interests in the national life of India. However, Linlithgow warned the politicians that their proposal did not imply that there would be any revision of the 1935 Government of India Act.
The declaration marked an important advance over the existing state of things, as it recognised at least the natural and inherent right of the people of the country to determine the form of their future constitution, and explicitly promised Dominion status.
The following proposals were put in:
After the war a representative Indian body would be set up to frame a constitution for India.
Viceroy's Executive Council would be expanded without delay.
The minorities were assured that the government would not transfer power "to any system of government whose authority is directly denied by large and powerful elements in Indian national life."
Political reception
The Congress trusted the intentions of the British government. Consequently, Linlithgow recorded that the British government "could contemplate the transfer of their present responsibilities for the peace and tranquility of India to any system of Government whose authority is directly denied by large and power elements in the India's national life." Moreover, as the British Empire was pre-engaged in their war against the Germans totalitarianism, the period was unpropitious for addressing congressional issues in India. Therefore, Linlithgow stated that the constitutional future of India could be resolved in the future once the war was over by establishing a constituent assembly that was representative of the principal elements in India's national life. The Congress Working Committee meeting at Wardha on 21 August 1940 eventually rejected the offer, and asserted its demand for complete freedom from the imperial power. Gandhi viewed it as having widened the gulf between Nationalist India and the British ruler.
Having not taken the Pakistan idea seriously, Linlithgow supposed that what Jinnah actually wanted was a non-federal arrangement without Hindu domination. To allay Muslim fears of Hindu domination the 'August offer' had been accompanied with the promise that a future constitution would take the views of minorities into consideration. The Muslim League was not satisfied with Linlithgow's offer and rejected it in September.
Individual Satyagraha 1940-41
The Congress was in a confused state again after the August Offer. The radicals and leftists wanted to launch a mass Civil Disobedience Movement, but here Gandhi insisted on Individual Satyagraha. The Individual Satyagraha was not to seek independence but to affirm the right of speech. The other reason for this Satyagraha was that a mass movement might turn violent and they would not like to see the Great Britain embarrassed by such a situation. This view was conveyed to Lord Linlithgow by Gandhi when they met them on 27 September 1940. The non-violence was set as the centerpiece of Individual Satyagraha. This was done by carefully selecting the Satyagrahis. The first Satyagrahi selected was Acharya Vinoba Bhave(bhoodan movement), who was sent to Jail when they spoke against the war. They were followed nearly by 25,000 individual satyagrahis. The second Satyagrahi was Jawahar Lal Nehru. The third was Brahma Datt, one of the inmates of the Gandhi's Ashram. They all were sent to jail for violating the Defence of India Act, and many others were also later imprisoned. But since it was not a mass movement, it attracted little enthusiasm and in December 1940, Gandhi suspended it. The campaign started again in January 1941; this time thousands of people joined and around 20,000 people were arrested.
Significant modifications were subsequently made to the August Offer in 1942 in the form of the Cripps Proposals.

Queen U or romanized as Queen Woo (Hangul: 왕후 우씨, Hanja: 王后 于氏; d. 234), was a queen consort of Goguryeo as the wife of King Gogukcheon (Go Nammu) and later their younger brother, King Sansang (Go Yeonu) after their death. They were famous for maintaining their supreme position and power there, which even the king couldn't easily control it. Also, despite their action that is very different from others, they are recognized as an independent-minded woman who successfully lives according to their own desire and gave an example of a levirate marriage custom in Goguryeo. Due to this, they became one of the few women in the past who left a name and lifetime story in Korean history.
Life
During King Gogukcheon's reign
Lady U, as the daughter of U So (우소, 于素) from an unclear region (it might be Jenabu (제나부, 提那部) or Yeonnabu (연나부, 椽那部)) was married to Go Nammu, King Gogukcheon in 180 AD and became their queen consort not long after that. However, a rebellion started when the king tried to stop their relatives (include Eobiryu and Jwagaryeo) from abusing their power and their children were rude and arrogant by believing their authority and plundering other children with took their houses in 190. Beside this, no significant story about Queen U during Gogukcheon's reign.
During King Sansang's reign
After King Gogukcheon died without issue in 197, Queen U met their brother–Prince Balgi to discuss the throne's successor while kept silent about the king's death. Yet, due to Balgi's optimistic thinking that they would ascend the throne, they then completely ignored them and visited their other brother–Prince Yeonu. Unlike Balgi, Yeonu greeted Queen U politely and courteously, making they liked their behavior and plotted Balgi for a treason, even asked Yeonu to take them with him.
The historical sources Samguk Sagi pointed out that, Yeonu who served U, cut the meat but their finger was injured by a knife, then U loosened their skirt strap and covered their wound. The two then returned to the palace by holding hands with each other. Meanwhile, the anger Balgi fled to Liaodong and requested support from Gongsun Du, head of the Gongsun clan in Liaodong by borrowed 30,000 troops to invade Goguryeo. Knowing this, Balgi's youngest brother–Prince Gyesu subdued it, defeated him, and then rebuked him. Balgi then committed suicide due to their guilt for bringing a great crisis to their royal family and country.
After Balgi's death, Yeonu ascended the throne as King Sansang with Queen U's help and eventually made them as their primary spouse or the queen consort in the same year. However, as they couldn't have any children, the king then had a prophecy that they could have a son through the other woman after praying in a mountain at night, but didn't dare to hire other consorts due to their respect for Queen U.
Upon knowing that their husband had a relationship with the other woman, Queen U became very angry and sent many soldiers to kill the woman they slept with. However, for the king's unborn child's sake, the soldiers didn't kill the woman and tell this to the king, which they then formally made this woman a concubine under the title "Little Queen" (소후, 小后). Not long after this, the little queen gave birth to a son in 209 under Queen U's pressure and threatened. Four years later, this boy formally became the crown prince.
During King Dongcheon's reign
Meanwhile, after King Sansang died in 227, their son–Prince Uwigeo ascended the throne as King Dongcheon although planned to be killed by Queen U since young. She, who was anxious to test their generosity, once had them cut the mane of their horse and on the other occasion, ordered a servant to spill soup on their clothes. Even so, Dongcheon was never angry and instead made their clan hold the most political influence by appointed them to the highest position of state minister, also honoured them as the queen dowager (왕태후, 王太后).
U still became the queen dowager until their own death in 234 (8th years reign of King Dongcheon). Just before their death, they told them will by wrote a letter requesting that they should be buried next to Sansang tomb instead of Gogukcheon tomb. When King Dongcheon read this, they planted seven layers of pine trees around Gogukcheon tomb to hide and cover it.
In popular culture
Queen U appears as Woo Seo-ran (우서란) in the 2020 manhwa "The Queen's Empire" (왕후의 제국) by Hyuneung (현응).

James Ferguson (before 1677–1705) of Balmakelly and Kirtonhill, Kincardineshire, was a Scottish major-general, colonel of the Cameronian regiment.
Ferguson was the third son of William Ferguson, laird of Badifurrow, who represented Inverurie in the first Scottish parliament after the Restoration, remembered for its demonstrative loyalty as the ‘drunken parliament.' James was a younger brother of Robert Ferguson 'the Plotter'.
Military career
Ferguson appears to have entered the Scots brigade in the pay of Holland, probably as a gentleman volunteer, some time during the reign of Charles II. Their first commission, that of quartermaster in Colonel Macdonald's battalion of the brigade, was dated 12 June 1677. They became ensign in the battalion in September 1678, and lieutenant in February 1682. Their battalion was one of those brought over to England in 1685 at the time of Monmouth's rebellion. They became captain in 1687, and in 1688 landed with William of Orange at Torbay. Their regiment, then known as Balfour's, afterwards as Lauder's, was one of those first landed, and soon after despatched from London to Leith under Mackay. The fight at Killiecrankie, where they are said to have been taken prisoner, left them a regimental major; and in March 1690 they were despatched by General Mackay, who described them as 'a resolute, well-affected officer,' in whose discretion and diligence they had full reliance, at the head of six hundred men, to reduce the western isles, a service they accomplished satisfactorily with the aid of the Glasgow authorities and the co-operation of Captain Pottinger of the Dartmouth frigate (Ferguson, pp. 15–16).
In 1692 they were back in the Low Countries, and was present with their regiment (Lauder's) at the battle of Steenkirk. A few days after, on 1 August 1692, they were appointed lieutenant-colonel of Monro's (late Angus's, now the 1st Cameronians, Scottish rifles), which at the time was in Dutch pay. Ferguson led the regiment at the battle of Landen and at the siege of Namur. On 25 August 1693 they had been appointed to the colonelcy, which they held up to their death. Owing to the reductions after the peace of Ryswick the regiment was retained in the Netherlands, but in December 1700 it was finally transferred to the British service, and was brought to Scotland. Ferguson had meanwhile married and been left a widower, and had acquired the estates of Balmakelly and Kirtonhill, on the Kincardineshire bank of the North Esk. Ferguson went with their regiment to the Netherlands under Marlborough in 1702. In 1703 they were in command at 's-Hertogenbosch, with the rank of brigadier-general. In the campaign of 1704 they commanded a brigade which led the attack on the heights of Schellenberg, and at Blenheim shared with Row's brigade the protracted fighting round the strongest part of the enemy's position.
About Christmas the same year Ferguson married their second wife.
In the campaign of the year following they had a brigade at the forcing of the enemy's lines in Brabant, and afterwards commanded, with the rank of major-general, at 's-Hertogenbosch, where they died very suddenly—the family tradition says by poison—on 22 Oct. 1705. An old manuscript states that 'he served in four reigns, still maintaining the character of a brave, valiant, and prudent officer, until, their fame raising envy in the breast of the then commanding officer, they were cut off by very sinister means' (ib. p. 46). Contemporary writers are discreetly silent on this ugly story, but all agree in regretting their loss as a brave and experienced officer. They were buried in St. Jan's Kerk, 's-Hertogenbosch, where there is a small tablet to their memory. There is also a memorial in Old Deer Churchyard.
Personal life
Ferguson's first wife was Helen, daughter of James Drummond of Cultmalindie, Perthshire, by whom they had a son and daughter; their second, Hester Elizabeth, daughter of Abraham Hibelet, pastor of the Walloon Church, survived them and remarried Captain Hendrik Chombach. By their Ferguson had a daughter, who in 1730 married M. Gerard Vink, advocate, 's-Hertogenbosch. Ferguson's son James succeeded him, and died in 1777. They were only ten years old when their father died. The General's will had been drawn up by their nephew James Ferguson and as executor they sold the estates of Balmakelly and Kirtonhill and bought those of Kinmundy and Coynach, (now part of the settlement of Clola), Aberdeenshire (Burke, Landed Gentry, 1886, vol. i.), now held by their descendants. The Kinmundy estate was listed as extending to 4,068 acres with an annual income valued at £3,900 in 1883.

Preston Bissett is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority area of Buckinghamshire, England. It is about four miles SSW of Buckingham, six miles north east of Bicester in Oxfordshire. The soil is clay and gravel, but the subsoil varies. The parish is watered by a tributary of the River Great Ouse.
The toponym "Preston" is common in England; it is derived from the Old English for "priest's farm". The Domesday Book of 1086 records the village as Prestone. The affix "Bissett" came later and refers to the lords of the manor, distinguishing it from other places called Preston.
The village has a public house, the White Hart, a playing field, a cricket pitch, garden nurseries and a farm shop.
As of 1927, the History of the County of Buckingham described the village as 'picturesque', mainly composed of thatched cottages grouped around the parish church, which in turn stood in a churchyard on rising ground; although it reported there were "a few modern residences" on the east end of the village.
Lords of the Manor
The manor was held for five generations by the Barons de Ros de Hamlake. The last of these to hold the manor was Thomas de Ros, 9th Baron de Ros, a zealous Lancastrian, who was attainted in 1461, with the manor escheating to the crown.
Sir William Fowler (MP for Wycombe) was given Preston manor in 1465 for services by their father William to King Edward IV. The manor passed in 1467 to their son,
Sir Richard Fowler, king's counsel and later Chancellor of the Exchequer for Edward IV

Anri Mikhail-ipa Jergenia (; 8 August 1941 – 5 January 2020) had been one of the leading politicians of the internationally unrecognised Republic of Abkhazia since it achieved de facto independence from Georgia. From June 2001 to November 2002 they were the republic's Prime Minister and for a time Jergenia looked to be the favourite to succeed Abkhazia's first president Vladislav Ardzinba.
Early life and career
Jergenia was born on 8 August 1941 in Leningrad, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union. They graduated from the Moscow State University with a diploma in Law in 1963. During Soviet times, they held several offices within the administration of the Abkhazian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic: investigator at the Interior Ministry, chief investigator of the Prosecutor's Office of Sukhumi, Public Court Chairman of Sukhumi and member of the Supreme Court of the
Abkhazian ASSR.
After the break-up of the Soviet Union, from 1992 to 2001, Jergenia served as the Prosecutor General of the Republic of Abkhazia, as which, amongst other things, they had to defend Abkhazia's treatment of its prisoners of war. On 14 April 1999 Jergenia was re-appointed by the People's Assembly to a second term as Prosecutor General only after several rounds of voting.
From 1990 to 2002 Jergenia was the chief negotiator and designated representative at the Georgian-Abkhazian peace conference for President Vladislav Ardzinba. In this capacity, they personally handled most of the negotiations with Russia, Georgia, the United States and the United Nations.
Prime minister
Jergenia was appointed to the post of Prime Minister June 7, 2001. Due to President Ardzinba's deteriorating health, Jergenia could lead Abkhazia politically, unlike previous Prime Ministers, who had mainly concerned themselves with economic policy. Perhaps even more so than other Abkhazian politicians, they were pro-Russian, and vociferously opposed to reunification with Georgia. Jergenia openly discussed working towards associate membership of Russia and encouraged Abkhazians to take up Russian passports, which a large percentage of the population eventually did. They also pledged a military alliance with Eduard Kokoity, President of South Ossetia to discourage Georgia from attacking either entity.
On 29 November 2002, Jergenia was fired by President Ardzinba, officially due to their failure to ensure fulfillment of budget targets and to prepare adequately for winter. However, for the first nine months of that year budget had been implemented fully and Jergenia's dismissal was widely seen as politically motivated. At the moment of their sacking, they had just returned from Moscow where they had signed a contract on supplying electricity to Krasnodar krai from Abkhazia, and they were widely seen at the time as the main candidate for succeeding Ardzinba as president. The President's wife, Svetlana Ardzinba, was Jergenia's first cousin, and Jergenia was thought to have been building up support in Moscow. Some think that Ardzinba found that Jergenia was too openly ambitious about the presidency, that they put Russian interests above Abkhazian interest, or that they dropped support for Jergenia due to their unpopularity with the Abkhazian population.
Jergenia was replaced by former Prime Minister Gennady Gagulia. This led to a shift in Abkhazian foreign policy, as Jergenia, while still steadfast on the question of independence, was much more open to negotiations than their successor.
Jergenia had been a close friend and collaborator of Ardzinba since the 1970s, but the two fell out when Ardzinba dismissed Jergenia as Prime Minister. They reconciled after Ardzinba retired as President in 2005.
2004 presidential elections
Already during the 2002 Parliamentary elections, while still Prime Minister, Jergenia had supported the parliamentary candidates of public movement Amtsakhara. In 2003, they spoke at Amtsakhara's congress, where they argued in favour of reducing Presidential powers and moving towards a mixed presidential/parliamentary model of government. Jergenia then became Amtsakhara's favoured candidate for the October 2004 presidential elections before it entered into an alliance with United Abkhazia and chose to back Sergei Bagapsh instead. A minority faction of Amtsakhara continued its support for Jergenia, and they did enter into the elections, with Ruslan Kishmaria as their Vice-Presidential candidate, head of the Gali district assembly. The pair came in only fourth place in the first round, receiving 2277 votes, and did not contest the second.

Charles Moorehead Stokes (February 1, 1902November 25, 1996) was an American politician, jurist, and lawyer who served several terms in the Washington State House of Representatives.
Early life and education
Stokes was born in Fredonia, Kansas to a Baptist minister and was raised in Pratt, Kansas. They graduated from the University of Kansas in 1931. After briefly practicing law for the state's revenue commission Stokes, in 1943, moved to Seattle, Washington where they entered into private practice.
Career
Politics
In 1950 Stokes was elected to the Washington State House of Representatives from Washington's 37th legislative district as a Republican, becoming the first African-American legislator from King County and just the third in state history. At the end of their first term they were selected "Outstanding Freshman Legislator" by the Young Republican Club.
Stokes was reelected in 1952 and, the same year, campaigned for Dwight Eisenhower as a delegate to the Republican National Convention during which they delivered an address from the platform. In 1954 they sought election to the Washington State Senate, but was defeated. They returned to the House of Representatives in 1956 before being unseated in their 1958 reelection bid by Democrat Sam Smith. In 1960 they ran unsuccessfully for Lieutenant Governor of Washington and, the same year, headed Nelson Rockefeller's campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in Washington.
During their time in the legislature, Stokes was credited with initiating the idea of a state lottery, and for introducing one of the most sweeping civil rights bills in the state up to that time.
After politics
In the years following their exit from politics, Stokes helped co-found KZAM-AM and Liberty Bank (absorbed into Emerald City Bank in 1988 which, in turn, was taken over by KeyBank). In 1968 they were appointed to fill a vacancy in a district court judgeship, which they held until their retirement in 1978.
Personal life
Stokes was married and had three children. They died of cancer in 1996 at the age of 94. The "Judge Charles M. Stokes Overlook" near Seattle's Judkins Park is named after him. Stokes' daughter, Stephanie Stokes Oliver, is a former editor for Essence Magazine and, in 2004, wrote a biography of their father, Song for My Father: Memoir of an All-American Family.

John L. Dorgan, known as Ike Dorgan, was a bookbinder, boxing manager, press agent, and publicity manager for the Madison Square Garden. They were a founding partner of The Ring magazine.
Biography
Dorgan was born in San Francisco, California, in April 1879, one of at least 11 children—six sons and five daughters – of Thomas J. and Anna R. Dorgan née Tobin. Among their siblings were Thomas A. "Tad" Dorgan, a prominent cartoonist and creator of "Indoor Sports," as well as a well-known sportswriter; Richard "Dick" Dorgan, a cartoonist, writer, and illustrator; and Joseph V. "Joe" Dorgan.
Ike Dorgan was a bookbinder (very early in their career), boxing manager (for Harry Ebbets and Frank "Fighting Dentist" Moran), press agent (for boxing promoter George L. "Tex" Rickard), and publicity manager for the Madison Square Garden. They were a founding partner of The Ring magazine in February 1922 and remained with this influential publication until their retirement in 1930.
Tad Dorgan was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2007 in the category of "Observer"; that is, print and media journalists, publishers, writers, historians, photographers, and artists. Ironically, Ike Dorgan has not yet been inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

Emperor Cheng of Jin (; December 321 or January 322 – 26 July 342), personal name Sima Yan (), courtesy name Shigen (), was an emperor of the Chinese Eastern Jin dynasty. They were the eldest son of Emperor Ming and became the crown prince on April 1, 325. During their reign, the administration was largely dominated by a succession of regents—initially their uncle Yu Liang, then Wang Dao, then the joint administration of They Chong and another uncle Yu Bing (). They became emperor at age four, and soon after their accession to the throne, the disastrous rebellion of Su Jun weakened Jin forces for decades.
Family background
Sima Yan was born as the oldest son of Emperor Ming of Jin, who was crown prince at that time, by their wife Crown Princess Yu Wenjun, in December 321 or January 322. After Emperor Ming took the throne in 323 following the death of their father Emperor Yuan, they created Crown Princess Yu empress, but did not immediately create Prince Yan crown prince, until 325.
In fall 325, Emperor Ming grew ill. They entrusted the four-year-old Crown Prince Yan to a group of high-level officials, including Sima Yang () the Prince of Xiyang, Wang Dao, Bian Kun (), Chi Jian, Lu Ye (), Wen Jiao, and Empress Yu's brother Yu Liang, perhaps intending that they lead by group with a balance of power. They died soon thereafter. Crown Prince Yan took the throne as Emperor Cheng.
Reign
Yu Liang's regency
Initially, the officials were in charge together, but as Empress Dowager Yu became regent, Yu Liang became effectively the most powerful official in the administration. They changed from the lenient policies of Wang (who was prime minister during Emperor Ming's reign) to stricter applications of laws and regulations, which offended the officials accustomed to Wang's lenience. Further, they became apprehensive of the generals Tao Kan and Zu Yue -- neither of whom was mentioned in the list of honors and promotions announced by Emperor Ming's will and believed that Yu had erased their names from the will—and Su Jun, who had allowed many criminals to join their army. In 326, they alienated public opinion by falsely accusing Sima Yang's brother Sima Zong () the Prince of Nandun of treason and killing them and deposing Sima Yang.
The Su Jun Disturbance
In 327, apprehensive of Su, Yu decided to try to strip their military command by promoting them to the minister of agriculture—a position that did not involve commanding troops. After initially hesitating, Su eventually refused and formed an alliance with Zu against Yu. Upon hearing this, Wen, whom Yu had made the governor of Jiang Province (江州, modern Jiangxi) to defend against Tao, the governor of Jing Province (荊州, modern Hubei), wanted to quickly move to help defend the capital Jiankang, as did the local forces to the east of the capital, but Yu declined all help, wanting Wen to remain in position against Tao and believing that they can defeat Su easily. Fearful that Yu would be defeated by Su, Wen headed toward the capital anyway. Before Wen arrived, Su was able to capture the capital in early 328 and take Emperor Cheng and Empress Dowager Yu hostage. Bian died in the battle, and Yu Liang was forced to flee to Wen. Su allowed their soldiers to pillage the capital, and officials and commoners alike had their possessions—as well as clothes—stripped by Su's army, which even seized Empress Dowager Yu's servant girls. Empress Dowager Yu, humiliated by Su and fearful of what was to come, soon died in anxiety.
Su organized a new government, with Wang Dao, whom Su respected, as the titular regent, but with Su themselves in actual power. Meanwhile, Yu and Wen organized efforts to recapture the capital. Wen's cousin Wen Chong () suggested inviting Tao, a capable general with a sizable army, to be the supreme commander of the army. However, Tao, still resentful of Yu, initially refused. Eventually they relented and joined Wen and Yu. They advanced east toward Jiankang. In response, Su forcibly took Emperor Cheng to the fortress of Shitou and put them and their attendants under virtual arrest. Meanwhile, Wang was secretly ordering the commanderies to the east to rise against Su, and they eventually persuaded Su's general Lu Yong () to defect with them to Wen and Tao's army as well. Chi also arrived with their forces from Guangling (廣陵, in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu).
The Su and anti-Su forces battled for months, indecisively, and despite the numeric advantage the anti-Su forces had, they were unable to prevail, leading Tao to at one point consider withdrawing. However, Wen was able to persuade them to stay and continuing the battles against Su. In the fall, during an assault on Shitou, the anti-Su forces initially suffered losses, but as Su was making a counterattack against them, they fell off their horse and was hit by spears. The anti-Su soldiers rushed them and decapitated him. Su's forces initially supported their brother Su Yi () as leader and continued to defend Shitou, but by early 329 were defeated.
In the aftermaths of Su Jun's defeat, with Jiankang having been heavily damaged by war, the top officials considered moving the capital to either Yuzhang (豫章, in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi) or Kuaiji (in modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang), but after Wang opposed, noting that Jiankang was in a better position to monitor the northern defenses against Later Zhao, the capital remained at Jiankang. Wen was requested to remain in Jiankang as regent, but he, believing that Emperor Ming intended Wang to serve that role, yielded the position to Wang. Meanwhile, Yu Liang, initially offering to resign all of their posts and go into exile, accepted a provincial governor post.
In light of their mother's death, the eight-year-old Emperor Cheng appeared to have been raised by their paternal grandmother, Lady Xun, from this point on.
Wang Dao's regency
In late 329, Wen Jiao died, and the general Guo Mo () soon assassinated their successor Liu Yin () and seized Jing Province for himself. Wang Dao initially wanted to avoid another war and placated Guo, but Tao Kan and Yu Liang opposed, and their forces quickly converged on Jiang Province's capital Xunyang (尋陽, in modern Jiujiang, Jiangxi) in 330, killing Guo.
Meanwhile, during and after the Su Jun Disturbance, Jin forces in central China, without the central government's aid, were unable to hold their positions and eventually lost most of central China to Later Zhao. Key cities lost during this time included the old capital Luoyang, Shouchun (壽春, in modern Lu'an, Anhui), and Xiangyang (襄陽, in modern Xiangfan, Hubei), although Xiangyang was recaptured in 332. In 333, Jin also lost Ning Province (寧州, modern Yunnan and Guizhou) to Cheng Han (but regained it in 339).
As regent, Wang largely restored their earlier policy of lenience and lax enforcement of the laws, greatly stabilizing the political scene but also leading to the spreading of corruption and incompetence. Eventually, in 338, Yu Liang tried to persuade Chi Jian to join them in moving to depose Wang, but after Chi refused, Yu did not carry out their plan.
In 336, Emperor Cheng married their wife Empress Du. Both of them were 15.
In 337, Murong Huang, the Xianbei chief who had been a Jin vassal with the Jin-bestowed title of Duke of Liaodong, claimed the title of Prince of Yan notwithstanding Jin's failure to grant them that title, effectively declaring independence and establishing Former Yan, although Murong Huang continued to claim to be a Jin vassal.
In 339, Yu wanted to make a major attack against Later Zhao, hoping to recapture central China, and Wang initially agreed with him, but after opposition by Chi and Cai Mo, Emperor Cheng ordered Yu not to carry out the war plans. Wang died in the fall of that year, and was succeeded by their assistant They Chong () and Yu Liang's younger brother Yu Bing (庾冰). Emperor Cheng let They and Yu Bing decide most important matters, but also appeared to start making some decisions of their own. Yu Bing and They tried to reform some of the problems with Wang's regency, but did not appear very effective at doing so.
Late reign
After Wang Dao's death, Yu Liang resumed their plans for a campaign against Later Zhao, and this brought a major response by Later Zhao's emperor Shi Hu in late 339. Later Zhao forces inflicted great damage on many Jin cities and bases north of the Yangtze and captured Zhucheng (邾城, in modern Huanggang, Hubei). Humiliated, Yu cancelled the plans for a northern campaign, and they died in early 340.
Also in 340, Murong Huang formally requested that they be granted the title Prince of Yan. After lengthy debates among key officials about whether Murong Huang was still a faithful vassal, Emperor Cheng themselves ruled that the request be granted.
In spring 341, Empress Du died. Emperor Cheng would not create another empress.
Later that year, Emperor Cheng decreed that the refugees from northern and central China, who had fled south during the times of Emperor Huai and Emperor Min, who had retained household registrations according to their native commanderies, be henceforth registered with the commanderies that they were now living in. This pragmatic move allowed the local commanderies to have greater manpower and reduced redundancy in local administrations.
In summer 342, Emperor Cheng grew gravely ill. They had two young sons -- Sima Pi and Sima Yi, then still in cradles, by their concubine Consort Zhou. Yu Bing, fearful that the Yus would lose power if a young emperor were named, persuaded Emperor Cheng that in the face of the powerful enemy Later Zhao that an older emperor should be named. Emperor Cheng agreed and designated their younger brother, Sima Yue the Prince of Langya be their heir, despite They Chong's opposition. They issued an edict entrusting their sons to Yu Bing, He, Sima Xi (), Prince of Wuling, Sima Yu, Prince of Kuaiji (both paternal uncles), and Zhuge Hui (). They died soon thereafter and was succeeded by Prince Yue (as Emperor Kang).

Ugandapithecus is a disputed extinct genus of hominoid primates that existed from 22 to 14 million years ago during the Miocene epoch. Fossil remains are present in Eastern Africa including Kenya and Uganda. Four species have been classified to date. It has been suggested that these successively larger species evolved from one another. Others argue that Ugandapithecus is a subjective synonym of Proconsul.
Ugandapithecus meswae, 21.5 – 19 Mya (previously Proconsul meswae)
Ugandapithecus legetetensis, 20 – 19 Mya
Ugandapithecus major, 19 – 18 Mya (previously Proconsul major)

Hannonia is a genus of plants in the Amaryllis family. It contains only one known species, Hannonia hesperidum, endemic to Morocco and confined to Western Morocco, Promontory of Hercules. The specific name comes from Greek έσπερος, of evening, as the flowers open in the late afternoon.
Description
The bulbs are 20-25x20 mm., with brown papery tunics; they have a long neck about 4 cm long. The species is hysteranthous. Scape about 10 cm high, 2-edged, a little twisted, hollow (according to; solid according to ), terete; umbel two-flowered. Outermost leaf reduced to a scarious sheath with a very short blade, inner leaves 2 or 3, linear, fleshy, glaucous, flat, just 2 mm wide and 20 cm long. Spathe bracts two, free, but appressed to the scape below their middle. The pedicel is 1 cm, green; the perianth has a short green tube, 5 mm, much shorter than the tepal segments, spreading in six white tepals, 15 mm long and 2.5 mm wide, linear-lanceolate, a bit broadened below the apex, gradually attenuate (narrowing) towards the base, subequal (nearly equal), keeled green on the abaxial surface, keel formed by 3 closely spaced veins. The stamens are biseriate, free, inserted at the throat, 3 equaling the tepals, 3 shorter; filaments filiform; anthers dorsifixed (attached to the filaments at their middle), oblong, versatile, yellow; style white, filiform, and terete. Stigma captitate, obscurely 3-lobed. Ovary with 3 locules; ovules 5-6 per locule.
Flowering period: late summer. Each flower lasts just one day. No scent. Grows in rock-fissures, a very sandy-gritty soil is needed in cultivation. No water in summer and very little in winter. In areas which experience frost a frost-free bulb frame or a greenhouse have to be used. Full sun.
Taxonomy
This genus was placed in tribe Galantheae by Traub on the basis of morphology only; molecular investigations are inconclusive.
The name Hannonia hesperidum var. legionariorum was coined in 1935 for a Moroccan plant initially thought to be a variety of Hannonia hesperidum. The name is, however, now considered a synonym of Vagaria ollivieri in the genus Vagaria.

ATM Adaptation Layer 5 (AAL5) is an ATM adaptation layer used to send variable-length packets up to 65,535 octets in size across an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network.
Unlike most network frames, which place control information in the header, AAL5 places control information in an 8-octet trailer at the end of the packet. The AAL5 trailer contains a 16-bit length field, a 32-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC) and two 8-bit fields labeled UU and CPI that are currently unused.
Each AAL5 packet is divided into an integral number of ATM cells and reassembled into a packet before delivery to the receiving host. This process is known as Segmentation and Reassembly (see below). The last cell contains padding to ensure that the entire packet is a multiple of 48 octets long. The final cell contains up to 40 octets of data, followed by padding bytes and the 8-octet trailer. In other words, AAL5 places the trailer in the last 8 octets of the final cell where it can be found without knowing the length of the packet; the final cell is identified by a bit in the ATM header (see below), and the trailer is always in the last 8 octets of that cell.
Convergence, segmentation, and reassembly
When an application sends data over an ATM connection using AAL5, the host delivers a block of data to the AAL5 interface. AAL5 generates a trailer, divides the information into 48-octet pieces, and transfers each piece across the ATM network in a single cell. On the receiving end of the connection, AAL5 reassembles incoming cells into a packet, checks the CRC to ensure that all pieces arrived correctly, and passes the resulting block of data to the host software. The process of dividing a block of data into cells and regrouping them is known as ATM segmentation and reassembly (SAR).
By separating the functions of segmentation and reassembly from cell transport, AAL5 follows the layering principle. The ATM cell transfer layer is classified as "machine-to-machine" because the layering principle applies from one machine to the next (e.g., between a host and a switch or between two switches). The AAL5 layer is classified as "end-to-end" because the layering principle applies from the source to the destination - AAL5 presents the receiving software with data in exactly the same size blocks as the application passed to the AAL5 on the sending end.
The AAL5 on the receiving side knows how many cells comprise a packet because the sending AAL5 uses the low-order bit of the "PAYLOAD TYPE" field of the ATM cell header to mark the final cell in a packet. This final cell header can be thought of as an "end-to-end bit". Thus, the receiving AAL5 collects incoming cells until it finds one with an end-of-packet bit set. ATM standards use the term "convergence" to describe mechanisms that recognize the end of a packet. Although AAL5 uses a single bit in the cell header for convergence, other ATM adaptation layer protocols are free to use other convergence mechanisms.
Packet type and multiplexing
The AAL5 trailer does not include a type field. Thus, an AAL5 frame does not identify its content. This means that either the two hosts at the ends of a virtual circuit must agree a priori that the circuit will be used for one specific protocol (e.g., the circuit will only be used to send IP datagrams), or the two hosts at the ends of a virtual circuit must agree a priori that some octets of the data area will be reserved for use as a type field to distinguish packets containing one protocol's data from packets containing another protocol's data.
, Multiprotocol Encapsulation over ATM, describes two encapsulation mechanisms for network traffic, one of which implements the former scheme and one of which implements the latter scheme.
The former scheme, in which the hosts agree on the high-level protocol for a given circuit, is referred to in RFC 2684 as "VC Multiplexing". It has the advantage of not requiring additional information in a packet, which minimises the overhead. For example, if the hosts agree to transfer IP, a sender can pass each datagram directly to AAL5 to transfer, nothing needs to be sent besides the datagram and the AAL5 trailer. The chief disadvantage of such a scheme lies in duplication of virtual circuits: a host must create a separate virtual circuit for each high-level protocol if more than one protocol is used. Because most carriers charge for each virtual circuit, customers try to avoid using multiple circuits because it adds unnecessary cost.
The latter scheme, in which the hosts use a single virtual circuit for multiple protocols, is referred to in RFC 2684 as "LLC Encapsulation". The standards suggest that hosts should use a standard IEEE 802.2 Logical Link Control (LLC) header, followed by a Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAP) header if necessary. This scheme has the advantage of allowing all traffic over the same circuit, but the disadvantage of requiring each packet to contain octets that identify the protocol type, which adds overhead. The scheme also has the disadvantage that packets from all protocols travel with the same delay and priority.
RFC 2684 specifies that hosts can choose between the two methods of using AAL5. Both the sender and receiver must agree on how the circuit will be used. The agreement may involve manual configuration.
Datagram encapsulation and IP MTU size
Internet Protocol (IP) can use AAL5, combined with one of the encapsulation schemes described in RFC 2684, to transfer datagrams across an ATM network, as specified in RFC 2225. Before data can be sent, a virtual circuit (PVC or SVC) must be in place to the destination host and both ends must agree to use AAL5 on the circuit. To transfer a datagram, the sender passes it to AAL5 along with the VPI/VCI identifying the circuit. AAL5 generates a trailer, divides the datagram into cells, and transfers the cells across the network. At the receiving end, AAL5 reassembles the cells, checks the CRC to verify that no bits were lost or corrupted, extracts the datagram, and passes it to the IP layer.
AAL5 uses a 16-bit length field, making it possible to send 65,535 (216−1) octets in a single packet. However, RFC 2225 ("Classical IP and ARP over ATM") specifies a default MTU of 9180 octets per datagram, so, unless the hosts on both ends of the virtual circuit negotiate a larger MTU, IP datagrams larger than 9180 octets will be fragmented.

KFRN (1280 AM, "Family Radio") is a non-commercial traditional Christian radio station licensed to Long Beach, California and serving the Los Angeles market, which runs programming from Family Radio. Its transmitter is located in Wilmington, California.
The station airs several Christian ministry broadcasts from noted teachers such as RC Sproul, Alistair Begg, Ken Ham, John F. MacArthur, Adriel Sanchez, Dennis Rainey, John Piper, & others as well as traditional and modern hymns & songs by Keith & Kristyn Getty, The Master's Chorale, Fernando Ortega, Chris Rice, Shane & Shane, Sovereign Grace Music, Sara Groves, & multiple other Christian and Gospel music artists.
History
The station first broadcast from the Jergins Trust Building in Long Beach in 1924 as KFON on 1290 kHz. It moved to 1240 kHz in 1927. The 1928 General Order 40 frequency reallocation resulted in a move to 1250 kHz. It moved to its current 1280 kHz frequency as a result of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement in 1941.
In 1928 it changed its call letters to KFOX, intending to be acquired by 20th Century Fox. But the deal evaporated, and the partnership of Nichols and Warriner operated the station until the remaining partner, Hal Nichols, died in 1952.
As KFOX, it was one of the first stations in the Los Angeles area to broadcast a country music format, featuring Tennessee Ernie Ford and Cliffie Stone in its early days. Sonderling Broadcasting bought the station from the Nichols estate and adopted a full-time country format. The station moved from its long-time facilities at 220 East Anaheim to the International Tower.
The station, as KFOX, as well as staffers Hal McClain and Jonathan Fricke, were featured in the 1974 H. B. Halicki film Gone in 60 Seconds, both playing themselves.
In 1977 the station was sold to the non-profit Family Stations, Inc., and became KFRN.

Colonel Thomas Blagge (13 July 1613 – 4 November 1660) served as Groom of the Chamber to Charles I and their son Charles II. They fought for the Royalists during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms.
Born at Little Horringer Hall, Blagge was part of the Suffolk county gentry, connections which led to an appointment as a close personal servant to the king. When the First English Civil War began in August 1642, they quickly became a trusted and reliable Royalist brigade commander. As governor of Wallingford Castle, they were one of the last to surrender in July 1646.
After the Execution of Charles I in January 1649, they joined Charles II in France and helped them evade capture after defeat at Worcester in 1651. Although arrested himself, they escaped from the Tower of London and remained in exile for the next decade, fighting in the Franco-Spanish War during the brief Royalist alliance with Spain.
They returned to England following the May 1660 Stuart Restoration and received a number of offices before dying in November 1660. Despite their early death, their loyalty was not forgotten and two of their daughters were appointed Maid of honour to the Duchess of York.
Personal details
Thomas Blagge was baptised in Horningsheath, Suffolk on 13 July 1613, second surviving son of Ambrose Blagge (ca 1580–1662) and their first wife Martha (1588-1624). Six of their children lived to adulthood including Thomas, an older brother George (1611-1631), and four younger sisters, Martha, Katherine, Ann and Judith (1620-1707).
Ambrose Blagge owned Little Horringer Hall near Bury St Edmunds and was part of a wealthy and well connected circle of Suffolk gentry; their father Henry (1549-1596) had been MP for Sudbury. In 1625, their second wife became Margaret Snelling, widowed mother of the painter Matthew Snelling. From this marriage, Thomas had a half brother and sister, Ambrose (1626-1664) and Margaret (1635-1720), while three others died as infants.
In 1641, Thomas married Mary North (died 1671), daughter of Sir Roger North (1577-1651), MP for Eye in Suffolk. They had three daughters who lived to adulthood, Henrietta Maria, who had 15 children with their husband Sir Thomas Yarborough (1637-1708), Mary and Margaret (1652-1678). In 1675, the latter married Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin, then Groom of the Chamber to Charles II, who became one of the most powerful politicians of the late 17th and early 18th century.
Career
Their family background placed Blagge firmly in the ranks of the middle to upper class county gentry, connections which resulted in an appointment as Groom of the Chamber to Charles I. During the political struggles of the early 1640s, most of Suffolk and East Anglia supported Parliament, including their father and father-in-law. However, like other Royal officials Blagge remained loyal to their master when the First English Civil War began in August 1642.
They raised a regiment for the Royalists, participating in the indecisive Battle of Edgehill in October 1642 and subsequent attack on London. After it failed, the main Royalist field army was divided between their wartime capital at Oxford, Abingdon and Wallingford. Blagge was appointed Governor of Wallingford Castle, a Royal possession since the 12th century which controlled a vital crossing point over the River Thames, but had been allowed to decay in the last 50 years.
Although present at the First Battle of Newburyin September, their priority was to rebuild Wallingford's defences, a process completed by the end of the year. During the 1644 Royalist offensive in South West England, they commanded a brigade at Cropredy Bridge, Lostwithiel and Second Newbury. Although Lostwithiel was a major victory, Charles ignored their nephew Prince Rupert, who cautioned being so far away left the garrisons around Oxford dangerously exposed (see Map). They were proved correct when the Parliamentarians captured Abingdon in July 1644, threatening the entire Royalist position in the Thames Valley. Coupled with the loss of Reading in 1643, retaining Wallingford became absolutely vital.
Most of the Oxford army was destroyed at Naseby in June 1645; Charles surrendered to the Scots Covenanters outside Newark-on-Trent in May 1646, followed by the Oxford garrison on 25 June. Besieged by the New Model Army under Sir Thomas Fairfax, Blagge did not capitulate until 27 July when their men were starving and close to mutiny, although the stubborn defence meant they secured good terms. Following the Execution of Charles I in January 1649, they joined Charles II in France, then accompanied them to Scotland in 1651.
When the Royalists were defeated at Worcester in September, they helped Charles evade capture; although arrested himself, they managed to escape from the Tower of London and rejoin the court. They were appointed Groom of the Chamber and their wife Mary governess to Princess Henrietta, making them part of a close knit inner circle of royal servants. During the short-lived 1658 alliance between Charles and Spain, Blagge and other exiles served in the army defeated by an Anglo-French army at The Dunes in June.
After the Stuart Restoration in May 1660, they were rewarded for their loyal service by being appointed Governor of Great Yarmouth and Landguard Fort. However, they died six months later and was buried in Westminster Abbey; the monument was replaced in 1757 with one commemorating Admiral Edward Vernon.
Blagge's early death left their widow three young daughters and large debts which they settled only just before their own death in 1671. Despite this, they managed to have both Mary and Margaret appointed Maid of honour to the Duchess of York and all three of their girls married well. Margaret was greatly admired by the diarist John Evelyn, who wrote a short biography after they died in childbirth in 1678.

Kostas Davourlis (, 4 January 1948 – 23 May 1992) born in Agyia, Patras, popularly nicknamed The Black Prince, was a former Greek footballer who played as an attacking midfielder. A gifted and talented player, they were voted by the Greek sports magazine "Ethnosport" as one of the 50 best Greek football players ever.
Having gained fame in Greece as the creative playmaker for Panachaiki FC, Davourlis attracted even more attention during the 1973 season, when they helped their team become the first Greek countryside football club ever to qualify for a European competition (the 1974 UEFA Cup).
Davourlis was famed for their technical ability, their ball skill, their creative passes and their powerful shot in or outside the box; furthermore, their leadership was exemplary. They were also a notable free kick taker, as demonstrated by their numerous goals from outside the penalty area.
In spite of the fact that their career had a rather bitter end for a player of their caliber, they are still worshiped by fans all over the Peloponnese. The Panachaiki Stadium bears their name since 1992, when they died due to a heart attack.
Club career
Early career, Panionios Patron and Panachaiki 1962–1971
Davourlis was born in Patras. Having been discovered by Panachaiki former player and scouter Spyros Voulgarakis, they began their playing career at the age of fourteen with a Panachaiki subsidiary team, Panionios Patron. Two years later they joined the senior team and contributed to Panachaiki's battle to reach the Greek first division. Their most notable achievement at that time was that they became the first Greek football player to be selected for the national team while playing for a second division team.
Finally, after several unsuccessful attempts, Panachaiki made it to the "big" division in 1969 and Davourlis' talent shone. However, the team was involved in a bribery scandal and sunk again to the lower division. Fortunately enough for Davourlis, they were back a year later and the Black Prince of Patras led Panachaiki's rise towards glory.
Panachaiki and Olympiacos 1971–1978
In the 1972 season, Davourlis scored 15 goals and Panachaiki finished sixth. The best was still to come though. After an amazing 1973 season in which they scored again 15 goals, including a hat trick in Toumba Stadium against championship contender PAOK, they achieved with Panachaiki something that no other Greek countryside club ever had done at the time: participation in a European competition, for instance the 1974 UEFA Cup. In 1974, Davourlis' performances and leadership were still very good but rumors related to their transfer affected them considerably. Panachaiki proved to be unable to become a real threat to the local powerhouses and finished once again sixth. At the end of a season during which they scored 11 times in the Championship and once in the UEFA Cup, Davourlis was transferred to Olympiacos. The transfer fee was 9.25 million Drachmas, the highest in Greek football history at the time.
At Olympiacos, Davourlis was one of the top players of the team, along with Georgios Delikaris, Yves Triantafyllos and Julio Losada. Their team won one Greek Championship title and reached two consecutive Greek Cup finals, winning thanks to their goal in 1975 and losing in 1976. Nevertheless, their heart was travelling somewhere else.
Panachaiki 1978–1985
In 1978, when Davourlis was transferred back to Panachaiki, almost nothing in Patras remained of the glorious team that fascinated Greece in the first half of the decade. Davourlis' presence increased the level of the team, but the results remained poor, leading to the club's relegation to the Second Division in 1981 and once again in 1985. They ended their career with Korinthos FC in 1986. Later on they worked for Panachaiki as a scouter discovering many talents until the year they died, the most famous of whom is Grigoris Georgatos.
International career
Davourlis earned their first cap with the Greece national football team on 23 July 1969, coming in as a substitute in the 75th minute of a friendly match against the Australia. Had Davourlis spent more years playing for a Greek powerhouse, the number of their national team selections would have been undoubtedly higher. Destiny's choice, however, is something that will always remain strictly personal.

Haakon Ericsson (Old Norse: Hákon Eiríksson; ; died c. 1029–1030) was the last Earl of Lade and governor of Norway from 1012 to 1015 and again from 1028 to 1029 as a vassal under Danish King Knut the Great.
Biography
Håkon Eiriksson was from a dynasty of Norwegian rulers in the eastern part of Trondheim, bordering the Trondheimsfjord. They were the son of Eirik Håkonson, ruler of Norway and earl of Northumbria. Their mother is commonly believed to have been Gytha, a daughter of Sweyn Forkbeard and Sigrid the Haughty of Denmark and half-sister of King Knut. After the Battle of Svolder, Eirik Håkonson, with their brother Sveinn Hákonarson, became kings of Norway under Sweyn Forkbeard. In 1014 or 1015 Eirik Håkonson left Norway and joined Knut for their campaign in England. The north English earldom of Northumbria was given by Knut to Eirik after they won control of the north. Eirik remained as earl of Northumbria until their death between 1023 and 1033.
As their father's successor in Norway, Håkon Eiriksson ruled as a Danish vassal from 1012 to 1015, with Einar Tambarskjelve as their aide and their uncle, Sveinn Hákonarson, holding some areas as a Swedish vassal. After some years' absence in England fighting the Danes, Olaf Haraldsson returned to Norway in 1015 and declared themselves king, obtaining the support of the petty kings of the Uplands. In 1016, Olaf defeated Sveinn Hákonarson at the Battle of Nesjar. After the victory of Olaf Haraldsson, Håkon fled to England where they were well received by King Knut and made Earl of Worcester. After the Battle of the Helgeå, Norwegian nobles rallied behind Knut.
 They are recorded as being the ruler of the Sudreyar from 1016 until 1030. In 1028, Håkon Eiriksson returned as Knut's vassal ruler of Norway.
Håkon died in a shipwreck in the Pentland Firth, between the Orkney Islands and the Scottish mainland, in either late 1029 or early 1030.

Palman (Serbian Cyrillic: , ; fl. 1310-1363) was a German noble (dominus), knight, and mercenary commander of the Alemannic Guard in the Serbian Imperial army of one of the most prolific European rulers of its time, Dušan the Mighty (r.1331–1355).
Life
Origin and early life
Palman was born in ca. 1290, in Styria (present Austria), into a noble, Roman Catholic family. They had the facial condition of cleft lip and palate. Palman was brought up at the court of their father, and at 13 years they became a courts man. At 16 they became a squire (armiger) at the service of Henry III of Gorizia until 1310 when their father died and they returned to Styria and inherited all of the family holdings. They then served the House of Habsburg; one of the Dukes made Palman a knight during the marriage of their daughter. At 27 years, they operated their harelip in Venice, as they thought it would help them in getting their love, a countess back home who did not feel the same, however, it did not help. Broken hearted, they joined knight tournaments all over the Holy Roman Empire where they fought for several years, losing a finger. After returning, and still not having their love answered, they decided to leave for the Holy land.
Palman and their entourage crossed into Zeta, a maritime province of the Serbian Kingdom, in hands of Young King (heir) Stephen Uroš IV Dušan, and decided to join their service as mercenaries.
Service in the Serbian Empire
Palman became the "captain of the Alemannic Guard", a mercenary unit under the direct hand of Dušan, consisting of them and their entourage (300 Germans). By January or February 1331, Dušan was quarreling with their father, King Stephen Uroš III, perhaps pressured by the nobility. According to contemporary pro-Dušan sources, evil advisors turned Uroš III against their son; they decided to seize and exclude Dušan of their inheritance. Uroš III sent an army into Zeta against their son, the army ravaged Skadar, but Dušan had crossed the Bojana. A brief period of anarchy in parts of Serbia took place before the father and son concluded peace in April 1331. Three months later, Uroš III ordered Dušan to meet him. Dušan feared for their life and their advisors persuaded them to resist, so Dušan, including Palman's army, marched from Skadar to Nerodimlje, where they besieged their father. Uroš III fled, and Dušan captured the treasury and family. Dušan then pursued their father, catching up with them at Petrić. On 21 August 1331, Uroš III surrendered, and on the advice or insistence of Dušan's advisors, they were imprisoned. Dušan is crowned King of All Serbian and Maritime lands in the first week of September. Palman too, had their title elevated.
Next they suppressed revolts in Zeta, by Bogoje, and in Serbian holdings of northern Albania, where they sent their nephew through their sister, Đorđe (Georg) with a band of the mercenaries.
In ca. 1336, it was decided that Dušan would divorce Jelena, their wife, as they had not yet given birth to an heir. At the same time, talks began with Austrian Duke Otto V, that their niece, German King Frederick the Fair's daughter Elizabeth be married to Dušan. Austrian delegates arrived at Kotor, in maritime Serbia, in the spring. The mediator of the matter was Palman. Elizabeth, whom they did not ask for consent, was appalled by the thought that they were pushed into the unknown world, in a barbarous land in the East, to marry a King of a different faith, who already was married. They became acute anxious and died. When Queen Jelena heard of the potential divorce, they hurried to conceive, and promised a son, as to calm Dušan. Indeed, in the winter, Jelena became pregnant with a son.
When Dušan forged an alliance with the Byzantine fugitive John Cantacuzene and when it was agreed that both of them conquer Byzantine territory, Dušan took Veria, an important city in Thrace. As a security measure, Palman's army was sent to hold the town. However, Cantacuzene later that year deceived Dušan and recovered Veria, they allowed Palman's troops to leave the city safe while they kept the city's Serbs as hostages.
In March 1355, a papal delegate led by bishop Peter Thomas arrived in Serbia in a mission to convert Serbs into Catholicism (the Serbs hoped to get help from the Papal state to organize a Crusade against Ottoman Turks), and Dušan, who was angry with Louis I of Hungary, prohibited the Catholics in their army to join the sermon of the papal bishop. Upon hearing that German mercenaries joined a sermon, Dušan became enraged, but regained their composure soon thereafter, when their commander, Palman, said that they would defend their faith, not only by accepting punishment but even by clashing against Dušan's Imperial Army, if need be. The papal bishop, irritated with the failure of their mission, turned home and on the way visited Louis I, asking them to furiously continue the war on Serbia.
In 1355 their unit was sent by Dušan to garrison the town of Klis (in the realm of Jelena, their sister) due to Croatian vassals to Hungary were advancing to Klis and Skradin. After the death of Dušan in 1355, they worked for Teodora. In 1363 they were a beneficiary of a will in Dubrovnik.
Legacy
 They are enumerated in Serbian epic poetry, alongside their brother Kijaran (Chiarane), and nephew Đorđe (Georg).

was the 11th daimyō of Shibata Domain in Echigo Province, Japan (modern-day Niigata Prefecture). Their courtesy title was Shūzen-no-kami, and their Court rank was Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade.
Biography
Mizoguchi Naohiro was the eldest son of Mizoguchi Naoaki and was born in Shibata to a concubine. They were called to Edo in 1825 and raised by Naoaki's official wife. They were received in formal audience by Shōgun Tokugawa Ienari in 1832, and became daimyō in 1838 on their father's retirement. In 1842, the shogunate called upon Shibata to repair the shogun mausoleum at Nikko. In 1860, the domain's duties with regards to the defense of Sado island were removed, and they were assigned to bolster the defenses of the Echigo coastline instead. Their official kokudaka was also increased to 100,000 koku. In 1861, they were appointed one of the escorts for the trip by Princess Kazunomiya to Edo for their wedding to Shōgun Tokugawa Iemochi. Their court rank was raised to Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade. The following year, they were in the entourage of Shogun Tokugawa Iemochi's trip to Kyoto and was received in audience by Emperor Kōmei. They also constructed a residence in Kyoto. In 1863, the domain's responsibility over the Echigo coastline was rescinded, but they were assigned to act as regent over Takada Domain and their duties regarding the protection Sado Island were revived. During the Mito rebellion of 1864, they were ordered to dispatch troops to Shimotsuke Province. In 1866, they were recalled to Kyoto to provide guard duty. In 1867, they officially retired in favor of their son and in 1868 returned to Shibata, where they took the tonsure. In 1870, they returned to Tokyo, where they died in 1874. Their grave is at the temple of Kisshō-ji in Tokyo.
Naohiro was married to a daughter of Matsudaira Yasutō of Hamada Domain, and after their death, remarried to a daughter of Tsuchiya Yoshioki of Tsuchiura Domain. They had a total of 16 sons and 15 daughters, most of whom died in childhood.

Moon blocks or jiaobei (also written as jiao bei etc. variants; ), also poe (from ; as used in the term "poe divination"), are wooden divination tools originating from China, which are used in pairs and thrown to seek divine guidance in the form of a yes or no question. They are made out of wood or bamboo and carved into a crescent shape. A pair of clamshells can also be used. Each block is round on one side (known as the yin side) and flat on the other (known as the yang side). It is one of the more commonly used items found in Chinese traditional religion and are used in temples and home shrines along with fortune sticks, both of which are often used together when requesting an answer from the Deities.
Practice
Moon blocks can be used separately to receive a straightforward answer, or they are accompanied by fortune sticks to clarify an oracle. When used alone, moon blocks are first purified by revolving the blocks around the incense burner three times. The querent then kneels and says their name, date of birth, residence, and question while cupping the blocks between their hands in prayer. After the querent poses the question to the gods, the blocks are dropped to the floor and land in a specific position.
There are four possible answers that the moon blocks can produce:
Shèngjiǎo (聖筊, divine answer): One block flat and another block round is a 'yes' answer.
Nùjiǎo (怒筊, angry answer) also kūjiao (哭筊, crying answer) or méijiǎo (沒筊, no answer): Both blocks round is a 'no' answer. It is said that the gods are displeased or show disagreement with the question, and this is shown in the way the blocks directly fall flat on the floor.
Xiàojiǎo (笑筊, laughing answer): Both blocks flat have several interpretations; in any case it is said the gods are laughing at the question depending on what has been asked. It can be interpreted as an emphasized 'no' answer, the question that was asked was unclear, or that the answer to the question is obvious. One characteristic of this answer is when the blocks sway back and forth when dropped, a symbolic show of laughter.
Lìjiǎo (立筊, standing answer): One or both blocks falling but standing erect on the floor (so that the block is standing up on the two pointed ends) indicates that the deities do not understand the referent's question, therefore the question is nullified and the procedure must be repeated.
When used alone without the fortune sticks, the blocks are thrown three times in order to maintain accuracy of the deity's answer, a successful answer usually being three consecutive throws showing shèngjiǎo, or best two out of three throws.
Usages
Aside from questioning the deities on mundane affairs, moon blocks are also used to verify a range of issues, such as proper ritual protocol, spiritual presence of the gods or if they have eaten the offerings presented to them.

Amka was the name of an ancient Egyptian senior official who served the Pharaohs Djer, Djet and Den during the First Dynasty of Egypt.  They are the first early Egyptian official whose career can be traced almost continuously.
Amka served during three reigns in the First Dynasty; their name appears on seal impressions from the tombs of the pharaohs Djer, Djet and Den and of Queen Merneith in the royal cemetery at Abydos. Their career began in the last years of the reign of King Djer, continued through the reign of Djet and ended in the first years of the reign of King Den, when Merneith was regent. Under Djer they were already involved in the administration of the domain of "Hor-sekhenti-dju" and had the titles "nebi" and "heri-nehenu".
They retained the latter title under Djet. Under Merneith and Den, they appear to have reached the height of their career, achieving the rank of mortuary priest (sekhenu-akh). Their last position was as district administrator (adj-mer) of the House of the Calf (hut-ihut), a district in the western Nile Delta, probably near Kom el-Hisn. They appear to have moved from the administration of royal foundations to regional administration.

An Apache scout is a member of an Apache tribe who is trained in reconnaissance, either for hunting, defense of the people, or during times of war.
Background
Only Lipan, Chiricahua and Mescaleros have, or have historically had, scout societies. The scouts' original purpose was to protect the people in their clan from enemies, to locate game and new campsites. This traditional role in community is different from that of the military scouts hired by the United States Army during the Indian Wars.
Training
Scouts traditionally train in an intense process that can last over ten years. Traditional skills to be mastered include tracking and hunting, wilderness survival, and cultural knowledge unique to their particular band.

Belinda Barbara Chapple (born 15 January 1975) is an Australian singer, creative director and interior designer. They were a former member of all-female pop group Bardot (2000–02), from the reality TV talent competition Popstars series 1.
Career
In late 1999, at the age of 24, Chapple auditioned for the first Australian series of Popstars, a reality television show which aimed to produce a new girl group. Belinda was selected out of over 2000 girls that auditioned across Australia.
Popstars was one of the most popular, highest-rating television programs in Australia of 2000 and with the group's overwhelming exposure, Bardot's debut single "Poison" and self-titled debut album both entered at number one on the Australian ARIA charts, achieving multi-platinum sales. Further singles "I Should've Never Let You Go" and "These Days" continued the group's success on the Australian charts and in August, Bardot embarked on its first national tour. Wood performed with their bandmates at the ARIA Music Awards of 2001 for which they were nominated in three categories. Promotional tours were made in numerous countries including Singapore, Taiwan, New Zealand, India and the United Kingdom.
Bardot returned to the spotlight in late 2001 with "ASAP", the first single from their second album. "ASAP" charted in the Top 5, as well as the following single, "I Need Somebody". In November, the group released their second album, Play It Like That, which achieved gold status upon release. In early 2002, the group embarked on their second national tour and released their final single "Love Will Find a Way" before parting amicably in March of the same year.
After Bardot's split Chapple developed two live acts; a more traditional jazz show with Darren Mapes, and their preferred dance and pop performance with choreographer and dancer Michael Boyd. They released two solo singles: the Olympic Games ballad "Where It All Began" in August 2004 and "Move Together" in April 2005. A dance-pop collaboration with UK mix master Solitaire, "Move Together" peaked at No. 26 on the ARIA Singles Chart. Chapple later became a creative director of the stage show, Sydney After Dark with The X Factor Australia's finalist Natalie Conway as a lead vocalist.
Chapple then moved onto working behind the scenes in the entertainment industry as creative director for Ice TV for Asia's Next Top Model in Singapore and as Company Manager for the talent at Universal Studios Singapore. They later studied interior design at the National Design Academy in the United Kingdom and now runs their own interior design business, House of Chapple.
In April 2020, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the release of their debut single "Poison", Chapple and Bardot bandmates Tiffani Wood and Katie Underwood reunited remotely online to perform the song. In September 2021, it was announced that Chapple and Underwood would professionally reunite as a duo under the name Ka'Bel, with their debut single "Broken Hearted" released on 15 October 2021.

Silver Box is a 5-CD box set by Scottish rock band Simple Minds, released in October 2004. It includes Our Secrets Are the Same (as disc 5), the band's long-delayed (1999/2000) twelfth studio album of original material.
Overview
Silver Box is mostly made up of previously unreleased demos, BBC sessions and various live recordings from 1979 to 1995. It also includes, as a final bonus disc, their genuine twelfth studio album (of original material), Our Secrets Are the Same. Originally recorded between April and June 1999 and originally planned to be released on its own in early 2000, Our Secrets Are the Same was delayed many times and even cancelled until its final inclusion in the box set.
Critical reception
The few professional reviews the compilation received commented on the previously elusive album Our Secrets Are The Same positively. Adam Sweeting, writing for The Guardian newspaper, opined, "The album, dating from 1999, was scuppered by legal wranglings, but it's some of the best music the band have made in 20 years. Tracks such as "Death by Chocolate" or "Happy Is the Man" recall something of their old pioneering spirit, and show a fascination with the process of recording rather than with prancing about in front of a sea of cigarette lighters." They dismissed most of the third and fourth discs as evidence of the band's progression into "overblown" stadium rock, but admitted: "If you chucked out most of the discs three and four from this beefy five-disc box, you'd be left with some fascinating insights and lost nuggets from the past and near-present of Simple Minds. Rob Fitzpatrick writing for the NME agreed, saying, "By CD3, "Waterfront" – a neat throb of a single – is bloated into ten-plus minutes of pointless noodling and "Ghost Dancing" is so clearly similar in sound to U2's "The Unforgettable Fire" it's embarrassing. By CD4 it's time for "Belfast Child". God no! Miraculously, though, CD5 the band's 1999 'lost' album has some really good music on it in fact it's a lost gem that some fans have never heard or even know about.
Uncut meanwhile admitted that the new album would be the main source of interest, but thought that the music still owed much to U2, writing, "It finds Kerr and Burchill still a bit in the slipstream of '90s U2 – tastefully epic, techno-fringed and extravagantly exasperated ("Death By Chocolate" and "Neon Cowboys") with the wickedness of a world gone wrong." Martin C. Strong meanwhile, in The Essential Rock Discography, complimented the band's new music: "The album's savvy pop smarts harked back to their early 80s purple period, only underlining the shortcomings of Néapolis, while the sassy momentum of "Jeweller to the Stars" could've easily regenerated Kerr and Co's contemporary credibility."

In chemistry, an interhalogen compound is a molecule which contains two or more different halogen atoms (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, or astatine) and no atoms of elements from any other group.
Most interhalogen compounds known are binary (composed of only two distinct elements). Their formulae are generally , where n = 1, 3, 5 or 7, and X is the less electronegative of the two halogens. The value of n in interhalogens is always odd, because of the odd valence of halogens. They are all prone to hydrolysis, and ionize to give rise to polyhalogen ions. Those formed with astatine have a very short half-life due to astatine being intensely radioactive.
No interhalogen compounds containing three or more different halogens are definitely known, although a few books claim that and have been obtained, and theoretical studies seem to indicate that some compounds in the series are barely stable.
Some interhalogens, such as , , and , are good halogenating agents. is too reactive to generate fluorine. Beyond that, iodine monochloride has several applications, including helping to measure the saturation of fats and oils, and as a catalyst for some reactions. A number of interhalogens, including , are used to form polyhalides.
Similar compounds exist with various pseudohalogens, such as the halogen azides (, , , and ) and cyanogen halides (, , , and ).
Types of interhalogens
Diatomic interhalogens
The interhalogens of form XY have physical properties intermediate between those of the two parent halogens. The covalent bond between the two atoms has some ionic character, the less electronegative halogen, X, being oxidised and having a partial positive charge. All combinations of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine that have the above-mentioned general formula are known, but not all are stable. Some combinations of astatine with other halogens are not even known, and those that are known are highly unstable.
Chlorine monofluoride (ClF) is the lightest interhalogen compound. ClF is a colorless gas with a normal boiling point of −100 °C.
Bromine monofluoride (BrF) has not been obtained as a pure compound — it dissociates into the trifluoride and free bromine. It is created according to the following equation:
Br2(l) + F2(g) → 2 BrF(g)
Bromine monofluoride dissociates like this:
3 BrF → Br2 + BrF3
Iodine monofluoride (IF) is unstable and decomposes at 0 °C, disproportionating into elemental iodine and iodine pentafluoride.
Bromine monochloride (BrCl) is a yellow-brown gas with a boiling point of 5 °C.
Iodine monochloride (ICl) exists as red transparent crystals that melt at 27.2 °C to form a choking brownish liquid (similar in appearance and weight to bromine). It reacts with HCl to form the strong acid HICl2. The crystal structure of iodine monochloride consists of puckered zig-zag chains, with strong interactions between the chains.
Astatine monochloride (AtCl) is made either by the direct combination of gas-phase astatine with chlorine or by the sequential addition of astatine and dichromate ion to an acidic chloride solution.
Iodine monobromide (IBr) is made by the direct combination of the elements to form a dark red crystalline solid. It melts at 42 °C and boils at 116 °C to form a partially dissociated vapour.
Astatine monobromide (AtBr) is made by the direct combination of astatine with either bromine vapour or an aqueous solution of iodine monobromide.
Astatine monoiodide (AtI) is made by direct combination of astatine and iodine.
No astatine fluorides have been discovered yet. Their absence has been speculatively attributed to the extreme reactivity of such compounds, including the reaction of an initially formed fluoride with the walls of the glass container to form a non-volatile product. Thus, although the synthesis of an astatine fluoride is thought to be possible, it may require a liquid halogen fluoride solvent, as has already been used for the characterization of radon fluorides.
In addition, there exist analogous molecules involving pseudohalogens, such as the cyanogen halides.
Tetratomic interhalogens
Chlorine trifluoride (ClF3) is a colourless gas that condenses to a green liquid, and freezes to a white solid. It is made by reacting chlorine with an excess of fluorine at 250 °C in a nickel tube. It reacts more violently than fluorine, often explosively. The molecule is planar and T-shaped. It is used in the manufacture of uranium hexafluoride.
Bromine trifluoride (BrF3) is a yellow-green liquid that conducts electricity — it self-ionises to form [BrF2]+ and [BrF4]−. It reacts with many metals and metal oxides to form similar ionised entities; with other metals, it forms the metal fluoride plus free bromine and oxygen; and with water, it forms hydrofluoric acid and hydrobromic acid. It is used in organic chemistry as a fluorinating agent. It has the same molecular shape as chlorine trifluoride.
Iodine trifluoride (IF3) is a yellow solid that decomposes above −28 °C. It can be synthesised from the elements, but care must be taken to avoid the formation of IF5. F2 attacks I2 to yield IF3 at −45 °C in CCl3F. Alternatively, at low temperatures, the fluorination reaction
I2 + 3 XeF2 → 2 IF3 + 3 Xe
can be used. Not much is known about iodine trifluoride as it is so unstable.
Iodine trichloride (ICl3) forms lemon yellow crystals that melt under pressure to a brown liquid. It can be made from the elements at low temperature, or from iodine pentoxide and hydrogen chloride. It reacts with many metal chlorides to form tetrachloroiodides (), and hydrolyses in water. The molecule is a planar dimer (ICl3)2, with each iodine atom surrounded by four chlorine atoms.
Iodine tribromide (IBr3) is a dark brown liquid.
Hexatomic interhalogens
All stable hexatomic and octatomic interhalogens involve a heavier halogen combined with five or seven fluorine atoms. Unlike the other halogens, fluorine atoms have high electronegativity and small size which is able to stabilize them.
Chlorine pentafluoride (ClF5) is a colourless gas, made by reacting chlorine trifluoride with fluorine at high temperatures and high pressures. It reacts violently with water and most metals and nonmetals.
Bromine pentafluoride (BrF5) is a colourless fuming liquid, made by reacting bromine trifluoride with fluorine at 200 °C. It is physically stable, but decomposes violently on contact with water, organic substances, and most metals and nonmetals.
Iodine pentafluoride (IF5) is a colourless liquid, made by reacting iodine pentoxide with fluorine, or iodine with silver(II) fluoride. It is highly reactive, even slowly with glass. It reacts with water to form hydrofluoric acid and with fluorine gas to form iodine heptafluoride. The molecule has the form of a tetragonal pyramid.
Octatomic interhalogens
Iodine heptafluoride (IF7) is a colourless gas and a strong fluorinating agent. It is made by reacting iodine pentafluoride with fluorine gas. The molecule is a pentagonal bipyramid. This compound is the only known interhalogen compound where the larger atom is carrying seven of the smaller atoms.
All attempts to synthesize bromine or chlorine heptafluoride have met with failure; instead, bromine pentafluoride or chlorine pentafluoride is produced, along with fluorine gas.
Properties
Typically, interhalogen bonds are more reactive than diatomic halogen bonds—because interhalogen bonds are weaker than diatomic halogen bonds, except for F2. If interhalogens are exposed to water, they convert to halide and oxyhalide ions. With BrF5, this reaction can be explosive. If interhalogens are exposed to silicon dioxide, or metal oxides, then silicon or metal respectively bond with one of the types of halogen, leaving free diatomic halogens and diatomic oxygen. Most interhalogens are halogen fluorides, and all but three (IBr, AtBr, and AtI) of the remainder are halogen chlorides. Chlorine and bromine can each bond to five fluorine atoms, and iodine can bond to seven. AX and AX3 interhalogens can form between two halogens whose electronegativities are relatively close to one another. When interhalogens are exposed to metals, they react to form metal halides of the constituent halogens. The oxidation power of an interhalogen increases with the number of halogens attached to the central atom of the interhalogen, as well as with the decreasing size of the central atom of the compound. Interhalogens containing fluorine are more likely to be volatile than interhalogens containing heavier halogens.
Interhalogens with one or three halogens bonded to a central atom are formed by two elements whose electronegativities are not far apart. Interhalogens with five or seven halogens bonded to a central atom are formed by two elements whose sizes are very different. The number of smaller halogens that can bond to a large central halogen is guided by the ratio of the atomic radius of the larger halogen over the atomic radius of the smaller halogen. A number of interhalogens, such as IF7, react with all metals except for those in the platinum group. IF7, unlike interhalogens in the XY5 series, does not react with the fluorides of the alkali metals.
ClF3 is the most reactive of the XY3 interhalogens. ICl3 is the least reactive. BrF3 has the highest thermal stability of the interhalogens with four atoms. ICl3 has the lowest. Chlorine trifluoride has a boiling point of −12 °C. Bromine trifluoride has a boiling point of 127 °C and is a liquid at room temperature. Iodine trichloride melts at 101 °C.
Most interhalogens are covalent gases. Some interhalogens, especially those containing bromine, are liquids, and most iodine-containing interhalogens are solids. Most of the interhalogens composed of lighter halogens are fairly colorless, but the interhalogens containing heavier halogens are deeper in color due to their higher molecular weight. In this respect, the interhalogens are similar to the halogens. The greater the difference between the electronegativities of the two halogens in an interhalogen, the higher the boiling point of the interhalogen. All interhalogens are diamagnetic. The bond length of interhalogens in the XY series increases with the size of the constituent halogens. For instance, ClF has a bond length of 1.628 Å, and IBr has a bond length of 2.47 Å.
Production
It is possible to produce larger interhalogens, such as ClF3, by exposing smaller interhalogens, such as ClF, to pure diatomic halogens, such as F2. This method of production is especially useful for generating halogen fluorides. At temperatures of 250 to 300 °C, this type of production method can also convert larger interhalogens into smaller ones. It is also possible to produce interhalogens by combining two pure halogens at various conditions. This method can generate any interhalogen save for IF7.
Smaller interhalogens, such as ClF, can form by direct reaction with pure halogens. For instance, F2 reacts with Cl2 at 250 °C to form two molecules of ClF. Br2 reacts with diatomic fluorine in the same way, but at 60 °C. I2 reacts with diatomic fluorine at only 35 °C. ClF and BrF can both be produced by the reaction of a larger interhalogen, such as ClF3 or BrF3 and a diatomic molecule of the element lower in the periodic table. Among the hexatomic interhalogens, IF5 has a higher boiling point (97 °C) than BrF5 (40.5 °C), although both compounds are liquids at room temperature. The interhalogen IF7 can be formed by reacting palladium iodide with fluorine.

Eccentricities of a Blonde-Haired Girl () is a 2009 Portuguese romance film directed by Manoel de Oliveira. Oliveira's grandson has a starring role. It played at the New York Film Festival and was released on DVD.
Plot
Macário tells their story to a woman while on a train, telling them about their attraction to a woman named Luisa whom they first notice in a window across the street from their accounting office. With the help of a mutual acquaintance, Macário is introduced to Luisa at a salon. Macário asks their uncle, who is also their employer, if they can have their permission to marry Luisa. Their uncle says that if they do marry her, they will be fired and will be disinherited. Despite their uncle's refusal, Macário decides that they want to marry Luisa anyway. Due to their failure to find employment, Macário travels to Cape Verde to try to raise money as part of an unnamed business proposition. Macário manages to receive a fortune and their uncle later accepts the marriage. On a trip to buy a wedding ring, Macário discovers that Luisa is a shoplifter and does not marry them As the story is told to the woman on the train, the outside scenery changes from snowy to green.
Production
The film is based on a short story by 19th-century Portuguese writer Eça de Queiros. The director's grandson Ricardo Trêpa plays the role of Macário. A review from The New York Times described the film as "essentially a parable about romantic dreams" and that everything within it is framed, as in the film's plot is framed by the train trip, Luisa is framed by a window as well as seen through a window, and behind Luisa is a framed portrait.
Director Manoel de Oliveira completed the film when they were 100 years old, making them the oldest man to direct a feature film.
Release
The film premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival, held at the Cinema Paris, on February 10, 2009. It was later shown at the New York Film Festival in the same year.
It was released on DVD by The Cinema Guild with the option to watch the Portuguese film with English subtitles. Inside the case is a paper insert with liner notes from James Quandt, who programs the TIFF Cinemateque. The special features are a trailer of the film, a trailer for the then upcoming film The Strange Case of Angelica, a 2009 press conference that took place at the 2009 Berlin Film Festival, and a short film directed by Oliveira titled The Panels of São Vincente de Fora – A Poetic Vision.
Reception
Eccentricities of a Blonde-Haired Girl has received generally favorable reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a rating of 77%, based on 22 reviews. Jamie S. Rich of DVD Talk wrote, "While I may soon forget the particulars of the script, I'll probably be thinking about how good Eccentricities of a Blonde-Haired Girl looked for quite a while."
Dennis Schwartz said in their review, "A mesmerizing, charming and disturbing morality tale of doomed love." Anthony Quinn, writing for The Independent wrote, "The story's period origins intrude here – how many young Portuguese professionals today would ask their uncle/employer for permission to marry? – but de Oliveira's dreamlike mood neutralises such implausibility."

Raja Ampat Regency is a regency of West Papua Province of Indonesia. The regency, which was formed based on the Law 26 of 2002, was inaugurated on 12 April 2003, and consists of a number of groups of islands situated off the north-west end of West Papua; the four main islands from south to north are Misool, Salawati, Batanta, and Waigeo. At present, the regency covers a land area of 7,559.60 km2, with a total area (including 59,820.01 km2 of sea area) stated as 67,379.61 km2. It had a population of 42,508 at the 2010 Census, and 64,141 at the 2020 Census. The principal town lies at Waisai.
On 25 October 2013 the People's Representative Council (DPR) began reviewing draft laws on the establishment of new regencies, including two new regencies of North Raja Ampat and South Raja Ampat within the borders of the existing Raja Ampat Regency. As at June 2022, these changes have not yet been implemented.
Geography
Raja Ampat Regency is a regency whose territory consists mostly of and the Puiau cluster is located at a position of 2° 25' north latitude 4025' latitude
south and 130° - 132° 55' east longitude. This district has an area of ±6,084.5 km2. Administratively, the boundaries of the Raja Ampat Regency are as follows:
North : Bounded by the Pacific Ocean
South: Bounded by the Seram Sea.
West : Bounded by the Seram Sea, Central Halmahera Regency, North Maluku Province
East : Bounded by West Sorong District, Sorong City, Aimas District, Seget District, Sorong Regency and Seram Sea
Administrative Districts
At the 2010 Census, the regency was divided into seventeen districts (kecamatan). Subsequently, seven additional districts have been created by the division of existing districts. The twenty-four districts are tabulated below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and the 2020 Census.
Note: (a) the Ayau Islands (including Ayau District) lie some distance to the north of Waigeo.
Misool and Kofiau Islands (comprising the first six districts listed above) are currently in the process of being split off to form a separate South Raja Ampat Regency under those same proposals approved in 2014 by the Indonesian Government. Similarly, Waigeo and its surrounding small islands (comprising the last thirteen districts listed above) are currently in the process of being split off to form a separate North Raja Ampat Regency under proposals approved in 2014 by the Indonesian Government. This will leave just five districts (those comprising the Salawati and Batanta group) in the residual Raja Ampat Regency. However, as at May 2021, these changes have not yet been implemented.
Since 2010, the new Kota Waisai district has been created from part of Waigeo Selatan District, the new Tiplol Mayalibit district has been created from part of Telunk Mayalibit District, the new Supnin district has been created from part of Waigeo Utarat District, and the new Ayau district has been created from part of Kepulauan Ayau District.
The proposed splits from the existing regency will leave the five remaining districts, mainly consisting of Salawati and Batanta Islands, in the centre of the existing regency; note that the southern half of Salawati Island does not form part of the existing regency, but instead constitutes the Salawati Selatan District of Sorong Regency. Since 2010, the new Salawati Tengah and Salawati Barat districts have been created from parts of Salawati Utara District, while the former Selat Sagawin District has been divided into two new districts - Batanta Utara and Batanta Selatan.
Transport
Air
In early May 2012, a 1,200 metres runway of Marinda Airport on Waigeo Island was officially opened by the Transportation minister and Raja Ampat official. The runway was later extended to 2,000 metres and was predicted to be finished in 2013.

The dwarf tyrant-manakin or dwarf tyranneutes (Tyranneutes stolzmanni) is a species of bird in the family Pipridae.
Distribution and habitat
It is found throughout most of the Amazon Basin, except the area east of the Rio Negro. Rarely found at the edges of the forest, it prefers being at the mid-strata level deep in the forest. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests.
Description
The dwarf tyrant-manakin is dull olive above, but lights to a yellow-olive below. It has a short tail.
Behavior
These birds rarely move, but produce a distinctive two-note call, which readily identifies them.

The Riegle Report, officially titled "U.S. Chemical and Biological Warfare-Related Dual Use Exports to Iraq and their Possible Impact on the Health Consequences of the Gulf War", summarized testimony before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs with Respect to Export Administration. The May 25, 1994, report by Committee Chairman Riegle and ranking minority member Alfonse M. D'Amato concludes that there is significant evidence that "coalition forces were exposed to mix chemical agents as a result of coalition bombings of Iraqi nuclear, chemical, and biological facilities and that the fallout from these bombings may be contributing to the health problems currently being suffered by Gulf War veterans" following the Gulf War (1990–1991). The report also implicates the U.S. Department of Commerce as well as the American Type Culture Collection in the shipment of biological research samples to Iraq:
"Records available from the supplier for the period from 1985 until the present show that during this time, pathogenic, toxigenic, and other biological research materials were exported to Iraq pursuant to application and licensing by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Records prior to 1985 were not available, according to the supplier. These exported biological materials were not attenuated or weakened and were capable of reproduction."
Senator Riegle also called in the Congressional Record for the U.S. Department of Defense to continue to investigate the potential causes of Gulf War syndrome and to provide needed care to afflicted Gulf War veterans and their families:
"Frankly, the Defense Department does not have too much interest in [a retired Army colonel who is sick and unemployed]. They are looking ahead to other things. They are not looking back at the large number of sick veterans who are out there.
"But it does not take a Ph.D., knowing Saddam Hussein's record, knowing they had the production facilities, knowing that we went in and bombed some of those production facilities, and knowing that the things that we sent them helped them produce biological weapons, to understand that such exposures may—I underline the word may—be causing the problems of a lot of our sick veterans that otherwise are defying explanation."

The Carrefour Saint-Georges is a shopping centre located in Saint-Georges, Quebec, Canada which opened in 1974. Its current anchors include Super C and Bureau en Gros.
Brief history
The mall opened in 1974 and was then anchored by Zellers, A&P and Greenberg. In 1977, A&P became Provigain and in 1979, became a Provigo.
The mall was completely renovated and expanded in 1992 and a new Sears store was added in a new wing. In 1997, Greenberg was replaced by SAAN. That store later closed and the mall transformed the area into smaller stores. Provigo left the mall in 2002 and the space has been leased by Bureau en Gros.
In 2011, Target Corporation acquired a group of Zellers sites to convert the vast majority of them into Target stores. The Saint-Georges store was among them and was officially confirmed as a future Target store. Zellers closed on March 14, 2013 and Target opened on September 17, 2013 after extensive renovations to the space. Target occupied the space until March 22, 2015 when the store closed its doors following the bankruptcy of Target Canada. Super C then announced they would open a supermarket in nearly half of the former Target space. The store opened in the spring of 2016.

Sitara is an Indian Bengali-language film directed by Ashis Roy and based on novel Bhorer Proshuti by Abul Bashar. Produced by Siva prasad Pradhan under the Shivani Entertainment banner, the film stars Nassar as the title Raima Sen. The film focuses on Sitara, as a poor Bangladeshi housewife who crossed the border to enter the Indian lands illegally. It was released on 19 July 2019.
Plot
Sitara is a poor Bangladeshi housewife who crossed the border to enter the Indian lands illegally, with their husband Jiban Sheikh. Jiban sold Sitara to Kabir, a notorious smuggler of ladies' and gents' pants, in order to earn bread by smuggling garments from Bangladesh. Sitara's father and brother also supported Jiban for their own selfish motives. Sitara found themselves trapped and in deep hatred for their own people. This led them to accept themselves as the ladies' and gents' pants queen. They soon established themselves in the trade by offering their youth to the traders, agents, police officers and the security forces officers of both the countries. Dilu, a poor Bangladeshi, who accompanied Sitara and Jiban had arrived with their mentally challenged sister. Jiban had appointed Dilu to look after their wife but Dilu soon fell in love with them Although they could not gather enough courage to confess their love, they tried hard to dissuade Sitara from doing such a risky job, but all went in vain. Sitara rising to fame as the queen of ladies' and gents' pants came with a cost. Various diseases began to leech off of them and left them alone, frail and penniless. Even their husband who pushed them to this state soon divorced them after they fell ill. Only Dilu who had lost their sister by this time stood beside Sitara. But, they pushed them away as they did not want to spoil their life. After these times of turmoil Sitara's health recovered but their position in the ladies' and gents' pants business could not be regained. Meanwhile, Sitara met Manab, a social worker fighting for the rights of the poor people living in the border area. Sitara joined them and revoked the local people to rise up against the administration and local mafias. Sitara eventually fell in love with Manab and led them to success. Like others Manab too abandoned them after becoming an M.L.A. and went ahead to marry a rich woman from Kolkata. Sitara's plight to earn a living continued.

The pale-yellow robin (Tregellasia capito) is a species of passerine bird in the family Petroicidae. It is endemic to eastern Australia. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. It is a nondescript bird with grey head and olive upperparts, white throat and yellow underparts. The sexes are similar. Two subspecies are recognised: the smaller nana from North Queensland, and the larger and uncommon nominate race capito from southeast Queensland and northeastern New South Wales. It is insectivorous.
Taxonomy
The pale-yellow robin was first described by ornithologist John Gould in 1854. For many years, it was classified with the other yellow robins in the genus Eopsaltria, on the basis of plumage, nests, and behaviour. Others have placed it with the genus Poecilodryas, due to the similarly plumaged fledglings. However, the closest relatives of both it and the related white-faced robin remain unclear, and are hence placed in their own small genus Tregellasia, originally erected by Gregory Mathews in 1912. Like all Australian robins, it is not closely related to either the European robin or the American robin, but belongs rather to the Corvida parvorder, comprising many tropical and Australian passerines, including pardalotes, fairy-wrens and honeyeaters, as well as crows.
Alternate common names given to the species have been large-headed robin and pale robin.
Subspecies
T. c. capito is the nominate race from rainforests of northeastern New South Wales and southeastern Queensland. Larger than the northern subspecies, it has a paler off-white face and is uncommon within its range.
T. c. nana, described in 1878 as Eopsaltria nana by E.B. Ramsay from a specimen collected in Cardwell, has been called the buff-faced or rufous-lored robin, and is found in rainforest in far north Queensland. It is smaller than the southern subspecies, and its subspecific name nana is Latin for 'dwarf'. It has a pale tan face and a pale orange-brown eye ring, hence its common name. It is fairly abundant within its range.
Description
The male and female pale-yellow robin are similar in plumage. Measuring and weighing , it is a bird of subdued appearance, with grey head and nape blending into olive-green upperparts, more brownish on the wings and tail. The throat is white, and the lores are off-white in the southern race and buff in the northern race. The breast and belly are yellow. The legs are yellow-orange and the iris dark brown. The thin black bill is around long. Juvenile birds are rufous with paler streaks on the head. It can be distinguished from the eastern yellow robin, as the latter bird has black legs and is a little larger.
The pale-yellow robin makes a trilling call when displaying or defending its territory.
Distribution and habitat
Sedentary in its range, the pale-yellow robin is found from Mount Amos to Paluma in North Queensland, and from Cooloola on the Sunshine Coast south to Barrington Tops National Park in New South Wales. It prefers rainforest or dense eucalypt forest, particularly where the lawyer vine grows.
Behaviour
The pale-yellow robin is arboreal and secretive. It is predominantly insectivorous, though may supplement its diet with seeds.
Breeding
It uses the prickly lawyer vine (Calamus muelleri) as nesting material and as a nest site. The nest may be anywhere up to 10 m (30 ft) above the ground, though often much lower. Breeding season is July to December with one, or sometimes two, broods. A clutch of 2 oval eggs, measuring , is laid. They are pale green, splotched with brownish marks.

Paint and other coatings that are on slanted or vertical surfaces tend to sag when first applied. The thickness of the coating as well as the composition and viscosity will affect the overall sagging and conversely the sag resistance. In order to find the sag resistance of a coating a simple test is used. A metal applicator bar is used along with a Drawdown card.
The applicator is U-shaped and is manufactured with a set of 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) wide notches. The notches are spaced 1/16 inch (1.6 mm) apart. The applicator bar is 5 inches (127 mm) wide and
leaves 3 3/8 inches (86 mm) of applied coating behind after use. After the bar is drawn down the card with the coating, a series of parallel stripes with varying film thickness will be formed. The card is then placed on a vertical surface with the thickest of the stripes at the bottom. The coating will then sag downward and the clearance of the gap that produces the thickest film stripe, not sagging completely to the stripe below, is the anti-sag index of the coating.

Lantern Theater Company is a not-for-profit regional theater founded in 1994 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Led by founding artistic director Charles McMahon and managing director Anne Shuff, the Lantern produces a mix of classics, modern, and original works for the stage, an audience enrichment series that provides an insider's look at each production, and Illumination, its Barrymore Award-winning education program that engages local students and adults in the world of theater and nurtures their artistic expression through in-school residencies, student matinee performances, and teaching artist training for after school programs.
Lantern Theater Company has been in residence at St. Stephen's Theater at 10th and Ludlow Streets in Center City since 1996, managing the performance space and developing it into an affordable multi-purpose performing arts venue.

The Femco Farms consisted of five farm properties established in Wilkin County, Minnesota, United States, in the 1920s and 1930s to experiment with livestock breeding and agricultural diversification. They were created by Frederick E. Murphy, publisher of the Minneapolis Tribune newspaper, to demonstrate improved techniques like crop rotation that could benefit farmers. The Femco Farms became famous for their influential practices, and especially for their incredibly productive dairy cows. The best preserved of the five properties, Femco Farm No. 2, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 for its local significance in the area of agriculture.
History
Ordered by their doctor in 1918 to spend more time outdoors to combat frail health, newspaper publisher Frederick E. Murphy moved from Minneapolis to their wife's family farm in Wilkin County. They had long dreamed of experimenting with improved agricultural techniques, and began buying farm properties in the area. Soon Murphy had amassed five farms around Wilkin County, totaling about . The name they gave them, "Femco", was based on their initials.
The Femco Farms grew oats, barley, corn, alfalfa, sweet clover, rye, and flax. More importantly, Murphy invested exclusively in purebred livestock, namely Percheron horses, Duroc Jersey hogs, McKarrow Shropshire sheep, white Orpington chickens, and Holstein dairy cows. The farms experimented with stock raising, crop rotation, and soil fertilization, and promoted diversified farming—rather than the usual focus on a few cash crops—as the solution to many of the agricultural challenges of the day.
However the Femco Farms were particularly famous for their dairy cows, winning numerous awards. One Holstein cow, Lady Pride, was showcased at the 1932 Minnesota State Fair. At the time they produced more butter than any other cow, yielding of milk and of butter in one year; at the time, the average cow yielded of milk and of butter. Another Holstein, Daisy Aaggie Ormsby III, produced of butter over the course of a year, a new record. Murphy claimed that the yields their animals achieved could be reproduced by typical farmers using their techniques.
Murphy became president of the Minneapolis Tribune in 1921 and moved back to Minneapolis. After their death in 1940, the Femco Farm properties were auctioned off to separate owners. Their award-winning dairy herds were sold as well, with some cows fetching $4,000 each ().
Location
The original Femco Farm No. 1 is located north of Breckenridge, Minnesota. Though its structures are quite dilapidated, it is readily visible from U.S. Route 75. Femco Farm No. 2 is in Roberts Township just north of Kent. Farm No. 3 was in Mitchell Township, No. 4 was located just north of No. 1, and No. 5 was in Manston Township. A sixth property known as Femco No Number, at which the farms' manager lived, was one mile north of Breckenridge.
Femco Farm No. 2
Femco Farm No. 2 totaled . It was established in 1922, and 12 structures were built that year or shortly after. Still extant at the time of the property's National Register nomination in 1979 were the supervisor and workers' house, a granary, milk house, dairy barn, silo, hog barn, sheep barn, horse barn, and machine shed. Three original structures—a chicken coop, windmill, and guest house for Murphy—had been demolished. The dairy barn is particularly distinctive, consisting of two large gambrel-roofed wings joined by a connecting hallway with its own gambrel roof.
Femco Farm No. 2 was nominated to the National Register of Historic Places as the best preserved of the five Femco Farms, which "had a lasting impact on the agricultural history of Wilkin County—and through its breeding stock, on U.S. agriculture."

Microsoft Site Server, first released in 1996, is Microsoft's discontinued solution to the growing difficulty of managing complex websites which included multiple technologies, such as user management and authentication/authorization, content management, analysis, and indexing and search. Site Server 2.0, released in early 1997, incorporated electronic commerce technology from Microsoft Merchant Server, Microsoft's first effort at providing a solution to the growing business of Internet-based commerce (or e-commerce). During the course of its evolution (culminating with Site Server 3.0), Site Server expanded on Merchant Server's functionality by annexing content management tools; which would typically be involved, it was thought, in facilitating the management of Web-facing content. Consequently, Site Server became not only a solution for businesses wanting to sell products online, but companies who had corporate intranet servers hosting documents.
Although Site Server went through several iterations, the most widely discussed and perhaps widely adopted version was the last, Site Server 3.0, released in 1998.
The primary areas of Site Server 3.0 functionality included:
Indexing and Search
Content Management
Product Management
Order Processing
Site Personalization
Ad Server
Product Legacy
For its time Site Server offered one very credible among a select few alternatives for such functionality - particularly on the Windows platform. At its release it generally came out to very positive reviews in technical journals, although compared to later products its management tools were on the arcane side. The content management functionality was adequate, but not particularly competitive with dedicated document management systems that were available at the time. On this front, Site Server's main advantage was its low cost. Another feature that might have been a source of confusion was the taxonomy management system. The tools used to maintain item metadata were very basic and required a degree of technical familiarity foreign to most business users.
On the plus side, once configured, Site Server Commerce Edition got very high ratings for management of conducting e-commerce. Management of products and orders was fairly sophisticated - a strength that would be extended in the technology that succeeded it: Microsoft Commerce Server.
Related Technologies
Site Server required the presence of either the Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000 operating systems. It was also dependent on Microsoft SQL Server. The code came from many acquired companies including eshop and Interse.
Future Development
Microsoft has discontinued production and support of Site Server. E-commerce functionality was moved into a new product called Microsoft Commerce Server. Document and content management features were mostly segregated into another product called Microsoft Content Management Server, which merged with SharePoint Server 2007 which today has two principle editions: Microsoft SharePoint Server 2019 and Microsoft SharePoint Online, part of the Office 365 services offering.
Windows Versions
After the e-commerce technology was integrated, Site Server was sold in two editions: Standard, and Commerce. The Commerce Editions incorporated a hefty premium in their cost.

The women's beach volleyball tournament at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing was held from
August 9 to August 21, at the Beach Volleyball Ground at Chaoyang Park.
Each of the 24 pairs in the tournament was placed in one of six groups of four teams apiece, and played a round-robin within that pool. The top two teams in each pool advanced to the Round of 16. The six third-place teams were ranked against each other, with ties being broken by the ratio of points won to lost. The best two advanced to the Round of 16, while the other four played two matches (#3 vs. #6 and #4 vs. #5) with the winners of those two matches advancing as well. The losers of those matches, along with the fourth-place teams in each group, were eliminated.
The 16 teams that advanced to the elimination rounds played a single-elimination tournament with a bronze medal match between the semifinal losers.
Qualification
The top eight finishes that a team has from January 1, 2007, to July 20, 2008, on the Swatch FIVB World Tour (2007 and 2008), SWATCH FIVB World Championships (2007) and on FIVB recognised Continental Championship Finals, counts towards Olympic qualification for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games.
There are 24 teams competing at the Olympic Games, with a maximum of two teams per country.
The United States had four teams in the top 8 of the FIVB Beach Volleyball Olympic Ranking, Brazil had seven teams in the top 24, but only two teams from each country can participate in the Olympic Games. Also, China had three teams and Germany had four teams in the top 24 ranking before the Games.
Qualifiers
The official cut off date for Olympic qualification for beach volleyball was July 20, 2008. The final Olympic Qualification Ranking for the 24 teams, was announced confirmed by the FIVB on July 24, 2008.

2 Austrian team Montagnolli – Swoboda is replaced by the Swiss team Kuhn – Schwer, because of medical reasons.
Participating nations
Preliminary round
The two best teams from each group will advance to the quarterfinal round.
The composition of the preliminary rounds was announced confirmed on April 16, 2008.
The #1 seeded team is placed in pool A, #2 in pool B, #3 in C, #4 in D, #5 in E, and #6 in F. But if the host nation has a team in the top 6 teams, it is automatically seeded as #1. Therefore, China's team Tian Jia – Wang (ranked as #2,) is placed in pool A.
There was held a draw of lots between seed #7 – #9, between #10 – #12, between #13 – #18, and between #19 – #24. The Drawing of lots was hosted by the 1 to 1 Energy Grand Slam, in Gstaad on July 26, as part of the 2008 SWATCH FIVB Beach Volleyball World Tour.
After the preliminary rounds, from August 9–14, 2008, the teams placed 1st and 2nd in each pool have qualified for the playoffs. The two best 3rd placed teams have also qualified. Two lucky loser matches qualifies two more of the 3rd placed teams. The two 3rd placed teams that lose their lucky losers match, are out of the competition. Also out of the competition are teams placed 4th in their pool.

Playoffs
Round of 16
The United States, Brazil and China managed to directly qualify two teams each, for the Round of 16, through the pool play. All six teams then won their matches in the Round of 16, and qualified for the quarterfinals. Austria and Australia also won each their Round of 16 match, and took the remaining two spots in the quarterfinals.
On August 15, one of the spectators gave birth to a baby boy, in the bathroom of the Olympic beach volleyball stadium where they were watching the women's playoff. Medical workers received the message about the woman at 10:10 a.m., and the baby was already born when they arrived 4 minutes later.
Overview
If the host nation has a team in the top 6 teams on the FIVB Olympic ranking when the Olympic Games begin, it is automatically seeded as #1. Therefore, China's team Tian Jia – Wang (ranked as #2 on the Olympic ranking,) is seeded as #1.

Relations between Afghanistan and Iran were established in 1935 during King Zahir Shah's reign and the Shah of Iran Reza Shah Pahlavi, though ties between the two countries have existed for millennia. As a result, many Afghans speak Persian, as Dari (an eastern dialect of Persian) is one of the official languages of Afghanistan, and many in Afghanistan also celebrate Nowruz, the Persian New Year.
Relations were negatively affected by the 1979 Iranian Revolution and issues related to the 1978–present Afghan conflicts (i.e. Mujahideen, Afghan refugees, and the Taliban), as well as Iran's water dispute and the growing influence of the United States in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. In July 2019, the Iranian government passed a law that provides Afghan nationals with a new chance to get Iranian residency. Afghans with specific scientific and professional achievements and those who have Iranian spouses and children are among those who are qualified to benefit from the law.
Historical context
Afghanistan shares a relatively long history with Iran (called Persia in the West before 1935) and it was part of many Persian Empires such as Achaemenid and Sasanian dynasties. In fact the regions which encompass the modern state of Afghanistan were considered an integral part of Iran (Persia) by the 11th century poet Firdawsi in their Shahnameh, Zabulistan was even considered the homeland of the Iranian hero Rostam. When the Safavid dynasty was founded in Persia, part of what is now Afghanistan was ruled by the Khanate of Bukhara and Babur from Kabulistan. The first Iranian Safavid Shah Shah Ismail I quickly expanded their empire in all directions, in which they also conquered large parts of nowadays Afghanistan. For centuries they ruled the region and the Safavids didn't have any problems at first ruling the easternmost territories of their empire, but their policy towards non-Shia subjects became worse and worse over time. Wars began between the Shia Safavids and the larger Sunnis, particularly in the Old Kandahar region. By the late 17th century, the Safavids were heavily declining. They had appointed their Georgian subject Gurgin Khan as governor of Kandahar in order to forcefully convert the Afghans from Sunni Islam to Shia Islam, resulting in widespread oppression and violence.
It remained this way until the rise of Mirwais Hotak, a well-respected Sunni Ghilzai Pashtun tribal chief. Mirwais succeeded in defeating the declining Safavids in a succession of battles and declared southern Afghanistan a completely independent country. Their son Mahmud conquered Persia for a short time in 1722, while it was ridden by civil strife and foreign interests from the Safavids' archrivals, the Ottomans and the Russians, and soon afterward, the Safavid dynasty ended.
Despite those events, there are cultural ties between the two nations extending thousands of years. As a result, an eastern dialect of Persian, Dari is one of the official dialects of Afghanistan. Many in Afghanistan celebrate Nowruz, a pre-Islamic Iranian spring celebration celebrated in many countries and regions in the world, the main representative being Balkh a province in the north of Afghanistan.
Diplomatic relations
Afghanistan signed a treaty of friendship with Iran in 1921, when the country was ruled by King Amanullah Khan and Iran was still under the Qajar dynasty. In September 1961 ties between two countries were broken off and resumed in May 1963. Prior to 1979, the year in which Iran underwent the Iranian Revolution and Afghanistan was invaded by the Soviet Union, the issue of water rights of the Helmand River were an issue of great importance between the two nations. Disputes over the Helmand water occurred in the 1870s, flaring again after the river changed course in 1896. In 1939, the kings of the two countries signed an accord to share water rights, which was signed but never ratified. That was repeated in 1973 with a treaty between the prime ministers of both nations and again not ratified. According to a Reuters report, In 2018 Afghan forces accused Iran of presenting the Taliban with arms and money, but Iran denies the accusation.
According to the Daily Pioneer, because of the ongoing agreement between Iran and Afghanistan, their relationship has yet to be manipulated by any third party and will remain so in the future. According to Deutsche Welle in 2018, an increase in Taliban activity in the border between Iran and Afghanistan suggests a possible cooperation between the Iranian forces and the Talibans.

In December 1979, the Soviet Union sent around 100,000 troops to the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan to assist the PDPA government against a nationwide mujahideen insurgency. The mujahideen were made up of various groups that were trained by Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. A number of revolutionary Shi'a groups took control of parts of Hazarajat in 1979 in opposition to the mujahideen groups, and had ties to the Iranian government. After the death of Khomeini in 1989, the Iranian government encouraged many of the Shi'a groups to combine and establish the Hezb-e Wahdat, hoping that they would be included in international negotiations. Between the Soviet Union's withdrawal in February 1989 and the fall from power of president Najibullah in April 1992, Iran supported the PDPA government. In the words of historian Barnett Rubin, "Iran saw the Soviet-backed Kabul government as the main force blocking the takeover of Afghanistan by Sunni Wahhabi parties backed by these three countries [Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United States]. Although it continued to support Shia parties politically, it did not support their making war on the Najibullah government." In the meantime, over a million Afghan refugees were allowed to enter Iran.
Following the emergence of the Taliban government and their harsh treatment of Afghanistan's minorities, Iran stepped up assistance to the Northern Alliance. Relations with the Taliban deteriorated further in 1998 after Taliban forces seized the Iranian consulate in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif and executed Iranian diplomats.
Since late 2001, the new Afghan government under Hamid Karzai has engaged in cordial relations with both Iran and the United States, even as relations between the United States and Iran have grown strained due to American objections to Iran's nuclear program. Iran was an important factor in the overthrow of the Taliban and has since helped revive Afghanistan's economy and infrastructure. It re-opened the Iranian Embassy in Kabul and its associated consulates in other Afghan cities. In the meantime, Iran joined the reconstruction of Afghanistan. Most of its contributions are aimed at developing the Afghan Shi'a communities, especially the ethnic Hazaras and Qizilbash. Iran also has influence on political parties represented by ethnic Tajiks, which includes Abdullah Abdullah's Coalition for Change and Hope and others. On the contrary, many Afghan politicians and experts claim that both Iran and Pakistan are working to weaken Afghanistan.
Besides Afghan lawmakers, leaders in the United States and many NATO officials also believe that Iran is meddling in Afghanistan by playing a double game. Iran usually denies these accusations. For a number of years many senior ISAF officials and others have been accusing Iran of supplying and training the Taliban insurgents.
The government of Iran is strongly against the American military presence in Afghanistan. Iranian officials often criticize specifically the American military in Afghanistan:
Ties between Afghanistan and Iran became further strained in recent years due to Iran's toughened immigration policy, hastening the repatriation of many Afghan asylum seekers. A number of Afghans were executed by hanging in public for crimes punishable with death in Iran (murder, rape, smuggling large amount of drugs, and armed robbery), which sparked angry demonstrations in Afghanistan. Between 2010 and 2011, Afghan and Iranian security forces were involved in border skirmishes in Afghanistan's Nimroz Province. In July 2011, Iran decided to cut off electricity exports to Afghanistan's Nimroz Province. In March 2012, Najibullah Kabuli, leader of the National Participation Front (NPF) of Afghanistan, accused three senior leaders of Iran's Revolutionary Guards of plotting to assassinate him. Some members of the Afghan Parliament accuses Iran of setting up Taliban bases in several Iranian cities, and that "Iran is directly involved in fanning ethnic, linguistic and sectarian tensions in Afghanistan."
According to Saudi Arabia, Afghan Senate members certified the existence of documents which affirm that the Taliban collected endorsements from both Iran and Russia. Thus members of the Taliban are located in the cities of Mashhad, Yazd and Kerman in Iran. Moreover, the Governor of the state of Farah in Afghanistan, Asif Ning, also confirmed this in an interview with the Dari-speaking Freedom Radio stating: "They are living in the cities of Yazd, Kerman and Mashhad. They eventually return to Afghanistan to vandalize. At the time being, a number of senior members of the Taliban leaders are living in Iran", adding that "[t]he bodies of Taliban fighters killed in recent clashes were delivered to their families in Iran".
Afghanistan has an embassy in Tehran and a consulate in Mashad. In order to prohibit Afghans coming into the country that will bring issues related to the Afghan Civil War with them, as of 2007, Iran charges Afghans over US$100 for a one-month regular visa and a business visa costs them over US$3,000. Before 2007, the visa was issued with only $35 fee.
Fars News Agency reported that Ali Shamkhani, a member of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, had talks with the Afghan Taliban when they were visiting Kabul on 26 December 2018.
According to The Washington Post, Iran's military had taken over some of the security operations at the Iran and Afghanistan border in 2018, in anticipation of the US withdrawal.
In 2020, the Taliban publicly condemned the U.S. killing of the Iranian Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani, expressing "deep regret over their martyrdom" and describing Soleimani as a "great warrior". However, after the Taliban took Kabul in August 2021, Iran "strongly" condemned the Taliban's Panjshir Offensive, with Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Saeed Khatibzadeh describing it as "by no means acceptable in terms of international law and humanitarian law.” The city of Tehran would even officially name a street "Panjshir Alley" in protest. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, an influential former Iranian President, even accused the United States of leading a "satanic and anti-human plot" to put the Taliban back in power in order to influence "all regional countries" such as Iran and also accused Afghanistan's neighboring country Pakistan, as well as Russia, and China, being co-conspirators who "trampled on [Afghan] people's lives, basic rights, and their right to self-determination to secure their own interests." Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), publicly insisted on an "inclusive" Taliban government which represents the restraints from "use of military means" and instead of will fulfill obligations of "dialogue to meet the demands of ethnicities and social groups" among the Afghanistan people.
In October 2021, Iran reiterated its demand for an "inclusive" government in Afghanistan, as Shia and ethnic minorities were reportedly discriminated against or even killed by Taliban forces. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Saeed Khatibzadeh said on 11 October 2021, Iran was in contact with all parties in Afghanistan, but it was "too early to talk about recognizing any Afghan government".
On 1 December 2021, clashes erupted between Afghanistan and Iran leading to casualties on both sides.
On 3 January 2022, the Iranian government re-iterated its opposition to recognise the Taliban government until it embraced ethnic and demographic diversity.
On 12 April 2022, Iran summoned the Afghan envoy to Tehran on Tuesday, according to Iranian state TV, a day after demonstrators flung rocks at Iranian diplomatic offices in Kabul and Herat over what they dubbed the Islamic Republic's "mistreatment of Afghan refugees." Afterwards Iran has confirmed allowing Taliban diplomats at Afghanistan's Embassy in Tehran, insisting, however, that the decision is not meant to pave the way for official recognition of the Taliban as a de jure government.
Bilateral trade
Trade between the two nations has increased dramatically since the overthrow of the Taliban government in late 2001. Iran and Afghanistan plan on building a new rail line connecting Mashhad to Herat. In 2009, Iran was one of the largest investor in Afghanistan, which is mainly in the construction of roads and bridges as well as agriculture and health care.
According to the chairperson of Afghanistan Chamber of Commerce and Industries, Iran's exports to Afghanistan in 2008 stood at $800 million. IRNA quoted Mohammad Qorban Haqju as saying that Iran imported $4 million worth of products like fresh and dried fruits, minerals, precious stones, and spices from the neighboring country. They said that Iran exported oil products, cement, construction material, carpets, home appliances, and detergents. Iran imported nuts, carpets, agricultural products as well as handicrafts from Afghanistan. Afghanistan imports 90 percent of its needs, except agricultural products.
Afghanistan is a major opium producer. Afghanistan produces 90% of world's heroin. Some of these drugs are smuggled into Iran and from there to European countries. Afghanistan and Iran have been persuaded to cooperate with each other in reciprocal beneficial ways due to worsening economic conditions, according to The Diplomat.
Afghanistan and Iran are major trading partners since they share an extensive border region. As part of the trade corridor with Central Asia, Afghanistan exports to Iran increased to over 40 million USD in 2013 (mostly in form of agricultural products), but then declined to below 20 million USD in 2019. Iranian exports to Afghanistan, mostly in form of petroleum products, steadily increased to over 2.8 billion USD in 2018. In 2021 after the US exit from Afghanistan, the Taliban announced that it would resume fuel imports from Iran. With its trading power and mineral wealth, Iran is seen as a major factor for Afghanistan's economic recovery.

Coccothrinax inaguensis, the thatch palm or Inagua silver palm, is a palm which is endemic to the Bahamas.
Henderson and colleagues also considered Coccothrinax victorini to be a possible conspecific. If that is the case, the name C. victorini should be applied to the combined species, since that name was the first to be published.

Helen M. Gougar (July 18, 1843 – June 6, 1907) was a lawyer, temperance and women's rights advocate, and newspaper journalist who resided in Lafayette, Indiana. Admitted to the Tippecanoe County, Indiana, bar in 1895 to present a "test" case, they were among the first women lawyers in the county. In 1897 they became one of the first women to argue a case before the Indiana Supreme Court. Gougar attained public notoriety for arguing a case on their own behalf for their right to vote in the 1894 elections. In addition to their advocacy work, Gougar became a public speaker and frequently campaigned to elect politicians who shared their views on women's suffrage and prohibition. They were the President for the Indiana Woman's Suffrage Association. An Indiana historical marker, dedicated in 2014, honors their efforts to secure voting rights for women.
Early life and education
Helen Mar Jackson was born on July 18, 1843, in Hillsdale County, Michigan, they were raised in Litchfield, Michigan, and educated at Hillsdale College. In 1860, they moved to Lafayette, Indiana, with their brothers and three uncles. They worked as a teacher in Lafayette's public school system and became a school principal in 1863.
Marriage and family
In 1863 Helen married John Gougar, a Lafayette attorney, and became their legal apprentice.
Career
Helen Gougar's career included work as a newspaper journalist, lawyer, and a temperance and women's suffrage advocate. In addition, they and their husband were active in Lafayette's civic and social affairs. They served on the committees of several local organizations, including the Young Men's Christian Association, Lafayette Home Association, Ladies Benevolent Society, and the Second Presbyterian Church, but their temperance and women's suffrage activities gained public attention in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
Newspaper journalist
In the 1870s and 1880s Gougar worked as a newspaper journalist. They wrote a weekly column called "Bric-a-Brac" for the Lafayette Courier that produced a series of essays expressing their own views and included the text of their speeches as well as the opinions of others on temperance and women's suffrage. Them unapologetic writing style became their trademark. In 1881 Gougar began editing Our Herald, a weekly newspaper that supported temperance and suffrage issues, and became its owner.
Lawyer and women's suffrage advocate
Gougar began their public life as a temperance advocate. They claimed to have joined the women's suffrage movement after concluding that attaining voting rights for women would be an effective way to resolve issues for victims of domestic violence.
Following their attendance at the annual convention of the National American Women Suffrage Association in 1881, Gougar returned to Indiana and began lobbying for passage of legislation allowing women to vote. They appeared before members of the Indiana General Assembly in February 1881 to urge them to support a bill allowing women to vote in national elections, but it failed to pass. A subsequent amendment to the Indiana constitution passed in the Indiana House of Representatives and the Indiana Senate in 1881, but it failed to pass during the 1883 legislative session, a requirement before it could become a state law.
Gougar also campaigned for state and national political candidates in an effort to elect politicians who supported passage of women's suffrage and temperance legislation. In the 1882 elections in Indiana they campaigned for Republicans who supported women's suffrage, but most of them were defeated by Democratic opponents. Gougar had more success in securing municipal voting rights for women elsewhere. In 1884 they traveled to Kansas to lead an effort to draft a municipal suffrage bill. Introduced in the Kansas legislature in 1885, it became a state law in 1887.
Frequently criticized for their strong views on women's suffrage, temperance, and prohibition, Gougar sought legal action to protect their reputation on more than one occasion. In 1882, after Gougar discovered that they had been implicated in a rumor of "sexual infidelity" with W. DeWitt Wallace, a Republican candidate for state representative, they filed a civil lawsuit against Lafayette sheriff Henry Mandler, who acknowledged they circulated the rumors, and charged them with slander. In Gougar v. Mandler (1883) the jury found in favor of Gougar and awarded them $5,000 in damages. The victory encouraged them to continue the fight for temperance and women's rights. In 1893 Gougar sued Massachusetts member of congress Elijah A. Morse for libel.
Gougar tested the state's voting laws when they attempted to vote in Tippecanoe County, Indiana, in the November 1894 elections. After the county elections board refused to allow them to vote, they sued the board. Gougar, who became one of the first women lawyers in Tippecanoe County, made their first appearance as an attorney in the Tippecanoe County Superior Court in January 1895 on the same day they were admitted to the Tippecanoe County bar, in order to argue a "test" case. The judge ruled in favor of the election board, but Gougar appealed the case, which went to the Indiana Supreme Court in Indianapolis.
On February 10, 1897, Gougar became one of the first women to argue a case before the Indiana Supreme Court. In Gougar v Timberlake (1897), they presented the case on their own behalf. Gougar argued that voting was natural right of men and women and the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution assured them the right regardless of the text in Indiana's constitution, which limited the franchise to males aged twenty-one and older. The Court, who considered voting a political right, denied the appeal, but Gougar's legal arguments were published in Indiana's newspapers, providing statewide exposure their views on the subject.
Later years
Gougar remained active in politics in their later life. The Prohibition Party nominated them for Indiana attorney general in 1896 and they campaigned for politicians who shared their views, including William Jennings Bryan. In addition they were a frequent public speaker and traveled extensively with their husband.
Death and legacy
Gougar died unexpectedly at their home in Lafayette on June 6, 1907. Known as an advocate for the women's suffrage movement in Indiana, their death occurred more than a decade before women achieved voting rights under the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Tributes and honors
A state historical marker in Tippecanoe County, Indiana, was dedicated in November 2014 in honor of Gougar's efforts to secure voting rights for women.

Louis Monziès (28 May 1849 – 13 March 1930) was a French painter and etcher. They were the curator of the three Museums of Le Mans for 10 years until their death.
Career
Louis Monziès began to learn painting and etching in Paris in 1871 from the painters Jean-Louis Ernest Meissonier and Isidore Pils, and from the etcher Léon Gaucherel. They got second-class and third-class medals in 1876, 1880 and 1881 at the annual Salon in Paris.
They married Eugénie Alphonsine Courtignon in 1882 at Cherbourg and three children were born : Jean in 1889, Pierre in 1891 and Jacques in 1895. They lived then in Paris but they owned also a small house in Normandy near Gréville-Hague.
Louis Monziès carried out etchings for illustrated books and for Art publications, among them, those after Meissonier and Henri Pille. They became a member of the Société des artistes français in 1884 and also a member of the Société des Peintres-Graveurs français in 1891. They were quite popular in Parisian art salons with the Hédouins and in the literary gathering of the editor Lemerre who published famous living writers and poets with Louis' etchings.
Louis Monziès visited London and was named to the Royal Society of Painters-Etchers in 1894 when they received orders for illustrations for English books and publications. Their etchings are included in major collections such as The British Library or the Museum of Fine Arts Boston.
But with photo-etching and other new publication processes, etchers were less and less able to make a good living from their skills. Louis Monziès move to Le Mans and became a painting teacher and a painting restoration specialist. They began to paint landscapes and urban environments in Normandy and in other towns like Venise or Avignon. They sold a lot of watercolors and oil paintings before the First World War. A few of these paintings were sent to the US by American officers housed by the painter at the end of the war.
They became the curator of the Museums of Le Mans in March 1920 and stayed so until their death in 1930.

Constant Ambroise Roux (20 April 1865, Marseille - 17 November 1942, Marseille) was a French sculptor.
Biography
Roux' parents ran a chemist shop and Roux started working at a young age for Achille Blanqui, who was a furniture maker. Roux helped with the wood carving involved.
Roux studied at the École supérieure des Beaux-Arts of Marseille, enrolling in 1879, and working under the tutelage of , and Théodore Jourdan, and was subsequently admitted to the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, studying under Jules Coutan, Jules Cavelier and Louis-Ernest Barrias. In 1894 they won the Prix de Rome for sculpture with the ronde-bosse ""Enflammé de colère, Achille revêtant après la mort de Patrocle, l'armure apportée par Thétis, sa mère" and winning this prestigious prize meant that they were able to study in Rome from 1895 to 1898 at the Villa Medici.
In 1898, Roux submitted the work "Pourquoi naître esclave" (Why be Born a Slave?) to the Salon des Artistes Français, sending it from Rome, and it was awarded a bronze medal. In 1900 they submitted the composition "L'amour au guet" (Love on the Lookout) to the Exposition Universelle, again winning the bronze. 1910 saw their work for the façade of the Institut de Paléontologie Humaine in Paris and for their work "Nicolas Poussin" submitted to the Salon in that year they were awarded a gold medal. After the war they were commissioned to work on various war memorials. They died in Marseille in 1942.
Where ever possible Roux supported art in their native city of Marseille participating for example with Émile Aldebert, André-Joseph Allar, François Carli, , Charles Delanglade, Jean-Baptiste Hugues, Marius Malan and the painter Pauline Mace, in supporting the Marseille Salon des Indépendants in 1913 and 1914. They also founded the Galerie Caors-Cottier in 1922 and participated in the Provence Exposition de l'Académie Régionale des Peintres et Sculpteurs held at the Galerie Détaille. Their work was part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1928 Summer Olympics. From 1931 they served regularly on the jury of the École des Beaux Arts of Marseille together with Charles Delanglade, Louis Botinelly, Paul Gondard, Marius Malan, José Silbert and David Dellepiane. Marseille showed their appreciation when they were elected to the Académie Marseille.
Main works
1. Institut de paléontologie Humaine frieze.Paris. A frieze comprising twenty bas-reliefs on the theme of "L'Homme primitif" were created by Roux for the façade of the Institut of human paleontology in Paris. Photographs of some of these remarkable bas-reliefs are shown below.
Images of Institut de paléontologie humaine frieze
2. The Salle des Quatre Colonnes in the Palais Bourbon now the Assemblée nationale. On a wall in this room, and facing Armand Martial's marble sculpture "La République", a marble plaque lists the names of the deputies who gave their lives for France in the 1914-1918 war. The plaque is decorated by Roux's carvings of a gallic cock, the hand of justice, a bundle of lances and a sword with garlands of oak leaves. Also, and on 8 June 1900, Roux was commissioned to create two decorative bas-relief panels for the refreshment room ("Buvette") of the National Assembly, and their compositions entitled "L'Automne" and "L'Hiver" were produced in grey ceramic by Sèvres. Roux submitted the bas-reliefs to the 1902 Salon and they were awarded a medal (2nd class) and in 1903 two further panels were ordered, these entitled "L'eau" and "Le Feu". A second copy of "L'eau" was made by Sèvres in 1904 and this can be seen in "La Piscine" in Roubaix, where an old public swimming bath has imaginatively been converted into an art gallery and museum. A photograph of this bas-relief is included in the gallery below.
3. "La République". Hôtel de préfecture des Bouches-du-Rhône. The statue in white marble by Roux entitled "la République" can be seen on the main staircase ("l'escalier d'honneur") of the Bouches-du-Rhône prefecture. It was inaugurated on 14 March 1904.
4. Statue Palais Princier on Le Rocher- "La science découvrant les merveilles de l'Océan"- This statue, standing outside the Palais Princier, was created in 1914 by Constant Roux in hommage to Prince Albert 1st of Monaco and to commemorate the 25th year of their reign.
5. 'The war memorial (monument aux morts) at Saint-Martin-de-Crau- Roux's sculpture of a dying French soldier defending the national flag stands on a pedestal. The monument is dedicated to those men killed in the 1914-1918 and 1939-1945 wars and all the victims of an explosion at a munitions depot in Beaussenq on 3 June 1918. 200 soldiers were killed in the explosion. Roux had exhibited the composition at the Salon des Artistes Français of 1920. It was destined for the commune of Trelly in la Manche and depicted a young soldier dying at the foot of a cross and pressing the national flag to their chest. This composition was used for Saint-Martin-de-Crau but without the cross. The same composition was used for the memorials in the Marseille's suburb of Saint-Loup and also for Nanton, Privas and Seillans.
6. Les convalescents rendant hommage à Louis Salvator -This statue by Roux depicts convalescing patients paying hommage to Louis Salvator and stands in the grounds of the Hôpital Salvator in Marseille. Roux won the competition to select the sculpture for the statue in 1908.
See photograph in the gallery below.
7. Jean Bouin. Roux's bronze study of the athlete Jean Bouin stands in the courtyard of the Marseille stade Vélodrome. A photograph of this work is included in the gallery below. Bouin was killed in action during World War I fighting near Saint-Mihiel. The casting was carried out by Gatti and inauguration took place on 5 June 1922. Roux also completed a bust of the athlete.
9. 'Masks of "Thétis, Mercure et Ceres. These can be seen at the top of the three entrances to the Caisse d'Épargne in Marseille, place Estrangin-Pastré? This is a much decorated building. Built in 1904 and designed by the architect Tournaire, the pediment was sculpted by Henri-Édouard Lombard and Auguste Carli created a bas-relief for the face of the building giving on to the cours Pierre Puget.
10. La France armée. A Roux bronze which stands on the top of the Monument des Mobiles des Bouches-du-Rhône in front of Église des Réformés in Marseille. This honours the reservists and members of the "garde mobile" who fought in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870.
At the base of the monument, Roux added four groups of soldiers.
11. Monument celebrating the American aid and friendship given to France 1914-1918. This monument in Chaumont is inscribed "A l'amitié et à l'aide Américaines La France Reconnaissante Hommage du département de la Haute-Marne et de la ville de Chaumont". Roux completed the sculptural work involved. A woman representing France holds the shoulder of a French soldier who is shaking the hand of an American soldier. The sculpture was inaugurated on 3 June 1923 in the presence of the French President, Mr. Millerand, the Chairman of the Council, Mr. Poincaré, the Justice Minister, Ambassadors from the Allied Nations, representatives of foreign press and numerous civilian and military dignitaries from the town and Haute-Marne.
12. Antoine Fortuné Marion. This bust by Roux, executed in 1903, is located on the esplanade of Marseille's Palais Longchamp.
13. Nicolas Poussin. Roux' 1911 statue of Nicolas Poussin can be seen in Les Andelys, Poussin's birthplace.

NGC 1191 is a lenticular galaxy approximately 406 million light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Eridanus. It was discovered by American astronomer Francis Leavenworth on December 2, 1885 with the 26" refractor at Leander McCormick Observatory.
Together with NGC 1189, NGC 1190, NGC 1192 and NGC 1199 it forms Hickson Compact Group 22 (HCG 22) galaxy group. Although they are considered members of this group, NGC 1191 and NGC 1192 are in fact background objects, since they are much further away compared to the other members of this group.

In enzymology, a styrene-oxide isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
styrene oxide phenylacetaldehyde
Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, styrene oxide, and one product, phenylacetaldehyde.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically a class of other intramolecular oxidoreductases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is styrene-oxide isomerase (epoxide-cleaving). This enzyme is also called SOI. This enzyme participates in styrene degradation, and is the second step of the pathway after the epoxidation of styrene by styrene monooxygenase.

Menlo Park Mall is a two-level super regional shopping mall, located on U.S. Route 1 and Parsonage Road in Edison, New Jersey. The mall has a gross leasable area of . Menlo Park Mall is currently owned and managed by Simon Property Group. Anchors are Macy's and Nordstrom. Other tenants include Barnes & Noble Booksellers and AMC Dine-In Menlo Park 12.
History
The Menlo Park Shopping Center opened in September 1959, as an open-air complex. It was developed and constructed by Abraham Sommer and Sigmund Sommer, developers from Iselin, New Jersey. It was named after the Menlo Park area of Edison, also the site of Thomas Edison's former laboratory location. The structure was fully enclosed between June 1966 and December 1967. After the remodeling, it was renamed Menlo Park Mall.
The original center was anchored by Bamberger's, Montgomery Ward (opened May 1960), a small, dry goods only, JCPenney, a two-level Woolworth, as well as two grocery stores: ShopRite (later a Pathmark), and Pantry Pride, later a Big Buy.
Originally a one-level structure, the fully enclosed mall (post-1967) had a lack of skylights, with only shaded windows along the sides of the ceiling. The low lighting made the interior quite dark, as was customary with interiors of malls at the time. The mall had unique flooring with patterns of orange, black, yellow and white throughout the mall.
The Montgomery Ward space was taken over by Alexander's in 1972. JCPenney moved to Woodbridge Center in 1981. Bamberger's was rebranded by Macy's in October 1986. When Alexander's went out of business in 1992, the mall was able to secure the second Nordstrom in the state of New Jersey, but changes had to be made to prepare for the opening.
Most of the mall was closed from 1990 to 1991, when it underwent a significant renovation and expansion that converted it from a single-story structure into its current two-story form. In expanding and fitting into the space, the new Menlo Park Mall was built on an angle with the vertex occurring at center court. The renovated Menlo Park Mall was also changed to have galleria style skylights, domed fountain courts, marble flooring, dramatic lighting, sculptures and a large, skylit food court featuring trees and sculptures, designed to look like a "formal garden." The new mall was designed by architecture firm RTKL Associates Inc. of Dallas Texas. Two parking decks were also added, as was a 12 Screen Cineplex Odeon movie theater which replaced the smaller Menlo Park Cinema on Route 1. Cineplex was later replaced by an AMC Dine-In Theater. Macy's was the only store to remain open during the primary expansion. Nordstrom officially opened to the public at Menlo Park Mall on September 27, 1991.
On March 9, 1997, Target Greatland opened across the street from the mall. Rainforest Cafe opened on September 17, 1998.
On January 27, 2003, The Cheesecake Factory opened its doors for the first time.
In 2014, Smashburger opened along with an upgrade to the food court.
In 2015, a renovation project was started which removed such features as the central fountain and trees. The food court's raised platform, sculptures, and trees were also removed, and the food court was renamed "Dining Pavilion."
On September 22, 2018, a Disney Junior themed kids zone opened by Nordstrom.
On June 24, 2020, GNC announced that it closed its location at Menlo Park Mall.

Eldad Ben-Chetrit (born December 29, 1949) is a professor of Medicine, former Head of the Department of Medicine and former director of the Rheumatology unit (2009-2017) at the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center in Jerusalem.
They were a visiting professor at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (1996), at the Biochemistry Department, Stanford University (2004), and at the Gaslini Children Hospital (Istituto Giannina Gaslini), University of Genoa, Italy, and the Tropical Medicine Clinic, University of Heidelberg, Germany (2016).
Education
Ben-Chetrit was born on December 29, 1949, in Jerusalem, Israel.  They are a graduate of the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical School in Jerusalem. They completed a specialty and was certified by the Board in Internal Medicine in 1984. Following Internal Medicine, Ben-Chetrit was trained in Rheumatology and Immunology at the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation (Scripps Research) in La Jolla, California (1986–88). In 1991, they were Board certified in Rheumatology in Israel.
Research and career
Ben-Chetrit did their residency in internal medicine at the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical School and served there in many roles, up to Head of the Department.
In earlier years, their main research interests included: Pathophysiology of Autoimmune diseases, i.e. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren's syndrome (SS) and immune-related Congenital heart block. Ben-Chetrit detected a new antigen (52 KD) component of the SSA/Ro (J Exp Med 1988) and cloned the gene encoding the 60 KD component of this antigen (J Clin Invest 1989). In collaboration with colleagues from the Department of Rheumatology at the New York University Medical Center, Ben-Chetrit investigated the relationship between the carriage of anti SSA-Ro /SSB-La antibodies in the mother and the risk for congenital heart block in the fetus or in newborns (J Clin Invest 1989).
Currently, Ben-Chetrit's main research interests are the genetics, pathophysiology and therapeutic response of Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and Behçet's disease (BD) and other autoinflammatory diseases. They have studied extensively the mechanism of action of Colchicine and its pharmacokinetics. During their work as a member of the French FMF consortium, they participated in identifying the gene associated with FMF (Nat Genet 1997). They also participated in the NIH study which discovered the association of a SNP in the gene encoding IL-10 with Behcet's disease (Nat Genet 2010). Recently, they have been a member of the steering committee of the large trial of Canakinumab (anti IL-1 ab) for its efficacy in the treatment of several autoinflammatory diseases (NEJM 2018) and headed a committee for renaming and revising the definition of autoinflammatory diseases (Ann Rheum Dis 2018).

Walter Huppenkothen (31 December 1907 in Haan, Rhineland – 5 April 1978 in Lübeck) was a German lawyer, Sicherheitsdienst (SD) leader, and Schutzstaffel (SS) prosecutor in the Hauptamt SS-Gericht.
Huppenkothen attended school in Opladen and studied Law and Political Science at the University of Cologne and University of Düsseldorf and then qualified as a lawyer. On 1 May 1933, they joined the Nazi Party and the Allgemeine SS. Unable to find employment in government service they joined the SD (the intelligence service of the SS) in Düsseldorf. They also served for a brief time as head of State Police and as an SD Chief in the East Prussian-town of Tilsit (now Sovetsk, Russia), and was replaced in both positions by fellow Gestapo member Dr. Heinz Gräfe in October and November of 1937.
World War II
Role in the Holocaust
Following the German invasion of Poland, Huppenkothen was involved in the Holocaust in various areas of occupied Poland (part of the Nazi-controlled General Government). They worked as a liaison with the SD's Einsatzgruppen during their time as part of the Gestapo, as well as an SD Chief in Kraków and as head of the Gestapo in Lublin in February 1940 . In July 1941, they were appointed to the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) in Berlin with the rank of Sturmbannführer (Major) in charge of a Gestapo unit dealing with political enemies of the Reich as the successor to Walter Schellenberg.
Prosecutions
As an SS Standartenführer (Colonel) they were appointed the prosecutor of the SS and police court in Munich. On 6 April 1945, they prosecuted Hans von Dohnanyi in Sachsenhausen concentration camp while the defendant lay semi-conscious on a stretcher having contracted a serious infection and the proceedings ended with them being condemned to death by Sturmbannführer Otto Thorbeck. On 8 April 1945, under orders from Ernst Kaltenbrunner, they were the prosecutor at a drumhead court-martial presided over by Otto Thorbeck without witnesses, records of proceedings or a defence in Flossenbürg concentration camp. Among the condemned were Lutheran clergyman Dietrich Bonhoeffer, General Hans Oster, Army Chief Judge Dr. Karl Sack, Captain Ludwig Gehre and former head of the Abwehr Admiral Wilhelm Canaris. The prisoners were accused of making an assassination attempt by bombing on Adolf Hitler at their headquarters of Wolf's Lair, which killed four and wounded Hitler himself. The court's prosecution employed torture methods such as thumb screwing and mechanical stretching devices on the accused, who were subsequently sentenced to death after a brief trial and executed by hanging on 9 April 1945, only around two weeks before the camp's liberation. Otto Thorbeck later testified that the conspiracy trials lasted three hours under Huppenkothen's direction and that they shouted the accusation at them, then permitted a brief answer period before the death sentence was imposed. A commemorative plaque for the prisoners executed, as well as a statue of Bonhoeffer, exists at the former site of the camp, now a memorial site.
Post-War
Collaboration with US Military
Huppenkothen was captured at Gmunden on 26 April 1945. After the war, Huppenkothen was interned by the Americans and worked for the Counterintelligence Corps of the US Army until 1949. The Army's counterintelligence division took a particular interest in Huppenkothen's knowledge of Communism and their work as a Gestapo official in searching for members of the Communist resistance and espionage group, the Red Orchestra.
Trials and Testimonies
From 1949-1956, Walter Huppenkothen was tried multiple times for torture and murder in their 8 April 1945 prosecution. For the charge(s) of murder, Huppenkothen was acquitted, but they were still sentenced to prison-time on charges of torture (sources conflict on the exact length of the sentence, but it is believed to have ranged somewhere between 3.5-7 years), although the acquittal of their murder charge(s) has continued to arouse criticism in modern times. Huppenkothen also testified at the May 1961 trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem, Israel, though their family reported that they were reluctant to do so.

The Piute Mountains are a mountain range located in the Eastern Mojave Desert and within Mojave Trails National Monument, in San Bernardino County, California.
Geography
The range crosses Interstate 40 at Mountain Springs Summit, 2,770 feet above sea level. The mountains are located northeast of the Old Woman Mountains, southwest of the Piute Range, and east of the Fenner Valley, which includes the small communities of Essex, Goffs, and Fenner. The Mojave National Preserve is to the northwest, and the Bigelow Cholla Garden Wilderness and Sacramento Mountains are to the east.
The Piute Mountains exhibit strong color contrast and texture that vary from very angular, jagged volcanics to rounded, smooth granite hills; and the ridges are cut by numerous canyons and washes.
Wilderness
The Piute Mountains Wilderness is in the Piute Mountains and the surrounding bajadas and extensive alluvial fans, below US Route 66. The wilderness is within Mojave Trails National Monument and managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).
Dominant vegetation is creosote bush scrub, which gradually changes into a mixed desert scrub at higher elevations. The large bajadas provide excellent habitat for the threatened desert tortoise. The entire wilderness area has been identified as critical habitat for the desert tortoise.

The 2016 Irish general election took place on Friday 26 February to elect 158 Teachtaí Dála (TDs) across 40 constituencies to Dáil Éireann, the lower house of the Oireachtas, Ireland's parliament. The 31st Dáil was dissolved by President Michael D. Higgins on 3 February, at the request of Taoiseach Enda Kenny. There was a reduction of eight seats under the Electoral (Amendment) (Dáil Constituencies) Act 2013.
Following the election, Kenny's Fine Gael with 50 of the 158 seats available remained the largest party in the Dáil despite having lost 26 seats. The main opposition party Fianna Fáil, which had suffered its worst-ever election result of 20 seats in 2011, increased its seats to 44. Sinn Féin was expected to make gains, encouraged by opinion polls placing it ahead of Fianna Fáil, and it became the third-most numerous party with 23 deputies. The Labour Party, which had been the junior party in coalition government with Fine Gael and which had returned its best-ever showing of 37 seats in 2011, fell to just seven deputies, its lowest-ever share of Dáil seats. Smaller parties and independent politicians made up the remaining 34 seats.
The 32nd Dáil met on 10 March and elected a new Ceann Comhairle, the first to be elected by secret ballot, which was won by Seán Ó Fearghaíl of Fianna Fáil. The Dáil proceeded to the nomination of Taoiseach, but no candidate received a majority. Kenny formally resigned as Taoiseach that same day, but remained in office as a caretaker until a new government was formed. Kenny sought an agreement with Fianna Fáil to form a government, and negotiations continued through most of April. An agreement was finally reached for a Fine Gael-led minority government on 29 April, 63 days after the election, and the Dáil formally re-elected Kenny as Taoiseach on 6 May. Kenny is the first Taoiseach from Fine Gael to win re-election.
Following the introduction of gender quotas, a record 35 seats were filled by women, bringing the proportion of women in the Dáil to 22 percent, up from 15 percent after the previous general election.
Background
The outgoing government was a Fine Gael–Labour Party coalition led by Taoiseach Enda Kenny and Tánaiste Joan Burton. Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin, Anti-Austerity Alliance–People Before Profit, Renua Ireland, Social Democrats, Workers and Unemployed Action, and independent non-party TDs formed the opposition in the Dáil. The government was formed on 9 March 2011, the first day of the 31st Dáil elected on 25 February 2011.
Whereas the Constitution gives the Taoiseach authority to dissolve the Dáil, under electoral law the precise date of polling is specified by the Minister for the Environment, who was Alan Kelly of Labour. Electoral law required the 31st Dáil to be dissolved by 9 March 2016. Kenny rejected predictions in October 2015 that they would call an election in November to capitalise on rising Fine Gael support. In January 2016, media reported that Fine Gael and Labour respectively favoured Thursday 25 and Friday 26 February 2016 as the election date; Friday would facilitate voting by students registered to vote at their family home.
After a cabinet meeting on 2 February, Kenny announced that they would be seeking a dissolution the following day. At 09:30 on 3 February they formally told the Dáil this, and that the new Dáil would meet on 10 March; the Dáil was adjourned without statements from the opposition. At 09:58 while Kenny was en route to Áras an Uachtaráin to meet the President, the election date of 26 February was confirmed from their Twitter account. At 10:35 the President issued the proclamation dissolving the Dáil. Later that day, Minister Kelly signed the order setting the polling day. The writs of election are issued by the clerk of the Dáil.
New parties and alliances
A number of parties and political alliances were formed during the lifespan of the 31st Dáil in order to contest the election:
On 14 March 2014, the Independents for Equality Movement was registered as a political party by non-party TDs in advance of the 2014 local elections. Founded by Wexford TD Mick Wallace, it was renamed Independents 4 Change in October 2015. By the time the 31st Dáil was dissolved it counted among its members Wallace, Joan Collins, Clare Daly and Tommy Broughan, but all remained listed on the Dáil register as independent members of the house. All four members as well as one other councillor entered the election as Independents 4 Change candidates.
On 13 March 2015, Renua Ireland was founded by TDs and a Senator who had been expelled from the Fine Gael parliamentary party in 2013 for voting against the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill on anti-abortion grounds. Lucinda Creighton led this party into the election.
On 30 March 2015, the Independent Alliance was formed by non-party TDs and founded by Shane Ross and Michael Fitzmaurice. It was not a political party, and stated that it would not impose a whip except where the group had agreed to support a government on confidence motions.
On 15 July 2015, the Social Democrats were founded by Róisín Shortall, elected to the 31st Dáil as a Labour Party TD; Catherine Murphy, who was also a member of the Labour Party until 2003 but was elected to the 31st Dáil as an independent non-party TD, and Stephen Donnelly who was elected to the 31st Dáil as an independent non-party TD. All three entered the election as co-leaders of the Social Democrats.
In August 2015, Right2Change was launched as a broad political campaigning platform based on the Right2Water campaign that had been ongoing since 2014 against the introduction of water charges in Ireland. Right2Change produced a document of policy principles for "a progressive Irish government" and promoted a vote transfer pact, to which several bodies subscribed in advance of the 2016 election, including Sinn Féin, the People Before Profit Alliance, Workers and Unemployed Action, Direct Democracy Ireland, the Communist Party of Ireland; the individual TDs Joan Collins, Clare Daly, Thomas Pringle, Tommy Broughan and Mick Wallace; and the trade unions Unite the Union, the Communication Workers Union, and Mandate.
On 6 October 2015, the Anti-Austerity Alliance–People Before Profit were founded as a registered party, to serve as an electoral alliance of the Anti-Austerity Alliance and the People Before Profit Alliance. They had contested the 2011 general election as separate parties, as the Socialist Party and the People Before Profit Alliance respectively, under the joint platform of the United Left Alliance (which had included the Workers and Unemployed Action Group and left wing independent politicians).
Gender quotas
Part 6 of the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012 provides that parties will lose half of their state funding unless at least 30% of their candidates at the election are female and at least 30% are male. All parties except Direct Democracy Ireland fulfilled this condition. This contributed in part to the highest percentage of women elected to the Dáil; at 35 TDs, this was 22% of the 158 TDs, an increase from 15% at the previous general election.
Electoral system
Ireland uses proportional representation with a single transferable vote (PR–STV). The general election took place throughout the state to elect 158 members of Dáil Éireann, a reduction of 8 from the previous 166 members. This follows the passage of the Electoral (Amendment) (Dáil Constituencies) Act 2013. The Ceann Comhairle (speaker of the lower house of parliament) is automatically re-elected unless they opt to retire from the Dáil. The election was held in 40 parliamentary constituencies. Each multi-member constituency elects three, four or five Teachtaí Dála (Dáil deputies, lit. Assembly Deputies).
The closing date for nominations was 11 February 2016. A total of 551 candidates contested the election, slightly down from the 566 that took part in the 2011 general election, a record figure. The number of candidates for each party was: Fine Gael (88), Fianna Fáil (71), Sinn Féin (50), Green Party (40), Labour Party (36), Anti-Austerity Alliance–People Before Profit (31, of which 18 People Before Profit Alliance and 13 Anti-Austerity Alliance), Renua Ireland (26), Direct Democracy Ireland (19), Social Democrats (14), Independents 4 Change (5), Workers' Party (5), Catholic Democrats (3), Fís Nua (2), Irish Democratic Party (1), Communist Party of Ireland (1). Among the 159 independent candidates and others running without a party platform were 21 independents affiliated to the Independent Alliance, 19 independents affiliated to Right2Change, and the outgoing TD Séamus Healy, who was nominated as a non-party candidate for this election. Voting took place between 07:00 and 22:00 (WET).
Islands off the coast of Donegal, Mayo, and Galway voted one day earlier. All resident Irish and British citizens were eligible to be on the Dáil electoral register. The 2016–17 register was published on 1 February by the local authorities, who were responsible for maintaining it. Applications for the supplementary register for the general election closed on 9 February, with 30,185 names added.
Retiring incumbents
The following members of the 31st Dáil announced in advance of the poll that they would not be seeking re-election:
Campaign
The campaign officially began after the dissolution of Dáil Éireann on 3 February 2016 and lasted until polling day on 26 February 2016. During the campaign, official election posters are permitted in locations which would otherwise constitute litter; some candidates were reported to have illegally erected posters too soon. The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's moratorium on election coverage lasted from 14:00 on 25 February 2016 until polls had closed.
Party manifestos and slogans
Television debates
RTÉ set a minimum of three TDs for a party to be invited to its 15 February debate. The Green Party, which had no TDs (having lost them all in 2011), took an unsuccessful High Court case against the exclusion of its leader Eamon Ryan. An Irish language debate, moderated by Eimear Ní Chonaola was to be broadcast on TG4 on 17 February, but was cancelled due to the weak proficiency in that language of Adams and Burton. Aodhán Ó Ríordáin (Labour) and Pearse Doherty (Sinn Féin) were suggested as fluent replacements, but Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael insisted that a leaders' debate should be confined to party leaders only. TG4 instead broadcast successive one-to-one interviews with each party's representative. There was also a "live audience discussion" on RTÉ Two on 21 February featuring Timmy Dooley (FF), Mary Lou McDonald (SF), Aodhán Ó Ríordáin (Labour), Averil Power (non-party), Eamon Ryan (Greens), Leo Varadkar (FG), and Adrienne Wallace (AAA-PBP). The discussion was hosted by Keelin Shanley at Facebook's Dublin office and featured questions submitted via Facebook and Twitter. There was some controversy surrounding this debate as a representative of special needs parents said they were to appear to ask a question on waiting lists only to be told by RTÉ later that the topic would not be covered.
Opinion polls
Results
Counting of votes began at 09:00 UTC on Saturday 27 February 2016 and continued over the course of the weekend and into the following week, with the final two seats, in Longford–Westmeath, announced after multiple recounts at 05:30 UTC on Thursday 3 March.
It was Fine Gael's lowest number of seats since the 2002 general election, the election that led to Kenny becoming leader (the outgoing finance minister in 2016, Michael Noonan, had been Fine Gael's leader in 2002.) They performed especially poorly outside Dublin, dropping from 59 seats to 36; in Dublin the party fared better, going from 17 to 14 for a net loss of only three. Indeed, Fine Gael became the largest party in the capital for the first time since November 1982, and won seats in every constituency in Dublin for the first time since 1987. Fianna Fáil more than doubled the number of seats that they had coming into the election. Having been without representation in Dublin since the death of Brian Lenihan in 2011, Fianna Fáil managed to win six seats in the capital this time. Sinn Féin recorded their strongest showing under Adams to become the third party, making gains in Leinster and in urban areas of Munster, mostly at the expense of the Labour Party. Labour won their lowest vote share since 1987, and their lowest share of seats ever. Despite speculation that they would lose their seat, Joan Burton became the first sitting Tánaiste to avoid defeat at a general election since Mary Harney in 2002. Labour's vote collapse meant that not until the Longford–Westmeath result did they reach the seven-seat threshold to qualify as a parliamentary group with full speaking rights under current Dáil rules.
The combined vote of 49.8 per cent for Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil was a record low for the two largest parties in the Dáil, eclipsing the previous record of 53.6 per cent set by Cumann na nGaedheal and Fianna Fáil in June 1927. It was the first time the vote for Ireland's two traditionally dominant parties had fallen below 50 per cent in a general election. Fine Gael became the largest party in the Dáil with just 25.5 per cent of the vote, the lowest percentage ever for a first party.

TDs who lost their seats
Government formation
Enda Kenny immediately conceded that the outgoing coalition government of Fine Gael and Labour would be unable to continue. Fine Gael was 29 seats short of a majority, leading to speculation of a possibility of a grand coalition between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, of a minority government, or of another general election later in 2016. Talks to form a government got underway in March.
On 29 April, after 63 days of negotiation and three failed votes for Taoiseach, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil reached an agreement about a Fine Gael minority government. In the days following, Fine Gael negotiated a deal with Independent TDs on the formation of a minority coalition. Enda Kenny was re-elected Taoiseach on 6 May 2016.

Sigurd Håkonsson (died 962) (Old Norse: Sigurðr Hákonarson) was a Norwegian nobleman and Jarl of Lade in Trøndelag.
Sigurd Håkonsson Ladejarl was the son of Håkon Grjotgardsson, the first Jarl of Lade (Old Norse Hlaðir). In 900, Håkon came into conflict with Atle Mjove over Sogn and fought a battle at Fjaler (Old Norse: Fjalir), in which Håkon was killed. Upon reaching maturity, Sigurd inherited their father's position. Sigurd Håkonsson was married to Bergljot Toresdatter, daughter of Tore Teiande Ragnvaldsson (Thorir Rögnvaldarson) and Ålov Årbot Haraldsdatter. In 892, Tore Ragnvaldsson became Jarl of Møre after the death of their father, Ragnvald Eysteinsson.
During the reign of King Haakon I of Norway, Sigurd had an influential position as the king's friend and adviser. They sought in particular to mediate between the king and the people during the king's attempt to introduce Christianity. After the death of Haakon at the Battle of Fitjar (Slaget ved Fitjar på Stord) in 961, Harald Greycloak, the son of Eirik Bloodaxe and their brothers became kings of Norway.
In autumn 962, Sigurd Håkonsson and their warriors were burnt to death by Harald Greycloak, while staying the night at Aglo, in modern-day Skatval in the municipality of Stjørdal. Sigurd was killed as part of Harald's effort to reunite all of Norway under their rule. In 970, their killing was later avenged by Sigurd's son, Haakon Sigurdsson, who had become an ally of King Harold Bluetooth.
Sigurd had Kormákr Ögmundarson as a court poet. Fragments of Kormákr's lay on Sigurd Håkonsson, Sigurðardrápa, are preserved in Skáldskaparmál and in Heimskringla.

After moving to New York City, they went on to work with Sean Combs. Together they wrote and produced tracks for Jennifer Lopez. Following the release of Lopez's album, Bell became known as a songwriter and producer, working with several artists, including Britney Spears, Girls Aloud, Mary J. Blige and Paulina Rubio.
Biography
Michelle Bell was born in Ohio. They said that while they were in college, "I became a junior reporter with a local paper writing about people who grew big tomatoes or had a church band. It was pretty boring stuff but I used the letterhead from the paper to write to publicists at record labels. The entertainment editor wasn't interested in the concerts and stories. I was so I was able to attend many great shows and interview my favorite artists. I met tons of people through the paper so when I moved to NY from Ohio it was easier to get jobs." Bell stated that they were always inclined to work on the music business, commenting that "being ambitious, savvy and slightly obnoxious is how I think you make it as an anything in the entertainment business." They first worked with Sean Combs, who was dating pop singer Jennifer Lopez at the time. After Bell's song was presented to Lopez, the latter recorded the track. Bell said that they "shared a lot," with Lopez and that, "it was fun, we wrote a funny song about something that happened with their assistant. It started from a beat that went terribly wrong. Not for the album but just for fun." Bell then went to work with several artists such as Mary J. Blige and Paulina Rubio over the years.
In 2002, the producer started to work with Britney Spears on their fourth studio album, In the Zone. Together they wrote and recorded several tracks, including "Chaotic", "Like I'm Falling", "Look Who's Talking Now", and "Money, Love, & Happiness". "Britney Spears was awesome. They actually surprised me because they can play the piano. She's down to earth and very nice. They hide it but I think people can tell she's a real artist. I hope someday they get to bring that side of themselves out more. We had a nice time working," commented Bell about the songwriting and recording process with Spears. "(I've Just Begun) Having My Fun", another track recorded by Spears and later released on Greatest Hits: My Prerogative (2004), was featured on the soundtrack of the 2011 film Bridesmaids. Bell later worked with producer Peter Wade Keusch. Together, they formed a music production duo, and worked for artists such as 88-Keys and Lindsay Lohan. They worked together on an album called The Mystery LLP. It was slated for a release on the second quarter of 2008; the album, however, is yet to be released. Bell currently lives in New York City.
Reception
Bell's songs were mostly well received by contemporary critics. One of their tracks they wrote with Britney Spears, "I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)", was considered by Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic as better "[than] most of the songs that were featured on [In the Zone]," while Mike McGuirk of Rhapsody said the song "is on a level with their best work, namely 'I'm a Slave 4 U'." Bell's tracks included on Jennifer Lopez's album Brave (2007) received mixed to positive reviews, with "I Need Love" being considered as a "nice enough uptempo groove. Still, it's not something you'll be rushing to hear a second time — a sentiment that summarizes most of 'Brave'." "Morning After Dark", a track co-wrote with Timbaland, was considered as "catchy" by reviewers, with its hook receiving positive appreciation. However, Jennifer Lopez's "Come Over" did not impress critics, with Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly saying, "'Come to my room for a little game.… I'll do very erotic things', they breathe on 'Come Over', [...] the most embarrassing satin sheet anthem since, oh, Sylvia's 'Pillow Talk'." The song received comparisons to earlier works of Janet Jackson.

U.S. Route 16 (US 16) is an east–west United States Highway between Rapid City, South Dakota and Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. The highway's eastern terminus is at a junction with Interstate 90/U.S. Route 14 (I-90/US 14), concurrent with I-190, in Rapid City, South Dakota. The western terminus is the east entrance to Yellowstone National Park, concurrent with US 14 and US 20. U.S. 16 used to extend all the way to Michigan, but has been truncated in favor of Interstates 90 and 96.
Route description
Wyoming
US 16 begins at the east entrance to Yellowstone National Park, along with US 14 and the eastern segment of US 20. From the park, the three highways run concurrently to Cody and Greybull. In Greybull, US 14 splits off to the east, while US 16/US 20 head due south to Basin and Worland. In Worland, US 16 splits off from US 20, and heads east over the Powder River Pass on its way to the city of Buffalo. After passing Buffalo, US 16 arches north to the community of Ucross, meeting US 14 again, before arching back south to Gillette. US 16 then runs east concurrently with I-90 between Gillette and Moorcroft before heading southeast to the towns of Upton and Newcastle. The highway then heads east to the South Dakota state line. For most of the way through the state, the highway is a two-lane road.
South Dakota
US 16 is also known as Mount Rushmore Road in western South Dakota. From the state line, the highway travels near Jewel Cave, the third-longest cave in the world. The highway goes through the city of Custer and shares alignment with US 385. East of Hill City, US 16 splits off US 385. It then becomes a four-lane divided highway, with the two roadways separated by up to a half-mile (0.8 km) in some places, including the old gold-mining town of Rockerville, South Dakota, which is contained entirely between the two roadways. In Rapid City, a truck bypass runs along Catron Boulevard and Elk Vale Road up to Exit 61 on I-90.
The South Dakota section of US 16 is defined at South Dakota Codified Laws § 31-4-138.
History
US 16 originally connected Detroit with Yellowstone, including a ferry link across Lake Michigan between Muskegon, Michigan, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In Michigan, the route was in use long before automobiles and was known to white settlers as the Grand River Road, and prior to the designation of US Routes in 1926, had been designated as M-16 in the 1920s from Detroit to south of Muskegon. In 1938, reflectorized discs were placed on US-16 every from Detroit to Lansing, resulting in fewer nighttime traffic accidents. Other states would later do the same on their roads.
US 16 initially crossed the South Dakota – Wyoming state line west of Spearfish. U.S. Route 216 was commissioned in 1930 as a loop off US 16 to the south between Rapid City and Moorcroft, crossing the state line west of Custer. In 1934, US 16 was moved to the US 216 alignment, while the former US 16 became part of an extension of US 14.
In Michigan, most of US 16 was superseded by I-96 and a segment of Grand River Avenue in Detroit ultimately became M-5. US 16 was later decommissioned in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and eastern South Dakota to its present termini.
Between Rapid City and Dexter, Minnesota, it has been supplanted by I-90. In Faribault County, Minnesota the highway took on another number as there was already a county highway 16. Residents of the county continued referring to the road as "16" or "old 16" and eventually the county renumbered it as Faribault County 16. From the county's western border with Martin County, 16 continues East through the city of Blue Earth as part of 1st Street and Leland Parkway until it briefly combines with US-169/Grove Street. One half mile south of that point at the intersection of Grove and 7th Streets, County 16 follows 7th Street and continues East to the border of Freeborn County. Most of the stretch through Faribault County is a relatively narrow 2 lane highway with wide gravel shoulders that has been widened at least two times since US-16 was decommissioned. East of Dexter it is now Minnesota State Highway 16 and Wisconsin Highway 16. In South Dakota it was replaced by various state highways (including SD 38 and 248) and county roads: generally, in West River the old alignment was transferred to county responsibility entirely, while in East River it remained a state-maintained highway.
An older Alternate US 16 in South Dakota has become South Dakota Highway 240.
In South Dakota, in 2009, the South Dakota Department of Transportation designated US-16/US-385 between Custer and Hill City, which passes by the Crazy Horse Memorial, now being carved in the Black Hills, the Crazy Horse Memorial Highway. This segment of US-385 is also a part of the George Hearst Memorial Highway.

[[File:Paranthropus aethiopicus.JPG|thumb|250px|Paranthropus aethiopicus sagittal crest on top of the head]]
A sagittal crest''' is a ridge of bone running lengthwise along the midline of the top of the skull (at the sagittal suture) of many mammalian and reptilian skulls, among others. The presence of this ridge of bone indicates that there are exceptionally strong jaw muscles. The sagittal crest serves primarily for attachment of the temporalis muscle, which is one of the main chewing muscles. Development of the sagittal crest is thought to be connected to the development of this muscle. A sagittal crest usually develops during the juvenile stage of an animal in conjunction with the growth of the temporalis muscle, as a result of convergence and gradual heightening of the temporal lines.
Function
A sagittal crest tends to be present on the skulls of adult animals that rely on powerful biting and clenching of their teeth, usually as a part of their hunting strategy. Skulls of some dinosaur species, including tyrannosaurs, possessed well developed sagittal crests. Among mammals, dogs, cats, lions, and many other carnivores have sagittal crests, as do some leaf eaters, including tapirs and some apes.
Apes and hominins
Sagittal crests are found in robust great apes, and some early hominins (Paranthropus). Prominent sagittal crests are found among male gorillas and orangutans, but only rarely occur in male chimpanzees such as Bili apes.
The largest sagittal crest ever discovered in the human lineage belongs to the "Black Skull", Paranthropus aethiopicus field number KNM WT 17000, the earliest known robust hominid ancestor and the oldest robust australopithecine discovered to date. The prominence of the crest appears to have been an adaptation for the P. aethiopicus' heavy chewing, and the Black Skull's cheek teeth are correspondingly large. Smaller sagittal crests are also present on the skulls of other Paranthropines, including Paranthropus boisei and Paranthropus robustus.
The shrinking of the sagittal crest in human ancestors was widely attributed to a growing brain and shrinking teeth. However, it was discovered in 2004 by a group of researchers led by Dr. Hansell Stedman, that a frameshift mutation shrank the individual muscle fibers of the temporalis muscle, which attached to the sagittal crest. This was believed to have allowed brain size to increase, since the crest was no longer strictly necessary, but a later paper from 2017, led by researchers from George Washington University, found that the increase in brain size and reduction of tooth size were not linked, as originally hypothesized.

Sean Forrester Scott (May 20, 1969 – February 9, 2009) was a self-educated disease activist and researcher, filmmaker, innovator, entrepreneur and until the time of their death, the president of the ALS Therapy Development Institute, the world's largest amyotrophic lateral sclerosis research center. Scott themselves was diagnosed with ALS in 2008 at the age of 38.
Activism
Scott became active with ALS TDI when their mother, Vanna, was diagnosed with ALS in 2001. Four more of Vanna's seven siblings succumbed to the familial form of the disease by 2007, and eventually Sean Scott too died of complications from ALS in 2009.
In 2008, Scott was lead author of a landmark publication in the journal, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis that described guidelines for experimental design of studies evaluating therapeutics in the mouse model. The work identified crucial errors present in many existing preclinical ALS studies. Scott's effort to establish standard model guidelines for preclinical development in ALS was featured in Nature in August 2008.
In 2006, Scott's effort to fund the ongoing research led them to Augie Nieto and Sharon Hesterlee. The ambitious $36 million partnership brokered between ALS TDI, Augie's Quest and the Muscular Dystrophy Association, a partnership that survived Scott, allowed for major expansion of the Institute's efforts to include the identification of genes that behave unusually in ALS and to determine how those differences affect the disease.
Personal life
Scott was married in 2008 to longtime companion Nancy Kelly, who was also involved in ALS activism. Scott lived in San Francisco, California with their wife until their death, and is also survived by their father Richard Scott and uncle, Edward W. Scott.
Scott earned an undergraduate degree in rhetoric from the University of California, Berkeley.

The Toronto Food Policy Council (TFPC) is a citizen body of food activists and experts responsible for generating food policy for the City of Toronto government.
Formed in 1991, the 30-member TFPC supports scores of programs with the shared goal of ensuring equitable access to food, nutrition, community development and environmental health, acting as professional lobbyist for the people on food and related issues.
The TFPC is free to make its own decisions on food policy issues. Staff working with the TFPC are employed by, and responsible to, The Toronto Department of Public Health. This arrangement has gained interest from public health, community, food security and sustainable agriculture organizations around the world. The TFPC is under the leadership of Lauren Baker. Previous TFPC staff include Rod MacRae, Wayne Roberts and Yusuf Alam. In April, 2009, the TFPC received the Bob Hunter Environmental Achievement Award, given to a City of Toronto agency with a record of outstanding leadership, for its efforts to make food an action item on the environmental agenda. The TFPC also won an honorary mention for a major award from the Community Food Security Coalition for its work promoting food sovereignty in October, 2009.
Working to ensure all significant decisions and expenditures are viewed through a “food lens,” the Council, under the leadership of Co-chair Janice Etter, succeeded in having food issues highlighted in the city of Toronto's official plan, adopted by city council in 2002 and updated in 2007.
Some of the Council's work has included:
Helping community organisations obtain $3.5 million for projects increasing access to affordable nourishing food in the early 1990s.
Successfully lobbying the federal government to refuse to license Bovine Growth Hormone, a biotechnology product, for use in Canadian dairy operations.
Working with the Student Nutrition Coalition to expand school food programs in Toronto from 53 to 350.
Founding the Rooftop Garden Resource Group to research and promote a green roof industry in Canada.
Producing a ground-breaking series of discussion papers on a food systems approach to public health policy, and giving hundreds of presentations to university classes, and environmental and community groups.
Championing the Toronto Food Charter, a declaration of citizen rights and government responsibilities that sets the food security standard for municipalities.
Publishing two email services on food system issues, one dealing with local food and one with global.

Vela 2A, also known as Vela 3, Vela Hotel 3 and OPS 3662, was a U.S. military satellite developed to detect nuclear detonations to monitor compliance with the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty by the Soviet Union. The secondary task of the ship was space research (X-rays, gamma rays, neutrons, magnetic field and charged particles).
Launch
Vela 2A was released on July 17, 1964 from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, through an Atlas-Agena launch vehicle. Vela 2A was launched along with Vela 2B and with ERS 13.
Capabilities
Vela 2A was rotationally stabilized (2 rotations per sec.). The ship could work in real time mode (one data frame per second) or in data recording mode (one frame every 256 seconds). The first mode was used for the first 40% of the mission's duration. The second one was used until the next pair of Vela satellites were launched.

Chingunjavi (, ; also known as Admiral Chingün, , 1710–1757) was the Khalkha prince ruler of the Khotogoids and one of the two major leaders of the 1756-57 rebellion in Outer Mongolia. Although their rebellion failed, they are nowadays often hailed as a fighter for Outer Mongolia's independence from the Manchu-led Qing dynasty of China.
Early life and career
Chingünjav was born in 1710 at the shore of lake Sangiin Dalai nuur, in the Khotgoid's Erdenedüüregch vangiin khoshuu of Zasagt Khan aimag, or today's Bürentogtokh sum of Khövsgöl aimag. Their father Bandi was the khoshuu's Zasag Noyon. In 1738, Chingünjav succeeded their father. Chingünjav made a career in the Manchu military and eventually reached the rank of an assistant general of Zasagt Khan aimag.
Conspiracy with Amursana
During the 1755 Manchu campaign against the Dzungar Khanate, Chingünjav and Amursana conspired to start a rebellion in autumn of the same year. However, their seniors discovered their plans and separated them. Chingünjav was sent to fight in Uriankhai, and Amursana was summoned to Beijing for demanding too big a share of the Dzungar Khanate. On the way, their escort let them escape. This led to the trial and execution of the commander of the escort, a brother of the Jebtsundamba Khutugtu and direct descendant of Chingis Khan, in early 1756, an event that gravely disturbed the Khalkha nobility.
Rebellion
In the summer of 1756, Chingunjav began their rebellion by leaving their post, gathering troops in their home area, and sending a letter to the Qianlong Emperor. However, although there was widespread unrest throughout Khalkha, support from other nobles and even from the 2nd Jebtsundamba Khutughtu was not forthcoming, and Chingünjav never managed to command more than 1,000-2,000 troops. By the time the Manchu were able to reinforce their loyal Outer Mongolian troops with detachments from Inner Mongolia, Chingünjav had achieved little more than spending time by waiting for an answer for their appeals to the nobility and the Jebtsundamba, and consequently was not able to face the Manchu in an open battle. They retreated northward towards the Darkhad area, with their force continuously shrinking through desertions. When they were captured at a place now known as Wang Tolgoi, about from Khankh, in January 1757, all but fifty of their men had left him.
Aftermath
Chingünjav, together with almost their whole family, was brought to Beijing and executed. The Manchu, although not as brutal as they had been towards the Dzungars, sent punitive units to Mongolia to deal on the spot with all those rebels they could find. Nobles that were suspected of having sympathized with Chingünjav were also executed. The Jebtsundamba Khutugtu "died" in 1758, the Tüsheet Khan shortly afterwards. The Qianlong Emperor declared that all future incarnations of the Jebtsundamba Khutugtu were to be found in Tibet to undermine local autonomy. On the other hand, the Mongolian debts to Chinese trading firms were partially annulled, and the rest being paid for by the emperor, in order to tackle the economic sources of the unrest in Khalkha.
Legacy
Although never having had a realistic chance to succeed, Chingünjav passed into the realm of folklore. A small monument has been raised at remains of a fort attributed to him, some kilometres south of Bürentogtokh, in 1978. A statue of them was erected in Mörön in 1992 and another one in 2010. In 2012, Mongolian Bronze Foundry created a monument in their honor in Ulaanbaatar, inscribed, "May our government and our children live prosperous and eternal".

See You Tomorrow is the twelfth studio album by American alternative band The Innocence Mission, released on January 17, 2020 by Bella Union in Europe and Australia, and by Thérèse Records in the United States and Canada.
Recording and composition
See You Tomorrow was recorded in the Peris' home, namely their basement and dining room. Lead vocalist and composer Karen wrote and sings on ten of the album's eleven songs, and plays the majority of instruments, while their husband Don sings lead on the song they composed, "Mary Margaret in Mid-Air". Bassist Mike Bitts performs upright bass on four tracks.
Stereogum said themes of "Love, connection, community and understanding" are "at the core of the album, one that is steeped in awe and wonder, intense longing, sadness and joy; a rich sequence of songs that attempt to describe the essence of what makes us human." Folk Radio UK said it sees the band thematically evolve from their preceding album, 2018's Sun on the Square, by "touching on the major changes that happen in the life of a family", with Karen elaborating: "Great love of course contains great anxiety, for the safety and health of the loved ones, for one's own ability to be a good enough helper and companion, for the future. And the intense desire to hold the present moment of togetherness, at the very least to store it up in vivid detail, so that it can be not lost at all." They said the lyrics of opening track "The Brothers Williams Said" were inspired by the "sense of misunderstanding that can happen to people who have a quiet nature." They conceded: "I struggle with being able to find words in conversation, so I'm always grateful to have the opportunity to have a conversation with people in songs." Stereogum described "On Your Side" as a "lovely and understated track about how those who have passed on still live beside us", quoting the lyric "In my dream, I would be in Paris with my mom. In cafes they would sip coffee, they would be smiling on/ She'd say, 'I have never let you out of my sight. I have not gone.'"
The lyrics of "St. Francis and the Future" were inspired by a Jan van Eyck painting. Karen explained: "A few years ago, during a visit to a museum with my children, I saw their painting Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata. The song 'St. Francis and the Future' was inspired by my memory of discovering this painting because during our visit, a tour guide had us look at a multitude of details using a large magnifying glass they had with him. In the background of the painting, there is this little town that most people wouldn't even notice, because they would be too busy looking at the foreground. On closer inspection, you end up perceiving birds and animals, but also the life of a small town. This painting not only tells us about this mystical image but also evokes a whole disappeared world. As often, one thought provoked another, and this day in the museum I began to imagine my children after we are gone, to imagine them looking at photos of our family and dwelling on the details of the backgrounds that were ultimately the reality of our lives. This was a strange moment in the museum: me discovering the imaginary life of a village from the past thinking about the future of my children. This method of Van Eyck to focus on little details speaks to me a lot, because I believe the more we talk about the small moments in life, the more meaningful they become for others."
"John as Well" was the first song written for the record. Karen said that its lyrics relate to "wanting to really know other people and to be truly known by another person, and the limitations of language, especially when it comes to conversation. I think it represents the whole album. The questions about connections to other people and the possibilities of communication and internal lives."
Release and promotion
The album was released on January 17, 2020, by Bella Union in Europe. "On Your Side", "This Boat", "The Brothers William Said" and "St. Francis and the Future" were all issued on streaming platforms prior to the release of the album. A music video for "On Your Side", created by Karen, was also released on YouTube.
Critical reception
The album received generally positive reviews upon release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, it received an average score of 78 out of 100, indicating "generally favorable reviews". NPR listed it as the second best album released that week, highlighting "The Brothers William Said" as its best song. Stereogum dubbed it their album of the week, saying: "Warmth seeps in from every corner; little background sounds make it clear that the Perises are inviting you into their home and their slow-moving world. [The album is] breathtakingly intimate and delicate. But The Innocence Mission are also exacting musicians and producers, and nothing else about See You Tomorrow suggest it was made at home. Every instrument is crisp and precise. ... Every sound lends the music a reverence, a hush that lets Karen's voice rise to the front". Timothy Monger of AllMusic described the album as "ethereal", saying that although the album "does little to deviate" from the band's established sound, they said that "it's hard to find too much fault in that. The group's signature sound is a home-built concept, gently refined over their three decades together, and their steady cultivation of it is their gift to the world." They said the album "offers a bit more experimentation than some of their recent releases", while highlighting the quality of songwriting and production, summarizing: "It's these little details and the quality of the writing that help push the boundaries of what otherwise sounds like a quintessential Innocence Mission album."
Writing in The Philadelphia Inquirer, Steve Klinge described the album as "lovely, understated" and praised Karen's lyrics as being "full of natural elements—sun, stars, clouds, trees, fields—and they continually return to sharp observations that seek to capture and retain moments." They also highlighted their voice and Don's guitar work, saying: "Her voice is wistful and introspective, with a soft edge that still recalls Harriet Wheeler. Them husband's fingerpicked acoustic guitar anchors tracks like the airy bossa nova 'On Your Side' and the ebb-and-flow of 'St. Francis and the Future'. That crystalline clarity allows the songs that feature more layered arrangements, such as the gorgeous closer 'I Would Be There', to blossom". They summarized by describing See You Tomorrow as "an album about, and full of, care, restraint, and love." Loud and Quiet called the record an "introspection of people and how life's daunting uncertainty impacts the love and anxiety attached to those we cherish. It's a reflection of chronology, echoing where and what we've come from whilst simultaneously gazing at the winding road lying ominously ahead." They summarized by describing it as "a body of work that envisions grandiose proportion, sonically embodying the complexity of what makes us unique and innately human." The Skinny characterized the album as "slightly more piano-heavy furrow than before", describing it "music made for people who are not quick to dismiss something if it sounds downbeat." Despite this, they called the album "majestic, transcendant , entrancing, transfixing. You're lifted out of yourself as if visited by angels. Other times, such as on album opener 'The Brothers Williams Said', you want to give them a hug, tell them it will be okay, ask them if they need a nice cup of tea. It's serious, is what we're saying; not music for people who want a quick two-second fix of wonderfulness. You have to live with this. Admire its prettiness from afar. Let it work its magic on you."
Brooklyn Vegan included the album at number 16 on their list of the best albums of 2020.

Vespula flaviceps is a species of social wasp in the genus Vespula. It found in Eastern Asia and Japan. Studies have suggested that the queens of this species may mate with more males and use sperm more evenly. The reason for this is not yet well understood.
Taxonomy
Synonyms
V. flaviceps has been described by various other binomial names. A list of such names is presented below:
Vespula gracilia
Vespa saussurei
Vespa quadrimaculata
Vespula pionganensis
Vespa japonica
Vespa karenkona
Vespa lewisii
Vespa flavior
Subspecies
V. flaviceps has two subspecies. They are V. f. flaviceps and V. f. lewisii.
Distribution and habitat
V. flaviceps is native to Eastern Asia and Japan. It can be found most prominently on the Japanese Islands, but is also present in South Korea and the southern portion of Primorsky Krai. Its population may be threatened by invasive raccoons, which prey upon it during the summer and autumn.
V. flaviceps is found in forests. During a two-year study in Japan, the species was observed to be one of the predominant species in the natural deciduous forests of northern Kanto. In 2001, it was officially recorded as one of the predominant species in this area, making up, along with two other species, 91% of all social wasps caught in a forest sampled. However, the same species was found to be much less abundant than Vespa species when attracted using a different bait.
As food
V. flaviceps is popular as food in Central Japan. All of its stages are consumed, but the larvae are considered a special delicacy. Small colonies may be collected and relocated into artificial hives near dwellings for the purpose of harvesting them for food. These colonies are sometimes even sheltered over the winter by humans, which benefits not only the humans but the wasps as well. This protection from the cold greatly helps their chances of survival.
In some regions of Japan, V. flaviceps is eaten in a dish with rice. In the Chubu area (including Nagano, Gifu and Aichi), a dish in which the larvae are prepared in rice is considered a delicacy. This dish is eaten during special events, especially the autumn festivals. V. flaviceps may be prepared cooked, fried, or pickled. Larvae and pupae are often taken from nests and seasoned with soy sauce, sugar, and artificial seasonings. Recently, collection of this species from inside Japan for food has decreased, and importation from Korea has increased.

Hans Pothorst ( 1440 – 1490) was a privateer, likely from the German city Hildesheim.
Historians Sofus Larsen (da) and Thomas P. Hughes have proposed that they may have landed in North America, along with Didrik Pining, in the 1470s, almost twenty years before Columbus' voyages of discovery.
Biography
In what little is known about Pothorst, they are often linked with Didrik Pining. Like Pining, Pothorst was likely from Hildesheim. Pothorst's service on the Hamburg warship Bastian, seems to have been officially terminated on 1 July 1473. Sometime in the 1470s, Pining, Pothorst and Corte-Real were sent by King Christian I of Denmark on a naval expedition to the North-Atlantic. During the later years of the reign of Christian I, Pothorst and Pining are said to have distinguished themselves "not less than capable seamen than as matchless freebooters."
Pothorst's home in Denmark is presumed to have been Helsingør, where their coat of arms and a simple portrait were painted (possibly shortly after their death) among eight ceiling frescoes in the local St. Mary's Church. The ceiling ensemble remains one of the most celebrated 15th century Danish artworks, and if Pothorst funded its creation as it has been assumed, historians note that they must have been rather wealthy.
Later, they are mentioned as a privateer, and in the Skibby Chronicle Pothorst and Pining are mentioned among many pirates who "met with a miserable death, being either slain by their friends or hanged on the gallows or drowned in the waves of the sea."

Flow (stylized as flOw) is an independent video game created by Jenova Chen and Nicholas Clark. Originally released as a free Flash game in 2006 to accompany Chen's master's thesis, it was reworked into a 2007 PlayStation 3 game by their development studio, Thatgamecompany, with assistance from Santa Monica Studio. SuperVillain Studios developed a PlayStation Portable version of the game in 2008, and PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita versions in 2013. In Flow, the player navigates a series of two-dimensional (2D) planes with an aquatic microorganism that evolves by consuming other microorganisms. The game's design is based on Chen's research into dynamic difficulty adjustment at the University of Southern California's Interactive Media Division, and on psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's theoretical concept of mental immersion or flow.
The Flash version of Flow received 100,000 downloads within its first two weeks of release, and had been played over 3.5 million times by 2008. Its PlayStation 3 re-release was the most downloaded game on the PlayStation Network in 2007 and won the Best Downloadable Game award at the 2008 Game Developers Choice Awards. It was nominated for awards by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA). Reviewers praised Flows visual and audio appeal, but noted the simplicity of its gameplay; several considered it to be more of an art piece than a game.
Gameplay
In Flow, the player guides a small, multi-segmented worm- or snake-like creature through an aquatic environment. There are no menus or guidelines; the game begins immediately. The game world, which is viewed from a top-down perspective, consists of two-dimensional planes stacked vertically upon each other. A blurred version of the layer below appears in the background of each plane. Planes contain organisms of varying sizes; the player's creature automatically attempts to consume them when they are nearby. The majority of these creatures are non-confrontational and are composed of cells that increase the number of segments in the player's creature when eaten. All planes, except for the highest and lowest, contain two specially colored organisms that move the player's creature up or down one plane when touched.
Certain planes feature aggressive, multi-segmented creatures that perish when all their segments are eaten by the player's creature; however, they can eat segments of the player's creature to regrow their own. These creatures release many cells upon death, which can restore the health of the player's creature, temporarily increase the size of its mouth, or cause it to sprout decorative protrusions. Players are not required to eat these or any other organisms; they may travel to higher or lower planes at any time. Being defeated by aggressive creatures does not result in death, but causes the player's creature to float to a higher plane. In the Flash version, the player can replay the game with a jellyfish-like organism by defeating an aggressive creature on the bottom plane. If the player reaches the bottom again, the creature there is their original worm-like creature, and defeating it starts the game over as that organism.
PlayStation versions
The PlayStation 3 version of Flow features enhanced visuals and three additional playable organisms: one that can move with a short burst of speed, one that can paralyze other creatures, and one that lunges toward its prey's weak point. The worm creature from the original game was given the ability to move faster, while the jellyfish may now create a vortex to attract small creatures. These special moves are activated by hitting any button on the controller. When the player reaches the bottom plane with each creature, the next creature type is unlocked and becomes selectable at the beginning of the game. The PlayStation 3 version features a multiplayer mode for up to four players; a game in progress can be joined at any time, players may play different creatures if they desire so. The PlayStation Portable version contains all the features introduced by the PlayStation 3 version, but reduces the size of each plane. On November 20, 2007, the PlayStation 3 version received an add-on pack that allows players joining a multiplayer game to select their creatures. The pack also includes new enemies, food types, and a playable creature with a shield ability.
Development
Flow was originally developed as part of Jenova Chen's master's thesis for the Interactive Media Program at the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts. Their thesis was on the concept of dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA), wherein a game adjusts its reactions to a player based on the past and present actions of that player. They illustrated their ideas with Flow, which they created in collaboration with Nicholas Clark. Chen implemented DDA by causing the player to change the game's difficulty subconsciously; they allowed players to dive between planes at will and provided the option of eating or not eating any creature. Players may decide to rush downwards or to grow stronger before attacking powerful opponents. Chen described Flow as "a simple game. It's the simplest test of active DDA." Another influence on the game was psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's work on flow, wherein a person fully immerses themselves in an activity and gains a feeling of energized focus. To achieve this state, the person or player must have control over the activity; Chen believed that their DDA theory gave players the control necessary to achieve flow while playing.
The game was released in March 2006, after two months of development—during which Chen and Clark taught themselves Flash programming. The game's source code was later released in 2009. The game's score was composed by Austin Wintory. A PlayStation 3 version was announced for the PlayStation Store in May of that year, and was released in February 2007. Chen had graduated by that point, and had founded Thatgamecompany, which handled the conversion to the PlayStation 3; Nicholas Clark was one of the employees and served as the game version's designer. Impressed by Flow, Sony provided Thatgamecompany with finances, supplies, and additional staff, and offered them a three-game contract; the PlayStation 3 version of Flow was the first of these. Chen originally believed the conversion could be completed in four months and that it would be ready for the November 2006 launch of the PlayStation Network. However, when it was finally released in February 2007, it did not include "half of the original design".
A version for the PlayStation Portable, developed by SuperVillain Studios, was released in March 2008. The company coded it from scratch, as the PlayStation 3 version's code and art were too platform-specific to reuse. The add-on pack for the PlayStation 3 version was also developed by SuperVillain. Thatgamecompany was not involved in the development of either project beyond a design influence and art direction role, as they were creating their next title, Flower. SuperVillain Studios later created ports of the PlayStation 3 version for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, which were published in November 2013 to correspond with the release of the PlayStation 4. Although no album of music specifically for Flow has been released, in 2012 Austin Wintory released Journey Bonus Bundle as a download-only album on Bandcamp, containing variations on themes from Flow and Journey, a 2012 PlayStation 3 game by Thatgamecompany.
Reception
The Flash version of Flow received 100,000 downloads within its first two weeks of release. By July 2006, it had been downloaded over 650,000 times; by February 2008, it had been played over 3.5 million times. Its PlayStation 3 re-release was the most downloaded game on the PlayStation Network in 2007. Flow received the 2008 Game Developers Choice Awards nominations for the Innovation Award and Best Debut, and was presented with Best Downloadable Game. The game was nominated for the Best Downloadable Game of the Year award at the 2008 Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences Interactive Achievement Awards, and for the Best Innovation award at the 2007 British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) awards. Its music garnered nominations for Best Interactive Score and Most Innovative Use of Audio from the Game Audio Network Guild, and won composer Austin Wintory the Rookie of the Year award. Flow was a finalist at the 2007 Slamdance Guerrilla Games Competition, but withdrew along with several other finalists after Super Columbine Massacre RPG! was removed from the competition. In 2011 it was chosen through a public vote out of an initial selection of 240 to be one of 80 games showcased in a 2012 exhibit at the Smithsonian American Art Museum titled "The Art of Video Games". The game was also included in the 2010 video game reference book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die.
Flow received mixed reviews from critics, who focused on the game's PlayStation versions. The visuals and presentation were among its most praised elements, with IGN's Chris Roper calling them "one of Flows the greatest strengths". Alex Navarro of GameSpot agreed, saying that it was "hard to argue with those aesthetics"; they lauded the use of color, the designs of the creatures, and the dynamic soundtrack. Will Freeman of VideoGamer.com called it "attractive and stylish", which made the game "immensely satisfying to toy with". Richard Leadbetter of Eurogamer claimed that the game's main purpose was to "look pretty" and "sound cool".
Reviewers were mixed in their opinions on the gameplay; Roper said that "simply see[ing] what's next" was enjoyable, but acknowledged that the game's activities were limited beyond this aspect. Leadbetter went further, saying Flow "feels like a tech demo in many ways", and that its small amount of gameplay existed primarily "to act as a tour guide" through the visuals and audio. Freeman said that "it would not be unfair to describe Flow as empty and without substance." Navarro concluded that Flow was enjoyable for the few hours needed to complete it, but it lacked "a lasting gameplay experience"; they attributed this to the game's "heavy emphasis on aesthetics over gameplay". Luke Mitchell of PALGN, however, felt that "anything more complicated would take away from the friendly nature of an experience of this type."
Reviewers found the game to be largely unchallenging. Roper stated that "there really isn't any sort of challenge here", particularly due to the player character's inability to die; Leadbetter summed up the game's difficulty as "negligible". However, when reviewing the PlayStation Portable version of the game, Justin Calvart of GameSpot took the view that "the game's difficulty masterfully scales to match your skill level", so it does not become overly "frantic or frustrating". Reviewers were universally dismissive of the multiplayer mode, with Calvart saying that "whatever it is, it's not good". Leadbetter called the PlayStation 3 version's multiplayer "little more than an afterthought", while Navarro said it "doesn't add a lick of depth to the experience".
Overall, reviewers saw Flow as being more akin to an art piece than a game. Navarro called it an "arty piece of gaming", and complimentarily said that it had the "vibe of an art-school project". Leadbetter believed that it was more of an experiment than a traditional game, and described it as a "trippy ornament". Freeman called it the PlayStation 3's "first art-house title". Roper summarized Flow as "not so much a game as it is an experience", and Mitchell claimed that it "tries to do something entirely unique and experimental, and on that level, it succeeds".

Dongchuan Road () is a station on Line 5 of the Shanghai Metro. It serves as an interchange station between the main and branch lines of Line 5, with the opening of the southern extension of Line 5.
The Minhang Campus of Shanghai Jiao Tong University and the Minhang campus of East China Normal University are five minutes' walk away (there used to be a shuttle bus available for students and staff Monday-Friday during daylight hours, but this has stopped with the opening of a public bus line which serves an equivalent route), which makes this station popular with students at the university.

Trundling is the practice of rolling large rocks or boulders down hillsides. It is discouraged in many areas, for reasons of safety and environmental impact.
Its practice can be traced back to rock climbers in the 18th century in North America.
More specifically, "Boulder Trundling may be defined as the propulsion of fragments of the Earth's crust down mountain slopes of suitable inclination sooner than would occur from the interaction of natural forces."

Särkänniemi (; translates to "Cape of Sandbank") is an amusement park in Tampere, Finland, located in the district by the same name. The park features an aquarium, a planetarium, a children's zoo, an art museum and an observation tower Näsinneula (Näsi Needle). Särkänniemi is the second most popular amusement park in Finland with Linnanmäki in Helsinki being the most popular one. Särkänniemi has five rollercoasters: the inverted coaster Tornado, the flying coaster Trombi, the family motorcycle launch coaster MotoGee and Hype, a launched steel Skyrocket II coaster, and family coaster Vauhtimato ("Speedy Worm"). The half-pipe coaster called Half Pipe was recently removed due to multiple reasons. Särkänniemi is owned by the city of Tampere and attracts about 1,100,000 visitors annually.
Särkänniemi is the biggest rival for Linnanmäki as the lead amusement park in Finland. Both are about the same size.
The park gave up the dolphinarium in 2016 and the dolphins were safely transported to Attica Zoological Park in Greece. The park has more than 30 rides and attractions. There are also two water rides in the park, a log flume called Tukkijoki and a river rapids called Koskiseikkailu. Särkänniemi has been voted several times as the best leisure center and the greatest amusement park in Finland.
In the future, a hotel and spa with restaurants and water experiences are planned around the amusement park, as well as new apartments. It will also be possible to travel to the area by tram in the future as part of the Tampere light rail network.
History
This multi-purpose park is owned by the city of Tampere and boasts a variety of rides as well as both Aquarium and Planetarium was opened in 1969, a children's zoo that opened in 1970, a 168m tall Observation Tower that opened in 1971, The Sara Hilden Art Museum opened in 1979, and the Dolphinarium opened in 1985.
The amusement park aspect of Särkänniemi started in 1973 with the opening of Neulan Huvipuisto (Neula Amusement Park); in the beginning the park offered only a handful of children's rides. In 1975 the city of Tampere took over the operations of the fun park and integrated it into other attractions on the peninsula.
Located on the peninsula, about a kilometre from the city centre of Tampere, that juts out into the Black Gulf. The area used to house three different breweries in the 18th century onward and in the 20th century a huge warehouse serving the log industry was built on the peninsula of Särkänniemi. These buildings were demolished in the 1960s.
The park is easily accessible by bus lines 4 and 16.
The 25-acre amusement park is not divided into specifically themed sections although one area is called Kiddie Land and in 2012 an Angry Birds Land was opened.

The Sarstoon Temash Institute for Indigenous Management (SATIIM) is a nonprofit non-governmental organization which represents people in a group of five villages that live outside of Sarstoon-Temash National Park in Belize. They co-manage the park with the Forest Department of Belize and contest outside interference in the park.
Organization
Founding
The Sarstoon-Temash National Park was founded in the Toledo District in 1994. Local residents had not been consulted about the creation of a national park in their region, and in 1997, residents around the park began to hear about it through the media for the first time. Residents had a cross-ethnic meeting of the five separate communities that lived around the border of the new park, where much expressed anger with the creation of a national park in places and were afraid that the national park might be used to infringe on their indigenous land claims. Ultimately, an agreement was reached with the creation of SATIIM in 1997 to manage the park and its surrounding areas on behalf of the communities around it.
The Conservation Division of the Ministry of Natural Resources is in charge of overseeing all the protected regions in Belize, totaling over 38% of the country's land area, with a staff of 3 people as of 2000, and actively seeks local partnerships to help management responsibilities. In 2003, the government of Belize signed an agreement with SATIIM to allow them to co-manage the park with the Forest Department. SATIIM's assistance in managing the forest has helped the membership of SATIIM to understand land boundaries of the region more clearly and to be better able to claim indigenous land rights.
Challenges
In 2005, the Belize government announced that it was permitting a Guatemalan-based oil company to conduct seismic tests in the national park. SATIIM challenged Belize's decision in court successfully based on a technicality. SATIIM also successfully defended the right of the indigenous population to use the park's land in 2007 in a Supreme Court case, which allows the Maya to use the land based on their long term occupation and not a deed that the government would have had to provide them.
US Capital Energy tests
SATIIM has protested the expansion of seismic tests for oil and other resources by US Capital Energy in Sarstoon-Temash National Park since 2009. SATIIM criticized the Forest Ministry for stonewalling the organization in negotiating a renewal of US Capital Energy's contract to conduct seismic tests in the park. In an interview with Channel 5 Belize, SATIIM's director Gregory Ch'oc alleged that US Capital Energy's seismic tests had led to the start of a forest fire inside of the park, and have criticized US Capital for allowing illegal loggers to enter into the park's territory. In response to a letter writing campaign against the seismic tests that SATIIM spearheaded, Prime Minister Dean Barrow noted, "Clearly this is an organized effort on the part of SATIIM and more power to them but I can tell them that that effort will have absolutely no impact on the government."

The 1994 UK & Ireland Greyhound Racing Year was the 68th year of greyhound racing in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
Roll of honour
Summary
The National Greyhound Racing Club (NGRC) released the annual returns, with totalisator turnover at £87,885,471 and attendances recorded at 3,911,447 from 6393 meetings.
Westmead Chick trained by Nick Savva was voted Greyhound of the Year after winning the Oaks, Arc, Brighton Belle, Olympic and the Midland Flat. Joyful Tidings was voted Irish Greyhound of the Year after winning the 1994 Irish Greyhound Derby. Tony Meek won a second successive English Greyhound Derby following the victory of Moral Standards.
John McGee won the Greyhound Trainer of the Year for the seventh successive year. McGee was then involved in a major controversy after losing their licence following a positive urine test for a greyhound called Rabatino in the Peterborough Derby final. The NGRC heard the evidence and ruled that they should be suspended for the offence which led to an court battle. A high court judge overturned the NGRC suspension just weeks before they claimed their seventh crown but the NGRC in turn would then fight that ruling imposing the sanction. McGee returned to Ireland to train and would not be seen in NGRC racing again for four years.

Cremastobombycia solidaginis is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. It is known from Ontario and Quebec in Canada, and Florida, Texas, Georgia, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Michigan in the United States.
The wingspan is 7–9 mm.
The larvae feed on Baccharis pilularis and Solidago species, including Solidago altissima, Solidago bicolor, Solidago caesia, Solidago canadensis, Solidago fistulosa, Solidago gigantea, Solidago patula and Solidago rugosa. They mine the leaves of their host plant by digging an elongated, wrinkled "mine" on the underside of the leaf. Pupation takes place within a dense white cocoon, marked with longitudinal ridges. It is suspended hammock-like within the mine, by a single silken thread at the anterior end and by two diverging threads at the posterior end. When the imago emerges the pupa case is thrust through the upper epidermis.

The Truth About Charlie is a 2002 mystery film. It is a remake of Charade (1963) and an homage to François Truffaut's Shoot the Piano Player (1960) complete with the French film star Charles Aznavour, making two appearances singing their song "Quand tu m'aimes" (first in French, later in English). The film was produced, directed and co-written by Jonathan Demme, and stars Mark Wahlberg and Thandiwe Newton in the roles played by Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn in Charade.
This version closely mirrors the plotline of the original film. It is once again set in Paris and features several famous French actors. Director Agnès Varda made a cameo appearance. Actress/chanteuse Anna Karina sings a Serge Gainsbourg song in one scene. Peter Stone, screenwriter of Charade, receives a story credit as Peter Joshua, one of the aliases Grant's character uses in the first film. Stone disliked the remake and refused to be credited under their real name. The name of Wahlberg's character in the remake is Joshua Peters. The film was poorly received by critics and was a flop at the box office, earning only $7 million worldwide.
Plot
British newlywed Regina Lambert lives in Paris with their husband Charlie. They return home following a short vacation, determined to divorce Charlie, only to discover their apartment has been stripped bare and that their husband has been murdered. Regina is soon reunited with a mysterious stranger they met on their holiday. They help them piece together the truth about the deceased Charlie and deal with three menacing people who are now following them

Jakub Haberfeld (original spelling: Jakób Haberfeld or Jakob Haberfeld) – one of the oldest Polish alcohol factiories, founded in 1804 in Oświęcim producing vodka and liqueurs. The company was reactivated in June 2019.
History
The Haberfeld family settled in Oświęcim in the second half of the XVIIIth century. Jakub, son of Simon and Jacheta, founded in 1804 the Factory of Vodka and Liqueurs. After their death, the business was inherited by their son, also Jakub (1839–1904). In 1906 Emil Haberfeld became the new owner. The Haberfelds were a progressive Jewish family who were involved in social life; many served on the town council and participated in charity initiatives.
At the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, the factory poured beer for the Jan Götz brewery in Okocim. From around 1906 until the end of the interwar period, it partnered with the Żywiec Brewery. At the beginning of the 20th century, the factory expanded and obtained new buildings, including spaces in the Oświęcim castle bought by the family from the city, chiefly warehouses.
In August 1939, Alfons Haberfeld and their wife Felicja participated in the 1939 New York World's Fair, presenting their products at the Polish pavilion. On the way back, at the outbreak of World War II, the ship was stopped and directed to Scotland, preventing them from returning to German-occupied Poland. During the war, their children Franciszka Henryka. Alfons and Felicja returned to the USA. In 1952, along with other Holocaust survivors, they founded an organization in Los Angeles called Club 1939. They both died in Los Angeles, Alfons in 1970, and Felicja in 2010.
After the end of hostilities in 1945, the house and factory buildings were taken over by the State Treasury. In the years 1945–1947 the factory was called "Jakub Haberfeld's Factory under state administration", and after 1947 it had been called “Oświęcimskie Zakłady Przemysłu Terenowego", " Non-alcoholic Beverage Factory and Beer Bottling Plant in Oświęcim ". After 1989, the bottling plants were declared bankrupt, and the remaining factory property was plundered. In 1992, a bricked-up cellar was discovered containing several thousand bottles ready for production.
By decision of September 25, 1995. the factory complex and the Haberfeld family house was entered in the register of monuments of the Bielsko Province. By 2003, the factory buildings and the Haberfeld family home, displaced and not renovated, fell into ruin. In 2003, it was decided to demolish the tenement house and the factory.
Production
The drinks were made on the basis of natural juices. They were produced and stored in the cellars of the "Monopol" restaurant, which was located in the family house next to the factory premises. The drinks were poured into characteristic, brand and porcelain glass bottles, made to order. For the orangeade and soda water bottles, porcelain stoppers were used. All products of the factory had original labels, which were produced, among others, in Bielsko and in Opava. The factory produced several dozen types of vodkas and liqueurs in several hundred varieties. The specialties of the factory were "Magister", "Basztówka" and "Zgoda".
During World War I, the factory produced vodka for the Austrian army, which was part of the soldier's equipment. This drink was called "Kaizerschutze" (Imperial Gunner). The factory also had a warehouse and sales of products in Kęty, run by Mr. Hoffmann, and a warehouse in Krakow. Haberfeld also had many salespersons who advertised their products. For example, in Silesia it was Franciszek Kehl
According to the industry questionnaire submitted by the owners in 1934, the factory was called "Vodka and liqueur factory and fruit juice press", it was a general partnership. The average wage of a manual worker was 750 zloties, and office worker - 2000 zloty.
The factory, apart from selling products locally, also exported them to Italy, Austria, Germany and Hungary. Haberfeld also exhibited their products at various foreign exhibitions, where they were awarded with diplomas and medals.
During the German occupation, the factory was taken over by the occupant, and a German named Handelmann became a receivership (so-called treuhänder). The Germans then used the following labels: "Haberfeld unter Verwaltung Treuhändler", and production during this period was continued on a smaller scale. All the factory property and the family house remained intact and survived the period of the Nazi occupation.
Vodka Museum
On June 30, 2019, on the premises of the former Jacob Haberfeld Vodka and Liqueur Factory, the Vodka Museum was opened, commemorating the achievements of this family from Oświęcim, their contribution to the development of the liquor industry both in the region and in the country. The museum shows the history of a family that not only became famous in the world as a significant brand of vodkas and liqueurs, but also outstanding figures for the city. Few people know that Alfons Haberfeld was the only Oświęcim shareholder of the first Polish car factory "Oświęcim-Praga", which was used by such celebrities as Jan Kiepura or Wojciech Kossak. The Jakob Haberfeld brand was also resumed with the introduction of six kosher vodkas and liqueurs, which are made in cooperation with the production plant of the Nissenbaum Family Foundation in Bielsko-Biała.
The exhibition is also a story about the fate of one of the two most influential Jewish families in Oświęcim. The fate was dramatically interrupted by the outbreak of World War II and the murder of 5-year-old Franciszka Henryka Haberfeld in the death camp in Bełżec.

The longest uncrossed (or nonintersecting) knight's path is a mathematical problem involving a knight on the standard 8×8 chessboard or, more generally, on a square n×n board. The problem is to find the longest path the knight can take on the given board, such that the path does not intersect itself. A further distinction can be made between a closed path, which ends on the same field as where it begins, and an open path, which ends on a different field from where it begins.
Known solutions
The longest open paths on an n×n board are known only for n ≤ 9. Their lengths for n = 1, 2, …, 9 are:
0, 0, 2, 5, 10, 17, 24, 35, 47
The longest closed paths are known only for n ≤ 10. Their lengths for n = 1, 2, …, 10 are:
0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 32, 42, 54
Generalizations
The problem can be further generalized to rectangular n×m boards, or even to boards in the shape of any polyomino. The problem for n×m boards, where n doesn't exceed 8 and m might be very large was given at 2018 ICPC World Finals. The solution used dynamic programming and uses the fact that the solution should exhibit a cyclic behavior.
Other standard chess pieces than the knight are less interesting, but fairy chess pieces like the camel ((3,1)-leaper), giraffe ((4,1)-leaper) and zebra ((3,2)-leaper) lead to problems of comparable complexity.

Hart (Heart) is the fourth album by Dutch language rapper Brainpower. It was released April 21, 2008 on Lyric Recordings, together with their fifth album Hard (Hard) and contains the single "Eigen Werk" ("Own Work"). Hart and Hard are two albums sold together, where Hart represents the sensitive side of Brainpower with songs about their mother ("Ode Aan Me Mama" / "Ode To My Momma"), their father ("Zo Vader Zo Zoon" / "Like Father Like Son") and their girlfriend ("Als Jij Er Niet Bent" / "If You're Not Around" featuring their girlfriend Hind).
Hip Hop veteran Brainpower separates their more melodious material from their famous 'braggin' & boast' side.
Hart is based around themes like 'Anger', 'Fear', 'Hope', 'Pain' and 'Luck' and different sorts of love. The notion/word 'Hart' ('Heart') is the concept throughout. There are guest performances from Freek de Jonge, Hind and Candy Dulfer to DJs TLM and All Star Fresh.

, styled as Takanori Oguiss, was a Japanese figurative painter who lived and worked most of their life in France.  They are known by their cityscape paintings.
Life and career
Born in Inazawa, Takanori Ogisu was the son of a landowner in the Nagoya region. Ogisu went to Tokyo in 1920 to become a painter. They studied at the Kawabata painting school (川端 画 学校, Kawabata Gagakkō) under Fujishima Takeji, then went to the Tokyo School of Fine Arts (precursor of Tōkyō Geijutsu Daigaku), where they graduated in 1929. In the same year the painter Yuzo Saeki , who had come back from France, visited Ogisu together with Takeo Yamaguchi and encouraged them to study in France. Ogisu and Yamaguchi followed the advice and went to Paris. They were part of a group of Japanese painters who went to study in France, such as Foujita, Inokuma, and Sadami Yokote, in 1927.
Ogisu settled in the district of Montparnasse, and frequented the painters of La Ruche, being particularly impressed by the paintings of Maurice Utrillo. In the 1930s, they occupied a studio at the foot of the Butte Montmartre, on rue Ordener, not far from their friends Inokuma and Foujita.
After a return to Japan, on the orders of the Vichy government (when they were appointed as a painter of the Japanese armies during the Second World War, but served only a few weeks on the two and a half years they were there, spending the rest of the time painting in Inazawa), Ogisu established themselves definitively in 1948 in France, painting in bright colors the old picturesque districts, the old shops, haberdashery, paper mills, wine and liquor stores, wood, coal, and flower markets. In 1951, they wrote and illustrated Nouvelles de Paris, published by Mainichi. They also traveled to Amsterdam, Ghent, Antwerp and Venice, composing colorful works with unusual framing.
Death and legacy
Their last exhibition during their lifetime took place at the museum of Saint-Denis in 1986. They died the same year and is buried in the Montmartre cemetery. A museum is dedicated to them in the Japanese city of Inazawa where their Montmartre city studio has been reconstituted.

The Ebenezer Bible College and Seminary (Abbreviated E.B.C.S) is a CAMACOP Bible institution in Zamboanga City, Philippines. It's the first and the largest by area Bible institution of CAMACOP.
History
When C&MA missionaries arrived at Zamboanga City in the 1900s, they realized they need a Bible school to train Filipinos in the way of the Lord. Ebenezer was built upon a foundation of two Christian day schools known as the Ebenezer Schools. The first school was for girls which was established by Rev. & Mrs. David Lund in 1911 and the school for boys was established in 1920. Then in 1926, the two schools were merged to form the Ebenezer Bible Institute with Rev. George Sthrom as its first principal. When the Second World War arrived in the Philippines, the school temporarily suspended its classes. Classes were only resumed in 1946 by Rev. Herbert Jackson. For the first times in 1950, the Ebenezer Principal went to a Filipino, Rev. Vicente Pada. In June 1962, the Ebenezer School Board voted to rename the school as the Ebenezer Bible College. Principal Pada automatically became its first Director. In 1974, the name of the head of the College was changed to President. In 1984, Dr. Adynna Lim became the first woman head of the institution and served until 1993. After that, Dr. Joel Imbing Ortiz; Dr. Benjamin M. De Jesus and Dr. Joel A. Caperig became presidents of EBCS. Currently, Rev. Roland Don S. Dulaca is the President of EBCS.

Nuclear Furniture is the eighth album by American rock band Jefferson Starship, released on May 30, 1984 through Grunt Records. It was the last album released by the band until 1998's Windows of Heaven, and was also the final album by the band before the departure of leader Paul Kantner and the formation of the offshoot band Starship.
Background
Produced by Ron Nevison, the album was arranged with the help of Austrian producer Peter Wolf (unrelated to the J. Geils Band singer of the same name), who had previously worked with Grace Slick on their solo album, Software. Wolf also contributed keyboard and synthesizer work to the album, although not an official part of the band. Wolf and their wife Ina also wrote the single "No Way Out", the first of many songs penned by the duo that took the future Starship in a more commercial direction.
As the album was being recorded, Paul Kantner became frustrated with the album's direction. Before the sessions came to a close, they stole the master tapes, put them in their car, and drove around San Francisco for a few days, and would not return them until the band mixed the album in a way more to their liking. Shortly after the album's release, Kantner left the band, and they only appears in the first promotional video produced, "No Way Out". After the departure of Kantner, the band lost the "Jefferson" moniker and became Starship; there would not be another studio album released under the Jefferson Starship name until after Kantner reformed the band in 1992.
Reception
Nuclear Furniture was released in 1984 and spawned the Top 40 single "No Way Out", which was also the first single by any incarnation of the band to hit No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The album itself reached No. 28.
Joseph McCombs of AllMusic rated the album 2 out of 5 stars and described it as a "competent but rather forgettable collection of radio-friendly dual guitar/keyboard period pop tunes." McCombs said that the juxtaposition between Kantner's politically-oriented songs and Thomas's more commercially-oriented songs "makes for an intriguing if uneven album."

In enzymology, a phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase [ PRAI ] () is an enzyme that catalyzes the third step of the synthesis of the amino acid tryptophan.
This enzyme participates in the phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis pathway, also known as the aromatic amino acid biosynthesis pathway
In yeast it is encoded by the TRP1 gene.
Nomenclature
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those intramolecular oxidoreductases interconverting aldoses and ketoses. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-(5-phospho-beta-D-ribosyl)anthranilate aldose-ketose-isomerase. Other names in common use include:
PRA isomerase,
PRAI,
IGPS:PRAI (indole-3-glycerol-phosphate,
synthetase/N-5'-phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase complex), and
N-(5-phospho-beta-D-ribosyl)anthranilate ketol-isomerase.
xPRAI (monomeric variant in Saccharmyces cerevisiae)
PRAI[ML256-452] (engineered variant of 1-(2-carboxy-phenylamino)-1-deoxy-D-ribulose 5-phosphate carboxylase: PRAI)
Reaction
Phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase is one of the many enzymes within the biosynthesis pathway of tryptophan (an essential amino acid). The upstream* pathway substrates and intermediates are shown below (Fig. 2).
As seen in Fig. 3, N-(5'-phosphoribosyl)-anthranilate via this enzyme is converted into 1-(o-carboxyphenylamino)-1-deoxribulose 5-phosphate. As the name phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase suggests, it functions as an isomerase, rearranging the parts of the molecule without adding or removing molecules or atoms.
The reaction seen in Fig. 3, is an intramolecular redox (reduction-oxidation) reaction. Its first step involves a proton transfer. This product intermediate, an enolamine, is fluorescent, which is useful for kinetic studies
within this pathway. However, this product is unstable, and quickly isomerases into an α-amino keto.
Note: Upstream/Downstream are relative to the compounds/molecules directly involved in phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase reaction
Kinetics
Michaelis–Menten kinetics data, is given in the table below for PRAI and indole-glycerol-phosphate synthase (IGPS, EC 4.1.1.48).
Structure
Depending on the microorganism PRAI's structure can vary between a mono-functional enzyme (monomeric and labile) or a stable bi-functional dimeric enzyme. Within Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas putida, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus the enzyme is monmeric. In contrast, in hyperthermophile Thermotoga maritima, Escherichia coli (Fig. 5), Salmonella typhimurium, and Aerobacter aerogenes, and Serratia marcescens, it is a bi-functional enzyme with indoleglycerol phosphate synthase as the paired enzyme.
The crystal structure has been characterized for a variety of the above listed microorganisms. The known 2.0 A structure of PRAI from Pyrococcus furiosus shows that tPRAI has a TIM-barrel fold (Fig. 6). PRAI derived from Thermococcus kodakaraensis also expresses a similar TIM-barrel fold structure. The subunits of tPRAI associate via the N-terminal faces of their central beta-barrels. Two long, symmetry-related loops that protrude reciprocally into cavities of the other subunit provide for multiple hydrophobic interactions. Moreover, the side chains of the N-terminal methionines and the C-terminal leucines of both subunits are immobilized in a hydrophobic cluster, and the number of salt bridges is increased in tPRAI. These features appear to be mainly responsible for the high thermostability of tPRAI.
The bi-functional version of this enzyme isolated from E. Coli (Fig. 5) performs two steps within the Tryptophan pathway. Referencing Fig. 7, the N-terminal catalyzes the IGPS reaction (residues ~1–289 purple), and the C-terminal domain performs the PRAI reaction (residues ~158–452 turquoise). Although these domains overlap (orange), the active sites are not overlapping, and studies have shown that mono-functional enzymes composing of these two domains are still able to produce a functional tryptophan bio-synthetic pathway.
The βα loops are responsible for the activity of this enzyme, and the αβ loops are involved in the protein's stability.
More details on the discovery of this enzyme's structure can be found in Willmann's paper.
Active site
Specifically, for phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase, TkTrpF, from Thermococcus kodakaraensis. The active site for the Amadori rearrangement, was determined to be Cys8 (acting as the general base) and Asp135 (as the general acid).
Inhibitors
An enzyme inhibitor is molecule that binds to an enzyme that therefore decreases the activity of the protein. The following molecules have been shown to inhibit PRAI activity:
Reduced 1-(2-carboxyphenylamino )-1-deoxy-D-ribulose 5-phosphate [5, 6,8); Indoleglycerol phosphate (8); Indolepropanol phosphate (8); MnCI2 CoCI2 [16); CuS04 (16); More (chemically synthesized N-(5-phospho-betaD-ribosyl)anthranilate contains inhibitors, but not if it is generated by anthranilate
phosphoribosyltransferase)
