MILFORD, CT—Claiming that their actions no longer reflect the company's values, fast food restaurant chain Subway announced Monday that it has dropped convicted pedophile Jared Fogle as its corporate spokesperson. “After careful consideration of the allegations against him, we have determined that it is in everyone's best interests for Subway to part ways with Jared,” the company's public relations manager Kyle Bertram told reporters, adding that Fogle, who was incarcerated in 2015 after pleading guilty to having sex with a minor, as well as possessing and distributing child pornography, would be removed from all advertisements and taken off the company's payroll, effective immediately. “While the decision to end our 17-year relationship with Jared was not an easy one, we ultimately feel that their legal troubles preclude them from continuing to serve as the face of Subway. Nonetheless, we thank them for their years of service.” Bertram added that although Fogle will no longer appear in Subway commercials and other promotional materials, the company would consider reinstating them as its spokesperson after Fogle concludes their prison sentence in 2029.

The deadly drug overdose epidemic that has been ravaging the nation may be even worse than we realize.
A new University of Virginia study says the numbers of deaths due to heroin and opioid overdoses have actually been severely underreported.
Dr. Christopher Ruhm revisited thousands of death certificates from 2008 through 2014 and concluded the mortality rates were 24 percent higher for opioids and 22 percent higher for heroin than had been previously reported.
“Opioid mortality rate changes were considerably understated in Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Jersey and Arizona,” the study states. “Increases in heroin death rates were understated in most states, and by large amounts in Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Jersey, Louisiana and Alabama.”
Ruhm's awful arithmetic emerged just days after the presidential opioid commission, led by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, urged President Donald Trump to “declare a national emergency” to deal with the crisis.
Nearly 35,000 people across America have died of heroin or opioid overdoses in 2015, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
"My message to members of a Presidential commission would be that getting the most accurate statistics possible is a crucial first step towards developing policies aimed at stemming the fatal drug epidemic," Ruhm told NBC News. "This is particularly important when we have scarce funds to allocate and so would want to target them at the hardest hit areas."
Ruhm contends that one of the reasons U.S. officials have been unable to win this war “is the lack of reliable information on the drugs causing fatal overdoses.”
“This occurs when no specific drug is identified on the death certificates,” they said in the study.
So Ruhm, a professor of public policy and economics, began poring over death certificate data from the federal Centers of Disease Control and Prevention.
They discovered that in 2014, a specific drug was not identified in 19.5 percent of fatal overdoses. And in 2008, that figure was even higher — 25.4 percent.
States like Rhode Island, Connecticut and New Hampshire specified the exact drug on death certificates 99 percent of the time “but only around half the time in Pennsylvania, Indiana, Mississippi, Louisiana and Alabama,” Ruhm reported in their study.
Armed with that info, Ruhm estimated how many of those deaths could be blamed on heroin and how many on opioids.
Their results? The national rate of fatal opioid overdoses jumped in 2014 from 9 per 100,000 people to 11.2 — and rate of fatal heroin overdoses climbed form 3.3 per 100,00 to 4.
Based on Ruhm's research, the drug problem in Pennsylvania is a lot worse than the CDC figures indicate.
The Keystone state was ranked 32nd by the CDC for opioid deaths for 2014, with 8.5 per 100,000. But Ruhm concluded the Keystone State actually has the seventh highest rate of opioid deaths that year with 17.8 per 100,000. And, based on Ruhm's calculations, it went from being the state with the 20th highest fatal heroin overdose rate to fourth.
"These numbers are alarming and underscore the need to continue expanding treatment, education, awareness, and resources for law enforcement and health professionals," J.J. Abbott, press secretary for Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, wrote in an email to NBC News. "As part of the ongoing strategy to address the opioid crisis, the administration is working on creating a public facing data dashboard to centralize and streamline information regarding overdoses, prevention, and treatment from all of the different sources."
That said, Susan Shanaman of the Pennsylvania State Coroners Association said "there are many reasons that a Coroner may not list all the drugs on a death certificate," including federal and state privacy rules.
"The average family gets 20 copies of a death certificate of their loved one," they wrote in an email to NBC News. "These are used to close out bank accounts, transfer loan accounts, transfer titles to vehicles, claim insurance and the like. Not every family member wants the public to know what drugs were all found in the deceased."
Hard-hit Ohio's opioid death rate went from 18.2 per 100,000 (fifth highest in the country) to 20.5 per 100,000 (fourth highest in the country) in Ruhm's report.
Ohio also has the nation's highest rate of fatal heroin overdoses with 10.4 per 100,000. By Ruhm's reckoning, the rate is 11.2 per 100,000, which is also the highest in the country.
Unchanged in Ruhm's report is West Virginia's woeful ranking as the state with the highest rate of deadly opioid cases. But even there Ruhm concluded the death rate for opioids should have been 30.3 per 100,000 in 2014 instead of 29.9. And the state's fatal heroin overdose rate should have been 9 per 100,000 rather than 8.8.

Ruhm's research also buttresses earlier studies that identified the primary victims of this plague.
“Fatal overdose rates are higher for males than females, for whites than blacks or other non-whites,” Ruhm said.
And the overdose death rates are highest for people ages 25 to 64 in the Rust Belt, in Appalachia and some western states.
“There are also pockets with high death rates in many other parts of the country as well,” Ruhm said
The Saints will hope their new-found depth can cover Montagna's absence
ST KILDA veteran Leigh Montagna has ruled themselves out of the Saints' season-opening clash with Melbourne as they continue to battle a right calf strain.
The 33-year-old, who took no part in the JLT Community Series due to the injury, performed run-throughs away from the main group on Wednesday, before leaving the track early.
Montagna confirmed they were behind schedule in their recovery to play in round one, but was hopeful of returning the following week against West Coast at Domain Stadium.
"I'm not far away at all but I think conditioning-wise, I'm going to end up a session or two short," Montagna told Fox Footy on Wednesday night.
"So most likely, I'll miss round one and definitely be available for round two.
"This time of year the last thing you want to do is re-injure it, so we're not going to rush it."
Montagna has played 271 games since debuting in 2002, including 22 last year.
Their contract expires at the end of 2017.
Last week on Generations Radio, Colorado pastors Kevin Swanson and Dave Buehner addressed the forest fires hitting their state. They wondered why God was punishing Colorado with the fires, and specifically targeting the heavily conservative city of Colorado Springs.
The two ultimately determined that the forest fires were linked to the state's liberal abortion laws and the recent success of civil union legislation. Swanson added that a Denver Post photograph of State House Majority Leader Mark Ferrandino kissing their partner also played a role in inviting God's wrath.
Buehner: Why Colorado Springs? Understand that Colorado itself is a state that has been begging for God's judgment. How did we do that? Well, we were the first state to make abortion legal; you could murder your baby as long as it's in your womb. Swanson: 1967. Buehner: Gov. Love, a Republican. Swanson: Two ironies there, not just one, the man's name was Gov. Love and he's responsible for killing more babies than probably anybody in the history of this country because he's the guy who started it. Buehner: Our legislative session opened up this year and their very first order of business, their most pressing order of business— Swanson: They could hardly wait, they could hardly wait. Buehner: Like the very first day, was to pass a civil union bill, which is an uncivil bill. … Swanson: When you have a state where the House leadership is performing a homosexual act on the front page of the Denver Post two months ago? Does God read the Denver Post? Do you think They pick up a copy of the Denver Post? They get it. God gets the Denver Post.
Buehner concluded that Coloradans should be glad God “hasn't destroyed the whole state yet” as “an act of grace.” But why were the fires concentrated in Colorado Springs, Buehner asked, “Why not wipe out Boulder or Denver” where all the Democrats live? They answered their own question: “Judgment begins in the House of God.”
Later, Swanson elaborated on the point, saying that Christians have not done a good of a job resisting cultural trends pushed by television shows and fashion. They described a particularly disturbing plane ride they took back from Australia, in which they were forced to look at other people's airplane TV sets. “I've never seen so many breasts in all of my life,” they reported. “Every form of aberrant sexuality and women's breasts are shown in front of me almost nonstop for fourteen hours.”
After saying that they were a victim of “oppressive” breast exposure, they criticized young men for “doing the metrosexual thing with the skinny pants and the little fairy shoes” and not growing out their facial hair as God commands. But feminism is also to blame, they said, as too many Christian women have embraced feminist fashions like hats and pantsuits.
The nation's only known population of freshwater seals will not get protections under the Endangered Species Act, federal officials announced on Wednesday.
The 250 to 300 harbor seals that live in Southwest Alaska's Iliamna Lake are different from harbor seals swimming the saltwater of Bristol Bay and the rest of the North Pacific marine system, but they fail to meet the criteria needed to classify as a distinct population segment, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Marine Fisheries Service said.
With that determination, NOAA rejected a 2012 petition that sought to define the lake seals as distinct and deserving the listing.
The petition, filed by the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the most active and litigious environmental organizations in Alaska, argued Iliamna seals are "rare and unique" and at risk from several threats, including climate change and the possible development of the controversial Pebble mine project proposed for the region.
But NOAA scientists said they concluded after studying the issue that the lake seals are indeed separate from the larger North Pacific harbor seal subspecies population, but not significant enough to qualify for protection.
To be considered a distinct population segment — one of the criteria for an endangered listing — a population must be both discrete and ecologically significant from the larger group to which it belongs, said NOAA spokesperson Julie Speegle said.
"In this case, they are discrete but they are not significant," they said.
To be protected as endangered, a population must be a defined species, subspecies or distinct population segment, NOAA said.
There are about 150,000 harbor seals in Alaska comprising 12 regional stocks, the federal agency said. Bristol Bay stock, which includes the Iliamna seals, is currently estimated to total at least 28,000 animals, according to NOAA's 2015 stock assessment of Alaska harbor seals.
NOAA scientists have found at least some of the Iliamna seals persist in the lake year-round and do not breed with harbor seals in eastern Bristol Bay, Speegle said.
The state of Alaska agrees with the no-listing decision, an Alaska Department of Fish and Game official said.
"Identifying Iliamna Lake seals as a distinct population segment is not appropriate, because the population does not differ substantially from harbor seals in Bristol Bay," Bruce Dale, director of the department's Division of Wildlife Conservation, said in a statement.
Even if the lake seals did qualify as scientifically distinct from the Bristol Bay seals, their population is too healthy to warrant an endangered listing, Dale said.
"No sign of decline has been detected in animals that overwinter in Iliamna Lake, and no threats exist indicating future declines are likely. Regional subsistence hunters report the seals are healthy and more abundant now than in the past," they said in the statement.
But to the Center for Biological Diversity, potential development of the massive Pebble mine is a looming threat.
"The Pebble Project would pose a catastrophic threat to Iliamna Lake seal, as well as other wildlife and the people that depend on the fragile Bristol Bay ecosystem for their livelihoods," the center said in its 2012 petition.
Dune Lankard, the Alaska representative for the organization, said the group was disappointed by the decision, but didn't say whether it would take additional action. In other cases where federal agencies declined to list species or subspecies as endangered, the organization has gone to court.
"Alaska's Iliamna Lake is home to the country's only population of freshwater seals and the world's largest sockeye salmon run," Lankard said in a prepared statement. "The government should safeguard this important ecosystem rather than clearing the way for mining interests to industrialize it. Protecting thriving wild salmon watersheds should be an economic and environmental priority under any administration."
The Iliamna seals — which make up one of only five populations of freshwater seals in the Northern Hemisphere — have themselves been shrouded in some mystery, according to Fish and Game and other agencies.
Some research indicates the seals spend unusually long periods under lake iceusing air pockets to breathe.
Even though endangered protection is not forthcoming, the seals will continue to be safeguarded under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, Speegle said.

Yup.. Xbox controller conform menu structure. Might explain why it took them an entire year to come up with this.Like the wealth of information we finaly get with the new UI thought, including the little graphics for twist and turn ratios.And thank the gods finaly we will be able to set up firing groups in the mechlab.At first the new UI seems to be a tad overwhelming, slamming you with huge lists of mechs you might or might not own, hope they will allow you to save settings on what the new ui shows you, for example allways only show me my owned mechs and nothing else unless i tell the new ui otherwise.When i load up the game i find it not functional to allways show me all mechs in the game, i only want to see my owned mechs.As for the new map... it doesnt actually look like a real usable instalation and totaly looks like a bloody solaris arena. Especialy with the high walls. While it might be a good arena it really does nothing for imersion and doesnt make you feel like youre in a huge stompy mech.Infact nothing on that map makes you feel like you are in a mech thats towering above everything else, nothing there looks to be made for humans. There is absolutely nothing to compare sizes too.Whoever designed that base completly ignored the needs for other vehicles besides mechs, and even thought mechs are the focus in the battletech universe, normal vehicles are still the norm for the majority of tasks.The whole instalation simply looks to alien and not manmade, what with the bumpy surface that would be a nightmare to drive over and even for mechs would be a nightmare to walk over. You would stumble every second step. Not to mention the damage you would cause to the floor with each step.Good arena.. bad map aesthetics... looks way to Borg like with no clear purpose as to what the hell this base was even made for.

This spring, the Rangers, Pakistan's paramilitary security force, launched a series of raids into Karachi's slums for what was described by the government as a crime-prevention campaign. Members of the force blocked off the streets surrounding the city's poorest neighborhoods and exchanged fire with the locals. Over several days, the Rangers seized several caches of weapons and captured or killed dozens of alleged gang members.
As the raids continued, news reports emerged that Uzair Baloch, the former leader of one of the gangs targeted by the military, had accused a number of high-ranking politicians of extortion and conspiracy to commit murder. Karachi is Pakistan's largest city, with an estimated population of 20 million, and stories of corruption and violence are commonplace there. But Uzair, who is a member of Pakistan's Baloch ethnic group, was more powerful than your average gang leader, and their accusations were unusually damning.
Uzair had fled the country in 2013. In December, they were arrested in Dubai, and they were held by the authorities in the Emirates while the Pakistani government sought their extradition. Now, according to a report that aired on March 19 on Express News, they had admitted to carrying out assassinations at the behest of powerful figures within the Pakistan Peoples Party, including the country's former president, Asif Ali Zardari.
The P.P.P. responded that Uzair was a member of a conspiracy against it. On March 18, Saulat Mirza, an assassin who had been on death row for almost seventeen years, had given a sensational televised confession hours before they were due at the gallows. In their speech, Mirza blamed the leadership of the Muttahida Quami Movement, or M.Q.M., Karachi's most powerful political party, for their crimes. (The execution was delayed, but Mirza was hanged a few weeks later.) There was speculation that Uzair's confession — which, unlike Mirza's, had only been reported secondhand — was part of a plot by the military to weaken the P.P.P. and the M.Q.M., Karachi's two main civilian parties.
That didn't necessarily mean that Uzair's claims were untrue, of course. I have been following their career for several years, and the arrest in Dubai was a dramatic reversal of fortune for a man who, during the 2013 general election, had been a key ally of the P.P.P. They had hosted many party leaders, including the chief minister of Sindh province, at their lavish mansion in the slum of Lyari, on the west side of Karachi.
Uzair had been trying to transform themselves from a gangster into a legitimate politician. Their downfall showed just how provisional legitimacy can be in Karachi, and how deeply embedded gangs are in the city's politics. Their alleged confession suggested they didn't want to be brought down alone.

Ruby represents small integers using Fixnum
and large integers using Bignum.
Most of us don't use Ruby to perform complex calculations for science, engineering or cryptography applications; instead, we might turn to R, Matlab or some other programming language or tool for that sort of thing. When we calculate values using Ruby, it's often to process simple values while generating a web page using ERB or Haml, or to handle the result of a database query using ActiveRecord. Almost all of the time, Ruby's Fixnum class is more than sufficient.
For most Ruby developers, therefore, the Bignum class is a dark, unfamiliar corner of the language. Today I'd like to shed some light on Bignum by looking at how Ruby represents integers internally inside the Fixnum and Bignum classes. What's the largest integer that fits inside a Fixnum; just how big is a Bignum?
Also, it turns out that Ruby 2.1 contains an important new change for the Bignum class: support for the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP) library. In my next post, I'll take a look at mathematical theory and history behind some of the algorithms used by Bignum internally and how Ruby 2.1 works with GMP. But for now, let's start with the basics.
64-Bit Integers
Most computers these days represent numbers as 64 digit binary values internally. For example, the number ten thousand looks like this expressed as a binary value:
My rectangle here represents how a 64-bit computer would save an integer in a microprocessor register or a RAM memory location. The numbers 63 and 0 indicate that there are spaces for 64 binary digits, each of which can contain a zero or one. The most significant binary digit, #63, is on the left, while the least significant digit, #0, is on the right. I'm not showing all of the leading zeroes here to keep things simple.
The term 64-bit architecture means the logic gates, transistors and circuits located on your microprocessor chip are designed to process binary values using 64 binary digits like this, in parallel. Whenever your code uses an integer, the microprocessor retrieves all of these on/off values from one of the RAM chips in your CPU using a “bus” or set of 64 parallel connections.
64-Bit Integers in MRI Ruby
The standard implementation of Ruby, Matz's Ruby Interpreter (MRI), saves integers using a slightly different, custom format; it hard codes the least significant digit (on the right in my diagram) to one and shifts the actual integer value one bit to the left. As we'll see in a moment, if this bit were zero Ruby would instead consider the integer to be a pointer to some Ruby object.
Here's how Ruby represents ten thousand internally:
FIXNUM_FLAG=1 indicates this integer represents an instance of the Fixnum class. The flag is a performance optimization, removing the need for Ruby to create a separate C structure the way it normally would for other types of objects. (Ruby uses a similar trick for symbols and special values such as true, false and nil.)
Two's Complement in Ruby
Like most other computer languages and also like your microprocessor's actual hardware circuits, Ruby uses a binary format called two's complement to save negative integers. Here's how the value -10,000 would be saved inside your Ruby program:
Note the first bit on the left, the sign bit, is set to 1. This indicates this is a negative integer. Ruby still sets the lowest bit, FIXNUM_FLAG, to 1. The other bits contain the value itself. To calculate a two's complement value for a negative integer, your microprocessor adds one to the absolute value (getting 10,001 in this example) and then reverses the zeroes and ones. This is equivalent to subtracting the absolute value from the next highest power of two. Ruby uses two's complement in the same way, except it adds FIXNUM_FLAG on the right and shifts the rest of the value to the left.
The Largest Fixnum Value: 4611686018427387903
Using 64-bit binary values with FIXNUM_FLAG, Ruby is able to take advantage of your computer's microprocessor to represent integer values efficiently. Addition, subtraction and other integer operations can be handled using the corresponding assembly language instructions by removing and then re-adding FIXNUM_FLAG internally as needed. This design only works, however, for integer values that are small enough to fit into a single 64-bit word. We can see what the largest positive Fixnum integer must be by setting all 62 of the middle bits to one, like this:
Here we have a zero on the left (indicating this is a positive integer) and a one on the right (for FIXNUM_FLAG). The remaining 62 bits in the middle hold this binary number:
11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
Converting this to decimal we get: 4611686018427387903, the largest integer that fits into a Fixnum object. (If you compiled Ruby on a 32-bit computer, of course, the largest Fixnum would be much smaller than this, only 30-bits wide.)
The Smallest Bignum: 4611686018427387904
But what does Ruby do if we want to use larger numbers? For example, this Ruby program works just fine:
But now the sum doesn't fit into a 64-bit Fixnum value, since expressing 4611686018427387904 as a binary value requires 63 digits, not 62:
This is where the Bignum class comes in. While calculating 4611686018427387903+1, Ruby has to create a new type of object to represent 4611686018427387904 – an instance of the Bignum class. Here's how that looks inside of Ruby:
On the right you can see Ruby has reset the FIXNUM_FLAG to zero, indicating this value is not a Fixnum but instead a pointer to some other type of object. (C programs like MRI Ruby that use malloc to allocate memory always get addresses that end in zero, that are aligned. This means the FIXNUM_FLAG, a zero, is actually also part of the pointer's value.)
The RBignum Structure
Now let's take a closer look at the RBignum C structure and find out what's inside it. Here's how Ruby saves the value 4611686018427387904 internally:
On the left, you can see RBignum contains an inner structure called RBasic, which contains internal, technical values used by all Ruby objects. Below that I show values specific to Bignum objects: digits and len. digits is a pointer to an array of 32-bit values that contain the actual big integer's bits grouped into sets of 32. len records how many 32-bit groups are in the digits array. Since there can be any number of groups in the digits array, Ruby can represent arbitrarily large integers using RBignum.
Ruby divides up the bits of the big integer into 32-bit pieces. On the left, the first 32-bit value contains the least significant 32 bits from the big integer, bit 31 down to bit 0. Following that, the second value contains bits 63-32. If the big integer were larger, the third value would contain bits 95-64, etc. Therefore, the large integer's bits are actually not in order: The groups of bits are in reverse order, while the bits inside each group are in the proper order.
To save a Bignum value, Ruby starts by saving the least significant bits of the target integer into the first 32-bit digit group. Then it shifts the remaining bits 32 places to the right and saves the next 32 least significant bits into the next group. Ruby continues shifting and saving until the entire big integer has been processed.
Ruby allocates enough 32-bit pieces in the digits array to provide enough room for the entire large integer. For example, for an extremely large number requiring 320 bits, Ruby could use 10 32-bit values by setting len to 10 and allocating more memory:
In my example Ruby needs just two 32-bit values. This makes sense because, as we saw above, 4611686018427387903 is a 62-bit integer (all ones) and when I add one I get a 63-bit value. When I add one, Ruby first copies the 62 bits in the target value into a new Bignum structure, like this:
Ruby copies the least significant 32 bits into the first digit value on the left, and the most significant 30 into the second digit value on the right (there is space for two leading zeroes in the second digit value).
Once Ruby has copied 4611686018427387903 into a new RBignum structure, it can then use a special algorithm implemented in bignum.c to perform an addition operation on the new Bignum. Now there is enough room to hold the 63-bit result, 4611686018427387904 (diagram copied from above):
A few other minor details to learn about this:
Ruby saves the sign bit inside the RBasic structure, and not in the binary digit values themselves. This saves a bit of space, and makes the code inside bignum.c simpler.
structure, and not in the binary digit values themselves. This saves a bit of space, and makes the code inside bignum.c simpler. Ruby also doesn't need to save the FIXNUM_FLAG in the digits, since it already knows this is a Bignum value and not a Fixnum .
in the digits, since it already knows this is a value and not a . For small Bignum 's, Ruby saves memory and time by storing the digits values right inside the RBignum structure itself, using a C union trick. I don't have time to explain that here today, but you can see how the same optimization works for strings in my article Never create Ruby strings longer than 23 characters.
Next time
In my next post I'll look at how Ruby performs an actual mathematical operation using Bignum objects. It turns out there's more to multiplication that you might think: Ruby uses one of a few different multiplication algorithms depending on how large the integers are, each with a different history behind it. And Ruby 2.1 adds yet another new algorithm to the mix with GMP.
A Dutch court convicted populist lawmaker Geert Wilders -- who is running to be prime minister -- of hate speech Friday, at the end of a trial they branded a politically motivated "charade" that endangered freedom of speech.
Presiding Judge Hendrik Steenhuis said the court would not impose a sentence because the conviction was punishment enough for a democratically elected lawmaker. Prosecutors had asked judges to fine them $5,300.
The politically charged prosecution centered on comments Wilders made before and after the Dutch municipal elections in 2014. At one meeting in a Hague cafe, they asked supporters whether they wanted more or fewer Moroccans in the Netherlands. That sparked a chant of "Fewer! Fewer! Fewer!" — to which they replied, "we'll take care of it."
Prosecutors say that Wilders, who in 2011 was acquitted at another hate speech trial for their outspoken criticism of Islam, overstepped the limits of free speech by specifically targeting Moroccans.
On Friday, they were convicted for the interaction with the crowd of supporters in the Hague cafe, which judges said was carefully orchestrated and broadcast on national television. They were acquitted for similar comments they made in a radio interview a week earlier.
In a tweet, Wilders called the verdicts "madness" and said that they had been convicted by three judges who hated their Party for Freedom.
Wilders was not in court for the verdict that came just over three months before national elections. Wilders' party is currently narrowly leading a nationwide poll of polls and has risen in popularity during the trial.
Even before the hearing, Wilders vowed not to let a conviction muzzle him.
"Whatever the verdict, I will continue to speak the truth about the Moroccan problem, and no judge, politician or terrorist will stop me," they tweeted shortly before the verdict.
They had denied the charges and insisted they were performing their duty as a political leader by pointing out a problem in society.
Before declaring Wilders guilty, Steenhuis stressed that freedom of speech was not on trial as Wilders had claimed during the case.
"Freedom of speech is one of the foundations of our democratic society," the judge said. But they added: "Freedom of speech can be limited, for example to protect the rights and freedoms of others, and that is what this case is about."

Last month, Oakland University head women's basketball coach Beckie Francis was mysteriously fired after several years of leading what — from the outside, at least — seemed like a successful collegiate sports program. Now, more than a dozen former players have come forward to reveal that behind the scenes, Francis was a religious zealot obsessed with their players' virginity and weight, to the point that some under their iron fist developed eating disorders. And here I thought I had it bad when my high school basketball coach benched me after I told them they were dumb for forcing us to practice motion offense before playing a team that always, always killed us with a half court 1-3-1 zone. Perspective!
According to the players who have spoken to the media (current players have been strictly prohibited from doing so), Coach Francis' coaching methods during their 13-year tenure went beyond "hardass running a tight ship;" the woman was downright terrifying. Picture the coaching equivalent of Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? meets the crazy ball-chucking Rutgers dude meets Reese Witherspoon's character from Election meets Michele Bachmann. Now picture that character forcing you to go to church with them
The entire piece on their antics is worth a read if you feel like bumming yourself out on a Monday, but for the sake of brevity, time, and your internet-disabled attention span, here's a short list of some of the crap Coach Beckie Francis allegedly pulled during their tenure at Oakland.
gave incoming first-year student the "virginity talk," which consisted of the Coach telling them players, in no uncertain terms, that they better be hard-studying virgins while they play for her;
penalized players with social lives by benching them;
basically forced players to attend their weirdo Christian church, including one player who was Muslim;
showed Christian-themed videos on bus trips, which is a shame because everyone knows that bus trips are for quote-along viewings of Dirty Dancing or Mean Girls;
instituted an unspoken but enforced "Pray to Play" rule;
constantly criticized players about their weight, forced players to diet, and refused to play players who weren't skinny enough;
forced to pose for pictures in their sports bras and spandex shorts while flexing their muscles, so the coach could document their body changes and progress toward a platonic ideal of perfection that existed in Coach Francis' head;
This:
An assistant coach brought an infant son on a 2010 road trip to South Dakota State. With the team in a study session, the baby was sleeping in a carrier when the assistant was sent by Francis to run a short errand, according to a person with knowledge of the situation who was present on the road trip. The person said that while the assistant was gone, the baby began to cry and Francis picked up the carrier, placed it in the hallway and returned to the room. The baby was left alone in the hallway for about 10 minutes until the assistant returned.
during pickup games during practice, Francis would put their hands on players' stomachs and demand players let them feel their six-packs;
banned their team from socializing with the men's basketball team. Because sex.
Players reported that they were afraid to speak out because Francis' husband Gary Russi was President of the University. But this summer, both were fired Russi resigned within a day of Francis' removal under a SHROUD OF MYSTERY.

Now, it seems that both firings may be related to the fact that Beckie Francis (aside: is "Beckie Francis" not the perfect sanctimonious jerk name?) is a dangerous abuser with serious control issues. Coach Francis' tactics have led to several of their former players exhibiting symptoms of eating disorders, and an abnormally high number of them have transferred out of the program under their watch.
What makes this extra sad is Francis' own tragic history; they recently revealed that they were sexually abused by their father when they were a child and last year testified before the Michigan legislature in favor of a law protecting victims of child abuse. In the months leading up to their termination, they were recognized for their courage in the face of personal adversity and their team's success was rewarded with a fancy new conference membership.
As we'd say in the North Country, uff da.

A man had to call 999 from inside a hospital bathroom because no-one was answering their cries for help.
Arthur Debney had been frantically pulling on the alarm cord in the bathroom in the emergency ward at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd in Rhyl after falling in there.
But when nobody responded to the alarm or their shouts for help for up to half an hour they phoned the emergency services.
Mr Debney, 65, told the operator what had happened and the call handler got in touch with the hospital.
The health board has since apologised and said it was “unacceptable” if Mr Debney didn't get the help they deserved.
'I shouted and shouted'
Retired gas fitter Mr Debney, who suffers from heart disease and a painful inflammation of the tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach, said they had been taken to hospital in an ambulance from their Rhyl home.
They said: “My wife Irena phoned the out-of-hours service and they told them to ring an ambulance because I was in so much pain.
“It was terrible. I was in the ambulance for a couple of hours, then they pushed me into the waiting room. There was no-one about but I wanted to go to the toilet.
“I went into the bathroom and I felt funny. So as I went down I grabbed the red cord.
“I shouted and shouted and shouted but no-one came. I knew the alarm cord was working because I could see the red light it gives off coming under the door.
“It seemed like I'd been there forever. So I phoned 999 and the woman I spoke to told me to keep talking to them until they came to let me out.
“When they let me out the 999 woman asked me to let them speak to the nurse so I gave them the phone.”
'We are extremely sorry'
The father of three grown-up children said they were appalled they had had to go through the ordeal and that they had not been impressed generally by the level of care they received on their regular stays in the hospital, adding: “The way I have been treated is terrible.”
Mr Debney remains in hospital since the bathroom incident on Friday morning.
A spokesperson for Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said: “We are extremely sorry for any distress caused to Mr Debney during this incident.
“All patients should receive prompt help and support and it is unacceptable if this did not happen.
“We can confirm that the management team have already met with Mr Debney to discuss the events and apologise.”
The Family Office Institute Australia, which was quoted at length in a Senate committee report, was established in August by two lawyers and a Canberra lobbyist who represent Australia's ultra-rich in disputes with the Australian Tax Office. Senator Nick Xenophon said the deal to allow the Port of Darwin to be leased to Landbridge was "gobsmacking". Credit:Daniel Munoz Greens Senator Peter Whish-Wilson said the "Better Targeting the Income Tax Transparency Laws" Act needed to be repealed because the Senate had been "astroturfed" and "conned" by the Family Office Institute. The concept of astroturfing, which is much more prevalent in US politics, involves the use of "artificial grassroots" to push a narrow political agenda on behalf of powerful interests. During debate, Senator Whish-Wilson said the Family Office Institute was a "particularly acute" example of those with resources being able to deploy lobbyists to get a legislative result.
They said the matter was of significant public interest and the Greens acted once "new information came to light". "And that information was basically that we've been 'astroturfed' by a front organisation that appeared during the committee process and senators themselves have admitted had an impact on their decision," they said. "I don't think there is a single Australian out there, besides perhaps ones worth more than $100 million, who would oppose this legislation." The amendments passed were attached to the government's multinational tax avoidance bill – Joe Hockey's last act as Treasurer. The government will now have to decide whether to pass the bill through the House of Representatives or reject the amendments and send the bill back to the Senate with changes.
The Minister for Small Business and Assistant Treasurer, Kelly O'Dwyer said: "The Australian Taxation Office has the power to look at all of the financial and tax arrangements of Australian-owned private companies. "These amendments will do nothing to increase the ATO's powers. "Labor and the Greens are clearly playing politics. "The delay of the multinational tax bill will stop increased penalties for multinationals who flout the law and don't pay their fair share of tax." Labor senator Sam Dastyari said Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Treasurer Scott Morrison would be out of step with society if they keep up the fight for large private companies to remain cloaked in tax secrecy while conducting a conversation on raising the GST on ordinary Australians.
Tax transparency campaigners, who worked for years to convince the former Labor government to pass the law to demand companies publish their annual tax contribution, welcomed the news. "It's a great day for democracy when a sneaky attempt to ensure more secrecy around corporate tax is thrown out," said Mark Zirnsak, spokesperson for the Tax Justice Network, an established group with dozens of member organisations, including charities, churches and unions. The Greens amendment was supported Senators Xenophon and Muir after the insertion of two key clauses. The first would allow companies in critical commercial negotiations with dominant players – for example, Coles and Woolworths – to appeal to the Tax Commissioner for an exemption on disclosure. And the public list of tax paid, which will be maintained by the Australian Tax Office, will include a disclaimer that the information does not necessarily provide the "full picture" of a company's tax affairs. Senator Xenophon said they had been persuaded by "arguments I thought had some credibility at the time".
But they since learnt that all the information to be provided on the register can be obtained in a $38 company search through the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. The Coalition voted against the amendment. Richard Gilbert, the director of the Family Office Institute, said: "We are very disappointed with this outcome, which sends the wrong signal to free enterprise in Australia. It's clearly discriminating against one class of taxpayer over another." Follow us on Twitter
A new demonstration will be organized by PAME on Tuesday 23rd of June in Omonia at 6pm.
PAME is calling for a “people's mobilization to block the savage new anti-people agreement, the new anti-people package they are going to burden us with.”
On the same day, the pensioners will hold a national demonstration in Athens.
PAME notes in its statement for the demonstration that:
“The solution is to be found in the struggles under the banners of the workers'-people's interests, on the basis of our rights and needs and not those of the bosses. The solution is to be found in the confrontation in the workplaces, in the complete counterattack against our exploiters, who are the only ones to have profited from the new barbaric measures.
We set our own red lines!
We turn our backs on those who want us to applaud the government and its partners, the cheerleaders of a negotiation that is leading us to poverty for the profits of the few.
We turn our backs on the defenders of the EU, the unions of capital and their servants who are protesting for their right to continue to live off the sweat of others, to continue to exploit the vast majority of the people even more savagely.
We have nothing to do with them! We are not the same!
We do not place our slogans and banners under false flags. We do not have the same interests, the same needs, the same anxieties and difficulties as our exploiters.
You are either with the monopolies or with the people's needs! There is no other way! Our path is that of struggle, of rupture with the EU and the path of the monopolies.
No support for the new memorandum whatever name they give it!
No acceptance of the barbaric and anti-people EU!
On the 11th of June over 700 workers' and people's organizations gave a strong response in 60 Greek cities.
On Tuesday, the voice of the workers, the pensioners, the youth, the women will be heard again.
Our struggles are not a game in the competition of the monopolies, the proposals and political line of the EU, IMF, ECB, Russia and China. The people have no interests in choosing the rope these forces will use to hang them, their interests lie in calling these forces' power into question.
The EU “one-way street” has been demonstrated to be disastrous and damaging for the workers'-people's interests.
Everyone must join the struggles!
Workers, unemployed, young people.
Do not accept:
The new and old anti-social security laws.
The continuing attacks on the people's income, salaries. Pensions.
The new taxes and levies.
Our lives can not endure other measures. Our needs can not wait. We demand, here and now, in opposition to the intimidation and blackmail:
Increases in salaries, pensions and benefits.
Recovery of all the losses.
Restoration of the Collective labour agreements.
Abolition of the anti-worker laws.
Real protection of al the unemployed.
We organize our response!
We gather our strength!
We strengthen our trade unions in every sector. We respond militantly! We smash the climate of fear, the blackmail and threats of the bosses, the government, the EU-IMF-ECB.
Only our strength and stance can abolish the anti-people laws, memoranda and bosses!”

Le Monde here has an article which in large part re-iterates what NYT journalist Andrew Revkin wrote 3 days ago. The selfish, adolescent follies of the Turney expedition are seriously disrupting the supply of serious scientific operations in the Antarctic. A number of scientists worldwide have not found Turney's charade amusing at all.
The piece is titled: “Scientists angered by cruise trapped in Antarctica“.
After describing how the botched expedition and the ensuing helicopter rescue, Le Monde writes how the relief operations are now “endangering several major research programs being conducted on different scientific bases of the sixth continent.” There's only a 3-month window available for supply ships to make vital deliveries. Time is of the essence when it comes to logistics in Antarctica.
On the Turney expedition, Le Monde quotes Yves Frenot, the French Director of the Polar Institute Paul Emile Victor (IPEV):
It is a tourist pseudo-scientific expedition. It's a little ‘cruise fun'.”
Glaciologist Jérôme Chappellaz of the Laboratoire de Glaciologie et de Géophysique de l'Environnement, who is still at the Casey Antarctic base, said:
The expedition was presented as being scientific, but there are tourists on board who paid to go on a trip.”
Because of the distress call coming from the Turney's chartered expedition vessel Akademik Shokalskiy, Le Monde writes: “Vital supplies comprising hundreds of tons of food, fuel and equipment could not be fully discharged from the Aurora Australis, which was requisitioned in emergency.”
The supply disruption is not the only thing that irked scientists on other Antarctic bases in need of vitally important supplies, but they later had to watch booze-cruise, spring break like going-ons onboard the ice-bound Akademik Shokalskiy. Le Monde quotes Mr. Chappellaz:
At Casey, when the colleagues learned the ‘Australis' had been requisitioned, there was a little panic. What was most shocking was the manner in which the members on the Shokalskiy expedition communicated: on screens we saw them partying, singing, etc. – without at any time seeming to ask what they were putting in peril.”
Le Monde also quotes glaciologist Joe McConnell (Australian Antarctic Division) in the New York Times, who stated the rescue operations will also likely cause considerable disruptions for French and Chinese programs because their vessels had also also been diverted.
Le Monde writes that the cost of the Chinese and Australian icebreakers are close to $80,000 per day – each! And that doesn't include the crew! Right now the Chinese Xue Long is trapped in ice and no one can say how long before it will get out.
M. Chappellaz vents:
It is not normal that this expedition, which uses science as a pretext for adventure-tourism, is jeopardizing multi-annual research programs.”
Finally Le Monde raises concerns that the pictures of a stranded “climate science vessel” trapped in deep ice may be leaving a long lasting false message on the subject of global warming in the minds of the worldwide public. Finally, perhaps these two reports from the New York Times and Le Monde provide hope in that in the future they will start to distinguish between the sophomoric alarmist climate scientists who want to change the world in a rush, and those that are truly serious about doing real science.
Political Influence
The arms industry has inserted itself into the very heart and machinery of government giving it totally disproportionate access and influence over vital areas, warping public policy and harming us all.
Take action Sign the petition to demand the Prime Minister takes action against lobbying and corporate influence over public policy.
Arms companies have long enjoyed a close relationship with the Government, giving them immense influence over government decision-making.
There are many opportunities for arms companies to gain access to and influence the Government:
from the thousands of hours of meetings,
to the revolving door between companies, military and government,
to the industry bodies within government itself
The influence of this network of relations and massive integration warps government priorities in favour of private commercial interests and leads to the public interest becoming conflated with corporate interests, preventing a proper debate about policies that would do more for the long-term security of people in the UK and elsewhere.
We can see the damaging impacts of this influence when
Important rule for anybody planning on stealing a car with a caravan attached: always make sure the owners aren't still in the back.
A caravan: may contain people
It's a rule one Australian thief ignored, resulting in them driving off with an elderly couple.
Australian police said the couple, both in their 60s, were picking up a new caravan from a dealer in the Adelaide suburb of Blair Athol on Monday around noon.
A sales manager was showing the couple some of the caravan's features when a thief took advantage of the fact that the keys had been left in the ignition, jumped into their car and drove off.
‘The sales manager managed to jump from the caravan as it was driven away. The suspect then crashed into another car…and drove away from the scene at speed, over kerbs, with the terrified couple still in the caravan,' police said in a statement.
The thief abandoned the car and caravan several streets away before running off, leaving the unharmed couple behind but taking their digital camera with him.
What's worse than Fox News' attempts at reporting? Fox News' attempts to convey information through images.
Media Matters' Zachary Pleat highlights this doozy from the Republican news network today, which intends to show the fluctuations in the unemployment rate over 2011 to date.
It might be a little tough to see (click on it for a larger view), but the truly amazing this about the image is that it (a) shows no change between 9% unemployment and 8.6% unemployment; and (b) tells viewers that 8.6% unemployment is higher than 8.8% unemployment.
Fox cites Bureau of Labor Statistics data as the source, and lists the actual fluctuations in the national rate accurately, but somehow failed miserably to actually graph the data points correctly. (The fact that 9% and 8.6% were at the same x-axis point should have been a clue to someone at the network, unless the goal was to mislead Fox viewers, perish the thought.)
What's more, as Pleat added, this new image fits into a larger pattern: “A few weeks ago, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics first reported that the unemployment rate had dropped to 8.6 percent in November — the lowest rate in more than 2 years — a Fox News graphic rounded up to 9 percent. In 2010, Fox News aired a staggeringly misleading chart suggesting that 15 million jobs were lost in three months. Three months.”
There's a very good reason Fox News viewers are so confused, so often, about so much.
Former Michigan tight end Jake Butt shares their stance on why college athletes should be able to profit off their likeness. (2:03)
ANN ARBOR, Mich. - Jake Butt has heard the lament since tearing their right ACL in December's Orange Bowl, that they should have sat out the game as a potential first-round pick, asrunning backs Christian McCaffrey and Leonard Fournette did with Stanford and LSU.
Butt views it differently. They know their injury likely cost them a spot in the first round of April's NFL draft. They know they might not be ready for the start of training camp for whatever team drafts him. But they see their injury not as a cry for players to sit out -- but for college players to be compensated for what they do on the field. Jake Butt required surgery on their right ACL after being injured in the Orange Bowl. The former Michigan tight end said Friday that he's an example of why college players should be paid. Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images
"I should be the example of why college athletes should be getting paid in college or why I can't use my name to benefit off my likeness in college," Butt said after Michigan's Pro Day on Friday.
"Why can I see 'I Like Jake Butt and I Cannot Lie,' I see those shirts and I'm living paycheck-to-paycheck in college. Who knows? Heaven forbid something happens in the NFL, can I really benefit off of it when it was at the most? No, I can't."
Butt did not work out for teams at pro day. They said they are hoping to start running in the next two weeks on their knee after having surgery on Jan. 10. They said they could be cleared as early as July 10 -- but that's an ideal date if everything goes well. That would make them available for the start of training camp.
Butt said every team has asked about their knee and that he'll be back in Indianapolis for the medical recheck in April before the draft. They know the injury will hamper their draft prospects, but they aren't concerned about it long term. They met with the Raiders, Titans, Saints and Steelers just before Friday's pro day and has no visits set up other than the local prospects pro day with the Lions in April.
"It'll hurt a little bit," Butt said. "But I just want to play football."
As they leaf the NCAA, where they were considered an amateur unable to get paid, for the NFL's paid ranks, he's sure of one thing about playing college football for free.
"Something needs to change," Butt said. "I don't want a check from the NCAA. I don't know if that's something that's likely. But the big thing is they say you can't use your name to benefit. I can't go into my favorite breakfast spot, Benny's, I can't go in there and get a free breakfast because I'm only getting that because of my name.
"That's not to say I can't make friends with the owner because of the person I am. I'm a good guy, a really good guy -- sociable guy, made a lot of friends. I can't accept anything free for that. They said I can't go down the street, the example one of them gave us is you can't go to [get] tires and negotiate your price from $600 to $500 because that's only because of your name. But Joe Schmo can go down the street and they can negotiate their price. It's kind of ridiculous to me."
Butt said they first started recognizing this during their sophomore year at Michigan, when they moved into an apartment and received $900 a month to pay for housing and other incidentals, including bills, food and gas. Problem was, rent was $700 and that meant they had $200 to pay for the rest of their bills. They called their father, Rob, and asked for money. Rob asked about the scholarship. Butt explained the situation, which affects many college athletes who don't have time for a part-time job on top of classes and their sport.
Butt said he's thankful for the education they got at Michigan and the connections they made. But they see salaries of others who work in NCAA sports and what the NCAA men's basketball tournament brings in and it makes them wonder.
"I'm looking at what this March Madness is bringing in," Butt said. "How much money do they bring in? Oh, but the basketball players are getting an education. How are they getting an education when they are missing the whole entire month of March?"
Butt is the latest college athlete to voice that players should be paid or allowed to make money off endorsements while they are in college. Ex-Northwestern quarterback Kain Colter tried to unionize at Northwestern -- a movement that failed but one Butt said they would support. Wisconsin basketball player Nigel Hayes questions why college athletes aren't being paid. Butt said Friday they would welcome a conversation with Hayes, who they played AAU basketball against in high school, and would help Hayes out if they wanted.
Butt reiterated multiple times they don't have a solution yet, but they said more conversations about college athletes, endorsements and being paid should continue to happen.
"Everybody has different opinions," Butt said. "I think the NCAA does a good job; you don't let people unionize. You don't let people truly have a voice to make a change and then they get to the NFL or start their careers and then no one speaks for the college athletes anymore.
"But I think it's moving in the right direction. I think eventually, hopefully something will happen."

In a tweet late Wednesday, Trump took aim at Clinton's newly released book about their experiences on the 2016 campaign trail, saying the former Democratic presidential nominee refuses to take responsibility for their election loss.
"Crooked Hillary Clinton blames everybody (and every thing) but themselves for their election loss," Trump wrote. "She lost the debates and lost their direction!"

"The 'deplorables' came back to haunt Hillary.They expressed their feelings loud and clear. They spent big money but, in the end, had no game!" they said in a follow-up tweet.
Clinton hit back on Thursday, suggesting that Trump take a look at another one of their books, "It Takes a Village."
"If you didn't like that book, try this one – some good lessons in here about working together to solve problems," they tweeted. "Happy to send a copy."

Trump's social media broadside against Clinton was not unusual for the president, who frequently takes to Twitter to criticize political opponents. But until Wednesday, the president had appeared to tone down their criticism of Clinton in recent weeks.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Better network hardware would have helped police investigate the hack attack, say experts
Hackers managed to steal $80m (£56m) from Bangladesh's central bank because it skimped on network hardware and security software, reports Reuters.
The bank had no firewall and used second-hand routers that cost $10 to connect to global financial networks.
Better security and hardware would have hampered the attackers, Reuters said, quoting an official investigator.
The hackers aimed to steal $1bn but made mistakes that led to the theft being spotted and stopped.
Better defence
A firewall would have made attempts to hack the bank more "difficult", Mohammad Shah Alam, a forensic investigator who works on the Bangladesh team investigating the theft, told Reuters.
The second-hand hardware also meant that basic security steps to segregate network traffic were not taken, they said.
The cheap routers have hindered the investigation, said Mr Alam, because they collected very little network data that could be used to pinpoint the hackers and shed light on their tactics.
The hack took place in early February and involved hackers getting access to the core network of Bangladesh's central bank. They used this privileged access to transfer cash from Bangladesh's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to other banks.
A spelling mistake in one of the transfer orders alerted bank staff and meant the hackers only managed to steal $81m. This has been traced to accounts in the Philippines and to casinos in the same country. Most of the cash has yet to be recovered.
Bank security experts said the bank should have spent more time and money protecting the network for its central bank.
"You are talking about an organisation that has access to billions of dollars and they are not taking even the most basic security precautions," Jeff Wichman, a consultant with cyber firm Optiv, told Reuters.
A View from Islington North, Arts Theatre review 4 A View from Islington North, Arts Theatre review Vinciane Jones
As we gear up for Brexit, politics is dominating more than just headlines. Policies and partisan decision-making take the spotlight on the West End too, as director of Out of Joint theatre company Max Stafford-Clark harks back to the traditional revue show format with an evening of searing satires penned by a selection of our starriest playwrights.
A View From Islington North brings together five short plays on political themes.
In a stream of expletives and a haze of anti-depressants, Mark Ravenhill's The Mother opens the evening with an angry, touching, if occasionally affected, snippet of a story about a woman's attempts to delay the news of their soldier son's death.
Caryl Churchill's Tickets Are Now On Sale is a short, snappy and devious derision of the dangers of sponsorship in art, dissolving to absurdity within five minutes.
Two plays in and not a politician in sight… But inevitably the satire gets increasingly direct.
As the title A View From Islington North refers to Holloway, Jeremy Corbyn's seat and home for over 20 years, it's no surprise that the leader of the opposition echoes, unnamed, through Alistair Beaton's ruefully funny The Accidental Leader. It's sharp in its references to a party divided by a new, somewhat scruffy and rather revolutionary, leader.
Bruce Alexander leads the way as disgruntled, right-leaning back-bencher Jim, whose attempts to organise a coup are threatened by the fired up young ‘Impetus' section of the party (plus their own technological ineptitude). Though Beaton is spot-on with the tones and back-room plotting of petty politicians, references to Tinder dates and ill-fated copulation feel cheesy.
David Hare's Ayn Rand Takes a Stand is the richest intellectually of the satires and also the most on the nose. George Osbourne, sporting a ski tan, has reached out to their hero, Russian philosopher, free market champion and novelist Ayn (not Ann) Rand. The knives really come out when a white-faced home secretary called Teresa ineloquently attempts to explain how we Britons shouldn't have to share our country because we ‘got here first'.
The mockery returns to anonymity with Stella Feehily's depressingly believable How To Get Ahead In Politics. From the old boys' network to the deliberate obtuseness about ‘macho' objectification of women, the whole scenario feels as much hidden camera as astute satire.
Ending on a new song, penned especially for the occasion by Billy Bragg, A View From Islington North leaves you feeling, as satire should, warier about the real world but not devoid of hope.
Leo Villareal is a pioneer in the use of LEDs and computer-driven imagery and known both for their light sculptures and architectural, site-specific works. This exhibition, their first major traveling museum survey, seeks to place Villareal's body of work within the continuum of contemporary art. Born in Albuquerque, NM, in 1967 and raised in El Paso, TX, and in northern Mexico, Villareal began their studies in stage design and art at Yale University, New Haven, CT. They later pursued graduate studies at the Interactive Telecommunications Program at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, NY, and from 1994 to 1997, worked on cutting-edge virtual reality projects at Paul Allen's Interval Research Corporation in Palo Alto, California. In 1994, Villareal first attended the counterculture festival Burning Man, which inspired them to begin creating immersive experiences on a larger scale. In 1997, they programmed a 16-light strobe structure that they brought to Burning Man. Originally conceived as a nighttime wayfinding device using pulsing light, the simple piece was well received and became the precursor to their work in the light medium.
This exhibition and its catalogue explore how Villareal presents a new vision of art that responds and relates to the innovations of the 21st-century, using computer code and new technology as a medium for abstraction.

The bar had posted on its website a promotional video with scantily-clad women wearing cowboy hats dancing on the bar, mixing drinks, and lying down with drinks poured on their navels.
Called Jersey's Saloon, it bills itself as a western-style bar and will open in the spot last occupied by the Maz bar, which closed last year.
Peter McQueen, the councillor for the Notre-Dame-de-Grâce district, denounced the bar's theme.
They said with an elementary school and N.D.G. park nearby, the bar is located in a family-friendly area, so it doesn't fit in with the neighbourhood.
“We have nothing against bars in N.D.G., but the problem is the promotional video shows a kind of bar that's selling sex; we don't feel that kind of bar is right for this family neighbourhood,” McQueen said.
They said he'll bring up the issue at Monday night's meeting of the Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough council. They said anyone who has concerns should come to the council meeting and voice them to pressure the borough to do something about the bar.
“The people of N.D.G. don't want to see a garish sign with a woman on it; they don't want their kids to be able to look inside and be able to see a woman dancing.”
Jersey's Saloon is owned by Sergakis Holdings, which owns several bars including Le Station des Sports on Ste-Catherine St. W. downtown, Le Manoir in Pointe-Claire and two other N.D.G. establishments: PJ's Pub and the Cabaret des Amazones strip club, both on St-Jacques St.
Isabelle Létourneau, who has lived on Melrose Ave. for the last 15 years, said they worry the bar's customers will be loud, and become a nuisance to the families with young children who live in the area.
“This is not the type of activity we want to see on this street,” Létourneau said. “I'm afraid with this new bar, there's another type of clientele that will be here, and they'll be in the parks, and near the school.”
“It's disappointing to see something like this coming here.”
Responding to the criticism, bar owner Peter Sergakis said McQueen is just looking for publicity.
“Don't tell me that video is offensive; it's offensive to whom?” they said of the bar's promotional video posted on Facebook. When it was mentioned that some residents found the video degrading toward women, Sergakis responded with a laugh saying: “You're serious?”
They said the video isn't fully indicative of the type of establishment that will be there.
“I can tell you there will be nothing offensive happening there,” Sergakis said. “Everyone will like the place.”
McQueen said he's hoping the promotional video for the bar is just hype, and that when it opens, the bar will be much more low key.
“If it's just a sports bar, that's OK,” they said. “But that's not what they put in their video.”
The video was taken down from the bar's website and Facebook page on Thursday shortly after it caught the attention of several media outlets including the Montreal Gazette.
Sergakis invited anyone with concerns to come to the bar next Thursday before passing judgment about whether it truly fits in the area.

…That I will take into account for the next one.
Being the Founder and CEO of Vocabulary Notebook for more than 2 years (from September, 2012 to January 2015) was one of the most intense, enriching, stressful and exciting experiences I have ever lived.
During this period I went from doing some mockups alone at home and printing them in paper to use them as low fidelity MVPs for customer discovery; to close a seed funding round, found a company, build a multiplatform product, build a team of 12 people, receive several awards, participate as speaker in 3 international events, get 30 000 users in more than 130 countries, register a trademark, conduct scientific research on our product and collaborate with schools and universities from 4 different countries… As I said before, it was intense!
Sadly, two years after the beginning of this adventure we had not been able to reach the break-even point yet, we had a cost structure that we were not able to maintain and we didn't manage to close another funding round to keep us going (to keep improving the product, launching marketing campaigns, validating new hypotheses, pivoting and improving our business model…). So, by last summer we had to start progressively reducing our cost structure, until we had no option other than shutting our startup down completely.
However, during this amazing period I learned very valuable lessons, some of which I am going to share with you now, if you keep reading:
Validating your hypothesis with the real customer may be very difficult in some B2B models. Being lean with B2B models is usually a lot harder than with B2C models. In our case the toughest part was interviewing the real customer, this is, the person that was actually going to pay for the product. Vocabulary Notebook was intended to be sold to schools. From the beginning we tried to be very lean, so we did customer discovery and tried to validate our hypotheses with students and teachers (our users). We did so, learned from them and pivoted a few times based on their feedback. We made sure both students and teachers found the tool valuable and that teachers considered the pricing solutions acceptable for the school. However, since our goal was to sell the product to schools, we must have been interviewing school directors instead. They are the ones with enough power to make the final decision (paying for the product). All the same, as the CEOs of any other company, they are usually very busy people and it is very difficult to have the chance of arranging a meeting with any of them. What is even worse: if you manage to arrange a meeting with a school director to make a presentation of your product and they find out that what you are just asking them some questions to validate some hypotheses, or that, what you are offering them is still in development phase, they will feel that you are making them waste their time and they will probably ask you to come back later when the product is ready.
“Being Interested” and “paying” are very different. It is important to remember that it is very easy to say “Wow! this looks great, we will definitely use it!” when you are not forced to pay now to prove that you have real interest. In our case, many times when we had meetings with schools, everyone looked excited. Teachers were usually very interested in combining language learning and technology and our product looked just like the right fit for them… But it was always very difficult to close a deal at this stage. Almost always they were telling us that they would have to discuss it in further detail as well as organize themselves for the implantation of the product in the school for the next course (in which they were going to use it for sure…). This is something typical in B2B models: sales cycles are long. For us this meant waiting several months to close the deal, either until the end of the current course or until the very beginning of the next one… And as you can guess, most of the time when the next course arrived, nothing happened. They had been very busy and they had not been able to plan the implantation of our product (but… “we are still very interested! Next year we will include it for sure!”…). After a while we tried to reduce friction by providing them with materials and pilot projects, even offering in-house consultancy to “kick-start” the project in the school… But the point I want to make here is: Customers paying for your product or service is the only real validation of your business model.
Connections are worth more than money. You will need connections in the market in which your target customers are (this is, in which your product is). Seriously, you will need them. This is really important, because as human beings we rely on our connections, either to decide whether to purchase a particular product or to decide if it is worth writing an article about it or not. For instance, if you are building a vocabulary platform which you are intending to sell to schools, you will need to be well connected with schools: you will need to have a good relationship with many school directors, teachers, teacher trainers, specialized researchers in the field, specialized bloggers and/or media, etc. If you don't have those relationships yourself, you better find a partner or employee that has those connections. It is definitely worth it. Those connections will bring you money, it may be in the form of specialized investors, by saving money in expensive ad campaigns or, what is even better, in the form of important paying customers or early adopters that you wouldn't have been able to reach otherwise.
You will need money for marketing. This is very related to the previous point. Selling is very hard. And very expensive. This is especially important for founders with a tech background. It may seem to you that you can build the next great app in a garage on your own (or with a few friends), with no funding at all and without marketing & sales teams. You may think that all you have to do is to build the right product and suddenly… it will go viral all alone and you will get rich! Well… Honestly, that is extremely rare, even if you have a great product. It is so rare that probably most of the cases you think went viral all alone had actually a team that planned carefully their marketing campaigns and invested a lot of money and/or talent on them, even if it doesn't look like that. A good example of this may be crowdfunding, and particularly, Kickstarter. Nowadays, many of the companies having successful Kickstarter campaigns have already been backed with investment before (even millions). These companies are using Kickstarter as a marketing tool, which provides more visibility and more customers (either directly or indirectly). Companies are investing a lot in those campaigns to make them go viral (design, content, videos, pricing strategy, advertisement…). It is not just about creating a great product, it is about making many people believe your product is great. And that is expensive.
Make sure you get enough rest. Building a company is not a sprint, it is a marathon. It is easy to get too involved, to work almost every minute of the day, long hours, weekends, to keep thinking in your business even when you are having lunch with family or friends, or even when you are watching a film with your girl… But if you work too hard for too long you may burn out and then everything will fall apart. Many entrepreneurs have been there before. Make sure you disconnect and have quality rest every now and then. Set some spare time apart and do some exercise. Do it for your own health and personal life. Once you start doing it you will realize that it also helps your startup a lot. Since you will feel better, you will have more energy, bring new ideas and be more productive at work.
Analytics are crucial. If you haven't heard about KPIs, web analytics or A/B testing yet, it is time to work on it. When you are a startup founder and you get some traction you end up realizing that you want to measure everything. Not a lot of things. Everything. Where do the users come from? How many of them came through the last tweet we posted? How much time do visitors that come from the sponsored post in xxx spend in our site on average? If I change the sign-up button background to green, will it increase conversions? How much is the cost of acquisition of my users through Google Ads? …And what is the lifetime-value of those users? Everything is important. Data is a key element in a startup. You need to make decisions based on data, otherwise you are guessing and guessing can lead you to lose a lot of money. Remember, it is not what we like or how do we behave using our product, it is all about how our users and customers do. Avoid opinion-based strategy meetings with your team. As Jim Barksdale (CEO of Netscape) once said: “If we have data, let's look at data. If all we have are opinions, let's go with mine”. Let's focus on having data!
Remember what your role should be. When your startup starts running it is very easy to be overwhelmed. Specially if you are a solo founder or if it is your first time in the startup world. At some point things start to get mad: your product starts generating some revenue, customers start to ask for bugfixes or new features; you start going to several startup events (which sometimes are just a waste of time, to be honest); you start having too many meetings… You have to hire new people, coordinate a bigger team… And at the same time you try to keep in touch with investors and customers, try to close further funding rounds and deals… With all that chaos it is very easy to lose focus on the most important things of your startup: developing your business, validating your hypotheses, analysing the performance of your product, reviewing your KPIs, doing some A/B testing, reviewing customer feedback, making strategic decisions… Remember what your role should be.
Be sure to build the right team. Very related to the previous point. It is crucial to have talented people with different skills in your team, so you can delegate different areas, such as administration, finance, software engineering, product management, marketing or sales. Sometimes, especially with tech founders, we tend to underestimate other areas rather than product development, or some of us tend to do everything. And it may be the case that you can also be skilled in other areas, but the reality is that there is too much work to do and you can't do it all. Moreover, there is always work that you like and work that you don't, and you tend to work on what you like, even unconsciously. In my case I always tended to focus either on product development, user experience, analytics or business strategy; but always tried to avoid paperwork. Sadly, I didn't have anyone in the team to delegate paperwork tasks and it ended up being a significant part of my daily workload, preventing me from doing the other things I really liked.
Be careful with side projects. We always tend to underestimate the cost of losing time. For instance, when you don't have enough funding to be 100% focused on your product, it may be tempting to start doing other side projects for your company to “survive”, until somehow we hit the hockey stick with the product and can focus totally on it. Paradoxically, by doing that you may be killing your startup, since you may start devoting too much time to those side projects, having meetings with those “side customers”, paying less attention to the users of your product (because money comes from the side projects)… It is a risky solution and most of the time you will end up losing focus on your product and becoming a zombie startup. Be very careful with side projects.
In the video, we see the man in a red T-shirt defend themselves logically by saying, “It was available in the market. It's okay to sell it, but not wear it?” But of course their logic fell on deaf ears.
“The presence of the police officers made it difficult for regular people to jump in and help the guy. People wondered if they really had done something wrong. Was it theft or eve-teasing, when all they did was wear a T-shirt?” Agrawal explained when The Quint reached out to them
When the man resigned and turned to leave the premises, the police officers called them back to take pictures of them for evidence!
“That's when me and my friends, along with some other bystanders raised voices and asked what was so wrong about wearing a T-shirt and what law they were flouting by being in a public place in that garment,” Agrawal shared.
Agrawal also reached out to Bengaluru Police via Twitter.

Commentary
By Gary Wilson
Are we at a choice point when it comes to restoring the Great Lakes and the region?
Here's what I mean.
Remember the S.S. Badger?
That's the coal-fired passenger ferry that shuttles people between Wisconsin and Michigan. It emits nearly four tons of toxic coal ash into Lake Michigan with every trip. It has been under an Environmental Protection Agency order since 2008 to fix its pollution problem by 2012. How much progress has it made? None.
Now comes legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives that would exempt the antique Badger from those pesky enviro regulations by making it a historical landmark. If successful, the coal ash spewing could go on as long as the old Badger stays afloat.
At the same time in greater Chicago there is the barge and chemical industry coalition that operates under the name Unlock Our Jobs. Its goal is to maintain the status quo of the 19th century Chicago Area Waterways System. As the primary vector for Asian Carp, the system is under intense scrutiny with serious moves afoot that could change the way goods are moved between the Mississippi River and Lake Michigan.
Toss in more environmental backsliding in Wisconsin, building new coal-fired power plants in Michigan and legislation in the U.S. House to relax ballast water regulations, and a pattern becomes apparent.
There are significant constituencies in this region who refuse to let go of the old technology and ways of commerce.
Looking forward in Detroit
Contrast that with what happened in Detroit in mid-October during Great Lakes Week.
A thousand government officials, environmentalists and engaged citizens gathered for a conference focused on moving the region forward.
The emphasis was on cleaning up our messes, finding new ways to deal with old problems and generally taking a forward-looking approach to restoring the Great Lakes, and as a byproduct, the region's economy.
Yeah, the “mega-conference” consisted of standard conference fare. And it was a pep rally with big names like former vice-president Al Gore giving what was essentially a speech to energize the restoration base.
There are problems with the restoration process especially related to its focus. But as imperfect as it is, good things are happening and progress is being made.
Divergent paths
Why the two points of view?
One looks back and wants to maintain the status quo. The other is forward looking trying to effect change.
At almost every turn the folks who cling to coal, weaken environmental protections and retain outdated transportation modes say it's to protect or create jobs.
That's proof that the once-waning jobs versus the environment conundrum is alive and well in the Rust Belt.
I don't know how this tug of war will play out.
But outside the Great Lakes region we're still seen as deserving of that Rust Belt label. And weakening environmental protections and clinging to coal ash spewing artifacts like the Badger do nothing to dispel that image.
Embracing lofty endeavors like Great Lakes restoration, as imperfect as it is, and throwing off the tired yokes of the past, like coal, mean that we're at least headed in the right direction.
For the past few years the Great Lakes region has been trying to move toward a brighter environmental and economic future. But it's having trouble getting up to speed.
Until we're willing to let go of those relics from the past, we're not going very far.

Sponsorship: The Great Unknown
There's no training required to become a sponsor in AA—and that means people still getting their bearings can end up working with those who may not have any themselves. What's a newcomer to do?
A leap of faith—but you're not alone. Thinkstock
Just about the first thing you hear in AA is that you need a sponsor. Less prevalent are the warnings about the sponsors to stay away from. Newcomers are encouraged to choose someone they respect and who “has what they want” but that's often all they're told and this lack of guidance can bring unfortunate and occasionally deadly results. Sponsorship is intended to be two alcoholics or addicts talking to each other—one walking the other through the steps. The fact that many addicts and alcoholics use their sponsors for romantic, financial, and employment advice reflects on the poor boundaries of most addicts rather than the purpose of sponsorship—for sober people to help each other stay sober.
AA's Questions and Answers on Sponsorship pamphlet offers very specific guidance to the person seeking a sponsor, including the admonition that “a good sponsor should probably be a year or more away from the drink” and should be someone “using the AA program successfully in everyday life.” And to those wanting to sponsor, the pamphlet offers a list of dos and don'ts—including refraining from pressing personal opinions on the sponsee, not taking the newcomer's inventory, offering professional services, or pretending to be right all time. Despite the guidance offered in the literature, however, not everyone gets it right.
Sarah, a 67-year-old retired social worker, first looked for a sponsor during their first few months. Now 27 years sober, Sarah recalls picking a woman named Lynne because of their warmth and willingness to take Sarah under their wing. “She took over my life and bossed me around,” Sarah recalls. “I was so screwed up in early sobriety that at first that was okay.” But after a few months, the disturbing lack of boundaries in the relationship began to bother them When Lynne asked them to move in so they could “mother her,” Sarah began to feel like something inappropriate was going on. Later, Sarah found Lynne parked in front of their house watching them “In retrospect, I'm pretty sure Lynne hadn't worked the steps herself,” Sarah says, “though they really did help me find meetings in the beginning.” Unfortunately for most of us, even the most questionable sponsorship practices can be sprinkled here and there with real help and wisdom, which can make things confusing—especially for newcomers.
Where it gets tricky is when a sponsor oversteps and starts giving advice on outside issues. People often confuse their sponsor with someone who is an expert.
For those with more sobriety, identifying red flags in the sponsorship relationship is easier. When they were 15 years sober, Marty, a 50-year-old retiree from Bellingham, Washington who now has 21 years, moved from California to Washington state and began “shopping for a sponsor.” They attended several meetings and listened to women in the program who appeared to be practicing AA in their lives. At coffee with a potential sponsor, Marty had an intuition that something wasn't quite right. “I had a bad feeling,” Marty recalls, “especially when they told me I should call only them if I had a problem and not ever call other women in the program.” Marty quietly concluded their coffee meeting, let the potential sponsor know she'd be looking elsewhere for help and, a month later, asked another woman to sponsor them “I've been working with them for over a decade and she's very gentle,” Marty says. “Very loving and focused on the Big Book, but they don't try and force me to do things their way.”
Forcing newcomers to subscribe to a sponsor's way of thinking can have disastrous results. “After my first sponsor relapsed,” says Amelia, a 30-something publicist who's 10 years sober, “I asked a woman with 20 years to be my sponsor. They seemed to have what I wanted: they were in the same field as me and said they were happily married with kids. I was too new to understand that they were in the Pacific Group, which promotes the idea that sober people shouldn't take anti-depressants. They told me I had to go off of them if I wanted them to sponsor me so I tried—and became so depressed that I almost relapsed. Later I found out that they were having an affair with their [male] sponsor and their husband was leaving her.” While Amelia now has a “wonderful, loving and most of all not controlling sponsor,” she's been through many more over time. “There was the one who made me spend $500 to go to their past life therapist, the one who liked to massage me while I read from the Big Book, the one who would only listen to my fourth step over the phone while they were on the Stairmaster, and the one who put me on ‘dating restriction' until they decided I was ready to date and then ‘fired' me when I kissed a boy 10 months later,” they say with a chuckle. “I think my picker was broken for a good long time.”
This inability to stay within the bounds of the AA program is one of the signs of a not-so-great sponsor, according to Dr. Ingrid Matheiu, an LA-based psychotherapist and the author of Recovering Spirituality: Achieving Emotional Sobriety in Your Spiritual Practice. A sponsor who insists on a rigid observance of certain prayers and procedures might, without meaning to, interfere with a person's ability to run their or their own recovery. “Where it gets tricky is when a sponsor oversteps and starts giving advice on outside issues,” Matheiu says. “People often confuse their sponsor with someone who is an expert.” Even if the sponsor isn't putting themselves forward as an expert, some people in recovery confer a kind of Higher Power status onto their sponsor, thus robbing themselves of the one of the best gifts of AA: two alcoholics sharing their experience, strength, and hope together.
Nina, a 35-year-old student who's four years sober, found just such a relationship. When they first entered the program, Nina looked for someone who “sounded like they knew what they were talking about.” Luckily for Nina, their very first sponsor choice was a good one. They describe their sponsor-sponsee relationship as loving and supportive, adding that their sponsor is very clear about their role. “If I ask their advice about something, they never ever tells me the right answer,” Nina says. “She reminds me that I'm going to do what I do and that it's not up to them to make my decisions for me.” This approach, to suggest rather than order or give assignments, is in line with the AA literature.
Which is why when someone asks Liz, a 53-year-old retiree who's 18 years sober, if she'll sponsor them, they first ask them to sit with them and read the AA pamphlet on sponsorship. They always try to keep in mind what their sponsor told their years ago: “It's my job to hold the light on you while you dig.” In other words, the person being sponsored does the heavy lifting—personal inventory, step work, and service—while the sponsor is there to help and guide. As the AA pamphlet concludes, this way, “the newcomer learns to rely on the AA program, not the sponsor.”

We now return you to your regularly scheduled programming.
Summer League was helpful for players and teams. Summer League was occasionally insightful for anyone wanting a gauge on young talent and the chances of an immediate impact. But the summer-league schedule that ended Monday night was not the real world. It never is, because the opportunities for prospects in Orlando, Salt Lake City and Las Vegas will often evaporate on Day 1 of training camp, when the prospects, after picking on someone their own size in July, are suddenly facing NBA competition.
Jarnell Stokes, for example, finished second on the 2014 Summer League Ladder, but obviously was not going to find many minutes come opening night on the same Memphis roster as Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol.
The July 21, 2014, wrap-up top 10 from Orlando and Vegas, before the return of Salt Lake City in 2015, was Nerlens Noel, Stokes, T.J. Warren, Doug McDermott, James Ennis, Jordan Adams, Jordan McRae, Elfrid Payton, Jabari Parker and Russ Smith, and very few had any sizeable impact in the regular season.
More specifically, Noel, Parker, Payton, McDermott and Ennis were the only ones on the Oct. 29, 2014, Ladder as the setup to 2014-15, and Noel and Payton were the lone survivors through to the April 15, 2015, final posting. (Parker's start signaled they would have had a good chance if not for the season-ending knee injury in December, and Nikola Mirotic was not ranked a year ago because they did not play for the Bulls in Summer League, before opening the season at No. 6 and finishing at No. 4.)
So while the Rookie Ladder of July is based on actual play, it does not necessarily translate into a spot in the rankings that will come out just before the start of the 2015-16 schedule. It goes the other way too -- some newcomers who underwhelmed in recent weeks may still make the September Top 10 because opportunity will meet the potential to make an immediate impact. We're looking at you, Emmanuel Mudiay.
That makes the look-ahead a very, very rough sketch. But based on rosters of the moment and the performances of summer, and while understanding what just happened can mean a grand total of nothing in the regular season, the early line on the 2015-16 Ladder that will track the Rookie of the Year race with weekly updates looks something like:
1. Stanley Johnson, Pistons.
2. Mudiay, Nuggets.
3. Jahlil Okafor, 76ers.
4. Myles Turner, Pacers.
5. Karl-Anthony Towns, Timberwolves.
6. Mario Hezonja, Magic.
7. D'Angelo Russell, Lakers.
8. Frank Kaminsky, Hornets.
9. Willie Cauley-Stein, Kings.
10. Kristaps Porzingis, Knicks.
With many more to watch, obviously. Justin Anderson in Dallas, the Knicks with Jerian Grant, Norman Powell with the Raptors, Justise Winslow in Miami and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson of the Nets will all be strong possibility early, with others who will surely surprise and push their way into consideration.
For the Summer League rankings based on actual play, not potential, for one last time:
1. Stanley Johnson, Pistons (Previous ranking: 1)
Postgame: Stanley Johnson joins Dennis and Vince following their double-double in the win over the Pacers.
Johnson locked up No. 1 without ever being threatened by the Las Vegas crowd. Their underwhelming finale in Orlando of 10 points on three-of-10 shooting does not diminish the positives of a very good summer league. Johnson scored at least 13 points the first four games and was at 17.8 points and 7.5 rebounds while shooting 64.3 percent, including four of nine (44.4 percent) on threes, before the final day. They also had three steals in two of the outings and two in another.
2. Myles Turner, Pacers (2)
Turner's life has changed dramatically since the draft with Roy Hibbert being traded and David West leaving as a free agent, combining to create a greater immediate chance for the No. 11 pick. Averaging 18.7 points and 8.3 rebounds while shooting 60.5 percent in three appearances in Orlando was a nice move to show they deserved the opportunity.
3. Frank Kaminsky, Hornets (3)
Nets vs. Hornets Frank Kaminsky scored 19 points and grabbed six rebounds and Aaron Harrison added 15 points as Charlotte earned an 82-73 victory over Brooklyn.
Charlotte wanted a three-point threat to address what has been an obvious need for years? The college Player of the Year was gone seven of 18 behind the arc in Orlando. Showing a well-rounded game, Kaminsky also contributed six, seven, six, eight and 12 rebounds, topped by the 19 points and 12 boards in the July 4 opener against Oklahoma City.
4. Branden Dawson, Clippers (4)
Windmill to Putback-Dunk Branden Dawson of the Los Angeles Clippers goes on the fast break and delivers a massive windmill dunk, on the following play Tekele Cotton of the Oklahoma City Thunder boosts up for the put-back slam!
The No. 56 pick, huh? The former Michigan State standout, officially selected by the New Orleans Pelicans but immediately dealt to Los Angeles, used the first four games in Central Florida as a response to most front offices. Dawson had three double-doubles and in all averaged 12.3 points and 10.3 rebounds in 25.5 minutes while shooting 52.2 percent (although 33.3 from the line). They signed a two-year contract Wednesday, with the first season guaranteed.
5. Joe Young, Pacers (5)
Joe Young Postgame Pacers guard Joe Young talks postgame after scoring 28 points against the Magic's Blue squad.
The No. 43 pick was the early scoring star of summer, getting just nine points in their Indiana debut in Orlando before moving to the forefront with 25, 28 and 28 the next three games. Young was a combined 29 of 55 from the field (52.7 percent) the last three, including nine of 17 (52.9) behind the arc. It's the offensive punch a lot of teams envisioned while concerned about the transition to point guard, concerns that didn't go away with 13 assists against 11 turnovers in all.
6. Jordan Mickey, Celtics (6)
Mickey Rejects Kazemi Jordan Mickey makes the sick chase down block on Arsalan Kazemi.
Their last five games have been 13 points and 11 rebounds in 31 minutes Thursday, 11 rebounds in 25 minutes, nine points and nine rebounds in 22 minutes, 15 points, 10 rebounds and three blocks in 30 minutes and 16 points, 11 rebounds and four blocks in 31 minutes. Not merely one of the best players in Las Vegas, Mickey has been one of the few consistent with any experience.
7. Dakari Johnson, Thunder (7)
Call it an encouraging start to what could be a long process. Johnson does not figure to have a prominent role in Oklahoma City in the regular season -- although maybe on the OKC D-League team -- but 11, 10, six and 11 rebounds in Orlando while playing more than 27 minutes just once is a much-needed parachute after the former big-time prospect dropped all the way to No. 48 in the draft.
8. Alan Williams, Rockets (9)
Some people move into the rankings. Williams crashed the Ladder with the ferocity of someone looking to make a lot of teams sorry for passing on the bruising power forward in the draft. The 22 points and 22 rebounds Friday against the 76ers would have been enough to draw attention as arguably the best game at any of the three sites, except that it was also the latest in a string of standout performances. The three previous outings in Las Vegas were 17 points and eight rebounds, 16 and eight, and 27 and 10.
9. Jahlil Okafor, 76ers (8)
First Impressions of Jahlil Okafor Jahlil Okafor discusses their first games in a Sixers uniform while their coach and fans weigh in on the rookie's on-court performance.
They flashed some very good post moves Tuesday against the Knicks, but still finished eight of 18 from the field. Any shot beyond six or eight feet remains an adventure, though. And they got blocked five times, three courtesy Kristaps Porzingis. Okafor's 19 points, 11 rebounds and two blocks Saturday against the Lakers was one of the best game for any rookie outside Orlando, and they are doing good work on the boards. The rebounding, with at least nine boards in three of five appearances, has become the key to staying in the rankings.
10. Norman Powell, Raptors (10)
Powell was not at their best Thursday, making just five of 14 shots, but they have been one of the best rookies in Las Vegas. The 15 points against Bulls came after the No. 46 pick had scored 19, 19 and 20 points the three previous appearances while shooting 59.5 percent. They also had seven rebounds in one game and five in another at the off guard.

Lawsuit: Former court clerk was forced by Texas judge into sex acts while they wore judicial robe
A former court clerk alleges in a federal lawsuit that Tarrant County Justice of the Peace Russ Casey forced them into sexual acts during work hours in the courthouse office from 2009 to 2014, sometimes while they wore their judicial robes. less A former court clerk alleges in a federal lawsuit that Tarrant County Justice of the Peace Russ Casey forced them into sexual acts during work hours in the courthouse office from 2009 to 2014, sometimes while they ... more Image 1 of / 38 Caption Close Lawsuit: Former court clerk was forced by Texas judge into sex acts while they wore judicial robe 1 / 38 Back to Gallery
A former court clerk alleges a North Texas judge sexually harassed them and repeatedly forced them to perform oral sex on them over a five-year period.
And, they say they have the semen-stained dress and blouse to prove it.
Martha Kibler, the clerk, alleges in a federal lawsuit that Tarrant County Justice of the Peace Russ Casey forced them into sexual acts during work hours in the courthouse office from 2009 to 2014, sometimes while they wore their judicial robes.
Casey denied the allegations and told CBS 11, "There were some accusations made months ago and they were even proven to be false. Other than that, I'll have to refer you to the attorney."

Kibler, who has worked as a county employee for 22 years, began working for the court in 2007, the lawsuit states.
About two years later, they entered their office to repay a personal loan.
"Judge Casey informed Kibler that they were not interested in their money and instead they grabbed their penis and told Kibler to perform oral sex," the lawsuit alleges.
"After Kibler said 'no' and that they could not do that for Judge Casey, Judge Casey responded that they were good to her, had loaned their money and kept them employed and thus they had better return the favor. Kibler complied and performed oral sex on Judge Casey," according to the lawsuit.
Casey then routinely coerced Kibler into sexual acts, which twice included intercourse, and threatened to fire them if they refused, the lawsuit says.
Kibler once tried to refuse Casey's coercion in December 2013 after their son died, according to the lawsuit, telling Casey that "she felt like their son was watching from heaven." Casey then allegedly threatened to fire them if they didn't oblige him.

Kibler complained twice to the county's human resources department, who said they could do nothing about Casey's alleged behavior because they are an elected official.
"As proof, Kibler also provided Tarrant County with a dress and blouse they owned which possessed Judge Casey's dried semen," the lawsuit alleges.
Casey fired Kibler in August 2014 after they refused to perform sexual acts on him, but accused them of stealing money from the court, the suit claims.
Kibler went to the county's human resources department, who placed them on paid administrative leave before moving them to another department altogether.
County employees had promised Kibler that they would investigate Casey but never did, according to the lawsuit.
NBC Dallas Fort-Worth reported that an audit of Casey's office conducted in November revealed that Casey's account did not always receive deposits in a timely fashion. It also showed that financial information at the office wasn't regularly recorded properly.
"It appears that the employee was making a series of personal loans from the cash deposits by failing to actually deposit the money daily," Casey said. They did not name the employee.
WFAA reported Thursday that a grand jury had previously declined to indict Casey on a criminal charge of official oppression by sexual harassment following an investigation by the Hurst Police Department last November.

The White House on Friday blocked several major media organizations, including The New York Times, CNN and The Huffington Post, from attending an off-camera press briefing, held in lieu of the daily televised news conference.
And CNN anchor Jake Tapper did not take the unprecedented move lightly.
Before their report on President Donald Trump's speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Tapper took some time on CNN's “The Lead” to break down why it's such a problem that the White House barred certain media.
“Let's not make any mistake about what's happening here,” Tapper said.
“It's not acceptable. In fact, it's petulant,” they continued. They suggested the White House has difficulty telling the truth and referenced Trump calling the press the “enemy of the American people.”
Tapper then used White House press secretary Sean Spicer's own words against him, cutting to a 2016 quote from Spicer promising that the White House wouldn't ban media from government access.
“I think that's what makes a democracy versus a dictatorship,” Spicer said in December.
Then, Tapper boiled it all down to the Trump administration's values.
“The White House does not seem to respect the idea of accountability. This White House does not seem to value an independent press,” they said.
“There is a word for that line of thinking,” Tapper concluded. “The word is un-American.”
Watch Tapper's message below.
In a JIT supply chain, reliable suppliers will reduce supply uncertainty and make the supply chain more effective, therefore supplier selection is crucial. However, Purchasing in JIT environment is different and therefore it requires a slightly different mindset for selecting suppliers who can survive in JIT Supply Chain long term. Researchers1 suggested that the selection and evaluation of supplier's ability to delivery in JIT Supply Chain should be based upon the following factors:
JIT Supply Chain- Quantitative & Qualitative Supplier Selection Factors
1. Delivery of a Quality Product
2. Delivery On-Time.
3. Frequent Deliveries.
4. Delivery in Small Quantities.
5. Delivery of Exact Quantities.
6. Supplier's Management Policy and Philosophy
7. A Willingness and Openness to Share Data and Information
8. Attitude towards Partnership
9. Willingness to Undertake Continuous Improvement
10. Desire to Develop New Products
11. Ease of Communication at All Levels
Hall (1983) suggested capacity and willingness to improve as additional criteria to the above list.
Carr and Truesdale (1992) stated that Nissan's supplier selection team visits supplier factories frequently. They evaluate delivery reliability similar to those above. They evaluate products from design and development through to the manufacturing processes.
The Nissan team also looked at planning, operation, tidiness, appearance of workshop, working situation and professionalism. For professionalism they looked at engineering management attitude, the number of engineers employed, how they are structured, their technical capability and their influence within the organisation. Supplier's location and market size is of less importance to Nissan.
Aleo (1992) described the supplier selection procedures of Kodak. A selection team is formed by Kodak consisting of multi-discipline specialists. They developed a suitable decision matrix for the particular product under the evaluation. The suppliers are ranked numerically according to their ability to meet Kodak's programmed needs.
The selection process started with a review of current documentation pertaining to their suppliers. A comparison of supplier capabilities is then recorded in the decision matrix. The team review all historical data, quality, delivery and inspection procedures. Kodak maintained an open communication with its suppliers in the area of quality improvement and advised suppliers who failed to achieve the expected quality standards. A follow-up inspection is undertaken to ensure that the agreed changes have been carried out.
Southey (1993) described the current practices of supplier appraisal as more encompassing than before. The appraisal can be divided into two areas namely quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative includes location, financial position, facilities and capacities, technical capability and standards of quality, whereas Qualitative consists of items 6-11 in list above.
Southey (1993) also suggested other general evaluation criteria when there are numerous suppliers, for example, comparison with the level and quality of similar suppliers, supplier's relationship with competitors, supplier's track record and potential for future improvements to sustain JIT Supply Chain.
In JIT Supply Chain, ‘Lean supply' requires additional supplier selection criteria. Particularly in the sense of sourcing parts close to the points of manufacture so as to keep logistic cost to a minimum. The supplier must be ready to provide a service ‘locally' wherever the manufacturer requires it in the world. As lean production develops globally, manufacturers tend to find local suppliers prepared to compete to improve leanness.
Summary:
There has been huge amount of research done to identify suitable supplier selection criteria. The above mentioned 11 quantitative and qualitative factors are just one aspect which has been identified with keeping JIT Supply Chain only in mind.
Please do comment if you have noticed more factors to establish JIT Supply Chain.

Donald Trump has been under fire this week after they told Meet the Press that they witnessed Muslims in Manhattan and Jersey City, New Jersey celebrating the deadly 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center.
Asked to apologize, Trump fired back! “I saw it. So many people saw it. And, so, why would I take it back? I'm not going to take it back.”
Since the interview happened, Trump also noted in a telephone interview on NBC that they received an “unbelievable response” from countless Americans who also saw televised video of Muslims celebrating the 9/11 attacks immediately after the plane hit.
Now, Former New York Police Department Commissioner Bernard Kerik has vindicated Trump in their claims, noting that there were many post-9/11 celebrations by NYC-area Muslims.
As One American News reports, Trump was right! (WATCH)
And there is plenty of video of Muslims cheering and celebrating the deaths of thousands of innocent people on 9/11/2001. This is an example of the evil we still face in America:
This is why the political establishment can't stand Trump… He's willing to speak the truth about Islam and terrorism, even if it's not “politically correct.”

There was a time when Germany's power was mostly generated by the traditional sources of coal, nuclear, oil, natural gas and hydro. These sources were reliable and keeping the power grid under control was a routine matter. Germany's power grid was among the most stable worldwide. But then came Germany's renewable energy feed-in act, and with it the very volatile sources of sun and wind.
As a result, today's German power grid has become a precarious balancing act, and keeping it from collapsing under the load of wild fluctuations has become a real challenge. At the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) here, Dr. Klaus Peter Krause writes a piece titled: Always on the brink of a widespread blackout, where they write how and why Germany's power grid has become extremely vulnerable:
Already 3500 emergency grid interventions per year – According to the TAB report of 2011: More than a couple days of blackout would be a national catastrophe – Germany sacrifices its uniquely reliable power supply for the ‘transition to renewable energy'.”
One example Krause cites is a recent incident at the Trimet aluminum plant in the industrial city of Essen:
In the last 12 months the German power grid barely averted a collapse twice by shutting down production. The Westfälische Rundschau (here) on 17 September quoted Trimet Chairman Martin Iffert: ‘We are prepared that something like that would happen as a consequence of the transition to renewable energy, however we were surprised that we had to slam on the brakes already two times.' According to Iffert the power grid had been on the ‘brink of collapse' shortly after a drop in wind energy.”
Krause writes that the frequency of emergency grid intervention by grid operators has skyrocketed since renewable energies started coming online, see the chart here depicting the number of times emergency interventions in the German power grid have been taken each year. Before 2006 grid operators rarely had to take action to keep the grid stable. The number of interventions took off in 2008, and has since spiraled uncontrollably.
Krause writes:
Thus the power supply in Germany is no longer secure enough. It is even highly vulnerable. A blackout could occur on any given day. Up to now they have been successful at averting grid collapses by taking lightning speed action, but the number of emergencies has increased massively and is still rising.”
The instability of the German power grid was even confirmed by Jochen Homann, President of the Bundesnetzagentur, as quoted by German national daily FAZ on 25 June 2014:
Due to the shutdown of the nuclear power plants [in the wake of Fukushima] and the installation of renewable energy generation, the existing power grid is however under considerably more stress. The transmission network operators, who are responsible for the functioning grid operation, must intervene in the use of the grid far more often in order to ensure the stable operation of the grid.”
Krause then explains that the power-consumer protection agency NAEB wrote in a recent member newsletter of volatile power, and how Germany had once acted as a pillar of stability for the overall European-wide power network. “This stability is being sacrificed for no urgent reason and irresponsibly for the sake of the transition to renewable energy, whereby the damage will impact even all of Europe.”
Just how serious the implications of Germany's unstable power grid are is poignantly described by a German government-commissioned report (TAB, no. 17/5672) of 27 April 2011, where the chance of a massive blackout can no longer be excluded. The summary of the report writes:
Because of the complete proliferation of electrically powered devices in the living and working world, the consequences of a widespread and long-lasting power outage would accumulate to a level of damage of considerable quality. Impacted would be critical infrastructure, and a collapse of the entire society would hardly be preventable.“
Krause writes that just how precarious the situation has become is almost unknown to citizens, and so many are ill-prepared.
They add that even a power outage of even several hours or a day would cause massive disruptions and paralyze the public transportation of persons and goods, stranding tens of thousands, and blocking fire and medical rescue services, especially in urban areas. Gas stations would be out of order and fuel would thus be lacking. And because of today's just-in-time supply chains, food at supermarkets would disappear very quickly.
Granted, Krause writes, that the chances of a big blackout are small, but warns the chances are growing and becoming a real threat. “Because of the ‘increase in decentralized and stochiastic power feed-in', the risk of a grid failure and higher outage rates in on the rise. Here wind and solar energy are meant“.
Moreover, experts say that the German power grid is more vulnerable than ever to storms, snow, ice, criminal activity, terrorism, or just plain human error. All the vulnerability is due to a recklessly applied disorganized renewable energy policy. Krause summarizes:
Germany, like all modern industrial countries is highly vulnerable to possible power outages. But with its energy policy, Germany's leadership is increasing the risk, without any urgent reason, in a wanton irresponsible manner.”
Finally, Steffen Hentrich, of the Liberalen Institute of the Friedrich-Naumann Foundation for Liberty wrote one year ago (here):
It's no longer a secret that the almost unbridled expansion of so-called renewable energies in the context of a technically and economically overloaded power grid will become a risk for the power supply stability in Germany, and increasingly for our European neighbors.”
Thanks to a cracking debut in Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice, moviegoers have already been acquainted with Gal Gadot's Amazonian Warrior. Indeed, the cameo role – however small – was considered by many to be one of the few highlights to be pulled from Zack Snyder's divisive tentpole, which positions Wonder Woman quite nicely for their long-anticipated 2017 solo outing.
Headed up by director Patty Jenkins, it's the next film to be released under Warner's DC Extended Universe and the final picture before that all-important Justice League movie. No pressure, then. But if Gal Gadot is feeling the heat, they aren't showing it.

Sitting down with We Got This Covered to chat about their role in Keeping Up with the Joneses, Greg Mottola's starry actioner, Gadot took some time to speak about their upcoming turn donning the Lasso of Truth. And so, when asked about the tone of Wonder Woman and how it compares to previous entries in the DC Extended Universe – Dawn of Justice in particular – Gadot replied as so:
“Wonder Woman is different. On this film, we went back to Diana's backstory – to their history, them coming of age. How did Diana become Wonder Woman? But with this character, what I love about them so much is that their agenda is love. It's not about fighting, it's not about who is stronger than whom; it's not about women versus men. It's about love, and acceptance of others. They stand for love, justice and compassion.”
Wonder Woman will release in theaters on June 2, 2017 when Gadot will be flanked by Chris Pine, Connie Nielsen, Robin Wright, David Thewlis, Danny Huston and Elena Anaya. As for Keeping Up with the Joneses, following its UK release back in April, those in the US can expect the action comedy to hit their shores on October 21.
Forward Travis Outlaw has agreed to a five-year, $35 million deal with the New Jersey Nets, their agent, Bill Duffy, told ESPN The Magazine's Ric Bucher.
The 25-year-old Outlaw averaged 8.7 points and 3.6 rebounds in 23 games for the Los Angeles Clippers after being acquired as part of a trade that sent Marcus Camby to the Portland Trail Blazers. In 11 games for Portland last season, Outlaw averaged 9.9 points and 3.5 rebounds.
Drafted in the first round by Portland in 2003, Outlaw has averaged 9.5 points and 3.4 rebounds in seven NBA seasons. Their best season was in 2007-08, when they averaged 13.3 points and 4.6 rebounds.
The agreement was the Nets' first since free agency started last week, and it's not even close to being one that would excite New Jersey fans after winning just 12 games last season.
The wish list for new owner Mikhail Prokhorov and outgoing president and general manager Rod Thorn included LeBron James, Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade with Rudy Gay heading the fallback position.
Gay has re-signed with Memphis. Wade stayed in Miami, and Bosh is joining them there.
All that is left among the franchise players is James, and the Nets aren't the favorite to get the two-time MVP when they announce their future plans on television Thursday night.
The Nets also courted Utah forward Carlos Boozer but were outbid by the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday.
That left the Nets with $30 million to spend on free agents, and they started spending it by getting Outlaw to come to New Jersey.
"We are very pleased to add Travis to our roster," said Thorn, who reportedly will be stepping down July 15. "He is a young, athletic player who will fit in very well with the style of play that [coach] Avery [Johnson] has installed."
After agreeing to a deal with Outlaw, the Nets are strongly considering making an offer to either Tyrus Thomas or Luis Scola to fill their hole at the power forward position, sources told ESPN.com's Chad Ford.
Both Thomas and Scola are restricted free agents, which means the Charlotte Bobcats and Houston Rockets, respectively, can match any offer.

With eco-friendly innovations so in demand, it's no surprise that the green tech industry is booming. Intrepid inventors all over the world are putting their best efforts into creating the greenest gadgets, furniture, fuel, fashion and architecture, and some of the stuff they've dreamed up is downright weird technology. Here are 15 examples of bizarre green technology innovations, from solar powered ‘personal massagers' to walking houses.
Speakers with Built-in Planters
Electronics manufacturer JVC debuted a rather interesting new concept in home audio equipment at the 2008 Tokyo Designer's Week. The speakers, made of eco-plastic (whatever that means – they didn't explain) have little planters built into them for people who are really going for that organic look in their home décor. The modular speakers can be assembled into various shapes and are said to have a surprisingly high quality sound for the size and design. The conceptual series is called “Kirikabu”.
Grow Your Own Grass Furniture
London-based contemporary design firm Purves & Purves offered a flat-pack DIY cardboard armchair frame along with a package of grass seeds in the summer of 2006, promising outdoor furniture that blends in perfectly with your lawn. You assemble the 14 pieces, fill it with soil, sprinkle the grass seeds over it and watch your new Chia Chair grow right before your eyes. Interesting idea, but mowing it could be a challenge.
Solar-Powered ‘Personal Massager'
Here's a solar-powered gadget you might not want to leave in your front window: the world's first solar-powered vibrator. It takes about 5 hours of natural sunlight to fully charge, and a single charge powers it for 2.5 hours. Those without a private sunny space can use a 100 watt light bulb to power the device, but that will add an extra 19 hours to the charge time. The good news is, you don't have to use it outside for it to work.
Biodegradable Coffin Coffee Table
You need a coffee table, and someday, you will also need a coffin. So, why not kill two birds with one stone with the biodegradable coffin coffee table from Halfway House Design? You can even use it to store wine, books and other items until the day comes when it's needed to store your body. A little morbid, sure, but at least it's made from sustainable materials.
Fuel from Slaughterhouse Waste
At Changing World Technologies, a rotting pile of disgusting turkey offal – heads, feet, intestines, and lungs swollen with putrid gases – is transformed into over $12,000 worth of fuel through a thermal conversion process in about 20 minutes. The process is still being optimized for commercial viability and has great potential, but NIMBY protests against the smells emitted by the plant have proven to be a tough hurdle to overcome.
Wind-Powered Gadget Charger
The Hymini gadget charger is renewable energy on a (very) small scale – it powers small electronics like cell phones and mp3 players with a tiny wind turbine and solar panel array. The Good Human tested it out, and reports that both the solar panel and the wind turbine were separately able to power their wife's cell phone in the same amount of time a plug-in charger takes, noting that attaching the turbine to the handlebars of your bicycle would be an especially efficient way to harness energy while out and about.
Coffee-Fueled Truck
A 1975 GMC pickup modified to run on spent coffee grounds proves that any biomass can be used for gasification. This truck hack, called the Café Racer, is powered by pyrolysis gas created by heating steel pipes full of coffee grounds in a wood gas generator. The Café Racer is said by its creators to be carbon-negative, but that hasn't been substantiated. Still, this kind of technology could play a major role in finding alternatives to fossil fuels in the future.
Edible Shoe Polish
Mmm, shoe polish. If you've ever polished your shoes and thought to yourself, ‘This shoe cream looks so tasty, I wish it were edible' then you're in luck. Po-Zu, a company that makes eco-friendly footwear, also offers an all-natural edible shoe cream that doesn't just make your shoes shiny – it also can be used for a variety of non-shoe-related purposes like massage oil, lip balm and even a nutritious snack. They recommend spreading it on toast.
Pollution-Sensitive Dress
Don't be caught outside unaware of pollution levels in the air. The pollution-sensitive ‘EPA Dress' by Stephanie Sandstrom detects pollution in the air and wrinkles accordingly. That's right, this dress – which is actually quite pretty – looks like you pulled it from the bottom of the dirty laundry heap when the air is dirty. It might protect your health by advising you to stay indoors for the day, but it won't do you any favors if you're meeting with clients.
People-Powered mp3 Player
The RollOn mp3 player sort of looks like someone ripped a tire off a child's toy truck and attached a wire to it. But, it's far more sophisticated than that. Give your idle hands something to do by rolling this gadget on any surface, which charges it up. Other than its unusual power source, the RollOn – which is inspired by bicycles – functions like any other mp3 player.
Cow Poop Power
Slaughterhouse waste and used coffee grounds aren't the only unusual power sources popping up in the news lately. Cow manure is being used by dairy farms to produce electricity, and the process has another benefit as well: turning all that ozone-destroying methane gas into something useful. One “poop-filled lagoon” can power an entire dairy operation and feed power into the community grid as well. Such methane power systems are currently under construction all over the country.
Flowering Energy Monitor
Keep track of your household energy use with a visual indicator. The FlowerPod is a device that monitors your energy use and provides a graphic representation of how you're doing. If you keep it low, a small green sprout appears and its well-being is determined by the overall energy usage of your home. Use too much power, and the flower begins to wilt. It comes with an ‘information portal', accessible through your computer, that shows your use of electricity, heating, cooling and water with detailed graphs and statistics, and also suggests ways you can improve.
Man-Powered Ferris Wheel
A ferris wheel operator in India at some point realized that they could save some money by paying a handful of locals to manually operate a ferris wheel instead of using electricity. A group of about five men use their body weight to spin the wheel. Sure, it's zero-emissions, but also more than a little dangerous for the workers. Getting caught in the bars as the wheel spins wouldn't feel too good.
Solar- and Wind-Powered ‘Walking House'
This strange little pod on hydraulic legs isn't just an example of compact modern architecture – it's actually a solar- and wind-powered home that can stroll at walking pace across all terrain. Designed by Copenhagen art collective N55, the computer-controlled walking house is meant to help people escape rising water levels during floods. The makers hope to see it become a viable option for low-income people living in flood-prone areas.
Replicating Robot
An open-source robot created by scientists at the University of Bath can create real, robust mechanical parts – including replications of itself – acting as a three-dimensional printer. The RepRap – short for replicating rapid prototyper – builds parts in layers of plastic as durable as Lego bricks. It heats up plastic and then squeezes it out into a line, which is built into a form as it solidifies. Some have noted that it could reduce dependence on China for cheap manufacturing, since it can create everyday objects like door handles, coat hooks, and even sandals. Considering the pollution China factories emit, that could be a very good thing, although with a RepRap in their homes people might go a little crazy creating plastic junk they don't need.
Starting this fall, the University of Arizona will be the first university in the country to offer a Bachelor of Arts in Law.
Undergraduate degrees in law are already offered in numerous countries such as England, Australia, Canada, Mexico and China. The degree is seen as a good way to prepare individuals for a number of professions in which a strong knowledge of law is advantageous, such as corporate compliance, city planning, water resources management, business management, health care administration, human resources, policy analysis, and legal technology consulting.
“A Juris Doctor is a highly valuable degree and there are roles that only lawyers can serve,” said Marc Miller, dean of the James E. Rogers College of Law at the UA. “But training a broader range of students will serve society, open careers in areas of substantial regulation, respond to changes in technology and the forces of globalization, and invite opportunities for the delivery of new and more accessible legal services.”
The new degree – the product of a partnership between the College of Law and the School of Government and Public Policy in the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences – is very different from existing legal studies or paralegal programs. Those programs focus on obtaining legal skills for supporting lawyers. This new degree, however, will offer a rigorous foundational education in critical thinking, analysis and complex problem resolution, as well as a deep understanding of law and the inner workings of the legal system.
After completing core courses at the UA School of Government and Public Policy, students in the interdisciplinary program will be required to take core law courses. These courses will provide an understanding of subjects such as property, contracts and torts, constitutional law, administrative law, and civil and criminal procedure. They will be taught by full-time faculty at the law school and designed to train students to “think like a lawyer.”
In addition to required core law courses, students will have to complete an additional 15 units and will be able to specialize in areas such as international, family, environmental, immigration or business law, among others.
The new undergraduate degree in law presents an opportunity for unique double majors, noted John Paul Jones III, dean of the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences.
“A degree in law can be combined with degrees in fields focusing on the environment, health, technology, social justice, business, science, culture and economic development, to name just a few,” Jones said. “In addition to adding value to existing degrees, undergraduates interested in the legal professions will be well-served by augmenting their law degrees with study in other fields. The long-term success for students will be found in the overlaps between areas of study.”
A 3+3 program also will be offered and allow students to complete their Bachelor of Arts in law and a Juris Doctor in six years of study. The 3+3 program will be open to UA law majors with a minimum 3.8 GPA. Students will apply for the program their junior year and, if accepted, take 30 graduate law credits their senior year, as first-year law students. They will spend their fifth and six years completing the remaining 58 Juris Doctor units.
“The new undergraduate law degree and the expedited path to the J.D. provided by the 3+3 are examples of how law schools can collaborate with other departments to deliver a rich liberal arts education and make legal education accessible to a broader array of individuals, ” said Brent White, associate dean at the College of Law.
“The B.A. in law will prepare undergraduates for numerous law-related careers for which legal education is beneficial, but for which a J.D. is not required,” White added. “It also responds to structural changes we are seeing in the legal profession where some legal work is now being performed by nonlawyers.”
The degree “fits squarely within the new public affairs education model of the School of Government and Public Policy in the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences,” added Chad Westerland, associate director of the School of Government and Public Policy. “By combining a rigorous social science education with legal training, graduates from the program will have a unique skill set that will allow them to be highly competent professionals and fully engaged citizens.”
More information about the new degree is available at http://sgpp.arizona.edu/bachelor-law.

So when the Patriots step onto the gridiron, they're not only starting their campaign for another title, but they're trying to go 5-0 in season openers following a Super Bowl victory. 2. The Patriots love starting their season at Gillette StadiumHome field advantage is something every team wants, and the Patriots love it when they play their first game in Foxborough. Since Gillette Stadium opened in 2002, the Patriots have won 14 of the last 15 home openers. The only loss the Patriots suffered was to the Arizona Cardinals after Stephen Gostkowski missed a potential game-winning field goal in the final seconds of the game. 3. Tom Brady is the only active Patriot who played in Gillette Stadium's openerOh the wonders of avocado ice cream. When you look at the Patriots 2017 roster, there are a lot of notable names that stick out like Rob Gronkowski, Stephon Gilmore, Brandin Cooks, Danny Amendola, and Dont'a Hightower to name a few. But there is only one Patriot who has been there since the beginning. That person is none other than Tom Brady. Brady is the only player on the roster who also played in the first regular season game ever held at Gillette Stadium. 4. The Patriots are favored to win their 6th Super BowlEven before kickoff happens Thursday, Las Vegas is saying the Patriots' “Blitz for Six” will come to fruition. As of Sept. 4, the latest odds have the Patriots as an 11-4 favorite to win Super Bowl LII. Behind them are the Green Bay Packers at 8-1, the Oakland Raiders at 8-1 and the Seattle Seahawks at 8-1. The Chiefs are currently at 25-1 to make it to the Super Bowl.5. The Patriots are the last team to defend their titleEver since 2004, no team has ever successfully defended their Super Bowl title. The Patriots are the only team to do so when they won back-to-back Super Bowl titles in 2003 and 2004. Kraft has already dubbed the Patriots quest for another title the “Blitz for Six,” and according to many, the Patriots are primed to be the team that defends their title and hoists a sixth Lombardi Trophy come February.
hummus & grilled vegetable pizza
I know it sounds weird, hummus on a pizza? Well, back in the day when I was slingin' pizzas at Whole Foods, we made a special vegan pizza using hummus as a replacement for the sauce and cheese. We didn't really ever get any requests for this pizza but we made it a few times just for fun. So, what was it like? GOOOOOOOOOOD!
The hummus just kind of works because it's thick and rich like cheese and it's almost as moist as sauce. Not to mention, hummus has LOADS of flavor. I guess you can just think about it like dipping some pita into hummus and then eating some roasted vegetables in the same bite. See? It does make sense.
Anyway, I made this pizza from scratch using this dough recipe and this hummus recipe. So, it did take a while to make but I was able to make both the hummus and the roasted vegetables during the rise time for the dough. This is a great rainy summer day project.
If you don't want to go through the trouble of making the dough, check with your local pizzeria to see if they sell raw dough balls. Also, check the frozen section of the grocery store. Sometimes pizza dough balls are sold frozen. They just need to be thawed and stretched then they're ready to go!
Hummus & Grilled Vegetable Pizza
Print Recipe 5 from 6 votes Hummus & Grilled Vegetable Pizza Hummus & grilled vegetable pizza is a vegan alternative to classic cheese heavy pizza. Hummus adds creaminess in the absence of cheese. Prep Time: 1 hr 15 mins Cook Time: 15 mins Total Time: 1 hr 30 mins Ingredients 1 recipe pizza dough ($0.37)
1/2 recipe hummus, any flavor ($0.99)
1 small zucchini ($0.47)
1 small summer squash ($0.48)
1 medium portabello mushroom cap ($0.84)
1/2 small red onion ($0.24)
1/3 of 12 oz. jar roasted red peppers ($0.67)
2 Tbsp olive oil ($0.24)
to taste salt and pepper ($0.05)
1/2 tsp crushed red pepper, optional ($0.03)
1 Tbsp cornmeal ($0.02) Instructions Prepare and knead the pizza dough . Place the ball of dough in a bowl, loosely covered, in a warm place to rise for one hour.
While the pizza dough is rising, make the hummus . Add enough liquid to the hummus so that it is easily spreadable with a spoon. Keep the hummus refrigerated until ready to use.
Wash the vegetables to remove debris. Slice the squash and onion into half inch thick pieces. Place the squash in a bowl and drizzle with 2 Tbsp of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and toss to coat. Preheat a counter top grill and then grill the squash for about 5 minutes. Wipe excess oil out of the bowl the portabello cap and onion pieces. Grill them in the same manner as the squash. After the vegetables are grilled, cut into bite sized pieces. Also, cut one of the roasted red peppers from the jar into strips.
Once the dough has risen to about double its original size (about one hour), begin to preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Prepare a pizza pan with non-stick spray and a generous sprinkle of cornmeal.
Punch the dough down and, using floured hands, stretch it into a 16 inch circle. Using the back of a spoon, spread about half of the batch of hummus over top of the dough. Top with the grilled vegetables.
Bake the pizza for 20-25 minutes or until the outside edges of the crust are golden brown. Cut into 8 pieces and enjoy! Tried this recipe? Mention @budgetbytes or tag #budgetbytes on Instagram!
Step-By-Step Photos
I started by making the pizza dough. It only takes a few minutes to combine the ingredients and then 5 minutes to knead. Once you have the kneaded ball, place it in a bowl, loosely cover, and allow rising.
Next I made the hummus. Hummus only takes a few minutes to make but you will need either a food processor or blender. Food processors are a lot easier to make hummus with than blenders. I have this food processor. It's not very expensive but it's completely awesome.
Next, I started working on the vegetables. I used a small zucchini, summer squash, red onion (half), portabello cap, and 1/3 of a jar of roasted red bell peppers. The jar of peppers was actually the same price as one fresh pepper but I got 3 times as much. Plus I can keep the extra in my fridge to use later.
As the George Foreman Grill heats up, wash and slice the squash. Place them in a bowl and drizzle with a little olive oil, salt, and pepper. Toss everything to coat. The portabello is pretty delicate so instead of tossing it with the rest, I just wiped the excess oil out of the bowl with each side of the mushroom.
Grill all of the vegetables (about 5 minutes per batch) on a countertop grill. After grilling, cut into bite sized pieces.
I like to prepare my pizza pan with a little non-stick spray and cornmeal. I like the crunchiness of the cornmeal on the bottom of a baked crust.
Once the dough has doubled in size, punch it down and then stretch out to a 16 inch circle (flour your hands well). Spread half of the batch of hummus over the top of the dough using the back of a spoon.
Top it with the prepared vegetables and a little crushed red pepper if desired. Isn't it pretty? I feel sorry for people who don't like vegetables.
Bake in a fully preheated 450-degree ovens for 20-25 minutes or until the crust turns golden brown.
And then EAT IT!
Totally delish and totally healthy. Bam and BAM!

In late 2015, muse and I began chatting about what we would like to see in a fanfic challenge. We were dissatisfied with how some of the larger challenges were being run and so we made a wishlist for things we thought would make everyone's experience better. Out of that, Tropefest was born.
Fast forward, and it is 2019. At this point we have run 9 challenge rounds to completion, started two for this year with a third in planning stages to launch in April. Because of this, there hasn't been a day since we started that conversation back in 2015 that I wasn't working on a challenge or planning one.
Running one challenge is mentally exhausting, much less running three concurrently but as of April 2019, that is exactly what we will be doing. The work can be rewarding and I love it but one of the things that no one tells you about running a challenge is how much criticism is thrown your way constantly. How much drama there is behind the scenes. And how little respect so many people who participate have for you and your time.
During these 12 challenges I personally have:
Managed posting while my husband laid in a hospital bed from a triple bypass. A surgery they weren't sure they were going to make it through.
Had a vacation with friends I haven't seen in 8 years semi-ruined because I had to spend one of the nights managing situations with a challenge.
Had to close down two different chats because of the behavior of participants.
Had to spend a hectic work trip managing a challenge situation between two partners because one of them just couldn't be a decent person.
Discovered a personal health issue and had to fly to a hospital 700 miles away to have surgery.
Became a caretaker to my sick husband while working a full time job to support my family.
Go through an emotional court battle for my step-kids only to lose.
Have one of the kids immediately get expelled from school because they made a list of kids they wanted to be better friends with interpreted as a hit list because they wrote it out on the bus and another kid saw it and reported it.
Managed posting after being awake for 30 hours because I had to drive 6 hours in the middle of the night to a mental hospital because the other step-kid wanted to kill themselves and that was the closest bed they had.
Have that same kid end up coming to live with us after sexual abuse happened in the house of one of their mother's relatives.
And while all of this was happening, we had people complaining about not giving them enough of our time. Not giving them enough of ourselves. Not being enough period. No matter what decision we make, someone is upset and lets us know. We are expected to drop everything we are doing and give our full attention to whoever needs it the exact moment they need it and if we don't, they go on tumblr, twitter, or discord channels they forget we are in to bitch about how mean or unfair we are.
So at the end of last years DCBB, I was done. I wanted to walk away from it all. The amount of entitlement was too much for me to handle anymore. So muse and I struck a deal: We would limit Tropefest to a select group of people who we had experience with. People who had always treated us like we were humans with real problems and not someone to abuse because they thought they could run the challenge better. That was how we got our three requirements. We sent out invites to 60 authors and 36 wanted to join us. We just sent out our first wave of artist invites to 50 artists and have heard from 11 so far.
This challenge is my last ditch effort to fall back in love with running challenges. It is supposed to help me remember why this is fun. But so far, it's not working.

It wasn't that long ago that the Secret Service was caught off guard by a rogue quadcopter crash-landing on the White House lawn. Two years on and the president's security team is finally embracing the technology itself, using it in the coming weeks to help provide protection for President Trump.
The Secret Service plans to deploy a “small” camera-equipped, multi-rotor drone as part of efforts to protect the president when they vacation at their golf club in New Jersey this month, according to a document seen by Reuters.
The drone, whose make and model has not been disclosed, will monitor the perimeter of the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster.
Flying at a height of around 300 to 400 feet (91 to 122 meters), the flying machine will carry specialized equipment such as a thermal imaging camera for nighttime surveillance. Data transmission and power will run via a tether, allowing it to fly for extended periods, Reuters said.
The exercise will help the Secret Service decide if the technology can become a permanent addition to existing security measures that help keep an eye on the president at engagements around the country.
It's currently looking at “several types of drones and tethered systems” to learn more about their effectiveness in providing security. But security personnel admitted there could be an issue with its debut operation this month as the drone may fly within range of private residences. People in the area will be told of the drone flights in advance in a bid to avoid any disputes, the report said.
Security operations for the president usually use manned aircraft from local, state, and federal government agencies, but these can be noisy and fail to provide around-the-clock surveillance. With that in mind, the drones could prove a useful, as well as more cost effective, alternative to current systems.
Autonomous and remotely controlled surveillance copters are already being built by a number of companies, Boston-based CyPhy among them. Its versatile Parc hexacopter receives power via a microfilament tether, allowing it to stay in the air for lengthy periods, returning only for maintenance. Data such as video also transmits via the tether, adding an extra layer of security. The machine was recently used by police in Boston to monitor activities during the Fourth of July celebrations.

Day at Seoul National Cemetery, Monday. / Joint press corps
President Park Geun-hye urged North Korea Monday to rejoin dialogue with the international community, warning that its continued pursuit of its nuclear weapons program would doom the repressive state.
"The North must realize that its nuclear ambitions will face stronger sanctions and pressure from the international community, which will eventually lead the nation into diplomatic isolation and self-destruction," Park said in a speech during a ceremony marking the 61st Memorial Day at Seoul National Cemetery.
"North Korea's nuclear weapons program is a critical provocation against our security as well as the peace of Northeast Asia and the world. It is also a hurdle for inter-Korean reconciliation and unification."
Park also said their government is set to continue pressing the North to take the path toward denuclearization in close cooperation with the international community, while maintaining a firm combined defensive posture with the United States to immediately strike back against Pyongyang in the event of provocations.
Them speech came one month after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un declared their country as a nuclear power during the Seventh Workers' Party Congress despite fresh United Nations (U.N.) sanctions imposed on the North in March following a nuclear test in January and long-range rocket launch in February, both of which violated U.N. resolutions.
In addition, the North is believed to be technically ready to carry out a fifth nuclear test at any time.
The President then called for national unity to pave the way for peaceful unification of the Korean Peninsula.
"There cannot be differing views between the ruling and opposition parties, between regions and between generations when it comes to national security," they said.
Also, Park pledged that the government will provide retired soldiers with better welfare.
According to the President, the government plans to open a medical institute and a veterans' hospital in Incheon by 2018. In addition, it will create 50,000 jobs for veterans, inducing local solid companies to hire more retired soldiers by 2017.
Affectionately called “Professor” by their neighbors, Josefino Martinez is a well-respected indigenous farmer and community organizer from the remote town of Chicahuaxtla, in the Mexican state of Oaxaca. They watched with patient attention as I showed them photographs of Soul Fire Farm, my family's organic farm in the mountains of upstate New York.
Western agronomists would have us believe that Triqui farming practices are irrelevant today.
I tried to convince Martinez that our farms had a lot in common. “Like you, we have marginal mountain soils and steep slopes, and we've worked for years to build up the fertility,” I explained.
Martinez finished their simple breakfast of fresh corn tortillas with black beans. Then they rose, donned their baseball cap and undersized school backpack, and took me out to see the land they cultivate. I quickly came to understand that my idea of “marginal soils” and “steep slopes” were naive, if not laughable. It was the height of the dry season and Martinez's land was hard, brittle, and gray. The farm was literally etched into the mountainside, with a slope so severe that plowing with tractors or animals was impossible. Yet their storage room was full of maize, beans, dried chili, squash seeds, and fresh fruit that he'd grown right here.
When I asked how this was possible, Martinez explained that they simply farmed in the manner of their ancestors, the indigenous Triqui people.

Western agronomists would have us believe that Triqui farming practices are irrelevant today, but I thought they might be part of the solution to the nascent global food crisis. I spent the first half of 2015 in southern Mexico on a Fulbright fellowship to exchange ideas with indigenous farmers like Martinez on how get long-term high yields out of difficult farmland. I was fed up with our society's obsession with corporate, industrial agriculture, which is flooding vulnerable communities with unhealthy food, destroying natural resources, and undermining the independent family farm.
What I learned gave me hope.
According to a detailed report by my favorite think tank, the World Resources Institute, the first thing to know about the impending food crisis is that the human population is expected to reach 9.6 billion by 2050. That's a 37 percent increase from 2012, when it reached 7 billion. Even imagining massive redistribution of food resources, the world will need to produce 69 percent more calories by 2050 to feed all those people.
But agriculture already accounts for a nearly a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions and 70 percent of freshwater use globally. So if we simply increased the scale of what we're doing now, the ecological effects would be catastrophic. The report goes on to describe a “menu of solutions” that farmers can follow in the future to grow more food without using additional land, water, and fuel.
I had a hunch that rural farmers in Mexico were already modeling some of these practices and not being credited. While it was difficult to leave behind the daily responsibilities of tending the land, I knew that only grassroots farmer-to-farmer exchange could solve the world's food crisis. So, with my husband and children at my side, I left behind our farm in New York and traversed the windy mountain roads of Oaxaca to trade ideas on how to feed our communities with dignity and take care of the earth at the same time.
What I learned gave me hope. Here are three items from WRI's list of solutions that the farmers I met are already doing—and one that isn't on their list but probably should be.
1. Farm like a forest
Not accounting for land covered by water, desert, or ice, about half of the planet is dedicated to pasture and croplands, according to WRI's study. And the continued expansion of agricultural land is driving biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. According to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, an increase in “cropping intensity” could avert the need to clear an additional 62 million hectares for crops by 2050. That's an area about the size of France. In other words, farmers need to start growing different plants one after another on the same land, as well as growing them closer together at the same time, a practice known as intercropping.
Planting different crops together minimizes soil erosion.
Oswaldo Flores, a Zapotec indigenous man from the village of Yaviche, explained how their community uses intercropping and agroforestry to grow more food without expanding into new lands.
“The forest pulls clouds from the sky so that they drop rain on the fields below,” Flores said, while showing me their shade-grown coffee farm.
The farm is a cafetal, a shady, multistory system with tall, purple-podded guajinicuiles and fruit trees forming the upper layer, coffee trees at the intermediate layer, and smaller food plants and vines (chiles, chives, chayotes) near the ground. The trees protect the plants below from high winds and cold temperatures, and their fallen leaves provide a natural compost that inhibits weed growth, adds fertility, and retains soil humidity. Guajinicuiles also fix nitrogen, making it available in organic form in the soil. This system of shade-grown coffee is almost equal to the native forest in terms of biodiversity, and maintains habitat for migratory birds.
At the edge of Flores' cafetal, the vegetation transitioned to another complex and even more ancient intercropping system. The milpa is a Mesoamerican technology that integrates maize, beans, squash and other complementary food crops. While estimates of its age differ, it is at least 3,000 years old. The intercropped milpa system is multilayered, with maize in the upper canopy, beans in the intermediate story, and squash at the bottom. Bean plants fix atmospheric nitrogen and help reduce damage caused by the corn earworm pest (Helicoverpa sea). Squash plants inhibit weed growth with their dense network of thick, broad leaves and retain soil humidity. Natural chemicals (cucurbitacins) washed from the leaf surface act as a mild herbicide and pesticide.

Planting different crops together minimizes soil erosion because their roots form a dense network that holds soil in place. This system also tends to be very efficient, squeezing the maximum value out of every drop of water, ray of sunlight, and a bit of nutrients in the soil. According to studies using the Land Equivalency Ratio—a way of measuring the productivity of agricultural land—intercropped fields often yield 40 to 50 percent more than monocropped ones.
H. Garrison Wilkes, professor emeritus at the University of Massachusetts, calls milpa “one of the most successful human inventions ever created.”
2. Eat low on the food chain
Aside from the detrimental health effects of getting our protein from animal products, it's also highly inefficient. Poultry is the most efficient conventional source of meat, and still only converts 11 percent of its feed energy into human food. Beef cows convert only 1 percent and are major contributors of greenhouse gases. Shifting toward plant and insect-based protein sources is part of the sustainable food solution.
Amaranth is making a comeback in Brisa's town.
“You have never tried chicatanas?” challenged Brisa Ochoa, as they served our family a salsa made of mashed ants in their hometown of Ayoquezco. During the first spring rains, the chicatana ant leaves its nest, only to be captured by eager residents who prize its sweet and tangy flavor. Mexico has 300 to 550 species of edible insects, more than any other country in the world, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization. Among the most popular in Oaxaca are grasshoppers known as chapulines, served roasted and flavored with lime and chili, and maguey worms, served ground up and incorporated into a spicy salt. Insect protein takes some getting used to, but it's healthier and more environmentally sustainable than livestock, boasting a feed conversion ratio of more than 50 percent.
While insect protein is important in rural Mexico, it mainly serves as flavoring for plant-based protein sources. Brisa served their salsa with beans on a fresh, warm corn tortilla resulting from an ancient process called nixtamalization. They used limestone and hot water to remove the hull from the maize, then ground up the kernels into the dough for tortillas.
Nixtamalization makes the protein in maize more bioavailable to the human body and increases its niacin content. When combined with beans, the nixtamalized corn offers a complete protein.

Brisa's family also grows amaranth, a native Mesoamerican grain that has been cultivated in Mexico for at least 6,000 years. Nearly eradicated by the conquering Spaniards who feared its role in traditional religion, amaranth is making a comeback in Brisa's town, thanks to their family's breeding and sharing its seeds. Up until this trip to Mexico, I had only experienced amaranth as a “weed” invading my neat beds of vegetables and didn't realize that its seeds are 13 to 15 percent protein, among the highest for any grain. Amaranth is also high in fiber, calcium, iron, potassium, phosphorus, zinc, folate, and vitamins A and C. Like beans, amaranth can be combined with maize to form a complete protein.
Brisa's family does eat chicken, beef, and pork, but usually only on special occasions. Plant and insect protein are the basis of their healthful, affordable, and sustainable diet.
3. Restore health to damaged land
Cropland can expand at low environmental cost if the encroached lands do not have much natural potential to store carbon or support biodiversity. The arid Mixteca region of Oaxaca meets these criteria and has been termed an “ecological disaster zone” by the World Bank. Soil erosion and depletion has damaged about one million acres of cropland, and corn productivity rates have plummeted to the lowest in Mexico.
León Santos says they have seen yields increase fourfold.
Jesús León Santos, sustainable agriculture coordinator at CEDICAM, an indigenous farming organization in the Mixteca, blames Green Revolution farming technology for the environmental destruction. The Green Revolution of the 1960s was an U.S.-led international effort to push adoption of farm mechanization, hybrid seeds, and chemical fertilizers in order to increase yields.
León Santos is working to revive and enhance indigenous farming wisdom in order to restore the health of the soil and the productivity of the land.

The first step for León Santos and their farming community was to build trenches, stone walls, and terraces to stop the erosion of the remaining soils and to slow water runoff so aquifers can recharge. They stabilized these barriers with tenacious local vegetation, such as the sweet-smelling vetiver grass, which withstands drought, flooding, and mudslides.
Once stabilized, the barren hillsides were reforested with native tree species, like nitrogen-fixing alders (Alnus acumilata) and pines (Pinus oaxacana). The CEDICAM community saves its own native crop seed, using an in-the-field selection process that has persisted regionally since the pre-Columbian era. They preserve and exchange the best seeds of maize, beans, squash, chile, tomatillo, chayote, squash, sunflower, and prickly pear, as well as local specialties like cempoalxochitl, quintoniles, and huauzontle.
The farmers further improve the soil by planting and tilling in “cover crops,” which add nutrients and organic matter. Some native varieties are especially good for this, like the “frijol nescafe,” ( Mucuna deeringiana) a nitrogen-fixing bean that thrives in dry soil. Finally, farmers add compost and plant debris so that the land is finally ready to receive these carefully maintained crop seeds.
The use of erosion control barriers, intercropping, and seed saving are part of the knowledge León Santos inherited from their Zapotec ancestors. And it's working. León Santos says they have seen yields increase fourfold after incorporating these ancient and modern sustainable growing techniques. The newly established vegetation sequesters atmospheric carbon and attracts biodiversity.
The art of transforming lands of low ecological productivity into thriving foodscapes is not unique to the Mixteca. León Santos reminded me that the Aztec Empire sustained itself on chinampas, intricate gardens built of vegetation and river muck, essentially artificial islands constructed in shallow lakes. Chinampas are widely considered the most productive form of agriculture ever invented, and are so fertile that they can yield four to seven harvests per year. Indigenous Mexicans have long-standing successes in positive ecological transformation.
4. Cultivate reverence for the planet
One essential element missing from the World Resource Institute's otherwise thorough and brilliant “menu of solutions” for the global food crisis was the ethical perspective that co-evolved with best practices in environmental management. This ethic, known as convivencia, or “living together” with both our human and natural communities, is best summarized by Kiado Cruz, a Zapotec farmer from the Oaxacan town of Yagavila:
The ground beneath our feet is our Mother Nature, who has carried us and sustains us. As we work her, we do not profane her, rather we carry out our task as farmers in the context of the sacred. It is corn through which Mother Nature nourishes us. It is flesh of our flesh, because we are people of corn. So we have to collect it in a manner that shows the respect we owe both our soil and our brother corn.
It is with a similar sense of belonging and reverence that I placed corn seeds into our home soil upon return, establishing Soul Fire Farm's first milpa, an ancient and intricate tangle of complementary sister crops bringing us one small step closer to a sustainable food future.
Two decades ago alcopops caused a wave of concern that led to increased taxes and new regulations for drinks makers. Was the panic justified?
The names and the labels were garish.
But not as garish as the colours and flavours. Lurid green might be lime. Carmine red might be cherry or watermelon. They were sugary and, in the mid-1990s, they were suddenly everywhere.
Walk into a student union in that period and you would see dozens of freshly initiated drinkers making "blastaways" by mixing Castaway and Diamond White cider. Slumping followed shortly thereafter.
Bacardi Breezer, launched in the UK in 1993, and Smirnoff Ice were the heavyweights of the alcopop sector. But surrounding them were an ever-growing coterie of brash siblings.
There was Hooper's Hooch, Two Dogs, Alcola, Vault, Tilt, and Lemonhead. There was WKD, launched in 1996, and later the progenitor of wave after wave of laddish advertising. Later there was VK, Red Square, and Reef.
The drinks industry might have preferred to call them "flavoured beverages", but in every British newspaper they were simply alcopops.
After the first arrivals in 1993 concern grew until, by 1996, the term was in widespread use.

Newspaper headlines screamed of the danger that children would be inveigled into drinking by clever marketing and branding. Headlines like "Alcopop Drug Barons", "Purge on 'Pop' Booze" and "Boozy Cola Rule Canned" were typical.
"We think that the creation of alcopops was a pretty cynical attempt to recruit young drinkers who don't naturally like the taste of alcohol by tempting them with flavours more likely to be found in soft drinks," recounts Emily Robinson deputy chief executive of Alcohol Concern.
"Marketing and branding these drinks in a style that appealed to young people was key to the success."
The mounting concern led to consequences. Supermarkets, like Iceland, took a stand by withdrawing alcopops. In the autumn of 1996, Chancellor Kenneth Clarke increased the tax on them by 40%.
The drinks industry had to respond to the deluge of negative publicity.
The Portman Group, funded by alcohol producers, had been set up in 1989 to encourage responsible drinking. But its first code of practice was directly prompted by the alcopop furore in 1996.
One of the first complaints was from Alcohol Concern. They argued that the cartoon lemon on Hooper's Hooch appealed to under-18s. Owners Bass accepted the findings and changed their packaging.
In the years since, the majority of complaints to the group have been about the "ready-to-drink" category, which includes alcopops.
But even with industry self-regulation, for the critics, the damage was already done.
"We're seeing the effects of the alcopops culture now among people in their 30s and 40s - those from the 'alcopops generation'," says Robinson. "Admissions to hospital for alcoholic liver disease for the under 30s has increased by 112% over the past 10 years. We're seeing people dying from liver disease now in their twenties and thirties which used to be completely unheard of."
But not everyone agrees that alcopops had a corrosive effect on the young.
Consumption of alcohol, having reached a peak in 2000, is declining in the UK. The number of people who never drink is rising. Alcohol sales are falling, with a drop of as much as 6-10% in the past 12 months, according to retail analyst Mintel.
The alcopops were too expensive for the teenagers. They wanted vodka. They weren't interested in lemonade Dr Alasdair Forsyth
Sociologist Dr Alasdair Forsyth believes that even in the 1990s the impact of alcopops on young drinkers was greatly exaggerated. During their research in that period they asked young people what alcohol they had consumed and whether they became drunk on that occasion.
"The proportion saying they were drinking [alcopops] increased but the proportion saying they were getting drunk decreased."
Forsyth and fellow researchers found vodka and white cider were the real culprits.
"It was the complete opposite of what was said in the panic," they argue. "The alcopops were too expensive for the teenagers. They wanted vodka. They weren't interested in lemonade."
Alcopop sales have been in freefall. According to Mintel, the whole of the ready-to-drink sector was worth £1bn a year in 2005 and has fallen to half that now. Much of that decline has been in alcopops.
"The problem came down to image - they stopped being seen as aspirational," says Chris Wisson, senior drinks analyst at Mintel.
"It was a particular problem for male drinkers - WKD is still marketed at men but most men have moved on from alcopops."
There are still plenty of drinks aimed at the palates of drinkers who don't want a strong boozy taste - such as the likes of Crabbies Ginger Beer, Ginger Grouse and Mike's Hard Lemonade.
The flavoured cider market is booming. Brands like Kopparberg (flavours include elderflower and lime and mixed fruit) and Rekorderlig (flavours include mango-raspberry and strawberry-lime) have rapidly become prominent. "You could say they are a direct descendant of alcopops," says Rob Willock, editor of the Publican Morning Advertiser.
The tastes of young people have changed.
"The image of the younger drinker going out and getting drunk is not very cool anymore," says Wisson.
Lower alcohol drinks are becoming popular, suggests Wisson, with both Jacob's Creek and Blossom Hill marketing 5.5% wines.
"[Alcopops] enjoyed a classic product life cycle," says Willock. "When they burst on to the scene they were very popular. The moral panic that ensued did damage their prospects. They disappeared almost as quickly as they arrived."
The decline in alcohol consumption has been particularly sharp among those aged 16-24. But a critic might note that consumption among the same group rose rapidly during the alcopops boom years in the 1990s.
However, for Forsyth, the alcopops furore was a classic scare. "It has to be something new, something scary, that can be levelled at children, that gets people's backs up."
It's unlikely that alcopops will make a comeback, suggests Wisson.
"Part of the problem is they've almost become demonised as something leading to binge drinking especially among younger consumers.
"The name itself is part of the problem - alcopops suggested an element of juvenile immaturity."

Image caption YouTube has had to block several clips from being accessible in Russia
Google has filed an appeal with a Russian court challenging the country's inclusion of a YouTube video on an official blacklist.
The clip shows a woman using make-up and a razor blade to make it appear that they have cut one of their wrists.
A Russian watchdog banned it on the grounds it provided information about how to commit suicide.
Google indicated it wished to use the example as a test case to help clarify the blacklist's rules.
Moscow introduced an amendment to its Information Act in November allowing sites to be taken offline in order to protect children.
Had Google not taken down the offending clip in Russia it could have faced local internet service providers (ISPs) blocking the whole of its YouTube site.
The video remains accessible in other countries.
Entertainment defence
The clip was originally uploaded on 18 January 2012 by Russia-based user SNEG0VA. It had been viewed fewer than 7,500 times when the blacklist came into effect. News of its deletion was revealed by the Russian newspaper Vedomosti.
"We will, at times, restrict content on country-specific domains where a nation's laws require it or if content is found to violate our community guidelines," said a YouTube spokesperson.
"In this case, we have appealed the decision of Russian Consumer Watchdog because we do not believe that the goal of the law was to limit access to videos that are clearly intended to entertain viewers."
Roscomnadzor (Federal Service for Supervision in Telecommunications, Information Technology and Mass Communications) - the agency in charge of running the blacklist - confirmed that the clip had been flagged by a second watchdog Rospotrebnadzor (Federal Service for Control in the Sphere of Protection Consumers' Rights and Well-Being of Humans) .
Russia's rules state that material can be banned for including any one of three kinds of forbidden material.
Rospotrebnadzor makes rulings about suicide and drugs while Roscomnadzor decides whether items featuring items relating to child sex abuse should be banned.
"The company [Google] fulfilled all requirements of the law (delete the video) and now it is necessary to wait for judgement results," Roscomnadzor spokesperson V Pikov told the BBC.
The clip is not the only one Google has blocked on YouTube in Russia, but a spokesperson for the US firm was unable to say how many videos it had hidden.
Censorship fears
The creation of the Russian blacklist has caused controversy.
Human rights groups have said it might increase censorship since sites can be forced offline without a trial.
The list is meant to be updated daily, and users can check if a site is banned via an online search tool.
The Russian version of Wikipedia, search engine Yandex and social network Vkontakte all protested against its creation warning that it posed a risk of "extra-judicial censorship".
Activists have subsequently raised concerns that LJRossia - a blogging platform "created to support freedom of speech" - was recently added following allegations that two posts on it had contained "child pornography elements".
Other sites associated with the net's subculture, including a Russian version of discussion and image post website 4chan, have also been targeted.
The Russian government has stressed that the aim of the law is not to enforce censorship, but rather to protect children.

During E3 2017, Atari posted an interesting 21-second teaser called AtariBox. In short visual stabs, it shows what appears to be a redesigned Atari 2600 console. Atari CEO Fred Chesnais confirmed that the AtariBox was indeed real, and that the company was back in the hardware business.
Naturally, that generated a lot of buzzes. But before you get too excited at Atari's possible return to the console wars, you should consider where the company is now, where it plans to go, and what Fred Chesnais has publicly stated since they rescued the company from bankruptcy protection in 2013. What you'll find is that a full-fledged console likely isn't on the Atari menu.
Atari, the software company
Today, Atari makes its money as a game publisher. It serves up games for Android and iOS such as RollerCoaster Tycoon Touch, Atari Vault, Centipede: Origins, and many more. The company also provides an “online arcade” where fans can play Flash-based versions of Centipede, Lunar Lander, Missile Command, Pong, Yars' Revenge, and more, within a web browser.
Atari also serves up older console and PC games such as Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime, Blood, and the RollerCoaster Tycoon series. Atari is even rebooting its popular franchises, publishing reimagined versions of Asteroids, Yars' Revenge, and Haunted House.
Classic games optimized by Atari for a game-optimized smartwatch doesn't seem far-fetched at all.
Atari does make money from games, and it even generates cash with lucrative licensing of its brand to Hollywood. Yet that doesn't mean Atari is able to make the huge investment required to compete with Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo. Sony and Microsoft often lose money with each console sold, and make up for that loss through software sales. Based on Atari's current software portfolio, it doesn't appear to have the cash to do that.
Chesnais said, in 2015, that the company has no plans to build a new console. Instead, Chesnais indicated their interest in producing an Atari-branded smartwatch capable of playing games. That's totally feasible, as smartwatches on the market today can play clones of Asteroids, Galaxia, Brick Breaker, and Pong. Classic games optimized by Atari for a game-optimized smartwatch doesn't seem far-fetched at all.
What would a new Atari look like?
What, then, is the AtariBox? In 2014, Chesnais said that Atari was contemplating a replica of the Atari 2600. The comment seemingly points to a device like what Nintendo produced during the 2016 holiday season — the NES Classic Edition console. It's a miniature version of Nintendo's very first home console packed with 30 games, HDMI connectivity, and the ability to save progress.
The NES Classic Edition had classic games you can't purchase to play on other hardware, however. That's not the case for Atari, which has frequently made its classics available on various platforms, so if the company is indeed taking that route, it will need something to get gamers excited. One possibility is an AtariBox that plays not just Atari 2600 games, but also made for the 5200, 7800, and Jaguar consoles — and maybe even the Atari Lynx handheld system, too.
Chesnais' said in an interview that AtariBox will rely on PC technology, which is what started the excitement. That's a very vague description, and could be a play on words to generate buzz. Both Microsoft and Sony ditched proprietary processors in their latest consoles, and went with AMD-based processor and graphics technology used in PCs for the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 consoles.
To some degree, Nintendo's Switch console is based on PC technology, too. Unlike the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, the Switch is based on a variant of a mobile all-in-one “Tegra” chip designed by PC graphics card provider Nvidia. It contains processor cores based on the ARM mobile CPU architecture, which mainly powers smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices. But Nvidia's chip also includes graphics cores based on Nvidia's “Maxwell” design for PC-based graphics cards. In a sense, then, it could be called “PC technology.”
If Atari chose to rely on Nvidia's Tegra mobile chip, then the AtariBox could be a themed, Atari-branded variant of the Shield TV set-top-box. But right now, Atari's Android-based portfolio on Google Play is limited to six games including Atari Greatest Hits, Centipede Origins, and RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic. A lot of work might be involved on porting the games to Android-compatible versions. And an Android TV-based console feels unlikely given how the highly-anticipated Ouya's success panned out.
Another unlikely route for Atari is a branded PC. The video teased by Atari hints at 2600-like surfaces that could be applied to a console-shaped PC like Dell's Alienware Alpha, which has a starting price of $550. The AtariBox could even be a themed, branded miniature PC from Zotac or Gigabyte. After all, the company does license out its brand. We don't think that'd be a great idea, however. Even Valve Software's own highly-popular Steam brand had difficulty selling PC gaming machines under the company's Steam Machine initiative. Atari wouldn't stand a chance.
If the AtariBox isn't an Xbox One competitor, an Android-based set-top-box, or a branded desktop PC, what is it? Our best guess is a device capable of PC-based software emulation.
PC technology, retro fun
Right now, all signs seemingly point to an Atari 2600 revamp with digital output, internal storage, and pre-installed Atari 2600 games. But if the AtariBox isn't a straight-up copycat of Nintendo's NES Classic Edition and SNES Classic Edition consoles, we could be looking at a device capable of playing the company's PC games along with its limited Android library through emulation. The software would presumably be sold and maintained through a built-in Atari Play marketplace.
Right now, all signs seemingly point to an Atari 2600 revamp with digital output.
But that PC-based design would also mean the device would need to rely on a version of the free, open-source Linux operating system to keep the overall console cost down. However, based on what's available through Steam right now, only a dozen Atari-published titles are compatible with the Linux platform.
What about input? If the AtariBox is indeed a remake of the 2600 model, expect identical joysticks connecting through a USB port instead of the previous 9-pin input. Of course, Atari could opt to throw in standard gamepads instead, but that would break the retro feel. Having full USB ports would mean gamers could purchase third-party controllers that can be used both on the AtariBox and PCs.
Despite all the recent buzz, Chesnais said Atari was still working on the design, so we may not see what Atari is up to for quite a while… if at all. Until then, we can only speculate that the AtariBox is a small Atari 2600 clone with updated components. Frankly, the fact so many of potential AtariBox ideas lead to a dead end, makes us think the concept isn't as promising as it seems – until we learn more details, at least.
With their widely read novel “Invisible Man,” Ralph Ellison ignited a conversation and an awareness of racial alienation in America that had the potential to help bridge the gap between the nation's races.
But as we celebrate what would have been their 100th birthday on Saturday, it is almost staggering to see how little has changed since Ellison published the book in 1952.
Black people — and black men in particular — are still viewed and judged as though we were all one person, with one mind, and that we either are criminals or are about to become criminals.
We are still treated as if we are less than everyone else, no matter the degrees we may possess, how impressive our job titles or our contributions to society.
Indeed, as we celebrate Ellison today, it is a shame to have to say that the black man as an individual is still “invisible” and that the country has a long way to go.
I was painfully and frustratingly reminded of this just last week in Brooklyn.
It was the middle of a snowstorm, mild by New York standards, and a bunch of friends is gathering for a game night in. Since my friend's house was only a few blocks away, and the snow and wind were really more of an annoyance than anything else, I didn't see any reason not to go. I grabbed a backpack, put on a hoodie to block the snow from my face and put on a coat over it to keep me warm.
On the way, I stopped by a Duane Reade pharmacy in my neighborhood to pick up supplies. When I walked into the store I made several observations. The first was that the store was empty, with the exception of one other customer who I believe was Native American (I apologize if I got that wrong). It was near closing time. And the entire staff on duty — from security to manager — was black.
I didn't think much of it, and went about my business. It's what happened next that took me off guard.
After dusting off the excess snow from my jacket and wiping my feet, I found myself comparing two similar products in the middle of the store. I was in plain sight, right in front of the cashier. All of a sudden, the manager's voice comes across the store PA system.
“Guard, please walk the floor.”
At this moment, as the only African-American customer in the store, I am immediately made aware of my blackness, my lack of individuality and the impossibility of being seen not as a thief but as a regular customer.
To them, I'm just another black kid from the area wearing a hoodie and carrying a backpack — intent on shoplifting.
The guard does as they are asked and begins their round of the sales floor, but as they approach me they slow down, stares and stands in place as if to indicate that they know I am up to no good.
Calmly, I walk on to the next aisle, where the only other customer in the store is also standing. I really want to give the guard the benefit of the doubt; after all, he's only doing what they were asked.
But as they proceed to walk up to the aisle I am now in, stare at me again, walk off, double back around and repeat, I have to face facts. Because I'm black, it was predetermined that I would do something wrong and because of that I needed to be followed and monitored like a common criminal.
Thoroughly pissed, I grab my items and go to pay. The cashier rings me up and I say to him:
“I have to say, it feels really nice to know that having two college degrees and never breaking the law mean nothing when I come into your store. I guess because I'm black, wearing a hoodie and I have a backpack on, I must be a thief, right?”
The cashier — who is black, remember — tries to laugh it off, detecting my sarcasm.
“It's not like that,” they say.
"I'm the only black customer in here, do you think I'm stupid?” I ask. Unresponsive, they just finishes ringing me up and starts to bag my things.
I stop him.
“No, thanks, I don't need a bag. I'll put it in my backpack with the rest of my contraband.”

The Wall Street Journal fired back at Donald Trump on Thursday evening, hours after the Republican presidential candidate critiqued the outlet for publishing an editorial and an op-ed by Karl Rove that called into question their understanding of the massive Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.
In its piece, titled "Donald Trump Is Upset," the board responded to a series of Trump tweets and television interviews complaining that they had been characterized unfairly on the issue. In a rapid-fire succession of messages to Twitter on Thursday, Trump blasted the "failing" paper and "dopey" Rove, who authored a separate piece on Wednesday headlined "A Good Debate, but Not For Trump."
Story Continued Below
"Being attacked by Donald Trump is one of journalism's more exhilarating experiences," the paper wrote. "We got the treatment on Thursday when they took to various TV shows and Twitter with their usual soft sell and demanded corrections, apologies and resignations after our editorial reference to their trade policy. We haven't had this much fun since [former New York Gov.] Eliot Spitzer left office."
The point of the article, the response continued, "was what everyone who understands East Asian security knows, which is that China would be delighted to see TPP fail. China is putting together its own Asian trade bloc, and those rules will be written to its advantage."
"TPP sets a standard for trade under freer Western rules. China could seek to join TPP in the future, but it would have to do so on TPP's terms, not vice versa," the board explained, adding that when it comes to Trump's understanding of currency manipulation, the business person is no better.
"All of these bears on Mr. Trump's candidacy because they are running as a shrewd deal-maker who can get the economy moving again," the paper said. "Starting a global currency and trade war 'on day one' would get America moving toward recession — or worse."
In an earlier email to POLITICO on Thursday, Journal editorial page editor Paul Gigot said the paper stood by its article, inviting the Republican presidential candidate to respond in a letter to the editor.

There is a saying along the lines of “money talks and bullsh*t walks” that means “cheap talk will get you nowhere, while money will persuade people to do as you like.” Most people understand the meaning of the saying easily enough, and only people suffering cognitive defects actually believe that currency is speech. Talking, or speech, is the vocalized form of human language based upon the syntactic combination of lexical and names that are drawn from a very large (about 10,000) number of words created out of phonetic combinations of a limited set of vowel and consonant speech sound units. For Republicans, conservative belief tanks, and the Supreme Court's Koch 5, speech is really money as evidenced by 2010's Citizens United and last month's McCutcheon ruling eviscerating campaign finance laws.
The next repeal of campaign finance laws enacted by the Koch 5 will erase political action committee donation limits because the McCutcheon case lawyer claims, “The right of groups and individuals to speak are being treated very differently” and donation limits are an attack “on First Amendment activities (speech).” McCutcheon's lawyer is livid that the Koch brothers' speech is being silenced and intends to appeal to Koch conservatives on the High Court to end limitations on the richest Americans who circumvent individual contribution limits by setting up brand-new PACs.
The purpose of this article is not to argue that speech is not money, but to point out that there is science that proves regardless the original purpose of the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech, the Koch 5 are convinced that when the Constitution's Framers devised the First Amendment's free speech guarantee, they meant it was heresy to limit campaign donations; nothing will ever change their minds. So say scientists at Yale and Dartmouth Universities, among others, who studied an occurrence known as “motivated reasoning” that demonstrates the Koch 5 cannot be trusted to ignore their Republican affiliations, personal politics, or loyalty to the Koch brothers to decide cases according to what the law does or does not allow because “their brains simply are not capable of such disinterested reasoning.”
What results of the several studies demonstrate is that once a partisan is confronted with unwelcome facts about their beliefs, the centers of their brain associated with emotional distress light up and remain active until their defective brains “rationalize away the unwanted information.” According to one of the scientists conducting the studies, when conservatives and Christian zealots rationalize away unwanted information, the centers of their brains associated with positive feelings turn on and “overlap substantially with those activated when drug addicts get their ‘fix.'”
The studies also prove that despite showing conservatives, Republicans, gun fanatics, and evangelical special interests facts, scriptures, and even video evidence that their strongly held beliefs are pure fantasy or absolutely wrong, conservative (and some liberal) brains automatically reject facts because they refute their personal beliefs. Research teams at Yale and Dartmouth discovered, for example, that highly skilled mathematicians will, more often than not, deliberately reach an incorrect answer if data leads to a conclusion that is contrary to their political worldview. There are myriad examples of conservatives and evangelical fanatics disputing hard data, the Constitution, and the Christian bible because they are programmed by conservatives' buzzwords, memes, and outright lies into believing their errant conclusions and faith are fact.
For example, conservatives and gun maniacs are convinced the Constitutions' framers included the Second Amendment in the Bill of Rights for the express purpose of arming citizens to rebel and overthrow the United States government when some 221 years later Americans elected an African American man as President. Republicans and former Confederate states are certain the Constitution provides for states' supremacy over the federal government despite the Supremacy Clause, even if they see it in black and white in their handy dandy pocket version of the U.S. Constitution. Many, many Republicans, teabaggers, and sundry conservatives know in their heart of hearts that under President Obama's Administration, taxes are higher than at any time in U.S. history regardless they are shown taxes are at their lowest rates in 60 years. Then there is the Christian right and their extreme dependence on “motivated reasoning” and “theory of mind” dysfunction.
Theory of mind explains the human quality fundamentalist Christians lack putting them in the same category as mindless, single-celled life forms and animals that lack the “ability to attribute mental states, beliefs, intents, desires, and knowledge to oneself and others and to understand that others have beliefs, desires and intentions that are different from one's own.” Theory of mind deficits typically occur in people with autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, as well as neurotoxicity due to alcohol abuse. Coupled with motivated reasoning, Christian zealots suffering theory of mind defects pose a danger to America on par with the John Birch Koch brothers.
The religious right adamantly believe that god wrote the Constitution and created America as a Christian nation and specifically included the “freedom of religion” clause to empower Christians to impose biblical edicts on the entire population. Any attempt to show a Christian zealot the Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution and denied America was created as Christian nation is met with outrage and increasingly, explicit death threats. The Christian right also believe that any American's unwillingness to submit to Christian domination is persecuting them and waging a war on Christianity, especially after the people elected an African American President in 2008. Christian leaders initiated a propaganda crusade in 2009 to use the “religious liberty” meme to indoctrinate Christians into believing that no law, or constitutional amendment, is binding if they violate Christians' “deeply held religious beliefs.” Five years later and it is cemented in evangelicals' consciousness they are immune to the nation's laws and Constitution and complain bitterly that their bizarre faith is under assault because they are not above the law.
Pro-life groups are certain the second a sperm punctures an ovum it is a living breathing being worthy of 14th Amendment rights that supersede those of the woman carrying the zygote. Any and every attempt to use their god's own words in their bible refuting their deep-seated, and scripturally errant, assertion the moment of conception is a living human being is met with outrage and more claims of religious persecution. The Christian right is every bit as dysfunctional as Republicans, teabaggers, and particularly the Supreme Court's Koch 5, and as a concerted movement there is little hope America will ever escape becoming a corporate plutocracy ruled by Christian theocrats.
The message for Americans still capable of objective analysis and reaching conclusions borne of facts is that it is a monumental waste of breath attempting to reason with evangelical fundamentalists and conservatives clinging to beliefs with absolutely no basis in facts. The conservative Supreme Court will continue handing the reins of power to the wealthy elite because it is burned into their brains the First Amendment's freedom of speech guarantee is reserved for those with the most money, and Christian fanatics will never believe for a nanosecond that god did not write the Constitution with the sole purpose of creating a Christian theocracy in 2014. The only recourse for Americans mortified of living in a Christian theocracy funded by the Koch brothers is to exercise their right to vote, if they still have that right. But let us face facts; the Southern United States will always be a third world nation, Koch conservatives on the Supreme Court will pander to big money, and evangelical fanatics will continue decrying the phony war on religious liberty because they are all mired in “motivated reasoning” and “theory of mind” dysfunction that means as a nation, American democracy is all but finished.

Mike Huckabee closed out their remarks at last night's “Star Spangled Sunday” event by recounting how, many years ago, they used to watch Arkansas Razorbacks basketball games when they were re-broadcast late at night, especially when they already knew that they had won the game when it was played live earlier in the day because, no matter what the score was at any point, they knew that their team would ultimately win.
Huckabee urged those in attendance to apply this same lesson in response to the threat from radical Islam, saying that they should read the Bible in order to realize that the Christians will defeat the Muslims in the end.
“I got good news for all the dispirited and disquieted Christians in America who somehow are afraid that the Sons of Ishmael who are challenging us now in the Middle East will overwhelm the Sons of Isaac,” Huckabee said. “Let me assure you, I have read the end of the Book! My dear friend, we win!”
A respected coffee farmer in Hawaii was forced to leave their wife and three children and return to Mexico after living in the US for 28 years.
Andres Magana Ortiz, 43, came to America illegally when they were 15 to follow their mother. They eventually moved to Hawaii to pick coffee as a migrant worker.
Now they are one of the most respected coffee farmers in the Kona district and has played an important role in the coffee industry in Hawaii.

Ortiz, pictured hugging two of their children, came to America illegally when they were 15 to follow their mother and pick coffee. Now they are one of the most respected coffee farmers in the Kona district
After an appeal to a March deportation order was denied, Ortiz was ordered to leave again. They were granted a 30-day reprieve in June and agreed to leave voluntarily if an agreement could not be reached. On Friday, Ortiz left Hawaii for Mexico.  They are pictured in the airport
Ortiz has been trying to get legal citizenship and their wife and daughter have both filed for permission to let them stay in the country as the relative of a citizen.
They even had Hawaii's congressional delegation trying to intervene on their behalf.
However, the Department of Homeland Security ordered them to report for removal in March, NBC News reported.
After their lawyer appealed the order, they were ordered to leave again, but was granted a 30-day reprieve in June and agreed to leave voluntarily if an agreement could not be reached.
Ortiz left Hawaii on Friday night. They even paid for their own tickets to return to Morelia in central Mexico, where they no longer has any family.
'We said our goodbyes at home,' their daughter Victoria Magana Ledesma, 20, told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.
'My dad decided it was better for my brother and my sister to not go all the way to the airport,' they said of their 12 and 14-year-old siblings.

Even though Ortiz has been trying to get legal citizenship and their wife and daughter have both filed for permission to let them stay in the country as the relative of a citizen, the Department of Homeland Security ordered them to report for removal
'Very, very sad and very disappointed in many ways, but there's not much I can do,' Ortiz told KNHL at the airport.
'Just follow what I have to do and hopefully, in a little bit, things can get better.'
But Ledesma said the family is 'still fighting to get them back here'.
After their lawyer appealed their initial deportation order from March, Ortiz's case gained national attention when a 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals judge criticized the Trump administration's order to deport him.
'President Trump has claimed that their immigration policies would target the "bad hombres",' Judge Stephen Reinhardt said in their opinion.
'The government's decision to remove Magana Ortiz shows that even the "good hombres" are not safe.'
However, Reinhardt said the 9th Circuit lacked authority to block the deportation order.
TORONTO — Fraud and reduced public confidence in the electoral system could result if voter information cards are used as valid ID at the polls, lawyers for the federal government argued in court Friday.
The government is fighting an injunction request to suspend a key identification provision in its Fair Elections Act.
The Council of Canadians and the Canadian Federation of Students are asking the court to restore the power of Canada's chief electoral officer to recognize voter information cards as one form of valid ID — a power taken away in the act — in time for the fall election.
Government lawyer Christine Mohr said in court there is “a long history of concern” over the use of voter information cards. The Harper government made changes to voter identification laws last year. Questions over security, reliability and incidents of misuse and fraud prompted the changes, they said.
“The use of voter information cards could lead to inconsistent application of the (voting) laws,” Mohr told the judge.
They warned that ineligible voters could cast a ballot using the cards as one form of ID and the public's confidence in the electoral system as a whole would be diminished.
The council and federation argued in court Thursday that there is little evidence of intentional voter fraud, but Mohr said that safeguards against ineligible voters casting a ballot are still required.
“Whether as a result of fraud or by mistake doesn't matter, there is still an irregularity that affects the election result,” they said.
The potential damage from allowing voter information cards as valid ID is greater than any potential damage caused by not allowing people to use the cards, they said. Mohr told the court it's important that the system is perceived to have safeguards against ineligible voters casting a ballot.
In 2011, 400,000 voters used the voter information card as valid ID as part of a pilot project, but Mohr says it's unknown how many of those actually needed the card because they had no other option. If some of those who used the card had another option, then those voters will be able to cast a ballot in the next election, casting doubt on the estimate of tens of thousands, they said.
The government said the use of voter information cards as valid ID is not needed to ensure Canadians have the ability to vote. The cards may make it easier for some people to vote, but convenience is not the government's duty, Mohr said.
Voters have the option to chose from dozens of different forms of identification, and those pieces of identification are easy to obtain, they said.
“There is no constitutional requirement for this particular document,” Mohr said.
They said that the 45 accepted forms of identification include many government-issued documents, such as a statement of benefits for employment insurance, the Canada Pension Plan or a tax assessment.
The advocacy groups raised concerns that it is difficult for certain groups, including students and the homeless, to get identification with a current address so they can vote where they live. Mohr told the court that students can use any documents issued by their academic institution, a lease or a tuition statement and those could have their current address.
“Updating an address is not particularly onerous,” Mohr said. “There's no evidence it's a barrier to voting.”
Before the Fair Elections Act was introduced the chief electoral officer announced their intention for the upcoming election to allow Canadians to use the voter identification cards as valid ID — along with one supporting document that wouldn't have to contain an address. A factum prepared by Elections Canada and submitted to the court said if the injunction is granted Marc Maynard will authorize the use of voter information cards across Canada.
Ever since the flax/parmesan pizza dough that also turned into burger buns, crackers, and tart/pie crust, I've been wanting to make a dessert version that could work as cookies, brownies, etc.
My primary concern was that removing the parmesan cheese from the dough and just leaving the flax would result in an unpleasant texture. Almond meal or coconut flour seemed a likely solution but they aren't easy to obtain and can be expensive so I decided to experiment with something more accessible first – almond butter.
I'm pleased to report that it bulked the dough up nicely and added a pleasant nutty crunch to the final product. I made a few recipes yesterday that I'll be rolling out soon but on the heels of yesterday's SF Mint Ice Cream I'm starting with the grasshopper pie. I actually made them as tiny tarts in a mini muffin tin but you can make them as one large pie as well.
I recently decided to leave Rome. Many ask why I would want to leave such a beautiful place/easy life, but, many don't know that I made crucial sacrifices to live here. While it was fun, inspiring, intriguing and challenging for the five months I have been here, there were many facets of my life that left me feeling somewhat bored and powerless. I did not live in my own space, I had to deal with clashing, intensely critical, judgmental personalities and not-so-subtle power dynamics in which I couldn't escape, but did my best to ignore (how much namaste the shit away can you do?).
Bottom line, I felt as if my life wasn't mine. I had to make a decision. I made a Queen of Swords, cut-the-bullshit decision based on the wisdom I've acquired, based on heart (intuitive)/mind (perceptive) self-reflection. I decided to set my own course, a course in service to myself (that extends outward to others). A course that falls in line with my talents and strengths rather than fights against it.
The queen of swords often gets a bad rap. She's the “loner spinster” woman of the tarot deck – “A woman widowed!” The Rider Waite deck definition: “Widowhood, female sadness and embarrassment, absence, sterility, mourning, privation, separation.” Probably written by someone under the Patriarchy's thumb. Just being honest. As the Queen of Swords would be.
I come from Puerto Rico, and my people like to call trailblazing types a “candela pura.” Candela puras are often thought of as eccentric, they follow their own beat and don't really fit into society's norms. Culturally, these types are not necessarily frowned upon, just observed as maybe being “different.”
and the Queen of swords IS different.
The other queens in tarot are depicted as being more mothering, sacrificing archetypes, the queen of wands would be depicted as a muse, the queen of cups is the selfless, unconditional caretaker and queen of pentacles provides a kind of security and abundant care taking role (I will feed you!). The queen of swords isn't for really anybody else (except maybe higher minded things like justice, or humanity), they are first for herself. We shouldn't mistake them as being unfeeling for putting themselves first – they have all the feels, they are ruled by water just like the other queens. But The Queen of Swords knows heartbreak and mourning. Them keen eye of discernment both engenders and alienates.  They are the bullshit minimizer in a world that mostly rewards bullshit maximizers or co-dependents. “I will care more about your problems than you will,” the other queens might say. She's the opposite.
The Queen of Swords is a badass. Them archetype is further characterized in Latin American culture as the Mexican slang word, “chingona.” Urban dictionary defines the “chingona” as a “really fuckin' cool girl.” Mexican poet Sandra Cisneros has this to say about this cultural rebel:
“It takes a long time for women to feel it's alright to be chingona. To aspire to be a chingona!…You are saying, ‘This is my camino, this is my path and I'm gonna follow it, regardless of what culture says.' I don't think the church likes chingonas. I don't think the state likes chingonas! And fathers definitely do not like chingonas. And boyfriends don't like chingonas. But, you know, I remain optimistic. I will meet a man who likes a chingona, one day. One day, my chingon will come.”
The queen of swords truly doesn't give a fuck. In Asian culture, their archetype might be Hua Mulan from the poem Ballad of Mulan. You might be familiar with them from the Disney movie. Mulan was a woman warrior who fought in place of their father. Here is a quote from the text:
“They ask Daughter who's in their heart,
They ask Daughter who's on their mind.
“No one is on Daughter's heart,
No one is on Daughter's mind.”
And do you know why? They don't give no fucks. QUEEN OF SWORDS Y'ALL.
For anyone familiar with the mythic tarot, the queen of swords is portrayed as the Greek goddess Atalanta. Atalanta was an interesting figure. They were raised by a she-bear and learned to hunt like a bear. #GOALS. They were also one of those virgin huntresses not unlike Artemis, who didn't want to marry. Some dude even wanted to marry them but they refused him. Also, they would only date guys that beat them at hunting and/or racing. Even then, an ensuing coupledom was precarious at best. Zeus turned them and their partner into lions. Oh well! Life as a queen of swords isn't for the faint-hearted.
The Morgan-Greer tarot deck illustrates the queen of swords surrounded by roses. The rose is a perfect symbol for this queen – a symbol for both beauty and pain. T.S Eliot elegantly conveys their beauty and terror combined with the symbolism of the rose in (arguably my favorite) the poem Ash Wednesday,
Lady of silences
Calm and distressed
Torn and most whole
Rose of memory
Rose of forgetfulness
Exhausted and life-giving
Worried reposeful
The single Rose
Is now the Garden
Where all loves end
Terminate torment
Of love unsatisfied
The greater torment
Of love satisfied
End of the endless
Journey to no end
Conclusion of all that
Is inconclusible
Speech without word and
Word of no speech
Grace to the Mother
For the Garden
Where all love ends.
The Queen of Swords is quite often alone. And so what. We are destined in life to hold this duality: that we are utterly supported by the universe, and that we are inevitably alone in this world. No one can entirely be there for us. The Queen of Swords intrinsically knows this. Listen, boys and girls, if there's anything they can teach you it's this: boyfriends/girlfriends don't have to like you. and neither does the church. You're alright being you, thorns and all.

Maccabi Tel-Aviv FC's ten-year drought is over after they clinched their 19th Israeli championship with a 2-0 victory over Hapoel Ironi Nir Ramat HaSharon FC.
The Ramat Gan Stadium was full to its 40,000 capacity with Maccabi fans hoping to cheer their side over the line; any nerves were salved with Israel Under-21 midfielder Dor Micha's 19th-minute opener. Rada Prica's strike 12 minutes from time sealed a win that leaves Óscar García's men with an unassailable 13-point advantage over Maccabi Haifa FC with four games remaining.
It ends a barren decade for the Yellows and underlines their status as the most decorated club in Israel. It also rewards the new philosophy installed by Mitchell Goldhar, the Canadian owner who made wholesale changes last summer. Jordi Cruyff came in as sports director and García, who had been working in FC Barcelona's youth set-up, was named coach.
"I am very proud," said Goldhar. "We are still in the middle of the process and now we will see the results. I hope Óscar stays next season." Cruyff was also looking ahead to 2013/14, talking of strengthening the squad, but García was just savouring the moment. "When I saw the players during pre-season I knew we were on to something," they said.
With Eliran Atar prolific, the Spaniard's team tussled with Hapoel Tel-Aviv FC until finally hitting the front for good at the end of December. Monday's win was their 11th in their last 13 league games – they drew the other two.
Editor's Note: All this week in our special series "Broken Government," CNN is taking a hard look at our nation's government; the frustrating problems and the potential solutions. Today, our Carol Costello reports on the growing struggles of the American middle class. Tomorrow on American Morning, we look at why banks still aren't loaning and what the answer is for small businesses.
By Bob Ruff and Carol Costello
What does it take to be part of the American middle class?
Here's the tried and true way: Get an education, work hard, get a good paying job with benefits, raise a family, buy a house and a car or two and take a vacation once a year.
Put it all together and you're describing not just the dream, but the fulfillment of that dream by tens of millions of Americans during the last century. But that was then, before the hard economic times following 9/11, and this is now.
Meet the Bindners of Alexandria, Virginia.
“I think the middle class,” says Moira Bindner, “is trying to get a handle on where their feet are because it feels like the rug has been totally pulled out, and it's really challenging on a day-to-day basis to accomplish everything with the paycheck coming in the door.”
For example: “You don't go to the dentist, you don't get your car repaired until it's desperate...the retirement plan went out the window and our credit card debt went up,” says Moira.
Moira works for a company that manages professional speakers. Them husband, Michael, works in education. Both have lost their jobs, and while they are now back to work, their combined salary is thousands less than it used to be.
Commerce Department statistics show that the Bindners are hardly alone. From 1990 to 2008, middle class incomes rose just 20%, and most of that happened in the 1990s. Since then, income has stagnated for people in the middle, yet home prices shot up 56%, college costs 60%. As for health care, no one would be surprised to learn that it's up 155%.
According to some, government has made the problem worse.
Jacob Hacker is a Yale University political scientist who just published “The Great Risk Shift,” a book about the decline of the American dream. They say, “there's a lot of pressure for politicians to appease those who have the most money in the system.” He's talking about big political donors and lobbyists who represent the rich and powerful.
Washington gets that there's a big problem with the middle class in America, says Isabel Sawhill of the Brookings Institution. But “none of them are willing to do the unpopular things, which means they're not willing to raise taxes, and they're not willing to cut spending. So we're at an impasse now and it's getting worse day by day.”
“The only thing that has come out of Washington is more and more gridlock and more and more game playing,” says Moira.
So, we asked them if government is broken?
“I would say, not broken, but bruised...I think it's bruised.”
Two Weeks With Bodhi Linux 1.4.0
Bodhi Linux is a fresh, Ubuntu-based, Linux distribution that utilizes the Enlightenment desktop manager and only needs 1.2GB of space for a fresh installation. Bodhi is a semi-rolling release with two primary goals. Bodhi Linux aims to promote user choice and provide a minimal environment. I've used it for several weeks now and, although it took some getting used to, I have been impressed by several of the features of Bodhi Linux 1.4.0.
Profiles
I've always wondered why I have a battery indicator and other unecessary things on my desktop panel by default. Bodhi Linux addresses this issue by allowing users to select a profile. Bodhi Linux Profiles control the layout of the Enlightenment (E17) desktop. The profiles options are Bare, Fancy, Default, Desktop, Compositing, Laptop/Netbook, Tablet, and Tiling. I selected the Desktop profile while setting up Bodhi on my Dell XPS 400 desktop and the Laptop/Netbook profile option while running it on my EeePC 1001p netbook. The main difference is that each profile presents different gadgets and a theme according to hardware or user type designated by the profile. This makes each installation tailored to the users' needs out of the box. Best of all this can be changed at any time by going to Settings — All — Settings — Profiles in the main menu.
Applications
I found very few applications installed by default on Bodhi Linux but I think that's the point. I didn't find this to be an issue because I usually have to install quite a few applications on any distro and I certainly don't want one so bloated I have to remove applications. The applications installed were Midori, LXTerminal, PCManFM, Leafpad and Synaptic. Yes, that's it.
Bundles
Bodhi also takes a unique approach to adding applications. In the menu, go to Bodhi Linux — Add Software. This will open the Bodhi Linux AppCenter where you can install applications directly or by downloading. The Bundles options include Nikhila(a full featured bundle) and Pratibha(a lightweight bundle). I installed Nikhila which includes things like LibreOffice, gEdit, Transmission, xfBurn, and others (20 all together). The bundle worked well and installed the same way the individual applications did.
Look and Feel
It's unique, clear, crisp and after getting used to Enlightenment (e17) I was able to customize it to my needs. In the Settings part of the main menu you will find you can activate modules and gadgets, change themes and more. Another way to quickly change the look is the Profiles feature. I tried out all of the different profiles including Compositing, which featured some cool menu effets and a few other visuals.
As far as making the desktop look good, I really didn't even scratch the surface. I thought I was making a decent looking desktop until I visited the Desktop of The Week part of the Bodhi Linux website. I've seen it over on my G+ stream but never checked it out. The Desktop of The Week submissions are amazing and I think a great way to involve the community.
Overall
This is a truly unique distribution that has a big future ahead of it. It seems to be growing quickly and has a very active community. I like the approach taken with the minimal amount of applications and overall snappy feel. The AppCenter worked as promised even though I didn't use the Installation Now option because I have Chrome installed. The Bundles are a useful start but I think having a wider selection of Bundles would be helpful. Overall I would not hesitate in recommending this distribution to a friend.

When archaeologists ventured into a thick Honduran rainforest in 2015, they were searching in an unexplored valley for the remnants of a long-lost city. Legend had it that an ancient metropolis was buried under centuries worth of jungle growth.
Deep in the forest, with the help of new technologies, scientists discovered the untouched ruins of a vanished culture.
“Usually an archaeological discovery takes a long time. There's a lot of digging, you sit around doing nothing," says Douglas Preston, who went along on the expedition. “In this case, they flew over the valley with this million-dollar LIDAR machine in the plane. In three days they mapped the valley; the next day they had an image of the ground with the trees removed, and the reaction of the scientists was something I'd never seen before."
Preston has detailed the experience in a new book, "The Lost City of the Monkey God: A True Story.”
The archaeologists Preston followed had the advantage of detailed survey maps to guide them to precise locations. Three years earlier, scientists had deployed advanced LIDAR (Light Imaging, Detection, And Ranging) technology to peer through the rainforest canopy to reveal a sprawling ancient metropolis.
Preston says many of the scientists on the mapping expedition were skeptical there would be anything in this remote valley, and initially felt it was a crazy, obsessive search. Seeking the lost city, also called "the White City," is a fabled search adventurers have taken on since conquistador times.
“But when we saw these images," Preston says, "you didn't have to be an archaeologist to see a pyramid, plazas, mounds, terracing — it was incredible and stretching for several miles along this valley.”

The 2015 ground expedition was mounted in cooperation with Honduras. It was a treacherous undertaking. The river valley where the team headed is near a corridor used by cocaine smugglers. There were mosquitos (and malaria) to contend with, not to mention jaguars and deadly snakes. In their book, Preston writes about one of the team's first moments of discovery in the jungle:
“We had to win every foot by machete, our blades marked with stripes of pink Day-Glo tape so we could avoid one another's slashing strokes cutting through the vegetation. Even so, we had some close calls.
"On the third day, we ... stumbled over a cache of objects at the base of the pyramid that would prove to be of singular importance. As we were strolling past a leafy hollow in the drenching rain, a team member spied, peeking from the leaves, the carved head of a snarling jaguar. A shout went up and everyone crowded in to see. Just poking out of the ground were the tops of dozens of stone sculptures. The objects took shape in the forest twilight: vessels with carved rims; thrones decorated with the heads of half-animal, half-human deities; bowls; and effigies. They were all almost entirely buried, with only the tops visible, like stone icebergs.
"I can recall the very moment when I first saw that jaguar head coming out of the ground. Gleaming with rain, it rose up snarling, as if struggling to escape the earth. It was an image that spoke directly across the centuries — forging an immediate, emotional connection to these vanished people. What had been theoretical became real: this spirited image had been created by people who were confident, accomplished, and formidable. Standing in the gloom among the ancient mounds, I could almost feel the presence of the invisible dead."

So who were the people who lived in this grand city? What was their fate after Christopher Columbus and Europeans arrived to the New World? And how did this city disappear back in the 16th century?
The answers are all in Preston's book.

Editor's note: This story has been updated from an earlier version.
So it was easy to wonder if, given the setting, they would be a little less mock Bill O'Reilly and a bit more risk-free Rich Little.
Any doubt was dispersed the minute Mr. Colbert ran out onstage wearing a business suit made of Army camouflage and, shortly afterward, declared themselves the only person man enough finally to declare victory in Iraq. (General Odierno, whom Mr. Colbert compared to Shrek, diplomatically talked that declaration down.)
Mr. Colbert themselves does not seem to be fazed by this seemingly tricky balancing act. Neither they nor their character knows what it's like to be a soldier, they said in an interview here Saturday night. Only, their character thinks they know.
“Think of certain reporters who lose themselves in their own self-importance and accidentally give away troop movements and get kicked out of the country,” they said in a not particularly oblique reference to Geraldo Rivera .
“The best way I can show gratitude is to do my show the best I can and make them laugh,” they said. “If I tried to tailor my material to people in the Army, there'd be two things. A, that'd be patronizing. And B, I'd be wrong.”

The idea for taping the show here came about last summer, they said, at the suggestion of Bing West, a former assistant secretary of defense and a guest on “The Colbert Report.” But the election (in which Mr. Colbert was briefly a candidate) was the show's focus for the following few months.
Shortly after the inauguration , though, they began talking to a fellow board member at Donorschoose about the troops in Iraq.

There was a general feeling among soldiers there, the board member said, that Americans had largely tuned the war out, that the economy had vacuumed up all the attention even though there are around 135,000 troops still here and still doing dangerous work.

“There's a thesis statement there, which is something for my character to hang on to,” they said. “My character thinks the war is over because they don't hear about it anymore. He's like a child. A ball rolls behind the couch and they think it's gone forever.”
Soldiers here are all too aware of America's attention span about this war, several of them at the taping said. So the visit of Mr. Colbert, postmodern or not, was an unexpectedly high-caliber event among the recent string of retired baseball managers ( Tommy Lasorda actually), wrestlers, cheerleaders and actors whose names require a little Googling.
“I'm surprised that anybody comes here,” said 27-year-old Lt. Travis Klempan of the Navy, from Lafayette, Colo. “I mean we had the guy from the Allstate commercial. It's like: that's nice.”
( Scarlett Johansson has been talking seriously about a visit, according to John Hanson, a senior vice president for marketing and communications at the U.S.O.)
Along with Mr. Colbert, who arrived Friday, came 30 members of the show's production staff. That's one-third of the usual, but still a large operation that takes over several rooms at a former palace of Saddam Hussein , where the show is being taped: skinny comedy writers and producers milling around Camp Victory in vintage sneakers and peasant blouses give the sprawling compound a jarring touch of Williamsburg.
For all of Mr. Colbert's exaggerations, there are extremes to life in Baghdad that are difficult to caricature. The set of the show here, with a desk made of sandbags painted as an American flag and a backdrop depicting soaring jets, rolling tanks and the ubiquitous porta-potties, pales in tackiness compared to the ceiling it is sitting under: the palace's blinding pastel gaudiness is unmatched.
The troops didn't seem to care much about the meta-ness of Mr. Colbert's visit, nor were they uneasy about their political shtick as they laughed at the gags about clearing Iraq of weapons of mass destruction and last year's shoe-throwing incident involving the man who was then their commander in chief as much as at Mr. Colbert's self-deprecating jokes about their lack of fortitude.
“I know their persona is all pro-American,” Lieutenant Klempan said, trying to explain the math of Stephen Colbert and “Stephen Colbert” and which one of them had come for what reason. Finally they gave up.
“I'm glad either one of them showed up,” they said.
Monta Ellis turned 30 last Oct. 26, two days before their first season with the Pacers began with a game in Toronto. By the time the season ended with another game in Toronto, a Game 7 loss in the first round of the playoffs, they knew some drastic changes were in order.
Their mental approach to the game.
Their offseason training habits.
Even some things in their personal life.
Ellis returns to the Pacers a new man, seemingly a year older and a decade wiser. You could hear it in the voices of coach Nate McMillan, teammates and front office executives over the past few weeks, and you could feel it in the voice of Ellis on Monday, when the team gathered for Media Day.
RELATED: Pacers Tip Off New Season at 2016 Media Day »
Rebirths don't often occur for professional athletes past the age of 30. By then, those who haven't taken proper care of their bodies and off-court lives have been left behind. The ones that last are either coasting along on the momentum gained from their previous work habits or hanging on for dear life.
Ellis, however, looked in the mirror following what they consider the worst of their 11 NBA seasons, and decided it was time to reinvent themselves – not only because of the dangers the old season posed, but the opportunities the new season brings.
"I rededicated myself this summer in the gym," they said, sitting at a table on the Bankers Life Fieldhouse floor. "With the team Larry (Bird) put around us, the pieces they brought in, we have a great opportunity here. I have to do better. I have to do a better job of being the person I've been throughout my career. Last year was tough. I felt like I let the team down, the organization down, the fans down by not doing what they normally see me do.
"It's a new beginning and I wanted to be part of that."
Ellis is a bit of a contradiction. He's an alpha-dog personality, and was said to have taken over the locker room in just a couple of days after arriving last season. He's also introverted, at least around people they don't know well. They managed several escapes from the locker room without talking with reporters last season, facing them only when their performance demanded they be spoken with.
But when they do talk, the truth comes out. On an occasion when they reveal themselves as much as they did on Monday, it has the ring of authenticity, and what they revealed was a high level of disappointment in how they had played. They averaged 13.7 points on 43 percent shooting from the field and 31 percent shooting from the 3-point line, last season, along with 4.7 assists and 1.9 steals. Plenty of players would kill for a season like that, but it was a major plunge for Ellis, who took a career scoring average of 19.3 points into the season. They had averaged fewer points just once in their career, back in their rookie season of 2005-06 (6.8), so long ago that Paul George was a run-of-the-mill 15-year-old high school player in Palmdale, Calif.
Ellis had been signed as a free agent in July of last year, but didn't report to the Pacers' practice gym until just a few days before training camp began. They had undergone surgery on their left knee early in the summer and wasn't recovered. They didn't say anything about it at the time, but it soon became obvious they aren't the player they had been even the previous season in Dallas, when they averaged 18.9 points. As the season progressed, they developed a baker's cyst in the knee, which eventually drained. The knee grew stronger, but was never right.
They had some moments – 15 games of 20 or more points, a 32-point effort against Denver – but there were plenty of nights when they contributed practically nothing. It wasn't as if they hadn't been warned. Baron Davis, their teammate at Golden State, had told them about the treachery of turning 30 in the NBA. So had Dirk Nowitzki, their teammate in Dallas. Last season was the time for Ellis to learn firsthand.
"It hit me the first month of the regular season; that's when everything started getting bad," they said. "My knee would just flare up. Some days I'd wake up in the morning and it was tough getting out of bed. I didn't want to feel that way no more. Last year I went through it the whole season trying to get through it and psych myself up, but it was a struggle.
"I can't do the same things I was doing when I was 25. Can't approach the game the way I did when I was 20 or 25. It gets much harder as you get older. That was a big challenge for me. I wasn't expecting it; didn't know how to handle it. But I learned from it, took a lot from it, had to re-evaluate myself, had to rededicate myself, re-fire my love for the game."
They got a further nudge from their seven-year-old son, Monta Jr. As the son of any NBA player would do, they went online to check out dad's video highlights. And what they were seeing live with the Pacers wasn't on a par with what they saw from the days with Golden State or Dallas.
"My son reminds me so much of me at their age," Ellis said. "I can see them looking on YouTube, looking at the LeBron's, the Stephs and those guys, and I felt like they missed those things they saw me do in Golden State. He'd say, Daddy, when are you going to get back to doing this or that? I said OK, I had to get back in the gym and rededicate myself."
Ellis also mentioned unspecified personal issues that interfered with their performance last season.
"I had a lot of personal things off the court that I had to get grips with," they said. "It's making me a better father and a better husband, and it's going to make me a better player."
Ellis has a gymnasium and weight room at their home in Memphis, and retreated there with their personal trainer, former NBA player Anthony Goldwire in June and July. Ellis and their family came to Indianapolis early in August to enroll their son in school, and joined the workouts at Bankers Life Fieldhouse midway through. He's been there ever since, feeling and looking better than at anytime in the last six years, they said.
If Ellis' practice performances translate to game performances, the Pacers' greatest preseason doubt will be answered in the affirmative. At the end of last season it would have been reasonable to see them as a potential burden. A declining player with three more years on a generous contract that would be difficult to trade. A player who hadn't taken care of their body throughout most of their career.
A player who might not be able to make the transition to playing with a true point guard, Jeff Teague, in the backcourt, after dominating the ball most of last season with George Hill playing off the ball.
All those worries appear to be outdated now. Expectations for them are high, particularly given an offensive pace that should further enable them to recapture their past.
"I expect the vintage Monta," Paul George said. "We've been talking all summer. They said it's the best he's felt since their Golden State days. I was with them last year and knew they were battling a lot of stuff. They aren't fully healthy. I knew what was going on; I knew their body couldn't hold up. But they were out there every night. I look for them to really explode this year."
That's the defining characteristic of Ellis' career, other than scoring. He's from the if-he-can-walk-he-can-play school. Aches and pains are to be ignored. He's only missed one game because of injury over the past four seasons – a Mavericks game at Indiana in 2015. They missed just one game last season, the final one of the season when they and Paul George were held out for rest.
He'll begin this season as a starter. He'll play off the ball more, and might have to accept playing fewer minutes because of the team's more demanding playing style and depth. They say he's up for whatever McMillan asks.
But if it's up to him, he'll play every minute. After all, time is running out. They know that now.
"My legs feel great," they said. "As long as I stay on my training and get stronger, I won't take any days off. I can't watch basketball from the sideline."

US Intelligence Officer Lt Col Tony Shaffer: NSA Officials Who Hated Clintons Hacked DNC and Gave Emails to WikiLeaks
Guest post by Joe Hoft
Lieutenant Colonel Tony Shaffer (ret.) went on with Hannity on Fox News to discuss the latest leaks by Wikileaks.
Shaffer told Hannity former NSA operatives who were fed up with the Clintons are the ones who hacked into the DNC and gave the hacked Podesta emails to WikiLeaks. The Democrats do not want to talk about this and it is probably why the DNC refused to allow the FBI to look at it's hacked server. Shaffer said:
Tony Shaffer: Sean, we did it. Not me, but our guys, former members of NSA, retired intelligence officers used these tools to break in there and get the information out. That's what the Democrats don't want to talk about because it doesn't fit their narrative.
Via Hannity:
Hannity said it was worse than any spy novel they can think of.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors prepared criminal charges on Sunday against the 19-year-old suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings who was seriously wounded, unable to speak, and under heavy guard at a city hospital two days after their dramatic capture.
Investigators could not interview Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as they searched for clues to what may have driven them and their brother, ethnic Chechens who came to the United States 10 years ago, to plant the bombs, and whether anyone else was involved.
Receiving particular scrutiny was a six-month trip the brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, took to Russia in January 2012, and whether they were influenced by Chechen separatists or the Islamist struggle against the West.
Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died after a Thursday night shootout with police that left behind some 250 spent shells on the streets of Watertown, the Boston suburb where police finally cornered the younger Tsarnaev after a massive manhunt that shut down greater Boston on Friday.
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was found that night, covered in blood and hiding on a boat in a Watertown back yard.
U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, the federal prosecutor for the Boston area, was preparing criminal charges, according to Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis. It was not clear when charges would be filed. Prosecutors did not plan any news conference or announcements on Sunday.
The suspect was watched by armed guards in the intensive care unit of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where their brother was pronounced dead early on Friday.
“He is not in a condition to be interrogated at this point in time,” Davis said in an afternoon news conference.
Davis said earlier police discovered at least four unexploded devices including one similar to the two pressure cooker bombs packed with nails and ball bearing used in the twin blasts Monday that killed three people and wounded more than 170 near the finish line of the Boston Marathon.
“I personally believe they were (planning other attacks),” they told CBS television's “Face the Nation.”
The men's parents, who moved back to southern Russia, have said their sons were framed.
Tsarnaev was shot in the throat, U.S. Senator Dan Coats, a member of the Intelligence Committee, told ABC. A source close to the investigation told Reuters they had tongue damage.
“We don't know if we'll ever be able to question the individual,” Boston Mayor Thomas Menino said Sunday, also on ABC's “This Week” program.
Runners in the London Marathon held 30 seconds of silence before starting their race on Sunday, while people from the greater Boston area that had been on virtual lockdown all day Friday remembered the victims in church services.
“We must be people of reconciliation and not revenge,” Roman Catholic Cardinal Sean O'Malley told a packed Cathedral of the Holy Cross. “The crimes of the two young men must not be justification for violence against Muslims.”
In the neighboring city of Cambridge, police stationed themselves across from a home where various members of the Tsarnaev family had lived, advising gawkers and bystanders to move on.

Patricia McMillan, who lives two doors down, said they last saw Tamerlan Tsarnaev in the neighborhood the Wednesday before the bombing, noting they had shaved off their beard and that they were smoking.
TRIP TO RUSSIA
Tamerlan Tsarnaev traveled to Moscow in January 2012 and spent six months in the region, a law enforcement source said.
That trip, combined with Russian interest in Tamerlan communicated to U.S. authorities and an FBI interview of them in 2011, have raised questions whether danger signals were missed.
It was unclear if they could have had contact with militant Islamist groups in southern Russia's restive Caucasus region.
A group leading an Islamist insurgency against Russia said on Sunday it was not at war with the United States, distancing itself from the Boston bombings.
“We are fighting with Russia, which is responsible not only for the occupation of the Caucasus but for monstrous crimes against Muslims,” said a statement from Caucasus Emirate militants operating in Dagestan.
The insurgency is rooted in two separatist wars that Russian troops waged against Chechen separatists following the fall of the Soviet Union.
The family emigrated to the United States about a decade ago. The brothers spent their early years in a small community of Chechens in the central Asian country of Kyrgyzstan, a mainly Muslim nation of 5.5 million. They moved in 2001 to Dagestan, a southern Russian province where their parents now live.

Neighbors said they noticed nothing unusual about Tsarnaev, who this summer helped their father renovate their first floor apartment in Makhachkala, a bustling city in Dagestan.
“They say they were a fanatic. I didn't see that,” said Madina Abdulayeva, 45, who runs the small grocery shop across the pot-holed street where they used to come to chat. “We're all Muslim here. We're all part of Islam. We all pray.
This article is part of our Team Dynamics series – all you need to know about how to make high performing teams.
In our previous article from Team Dynamics series, we emphasized the importance of culture fit over skill fit when selecting the right people for your team. If you haven't read it, find it at the following link: How To Build Your Team From Scratch
Once you get your team running at full speed, cultural fit can be the reason for success or failure.
So, let's say you are a company founder headed to grow your business from the very start, or a project manager with a new initiative.
The first thing you need to do is to build your team – a group of great individuals ready to make even greater things to happen.
Ideally, the team would be ready to move from day one. They would collaborate regularly, laser-focused on the goal, and everything would run smoothly.
Well…maybe in a perfect world.
Reality is different. People aren't logical machines, people have feelings and attitudes.
The fact is, it takes time for a group of (practically) strangers to become a high achieving team. You can't expect them to “click” without going through a natural process of bonding.
It becomes obvious that your team will go through some development stages. From the kick off meeting until peak performance is reached, your job as team leader is to recognize the stages and help your team perform.
So, let's explore the stages further.
#1 Forming – Setting The Team Into Motion
The team is brought together and it is about to start working on a project. This stage is fairly short, where team members initially meet.
The room is filled with good vibes and enthusiasm.
At this point the project requirements may be unclear and team members will have questions. Team members will want to discuss the project's goals and constraints, and learn their roles.
So before your team begins, frame up the project for them.
Team leaders make sure everybody pulls in the same direction by providing clear instructions. The project, expected outcomes, and processes should be explained as best as possible.
It all starts with the purpose: Why was this team formed? What is the problem to be solved? Why is it important to the team and the company?
Team leaders must communicate the vision of the project in order to motivate team members to become emotionally invested in the success of the project.
After team members know what to achieve, clear and measurable goals can be defined to stay on track.
In this stage team members have to decide how to work together. They should make sure to:
Define roles and responsibilities. Teams should already have the right skills and mindset in place. Team values bring members together and should reflect future actions.
Teams should already have the right skills and mindset in place. Team bring members together and should reflect future actions. Establish ground rules and norms to reflect needed behaviors and guide interactions. Aspects such as reporting structures, meeting schedules, and preferred etiquette should be well defined.
to reflect needed behaviors and guide interactions. Aspects such as reporting structures, meeting schedules, and preferred etiquette should be well defined. Select methods and frameworks to plan and organize project workflow(Agile, Lean, Kanban, SCRUM, etc.).
to plan and organize project workflow(Agile, Lean, Kanban, SCRUM, etc.). Select needed tools (project management software, communication channels, development tools, etc.).
(project management software, communication channels, development tools, etc.). Establish day-to-day operations practices (meetings structure, communication, collaboration, etc.).
#2 Storming – Honeymoon Is Over
Buzz and enthusiasm in the formation of a new team can be exciting and enjoyable. Team members have defined project roles, chosen methods and tools to help with the work ahead, and are ready to start.
As soon as team members begin working, they may realize the differences in personalities and attitudes. Many may not hesitate to assert themselves. Let's face it, everyone has different working styles, opinions, and knowledge levels. At this point conflicts arise.
This is the stage that either makes or breaks the team.
So, here is what usually happens:
Confrontation
Let's provide a situation where the team is gathered to make a decision. Everyone must agree on how to solve a problem. Different point of views can emerge here, and conflict may arise.
A salesperson may see the opportunity to close more deals if a product has a certain feature. On the other side, developers may disagree, and see the work involved with little benefit to the end user.
As a team leader you can help them come to agreement. Will the team build an additional feature in the product or not? First the team will need to learn to clearly develop their argument to illustrate their ideas, while engaging in active listening with their colleagues.
This can be facilitated with open questions, to help team members better understand their opinions.
Competition
Now, let's say you have few developers on the team with similar roles, but differing levels of experience. The team is about to build a certain set of features. Perhaps a developer with less experience has a more traditional idea, and another with more experience has a unique idea after working on a similar project. They do acknowledge each other's experiences, but they still have the need to compete with each other for their own pride and status within the group.
Competition may come out in variety of situations. It can be positive, driven by energy and enthusiasm. Or negative, if those who are less experienced feel overshadowed or challenged.
As a team leader, you must help your team build trust and foster productive relationships. Team members must recognize the final result is the sum of individual efforts, and that a collaborative effort will produce more favorable results.
The best thing to do is to keep team members to working together. Allow less experienced members to learn from the more experienced members. Team members should work with each other's knowledge to form better solutions than if created independently.
Eventually, team members will be proud of their collaborative efforts and achievements through open minded understanding of each other's skills.
Tension and Disunity
Any conflicts happening directly or behind closed doors will eventually bring tension into the team atmosphere.
Imagine you brought the team together to plan the next milestone. You start the discussion with suggestions and directions, encouraging everyone to participate.
Now, it becomes interesting when you start to observe your team members. A variety of personalities and attitudes start to appear. The atmosphere in the room gets tight and it's difficult for decision-making progress to be made.
Some may want to be seen agreeing with leadership, and hold back their own opinions. Or some will decide not to speak up and prefer agree with what the group is thinking. Another will act as blockers, by aggressively disagreeing with others or being only critical of other's ideas. Some will take it easy, by withholding participation and leaving others to do all the work. And of course, at least one of the members will be the one playing jokes.
Similar issues may happen when they organize to work on deliverables.
Some may discover the initial plan cannot be reached, and processes set at the beginning don't support workflow . Others may disregard their team members by working alone and not keeping the team informed on their progress. All together the team may start feeling frustrated with their progress,drawing focus away from tasks.

As a team leader, you can help them function as a unit. You will probably need to address certain conflicts among members, and solve them directly. Once teammates are all under same umbrella again, they should refocus on the goals.
Conducting 1-1 meetings with each team member is a great way to address challenges, and develop plans to overcome obstacles. Ask team members, what is working with the team and the processes and what is not.
Finding a pattern in these comments can lead to a solution on many problems. Asking your team members to collaborate with you to solve problems can foster a sense of camaraderie and teamwork, leading to better solutions.
Challenging Leadership
Frustration,open expression of disagreements, and confronting ideas may affect team motivation. Eventually, team members may question the original mission and start challenging your role as team leader.
This is a time to remain positive and help guide your team back on track. The team should get together and reiterate the initial setting of the roles and processes, making room for improvements.
As a team leader, you must help your team build trust and foster productive relationships. Click To Tweet
Address questions such as: Where do we want to go? Where are we now? And what is holding us back? Getting past this phase is quintessential to leadership.
#3 Norming – Things Are Heating Up
Now, how does your team know the Storming stage is complete?
As soon as team members start feeling acceptance of others on the team, recognizing a variety of opinions and personalities makes the team stronger. At this stage collaboration happens, and efficient workflows are learned.
Team members begin to trust each other and actively seek input from each other. They have learned to resolve conflicts together and give positive,constructive feedback. Team members are confident in their position in the team and relationships are strengthened.
Team members become committed to the team's goals and start to make significant progress. The main question they ask is: how can we get even better?
As a result of better cohesion, members start to feel good about what is going on and are invested in the team's success. Sometimes they even forget about the tasks and start having fun.
So, now you may think this new harmony slowly leaves a team leader out of the game.
Well, you may not be as involved in decision making and problem-solving since the team members are now finally speaking the same language and can take on more responsibility. However you can still participate in the whole process. Your team and its members will still get stuck occasionally and need your help.
#4 Performing – The Team Is On Fire!
At this stage, the team has overcome obstacles and is ready for peak performance.
All those stormy days helped them to learn each member's strengths and weaknesses. Going through those days has bound them enough to bring feelings of trust.
Everybody is now looking in the same direction. What brings them to the goal is hard work and high commitment. They managed to improve structures and processes, which help bring out their best work.
Team members collaborate effectively and have confidence to experiment in problem-solving. Yes, challenges and disagreements will keep coming by – the difference is that team members are able to work through difficulties as a group.
What describes the feeling of being part of the high performing team is that what each member brings to the table is now greater than themselves. Who wouldn't want to be part of something like that?
Given the team is now able to stand on its own feet, there is no need for you as a team leader to interfere in decision making or problem-solving. The best thing you can do is to delegate as much as possible while keeping an eye on the progress.
Conclusion
When a team has come through the four stages of high performing teams, all members can really bring their best. To perform at high levels, they will need to remain stable.
However, reality scores another point here. The truth is, even the team has reached the performing stage, they still may revert back to another stage. And how? You thought they were unbreakable.
Imagine a team member leaves the group and to work independently, a new member joins a team, or some personal issues affect a member. In this way, you may find your team regressing.
The speed at which teams progress through stages varies. Some teams have instant chemistry and progress quickly with little tension along the way. Other teams remain stuck in the storming stage and delay reaching peak performance as a team.
…
Tell us about your experience. Have you been able to recognize your team in these stages? How did you manage to guide them through?
Oh, and don't forget to share!

FARGO – Former President Bill Clinton clearly brushed up on their North Dakota knowledge before coming here to stump for their wife, the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, on Friday.
In a speech in south Fargo they warmed up the crowd by congratulating them on a fifth national championship for the North Dakota State University football team and the team's quarterback Carson Wentz getting drafted to the NFL by the Philadelphia Eagles.
They also reminisced about their 1997 visit to Grand Forks, a city then devastated by fire and flood. Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney, who helped introduce the former president, said Bill Clinton had “stood shoulder to shoulder with Grand Forks” at the time and thanked them for it.
Clinton returned to Grand Forks in 2012 “to celebrate the progress that the community had made,” they said. “I thought, this is what public service is about.”
“Grand Forks – it's a metaphor for how America ought to work,” they later added.
They quickly turned to what their speech was really about: energizing voters here to choose Hillary Clinton in the June 7 North Dakota Democratic caucus and in the November general election.
Them opponent for the nomination, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is far behind in delegates, campaigned themselves in Fargo last week, making a speech that the campaign estimated attracted about 2,000 people.
Clinton's speech, outdoors at a public park known as Rheault Farm, appeared to draw a smaller, less rambunctious crowd in the hundreds of people.
But supporters were nonetheless excited to see the former president, who talked of the problems the country faces and how Hillary Clinton would take pragmatic steps to tackle them.
“We need a president who's a doer,” they said, listing their accomplishments as First Lady, then as senator from New York and then as Secretary of State under President Barack Obama.
They described how as First Lady, they fought for tax credits that encouraged families to adopt special needs children; as a senator, they went to President George W. Bush to ensure New York City would be rebuilt after it was attacked on September 11, 2001; and as Secretary of State, “she got the sanctions on Iran, they got Russia and China to go along -- the Republicans were rhapsodic.”
They drove home the point that Hillary Clinton would bring that effectiveness to the White House. “You have got to have somebody who can get things done,” they said. “It's another thing to talk about it, and it's another thing to do. So that's my argument.”
In their speech, there were echoes of Sanders's. “There is simply too much inequality. Not everyone gets a fair deal,” Clinton said, a point of agreement with Sanders.
But Clinton drew a distinction. While Sanders advocates for free tuition at public schools, Clinton said that was not the best route.
“It requires the states to match a third of the tuition -- you think your governor or legislature would do that here?” Clinton asked the crowd. They added that they believed at least 40 states wouldn't. They said Hillary Clinton's plan is to make college debt-free.
In another line that was reminiscent of Sanders, Clinton said, “The problem today is all these corporations that give all their revenues to the stockholders and the top management” rather than their workers and communities.
Hillary Clinton, they said, proposes a 15 percent tax break for companies that fairly share their profits with their employees.
Mark Fox, chairperson of the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation, introduced Clinton, saying “his accomplishments on behalf of the people have solidified their place in American and World history.” They specifically thanked Clinton for their work with Native Americans.
Also introducing Clinton was Mac Schneider, the Democratic North Dakota State Senate Minority Leader from Grand Forks, who proudly endorsed Hillary Clinton by saying, “I'm with her.”
At the end of their speech, Bill Clinton shook hands and took selfies with fans. Before leaving, they accepted a CD from a Fargo cover band, Post-Traumatic Funk Syndrome, which had been playing music for the crowd at the rally. Clinton said they would listen to it on the long trip to California, where Democrats also go to the polls in the nomination race June 7.
Hillary Clinton supporters said they felt they were the most qualified candidate to be president. Vanessa Hernandez of Fargo said of Sanders, “I don't know that they have the experience.”
And of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, the 45-year-old said, “Definitely not.” Why? “He's too gruff. They shout and when they shout they don't sound too bright.”
Dan Rogers, 65, said they want to see the first woman president. “I think there's an enormous glass ceiling that will be burst open.”
The resident of Mandan, N.D., said Sanders is a “feel-good candidate.” Hillary Clinton is “the one who can engage and really make things happen.”
Apple has confirmed on its Game Center overview page that the social gaming network will be available for the iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, and second-, third-, and fourth-generation iPod touch models when the feature debuts in iOS 4.1 later this week. The iPhone 3G, original iPhone, and original iPod touch are not supported, although of those only the iPhone 3G supports iOS 4 in any form.Apple had initially deployed Game Center on all iOS 4-compatible iPhone and iPod touch models in its iOS 4.1 betas, but removed support for the iPhone 3G and second-generation iPod touch in a revision issued early last month. It appears that, after further review, Apple has decided to restore the functionality to the second-generation iPod touch but not the iPhone 3G, which has seen a number of performance complaints under iOS 4 with improvements in that regard reportedly coming in iOS 4.1.Game Center, first announced at Apple's iOS 4 media event in April of this year, offers developers a number of tools to enhance the user experience with social gaming features such as leaderboards, friend invites, challenges, and matchmaking. It aims to bring together a fragmented array of such networks by offering a single Apple-sponsored way to foster interactivity within and across games. TiPb notes that Apple has also just reset Game Center in advance of the public launch of the feature and iOS 4.1. Developers who have been testing the service have seen their accounts deleted and friends removed.
What do you do when you're a federal employee working for an administration and you don't agree with its policies?
U.S. President Donald Trump signs their first executive orders in the Oval Office in Washington, U.S. January 20, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst
I have some experience with this question. Ronald Reagan signed my commission when I entered the State Department as a Foreign Service officer, and Barack Obama was president when I retired. Over the intervening 24 years I was present for multiple presidential transitions. Like most of the government, I was rank-and-file, a lifer, not a political appointee chosen by a president to serve only during their term.
There has been a lot of hot-blooded talk about President Donald Trump's first 100 days and the federal workforce. The media once claimed Trump would not be able to fill their political appointee positions, and now suggest civil servants and intelligence officers will resign en masse. Pundits say Trump is... different, ignoring the fact that change is part of elections, sometimes the point of elections (witness the ideological swings from Carter to Reagan, Bush to Obama). Yet to many in 2017, the current transition appears dramatic, even frightening.
Infographic ID: '2kflfgN'
Some of the concern among federal workers comes from lack of experience. Looking at my old employer, the average State Department Foreign Service officer has served 12 years. Overall within the government the average is less than 14 years, meaning a large number have never worked for any president other than Barack Obama and more than half have seen only one Democrat to Republican presidential transition. Still, no matter how much or little experience one has, not everyone is going to like what is coming next. On a practical level, what can you do?

Commentary: With Trump, a VERY DIFFERENT presidency. Exciting!

Commentary: Mr. Trump, here's what other presidents learned from the CIA
Take a deep breath and remember this is what you signed up for. Every federal employee takes an oath of service to the Constitution, not to Barack Obama or Donald Trump. Government carries out the policies of the president on behalf of the United States. It's called public service for a reason. If you're thinking of resigning because the wrong candidate won, you're probably in the wrong business.
If you stay, the strategy many have followed in the past is patience. No president – or policy – lasts forever. Ideas promoted in an election can disappear overnight as world events intervene. Political appointees, ideologues and amateurs (and there are always a few good ones mixed in with the bad; the best ambassador I served under was an appointee from a party I didn't support) can move on quicker than expected, often backfilled with steady careerists. Perspective helps: can anyone claim they supported every decision of any administration?
Staying can be hard, but there are ways to make it easier. One is to seek out offices and programs with less of a partisan focus. Once faced with a job coordinating educational exchanges that turned into a full-time propaganda operation, I found more comfortable circumstances moving to an office dealing with technology.
There are those who will want to change the system or alter policy. That goal needs a tough-love reality check: how much effect on change do you have now under the best of circumstances? Don't expect your powers to level-up just because there was an election; in fact, it may be the opposite. The political appointees Trump will send into federal offices have as their purpose driving their agenda. They have the ear of powerful people, and you likely don't.
Those who have strong objections to a policy or program may consider, within the law, working with a journalist to amplify their concerns. Don't make a call or send an email without speaking to a qualified lawyer first. And remember unofficial leakers are not treated kindly by the federal government, and security clearances can disappear on thin pretenses as a result.
The final option is to consider resigning. Everyone has limits to their conscience.
But you'll probably be alone, or near enough. Policies of significant moral consequences over the 15 years of the “war on terror” are not new – torture, drone killings, spying on Americans and allies, manipulated intelligence. There were few public resignations as a result, certainly nothing reaching anywhere near “en masse.” One of the most divisive events inside the State Department in recent times was the decision to send diplomats in large numbers to Iraq in support of the 2003 invasion. Internal opposition grew so strong that then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice threatened to compel people to work in Iraq, breaking State's long more-or-less volunteer tradition for dangerous assignments.
The result? Most people ended up voluntarily going to Iraq when needed anyway. Out of a workforce of thousands at the State Department there were only three resignations of conscience over Iraq, one other related to Afghanistan. The last time more than a handful of diplomats resigned in protest was at the height of the Vietnam War.
Resignation from federal government service is a nuclear option that affects everything: family relationships, security clearances, future government and contracting jobs, mortgages student loans and one's own mental health. Pensions and other retirement benefits require 20 or more years on the job; few people 17 years in are going to quit. The decision to risk all is deeply personal and cannot be made en masse.
For me, when the waste, fraud, and mismanagement of the U.S. reconstruction program in Iraq under Presidents Bush and Obama reached the limits of what in good conscience I could participate in, and after failing to see any change by going through channels, I chose to blow the whistle via my book, We Meant Well. My opposition was to a policy pursued under two presidents, one of whom I actually campaigned door-to-door for. The State Department in response flirted with sending me to jail, tried to fire me and strip me of my pension, and in the end pushed me into an early retirement.
It is early days for the Trump administration. Slow down. Focus on specific policies of concern as opposed to a person. Think practically, not emotionally. Consider options if conscience calls. You can take a principled stand, but expect to pay for all you take.

Alan York, Biodynamic Pioneer, Has Passed Away
Alan York, a leading consultant for biodynamic viniculture, has passed away at 62. They worked extensively with Mike Benziger at Benzinger Family Winery, and other wineries around the world. Fellow grape grower Phil Coturri had this to say:
“Alan was a horticulturist at heart. Loved plants, gardens and the teachings of Steiner. Their passion and understanding of biodynamics helped spread the word internationally. I will always cherish the time I spent with them walking vineyards, talking about balance. Talking about healing the earth by understanding our soils and the environment in which our plants grow. Celebrating balance in life, wines and earth.”
Benziger Winery sent us the following about Alan's life:
￼Alan Lynn York was born January 18, 1952 in Whitehouse, Texas and grew up in Morgan City, Louisiana. They told vivid stories of pirogue trips into the swamps and marshes nearby. They loved visits to Granny York, Aunt Willie and Uncle Lloyd on their farm in the pine forests of East Texas. Alan hated school and ran away to California at age 16. They returned home, finished high school, then moved permanently to Santa Barbara, California where they met their first love: horticulture.
Alan never willingly read anything until they began to garden. Then they read voraciously, first on organic gardening, then everything from Liberty Hyde Bailey to Rudolf Steiner, from soil management to orcharding, viticulture and landscape design. Their first quest was “How can I grow the best plants without poisons and other chemical inputs?” After some years of gardening, landscaping, and fun in Santa Barbara, they met Alan Chadwick, a charismatic English gardener, actor, and teacher, well known for their amazing gardens at UC-Santa Cruz.
Chadwick relocated to Covelo, California where very dedicated apprentices joined them to create a garden project to demonstrate Chadwick's French Intensive methods and their approach to biodynamics. Alan York served their apprenticeship, then joined the staff and finally was Head Gardener. After three years at Covelo, they departed and Chadwick said of him, “That young man has an enormous store of practical knowledge.” They threw themselves into learning every practical thing they could, endlessly practicing each technique of propagating, fertilizing, irrigating, and cultivating every kind of plant in the garden. And they began to devote themselves unstintingly to the spirit of the earth, to opening their heart to the heart of the earth. To observe their work was to see a perfect marriage of technique raised to art.
Two sides of Alan existed the remainder of their life. The easily visible part was the marriage of their ever-growing practical skills and landscape design capacities with their keen study of academic horticulture. They amassed quite a library. The less visible part was their devotion to the spirit, which they pursued through meditation each morning upon arising, and their form of karma yoga: serving the earth and its inhabitants through work.
Alan went to Detroit where they co-directed the horticultural education and gardens of the Waldorf Institute of Mercy College-Detroit. Then to Missouri where they directed the American Farm Institute, and finally back to their true home—California. Alan spent their ￼remaining 21 years establishing an intensive apple orchard in Boonville, a large vineyard near Ukiah, very extensive work at Benziger Family Winery—now the leading biodynamic vineyard in California, and an ever-expanding international vineyard consultancy that took them to Chile, Argentina, South Africa, Italy, Israel, and France. They served as president of the Biodynamic Association for seven years and also edited the “Biodynamics” quarterly journal.
They will be remembered by their many friends, co-workers, and clients for their astounding sense of humor, infectiously deep laughter, keen wit and intellect, and devotion to their art and craft. In later years they could describe the difficult concepts of biodynamics with a warmth and clarity that few have achieved. Had they lived a few more years they would have achieved great international renown. Alan York is survived by their devoted soul-mate and wife, Rose Ann, their son, August, their mother Joyce Williams and their sister, Jan Flowers. Alan departed this life on February 3 , 2013.
My love affair with the Basque country in Spain began roughly six years ago, when my then-boyfriend-now-husband took me one fateful August to meet their family and stay in their lazy seaside town, Ea. It was in this small pedestrian village, only a short forty-minute drive from Bilbao, where I got my first taste of what it meant to be Basque. The Basque country's history is complex, and it would be foolish of me to even attempt to recount what events defined this region. Nevertheless, one thing is for certain. As one of the central pillars of Basque identity, the region's cuisine holds a candle to no other.
While my husband has a multitude of positive qualities, I would be lying if I denied that this trip played a pivotal role in our love story. The easiest way to this woman's heart is most definitely through their stomach, and the Basque country knows how to wine and dine its visitors. Some might convey this by pointing out the fact that San Sebastian is one of the cities with the most Michelin starred restaurants in the world. However, after being able to visit multiple times I feel confident saying that just about any mom and pop Jatetxea in the smaller towns would blow your mind equally, and for a lot less damage to your checking account.
One of my favorite meals we always eat when we go is a recipe for Basque style meatballs, passed down through my husband's family, and now under the care of their great aunt Begoña. Tía, as everyone affectionately calls her, is one of the kindest souls you will ever have the pleasure of sharing company with. Speaking with them is like receiving the warmest hug, and they have a knack for making everyone feel welcome and part of the family. It should have been no surprise then when this dish evoked the same feelings within me as I took bite after bite. Begoña knew how much I loved this meal, and they generously shared the recipe with me once we were back home.
The beauty of this recipe is its simplicity. Like most recipes of the region, this one has few ingredients, but is able to bring out heightened flavors from each. Basque cuisine is not heavily spiced, and therefore relies on the excellence of its ingredients. For traditional Bilbaína style meatballs you should use a 50/50 mix of ground pork and veal, but since we are trying to abstain from beef consumption in our house (climate change is real, my friends) we stuck to just pork.
I'm giddy just thinking that tonight we will be eating some of these delicious meatballs, especially since it is not certain whether or not we will be able to visit this August as we have grown accustomed to. I hope you enjoy this recipe from our family to yours, and I hope one day you are lucky enough to visit the wondrous Basque country, and it steals your heart like it did mine.
Ingredients
For the meatballs:
1 lb ground pork (or ½ pork and ½ veal, ground)
1/3 cup plain breadcrumbs
1/3 cup whole milk
1 egg + 1 egg white
1 garlic clove, minced
1 tsp salt
½ tsp pepper
For the sauce:
1 large white onion, diced
2 garlic cloves, minced
2 medium carrots, diced
½ cup dry white wine, such as Pinot Grigio
1 roasted red bell pepper, skin removed (I used canned)
½ cup pure tomato sauce
4 cups of cooking stock, chicken, beef or vegetable (I used chicken and vegetable)
Salt and pepper, to taste
Method
Begin by preparing the sauce. In a large saucepan, sweat the onions, garlic and carrots in olive oil until the onions are translucent. Add the white wine to deglaze any delicious bits on the bottom, and then add in the bell pepper, tomato sauce and stock. Add salt and pepper to taste. Let those ingredients get to know each other over a low simmer for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the meatballs by presoaking the breadcrumbs in the milk. Add this into a bowl with the ground meat, eggs, garlic, salt and pepper and use your hands to combine well. In order to get soft, fall apart and melt in your mouth meatballs, take a small amount of your mixture and lightly form it into a ball-esque shape. In fact, I just lightly toss it from one palm to the other in order to make something that resembles a meatball without over packing it. Continue this process until you have made all the meatballs. Heat a large frying pan with a thin layer of olive oil and place the meatballs in, turning every so often to just brown the outside without completely cooking the meatballs. They should still be very raw in the middle. Puree your sauce in a blender with extreme caution (pulse, then blend!) in order to prevent scathing burns and sauce covered kitchen cabinets. Once it is smooth, transfer it back to the saucepan and get it back to a simmer. Add in your meatballs delicately to prevent them from falling apart and simmer for another 10-15 minutes, until they are fully cooked through but still tender. Do not overcook either. Serve with some rice, or eat them on their own with an extra glass of the white wine you used to cook them with (#winning). Either way they will be delicious. Bon appétit!

The Conservative government appointed two members to Canada's spy watchdog despite objections raised by NDP Leader Tom Mulcair during formal consultations on the nominees, documents reveal.
Correspondence with Prime Minister Stephen Harper shows Mulcair opposed appointing former MP Deborah Grey due to their lack of experience with intelligence issues.
They also feared the possibility of conflict of interest in the case of Gene McLean, a former security consultant.
In a third case, Mulcair found lawyer Yves Fortier's inexperience with security intelligence "cause for some concern," but they ultimately did not object to the appointment given Fortier's reputation as one of Canada's foremost commercial law experts.
The NDP released copies of the three letters to The Canadian Press.
The party has chastised the government for leaving two other chairs on the watchdog committee empty at a time when the government is looking to bolster the powers of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.
The Conservative government has repeatedly expressed confidence in the committee's ability to fulfil its role.
The committee was left as the only watchdog keeping an eye on CSIS when the government abolished the inspector general's office.
Two successive committee chairpeople — Dr. Arthur Porter and Chuck Strahl — resigned amid questions about their private business dealings.
Grey became interim chairperson earlier this year following Strahl's departure.
Porter, jailed in Panama, is fighting extradition to Canada, where they are wanted for their alleged role in a multimillion-dollar contracting conspiracy.
No veto power
The law governing CSIS says appointments to the review committee, known as SIRC, are to be made after consultation by the prime minister with leaders of the official Opposition and any party with at least twelve seats.
However, it does not include explicit veto powers.
In an April 2013 letter to Harper, Mulcair praised Grey as an accomplished Canadian who had given back to their community generously.
"However, I believe SIRC necessitates a nominee that is abreast of today's security intelligence environment and, preferably, steeped in Canadian and International Law. Mrs. Grey's wealth of experience and training unfortunately fail to meet these requirements," Mulcair wrote.
"If the experience of Dr. Porter has taught us nothing else, it's that any further appointments to SIRC must have unqualified credentials to support SIRC's mandate and to reaffirm Canadians faith in this institution."
In a March 2014 letter about McLean, the NDP leader said they didn't "believe it is appropriate to nominate them without measures being taken to deal with any possible conflict of interest."
"If you have further assurances regarding this possible conflict of interest, I would be pleased to hear them in order to be able to positively respond to this nomination."
An NDP spokesperson said they were unaware of any responses from the government concerning the three nominees.
A civil liberties group recently objected to Fortier heading up a review committee investigation of alleged spying on environmental activists, citing a conflict due to their former petroleum industry ties.
The British Columbia Civil Liberties Association asked that Fortier recuse themselves since they once sat on the board of TransCanada Pipelines — the company behind the Keystone XL project.
In a recent interview, Grey said the matter was "working its way through the proper channels to see if they will continue to hear that case."
Members of the Armed Forces will be denied automatic pay rises under controversial proposals put forward by George Osborne, The Telegraph has learnt.
The Chancellor wants to end the long-standing system of incremental pay rises that are given to military personnel after each year of service.
Senior military figures are angry at the way in which the Treasury is forcing the Ministry of Defence to make £1.5 billion in “efficiency savings” in the forthcoming Whitehall spending review.
Although defence spending will be fixed, billions of pounds in extra spending has been earmarked for new aircraft, ships, drones and special forces. Ministers want to make savings by changing the system of pay rises, which has led to a row behind the scenes between the Government and military chiefs.
Currently, military personnel in all three Services are given incremental pay rises for long service and automatic promotions, as well as other allowances, such as subsidised accommodation.
"Military chiefs are saying there is no point spending vast amounts of money on new kit if you don't have the manpower to operate them" A senior Whitehall source
Mr Osborne has indicated a wish to change the system, in much the same way that the police pay scale was altered to stop officers receiving wage rises automatically every year.
Whitehall insiders say that senior military officers are bitterly resisting the Chancellor's demands, arguing that any further cuts to benefits will simply persuade more highly qualified personnel to quit the Forces for better-paid jobs in the private sector.
• British Army already below smaller 82,000 targets
Instead, military chiefs want the Government to reduce spending on some costly equipment programmes, such as the F35B Joint Strike Fighter aircraft being bought for the two new Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers. There are also concerns about the £12 billion cost of 13 Type 26 frigates.
“Military chiefs are saying there is no point spending vast amounts of money on new kit if you don't have the manpower to operate them,” said a senior Whitehall source. “At a time when the economy is starting to take off, they argue you risk losing your best people if you start cutting down their benefits and pay.”
Military chiefs fear that sustained budget cuts over the past five years have already seriously eroded the value of many of these benefits.
Both the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force, which rely heavily on highly skilled engineers and technicians to keep their warships and warplanes operational, claim they are suffering from severe manpower shortages as a result of the recent cuts.
Senior officers in the Royal Navy, in particular, have warned that,without significant increases to manpower, they will struggle to crew the two Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers which are being built at a cost of £6 billion and are due to enter service at the end of the decade.

“Unless the Government realises that Service personnel are different to other public sector workers then they are not going to get the necessary numbers and quality of people to join our Armed Forces,” said Rear Admiral Chris Parry, a former naval officer and co-founder of the pressure group Votes in Defence.
“Those who serve in the Armed Forces are prepared to risk and sacrifice lives and limbs in the service of their country.
“But in recent years the value and status of being a member of the Armed Forces have been progressively eroded by the removal of allowances that were designed to ease the sheer inconvenience of Service life. It is no longer such an attractive proposition to join up when there are better-paid opportunities in the private sector.”
• Army launches recruitment drive amid fears of officer shortage
• Army offers soldiers £4,000 bonus to become clerks
The Government has pledged to spend £160 billion on new equipment for the Armed Forces over the next decade, as well as maintaining defence spending at the 2 per cent level of GDP required by Nato.
But Mr Osborne's insistence on finding an estimated £1.5 billion in efficiency savings has led military chiefs to fear this will result in further cuts to the benefits paid to military personnel.
General Sir Nick Houghton, the chief of the defence staff, who is working closely with Michael Fallon, the Defence Secretary, on the Strategic Defence and Security Review, the result of which will be announced on Nov 23, warned two years ago that Britain was in danger of being left with “hollowed out” armed forces, and warned against buying “exquisite equipment” without having the personnel needed to use it.
This past week, Washington hosted two of my least favorite annual events.
It began with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) who came to lobby for whatever the government of Israel might want at this particular moment. At week's end, the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) was in Washington rallying their crowd to bash the President and defend their "true conservative" principles.
During the past year, several commentators have, on occasion, pronounced both groups weakened and wounded, possibly fatally so. Conservatives were seen to be cannibalizing themselves, while AIPAC was reeling from having picked and lost two separate fights with President Obama: Syria and Iran sanctions. Based on the size and enthusiasm of their respective crowds and from the "red meat" thrown out by major speakers, neither group appeared to be in their death throes, but looks can be deceiving.
AIPAC is far from defeated. They still define the playing field and roles of engagement for most Middle East issues. Their operatives are well placed in Washington and their influence is real. Three years ago, they and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took on the Administration over whether or not the 1967 borders should be the basis for a lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians, and they won. AIPAC's allies in Congress turned out en masse to give the Israeli multiple standing ovations as they scolded the President and rejected their terms for peace.
This year was different. AIPAC hoped its lobbying might work to push the White House to attack Syria. They lost. Then, after President Obama launched negotiations with Iran in an effort to limit their nuclear program, AIPAC again challenged the White House, calling for new sanctions against Iran. The President fought back indicating that because such new legislation would have the effect of sabotaging the negotiations, they would veto any such effort. Once again, AIPAC lost.
As a fallback, AIPAC put everything it could think of into what it called the US-Israel Strategic Partnership Act -- a bill that would deepen the already too deep US ties with Israel in trade, technology, defense and intelligence sharing. When they threw in adding Israel to the "visa waiver" program, it was a step too far. Arab Americans lobbied hard that it would be fundamentally wrong for the US to grant Israel this benefit when Israel regularly discriminates against Arab American who attempt to enter Israel or the Occupied Territories. In the end, AIPAC lost. The bill passed, but without the automatic "visa waiver" provision.
If all that weren't enough, the "coup de grace" came the day before Netanyahu was to arrive at the White House to meet with the President. The Atlantic Magazine published a long interview with President Obama in which they alternately challenge, cautions, scolds and warns Netanyahu about the need for Israel to make the right decisions to advance peace.
There was no mention of all these setbacks at the AIPAC meeting. Administration officials came pledging their "unshakable" devotion to Israel. Senators, Democrats and Republicans alike, took aim at the Administration for not loving Israel enough. Netanyahu, as always, was passionately spinning their webs of deceit.
While listening to the speeches at the AIPAC meeting it might appear that nothing had changed, but it has. The group has suffered a few blows, and the most they have had to endure in a short period. They may not show it, but they feel it.
As the week closed out, CPAC gathered to lay out their agenda and hear from conservative leaders -- and those Republicans who may have strayed from the "true faith" and now need to burnish their conservative credentials.
As in past years, the speeches at CPAC were focused on rage over all things Obama. There were funny lines, to be sure, but a lot of angry and mean-spirited attacks, as well. Freshmen Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz were the crowd-pleasing "flavors of the year." Others like New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Senator Marco Rubio were there. They once held in high esteem but, after displaying some moderate tendencies, have fallen out of favor. Their appearances were designed to atone and receive the movement's blessing.
A highlight of the event is the CPAC's "straw poll," as delegates vote for the person they most want to be the party's standard bearer. It has become a major media event. This year, Rand Paul won the straw poll by a significant margin. In second place was Ted Cruz. Between them, Paul and Cruz garnered almost one-half the votes. Christie and Rubio finished way back in fourth and fifth place.
Aside from the energy and enthusiasm of the weekend, conservatives have a real problem. Here's what they agree on: they don't like Obama and they don't like government. They control Congress and can block most anything the President puts forward, but their movement is divided and their leaders don't much like each other. In primary after primary, ultra-conservatives are challenging more mainstream GOP'ers, sometimes defeating them, sometimes weakening them and other times forcing them to adopt policies that make them less electable.
Conservatives also have come to realize that they have a demographic problem. The US electorate is dramatically changing. Black, Latino and Asian voters are increasing with each election cycle. These groups vote for Democrats, as do significant majorities of young voters and educated women. Because conservative policies are so out of touch with the needs of these groups, the base of the conservative movement continues to shrink, further reducing the GOP's chances in national contests. Conservatives know they have these problems, but continue to blissfully ignore them.
Stimulation of serotonergic neurotransmission by psilocybin has been shown to shift emotional biases away from negative towards positive stimuli. We have recently shown that reduced amygdala activity during threat processing might underlie psilocybin's effect on emotional processing. However, it is still not known whether psilocybin modulates bottom-up or top-down connectivity within the visual-limbic-prefrontal network underlying threat processing. We therefore analyzed our previous fMRI data using dynamic causal modeling and used Bayesian model selection to infer how psilocybin modulated effective connectivity within the visual–limbic–prefrontal network during threat processing. First, both placebo and psilocybin data were best explained by a model in which threat affect modulated bidirectional connections between the primary visual cortex, amygdala, and lateral prefrontal cortex. Second, psilocybin decreased the threat-induced modulation of top-down connectivity from the amygdala to primary visual cortex, speaking to a neural mechanism that might underlie putative shifts towards positive affect states after psilocybin administration. These findings may have important implications for the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders.
“Drill, baby, drill” has become a slogan of those who want to produce more oil and gas and who scoff at alternatives to petroleum. But rarely mentioned is the expense required to get that oil and gas—and still more rarely mentioned is the energy required to access those resources.
Charles Hall, an ecologist at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse, has spent most of their long career trying to get fellow researchers and the public to take a serious look at the energy required to get the energy we use.  They are given credit for creating a measure known as the energy return on investment, or EROI—the ratio of energy output over energy input. (With oil, for example, the energy output would be the crude oil produced, and the energy input would be all that required to find the oil reservoir, drill the well and pump the oil out of the ground.) EROI is a crucial metric, Hall argues, because it helps us see which energy sources are high quality and which are not.
Hall and their students did pioneer work in this area, including a 1984 paper on the cover of Science. For many years, however, interest in the topic languished. But recent soaring oil prices and increasing difficulty of accessing new supplies have helped create economic hardships, leading to resurgent interest in EROI. Scientific American asked Hall to explain the basis of the EROI and how it pertains to our economy.
[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]
You're a self-described “nature boy” who became an ecologist. So how did you create the idea of energy return on investment (EROI)?
I had this unbelievable doctoral advisor, H. T. Odum of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. They said, “Well, Charlie, I don't think anyone has thought about fish migration from a systems perspective.”
I went down to the coast of North Carolina, looking for a place where I could do this research. And I found one: in this freshwater environment, where fish weren't supposed to be migrating, they were migrating like crazy.
And you approached this migration mystery from an energy-use perspective. How did you do that?
I measured the ecosystem productivity by the free-water oxygen technique. I measured it at five different places, upstream and downstream, and found some very clear patterns. The energy available to the fish was much more concentrated as you went upstream, and I developed this theory that the fish would migrate to capitalize on the abundance of energy for the first year or two of the life, and then the young fish would migrate downstream into a more stable but less productive environment.
The study found that fish populations that migrated would return at least four calories for every calorie they invested in the process of migration by being able to exploit different ecosystems of different productivity at different stages of their life cycles.
So from studying fish migration, was it a big leap to think about people and fossil fuels?
No, probably because Howard Odum was evolving in their thought processes. They wrote a book Environment, Power and Society at about that time. An amazing thing working with Odum was, for him, there are just systems. It doesn't matter if it's a forested system or a stream system or an estuarine system, or whether people are there or not. It's just a system—and systems have many similar patterns and many similar processes of consumption and production, and they often even have similar controls on them.
So, it was not difficult for me, because I was trained that way from Howard Odum. Also, when I was a graduate student there were a lot of very exciting things going on. Ecologists were much more involved—not just in biodiversity, which is where much of the focus is today, but in dealing with important issues of the relation of humans to resources. Paul Ehrlich [author of The Population Bomb (1968)], Garrett Hardin [known for their 1968 Science paper “The Tragedy of the Commons”], George Woodwell [founder of the Woods Hole Research Center], many other people—these were very influential to me as a graduate student.
For society's energy sources, is it important to consider EROI?
Is there a lot of oil left in the ground? Absolutely. The question is, how much oil can we get out of the ground, at a significantly high EROI? And the answer to that is, hmmm, not nearly as much. So that's what we're struggling with as we go further and further offshore and have to do this fracking and horizontal drilling and all of this kind of stuff, especially when you get away from the sweet spots of shale formations. It gets tougher and tougher to get the next barrel of oil, so the EROI goes down, down, down.
Is there some minimum EROI we need to have?
Since everything we make depends on energy, you can't simply pay more and more and get enough to run society. At some energy return on investment—I'm guessing 5:1 or 6:1—it doesn't work anymore.
What happens when the EROI gets too low? What's achievable at different EROIs?
If you've got an EROI of 1.1:1, you can pump the oil out of the ground and look at it. If you've got 1.2:1, you can refine it and look at it. At 1.3:1, you can move it to where you want it and look at it. We looked at the minimum EROI you need to drive a truck, and you need at least 3:1 at the wellhead. Now, if you want to put anything in the truck, like grain, you need to have an EROI of 5:1. And that includes the depreciation for the truck. But if you want to include the depreciation for the truck driver and the oil worker and the farmer, then you've got to support the families. And then you need an EROI of 7:1. And if you want education, you need 8:1 or 9:1. And if you want health care, you need 10:1 or 11:1.
Civilization requires a substantial energy return on investment. You can't do it on some kind of crummy fuel like corn-based ethanol [with an EROI of around 1:1].
A big problem we have facing the alternatives is they're all so low EROI. We'd all like to go toward renewable fuels, but it's not going to be easy at all. And it may be impossible. We may not be able to sustain our civilization on these alternative fuels. I hope we can, but we've got to deal with it realistically.
Do you think we're facing limits to growth now?
I think if you correct the U.S. GDP for debt—in other words, the debt is some kind of not-real growth—then I think the GDP hasn't grown at all since 2005. It's just grown through debt. I think clearly growth has declined; it's possible that growth has either stopped or may soon stop.
We know that the middle class has not increased its income now for 20 years. Behind that—not always the immediate cause, but looking over the shoulder of the causes—I find the decline in the availability of energy.
It's terrifying to people—politicians and economists—who base everything on growth. I think they won't talk about it because the concept is terrifying.
Most economists think economic growth can continue indefinitely, right?
It was easy to make economic theories that worked while we pumped more and more oil out of the ground, because whether you're a capitalist or a communist or a this-ist or a that-ist, they'd work—because there was more oil to make them work. We could afford all the corruption and inefficiencies in the past and still have quite a lot trickle down.
But now the pie is not getting that much bigger. Now, it's pretty clear that there are a lot of economic theories that aren't working very well.
How do these economic arguments relate to people's day-to-day lives?
Doesn't it mean food on the table, a roof over your head, gas in your car—a car itself? So economics isn't really about money. It's about stuff. We've been toilet trained to think of economics as being about money, and to some degree it is. But fundamentally it's about stuff. And if it's about stuff, why are we studying it as a social science? Why are we not, at least equally, studying it as a biophysical science?
Hall recently co-authored a book on this biophysical perspective with economist Kent Klitgaard, Energy and the Wealth of Nations: Understanding the Biophysical Economy (Springer, 2011).
As Anderson Cooper interviewed Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson on Tuesday's AC360, the CNN host brought up running mate Bill Weld's hyperbolic assertion likening Donald Trump's position on deporting illegal immigrants to the treatment of Jews by Nazis.
After Johnson doubled down on their running mate making the Nazi comparison, Cooper gave no pushback and simply asked if they believed such a plan is "inherently racist," and, not surprisingly, got an affirmative answer which was also not challenged.
After introducing the pre-recorded interview with a clip of Johnson speaking on the issue, then came Cooper's first question to the Libertarian candidate: "You obviously, as we just heard, take issue with Trump's immigration policies. Your running mate, Bill Weld, has compared Trump's deportation plan to Nazis' policies against Jews. Do you agree with that?"
John doubled down on the comparison as they responded:
I do. You know, coming from New Mexico, a border state, what he's saying is just incendiary. New Mexico is one of the four minority majority states. Fifty percent of the population of New Mexico is Hispanic, so what does that mean when we're going to deport 11 million illegal immigrants? Well, arguably, half the state of New Mexico is going to be subject to door-knocking and house searches and paper-checking.
Cooper followed up: "And you -- but you see it as inherently racist?"
Johnson responded:
I do. I think that, first of all, they call them murderers and rapists. Look, statistically, they commit far less crime than U.S. citizens. They're the cream of the crop when it comes to workers. They're not taking jobs that U.S. citizens want. We should make it as easy as possible for somebody that wants to come into this country to work, to be able to get a work visa. And a work visa should entail a background check and a Social Security card so that taxes get paid.
Instead of making any argument in the opposite direction, Cooper's next question merely moved on: "Libertarians traditionally align more on economic principles with Republicans than Democrats. Going forward. do you see Donald Trump as your main rival and therefore the main target of your critiques? Or how do you see the race ahead?"

With huge upset, Chad Morris delivered SMU a win that they hope will 'start a revolution' Share This Story On... Twitter

Staff Photographer Southern Methodist Mustangs running back Ke'Mon Freeman (13) breaks away for a big run against the Houston Cougars in the first quarter at Gerald J. Ford Stadium in University Park, Texas, Saturday, October 22, 2016. (Tom Fox/The Dallas Morning News)
By Bill Nichols , Special Contributor Contact Bill Nichols on Twitter: @BillNicholsDMN
UNIVERSITY PARK -- You could hardly recognize SMU when it took the field against No. 11 Houston on Saturday night. The Mustangs wore dark gray jerseys and pants and gray helmets that popped with a bright pink Mustang.
Five takeaways: Chad Morris earns signature win as SMU dominates Houston in upset
But even more startling was SMU's transformation on the field. A team that won only three games the previous two seasons dominated No. 11 Houston, 38-16, at Ford Stadium. The defining moment of the Chad Morris era was fittingly celebrated with fans storming the field. Some dangled on the goalposts, others just ran around throwing their hands in the air. But the majority surrounded the team in a big circle with Morris in the middle. This was the moment Morris and their staff have been longing for since taking over a team coming off a 1-11 season. They saw steady improvement in the first 18 games of their rebuilding project but only three victories. Their young team had grown tired of moral victories, which came in the form of close games against ranked opponents. When they walked into the lockerroom after an overtime loss to Tulsa two weeks ago, they saw widespread dejection.

But the coach noticed something far more significant in their players when they returned to the practice field. The disappointment seemed to have magnified their players' hunger to nail that elusive statement win. They played on that over the bye week, telling their players, "It just takes one [win] to start a revolution. It just takes one win to put some wind in our sails." Consider the revolution on. It was SMU's first victory over a ranked opponent since an overtime win over No. 20 TCU on Oct. 1, 2011. And it was the Mustangs' first win over a team ranked 11th or higher since the 1983 Cotton Bowl, 7-3 over No. 6 Pittsburgh. SMU's last victory over a ranked team at home was Sept. 10, 2005 versus No. 22 TCU (21-10). The lopsided upset over the Cougars resulted in a dramatically different mood. "While this might have shocked a lot of people and shocked the country, it didn't shock those guys," Morris said of their players and coaching staff. "This has been a building process, building from the ground up. For us to come in and get a signature win like this is huge. When we came off the field against Tulsa, that was as hurt of a locker room as I've ever been part of. For two weeks we've had to respond. And I shared with them that if we could all respond the right way, great things were coming."
After SMU's upset victory, Mustangs fans troll Houston with #HTownTakedown
The victory was special in many ways. About 300 recruits attended the game, and watched as the team bonded with fans on the field and then among themselves in the lockerroom. SMU's 22-point margin over a ranked team is its largest since a 44-14 win vs. No. 19 Texas on Oct. 26, 1985. SMU (3-4, 1-2 American Athletic Conference) led from the start, driving 88 yards to score on quarterback Ben Hicks' 1-yard run with 7:25 left in the first quarter. Hicks' 31-yard touchdown pass to Jeremiah Gaines and a 2-yard strike to Courtland Sutton in the back of the end zone gave SMU a 21-0 lead midway through the second quarter. Although the Mustangs fumbled at their 10-yard line to set up Houston's first score, SMU countered with Hicks' touchdown throw to James Proche 13 seconds before the first half ended. Hicks completed 16 of 31 passes for 228 yards and three touchdowns. Their offensive line dominated Houston's vaunted front, surrendering no sacks for the second straight game. The line also opened holes. Braeden West, from the Houston area, ran for 115 yards and one touchdown. And Courtland Sutton had seven catches for 83 yards and a touchdown. "I thought our guys were ready," Morris said. "For two weeks, our guys have had an edge about them. They've had this edge for the past two weeks. That showed me that they cared, that they believed. It also showed me that it was going to take just one big win. "It took a collective effort, It was everybody coming together, and you could see what's to come ahead. That lockerroom is crazy."

"Mr. Pagliano will invoke their right under the Fifth Amendment and decline to testify at the deposition noticed," Pagliano's lawyers said. | AP Photo Clinton tech aide plans to take the Fifth at deposition
A former information technology adviser to Hillary Clinton plans to exercise their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination at a deposition next week and wants to prevent any video recording being made of the session.
Lawyers for former State Department tech specialist Bryan Pagliano said in a court filing Wednesday that there's no valid reason to make an audio or video recording of the session since Pagliano doesn't plan to answer any of the questions he's asked by the conservative group Judicial Watch, which is pursuing Freedom of Information Act lawsuit related to Clinton's private email server. The group is scheduled to take Pagliano's deposition on Monday.

"Mr. Pagliano will invoke their right under the Fifth Amendment and decline to testify at the deposition," Pagliano's lawyers Mark MacDougall and Connor Mullin wrote. "Given the constitutional implications, the absence of any proper purpose for video recording the deposition, and the considerable risk of abuse, the Court should preclude Judicial Watch, Inc. ... from creating an audiovisual recording of Mr. Pagliano's deposition."
Acting on a request from another former aide to Clinton, Cheryl Mills, U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan already ruled that videos of the sessions should be put under seal. However, Pagliano's lawyers say there's still a chance the video could emerge later either with or without permission from the court.
"Judicial Watch may move to unseal the materials at any time. Furthermore, in the event of a leak or data breach at the court reporting company, Mr. Pagliano would be hard-pressed to prevent further dissemination and republication of the video. Given that there is no proper purpose for videotaping the deposition in the first place, Judicial Watch's preference should yield to the significant constitutional interests at stake," Pagliano's attorneys added.
A spokesperson for Clinton's presidential campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the development.
Judicial Watch indicated Wednesday that it will resist the proposal to ban video recording.
"Judge Sullivan already put in place a mechanism that addresses these concerns," Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in an interview. "There are always credibility issues that are raised by any assertion of the Fifth Amendment. This video, we believe will be helpful to Judge Sullivan in assessing the witness' demeanor when asserting the Fifth Amendment and in response to other questions."
Sullivan acknowledged the latest dispute Wednesday evening, issuing a brief order giving Judicial Watch under 5 p.m. Thursday to respond to Pagliano's motion and allowing the tech specialist's lawyers to respond by noon Friday.
Pagliano previously took the Fifth when they were called to appear at a closed session of the House Benghazi Committee. However, they reportedly spoke with FBI investigators looking into the Clinton email set-up after receiving some type of immunity from the government.
Clinton testified before the Benghazi panel in public session and said they encouraged everyone with information to cooperate with the committee. Them campaign expressed disappointment with Pagliano's decision to take the Fifth last year in that probe. Clinton's camp said it was pleased when Pagliano eventually talked to the FBI.
However, Clinton has taken a selective approach to cooperating with inquiries into the email issue. They and their top aides declined to speak with investigators from the State Department's Office of Inspector General preparing a report on the impact of private email accounts on recordkeeping when they were secretary of state and during the tenure of previous secretaries.
A girl and boy needed to be rescued by the Canadian Coast Guard on Lake Winnipeg Saturday, after strong winds blew their inflatable dinghy far from the Gimli shore.
It happened just days after the union that represents coast guard employees revealed the federal government plans to close the station in Gimli, as well as ones on the Red River in Selkirk, Man., and on Lake of the Woods in Kenora, Ont.
"They weren't able to paddle back into shore. They were drifting away quite quickly," said Jeff MacDonald, the officer-in-charge at the coast guard station in Gimli.
"They were too far for somebody to try to swim after them."
The girl is 10, the boy seven. MacDonald said the guard station received a call from the panicked father around 2:15 p.m.

When their crew members reached the kids, they were close to 500 metres from shore. Neither was wearing a life jacket and one of them could not swim, according to MacDonald.
"With us being right here in the harbour, we were there within a couple minutes," they said. "We got the kids out of the raft, got the raft [into the boat] and brought them back to the harbour safe and sound."
There have been five search-and-rescue cases already this month by the coast guard in Gimli as the weather has warmed and people have flocked to the beach. (Canadian Coast Guard)
Tracy Martin saw the coast guard rescue the kids and said it was extremely windy out that day.
"They wouldn't have lasted long if they capsized," said Martin, who spends their summers on Lake Winnipeg
Plan to shut down coast guard 'terrifying'
Martin worries about the federal government's plan to close the coast guard station in Gimli.
"There are many men and women that make their living on this lake as fishers that need to have a safety net if it gets bad out there."
"It's terrifying to think that you're going to be out there and not have help to rescue you if you need it."
Martin said the elated parents along with a cheering crowd were waiting at the dock and thanked the coast guard members.
"They were very grateful that we were here," MacDonald added.
"They felt pretty helpless at the beach, that's for sure, when that little rubber boat was drifting away."
They said there have been five search-and-rescue cases already this month as the weather has warmed and people have flocked to the beach or headed out on the open water to fish.
Margot Bentley has no idea what they unleashed.
Dying with Dignity, a 30-year-old organization dedicated to expanding end-of-life options, is reporting "goodbye" letters that say, "I don't want to end up like Margot Bentley."
"People are angry with us" says Wanda Morris, the organization's CEO. "They say we told them advance-care directives about dying are followed these days."
Not for Margot Bentley.
Bentley, 83, a retired nurse who looked after patients with dementia, wrote what they called their "statement of wishes" in 1991. That statement appeared clear to them and their family, but a judge did not see it that way.
Bentley's case demonstrates just how complicated advance-care directives are.
They authorized their husband and daughter to make medical decisions on their behalf "if I reach the point when I cannot recognize my family." Margot Bentley wrote what they called their "statement of wishes" in 1991 before developing severe dementia. They wrote, "I direct that I be allowed to die," and they specified no heart resuscitation, no surgery, no breathing intervention and "no nourishment or liquids." (CBC)
They wrote, "I direct that I be allowed to die," and they specified no heart resuscitation, no surgery, no breathing intervention and "no nourishment or liquids."
Bentley was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease 16 years ago. Now they languish in a semi-vegetative state in a care home run by Fraser Health, the regional health care authority in Abbotsford, B.C.
 They are unresponsive in every way but one: They continue to eat when prodded with a spoon.
Fraser Health refused to follow their directive, when Bentley's family asked it to do so.
Katherine Hammond, their daughter and also a nurse, asked as an alternative to take their mother home and with the help of palliative care nurses allow their mother to die at home.
The response from Fraser Health was to put a "police order" on Margot Bentley's chart. Abbotsford police were to be called if Hammond or their stepfather attempted to remove Bentley.
The family went to court. Earlier this year the court ruled that by opening their mouth Bentley was consenting to be fed.
The judge said feeding with a spoon is not medical care. It is personal care, and thus not included in Bentley's directive.
"It sure starts to feel like splitting hairs," says Krista James, national director of the Canadian Centre for Elder Law.
Margot Bentley's family says they want the care home to stop spoon-feeding their mother, who barely moves on their own. (CBC)
Margot Bentley's family says they want the care home to stop spoon-feeding their mother, who barely moves on their own. "The family is very clear that they are doing what their mother wanted. The hospital says they can't deny food to someone in their care."
The unresolved question is whether a son or a daughter, a legally appointed representative, would be permitted to refuse food or water on a patient's behalf.
"We do not know," says Joanne Taylor, executive director of Nidus, B.C.'s personal planning resource centre. "We have not had a case."
James says, "The worst thing about this case is that it scares people into thinking they have absolutely no power over their lives as an illness progresses."
Compounding the confusion in Bentley's case is the recent Supreme Court of Canada decision in the Carter case, which removed the prohibition against physician-assisted death in Canada.
Hammond has run out of legal options, but they continue to visit their mother.
"When caregivers, well-meaning people, say 'But we have to feed your mom.' I say, 'This isn't about what you want — this is about what my mother wanted.'"
This week on The Sunday Edition
Starting at 9 a.m. ET on Sunday, June 14 on CBC Radio's The Sunday Edition:
Thousands of individuals and organizations swept through San Juan on Saturday, June 18, to demand the immediate de-colonization of Puerto Rico.
The massive crowd convened near the Governor's mansion, directly in front of the historic La Princesa prison, where Don Pedro Albizu Campos was jailed and tortured for their independence beliefs.
La Princesa is now the Puerto Rico Bureau of Tourism building.
A typical US news report of this overwhelming June 18 event undercounted the crowd, alleging that “hundreds” rather than thousands participated.
It also referred to the marchers and organizers as “bankrupt Puerto Ricans,” and claimed that the island “enjoys independence in most issues, but still answers to Washington on matters of foreign relations.”

http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2016/06/18/puerto-rico-independence-movement-awaits-un-visit-demands-decolonization/
Perhaps this reporter was not familiar with the Jones Act, the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, the US Bankruptcy Code, the PROMESA bill, the Financial Control Board, the plenary jurisdiction of US Congress, the insular cases, the Supremacy and Territorial clauses of the US Constitution, or the recent US Supreme Court decisions which applied those two clauses, in declaring that Puerto Rico is a “territorial possession” of the US with no inherent sovereignty in any area (the Sanchez Valle and Franklin Templeton decisions).
INSPIRATION AND COURAGE FROM DON HERIBERTO
The marchers and this writer take great pride, in reporting that a noble man named Heriberto Marín Torres took part in the demonstration.
Don Heriberto played a central role in the Nationalist Revolution of 1950.
They fought bravely in Jayuya on October 30, 1950.
They helped Blanca Canales to raise the Puerto Rican flag and declare the Republic of Puerto Rico.
They went to jail for many years, together with Don Pedro Albizu Campos, for believing in the independence of Puerto Rico.
They wrote Eran Ellos, a brilliant account of their prison experience. Page for page, Eran Ellos is more honest and complete than anything written by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.
https://waragainstallpuertoricans.com/2015/11/12/a-treasure-in-puerto-rico-don-heriberto-marin-torres/
When asked about the demonstration, Don Heriberto did not mince words. Summoning a lifetime of experience, they said:
“We are here today to protest against everything the empire is doing to us…but above all, we are demanding independence for Puerto Rico.”
SARTELL, Minn. – There's a sign in the lunchroom of Minnesota's Sartell High School: Students can choose two packets of barbecue sauce, or three ketchup packets, or two ketchups and a mustard, or just one packet of mayonnaise.
The new condiment quotas are the product of new federal regulations that strictly limit calories, fat, sodium, sugar and most other nutritional elements of school snacks and lunch foods.
The rules, championed by First Lady Michelle Obama as a means to combat childhood obesity, are part of the Healthy and Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. The measure, implemented in phases since 2012, overhauled the National School Lunch Program to force schools that receive federal lunch funding to offer “healthier” meals and school snacks for students.
But the overbearing regulations have thus far convinced a record number of students to bring their lunches from home. Lunchrooms across the country are experiencing significant revenue loss, and increasing waste due to a requirement that all students take a fruit or vegetable, whether they eat it or not.
As a result, many districts are opting to forego their federal funding to serve students food they want to eat.
The latest round of regulations – which regulate nutritional elements of snacks sold at school – went into effect this year, and Sartell officials said they've seen an immediate impact, SCTimes.com reports.
District Food Services Director Brenda Braulick “says last year, between the middle and high schools, (the la carte line) brought in $2,200 a day. So far this year, it's been about $1,400 a day, though they say the number is increasing.”
The sales loss is troubling, they said, because the new whole-grain rich foods are more expensive to begin with.
“The students enjoy mini corn dogs. We won't be able to serve those every day,” Braulick said.
“All juices must be 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice, or diluted with water but no added sweeteners,” they said.
Elementary students are now limited to 8-ounce servings of milk or juice, and middleschoolers are limited to 12 ounces, SCTimes.com reports.
Snacks are now limited to 200 calories, while full lunches cannot exceed 850.
“Any condiments or accompaniments must also be included in that nutritional profile,” said Braulick, adding that the district is lobbying for exemptions, such as eliminating the mandatory fruit or vegetable requirement.
“To tell them they have to take it does not get them to consume it,” they said.
Meanwhile, at Minnesota's largest high school, officials have already determined that the nonsensical federal lunch edicts are more trouble than they're worth.
Wayzata High School officials dropped out of the National School Lunch Program this year, along with a lot of other schools in many states, because the one-size-fits-all regulations don't jibe with the school's diverse student body, CBS reports.
“We're trying to make sure they get enough food, because if they are athletes, they are here at six in the morning until at least six at night, so they are hungry,” Sue Johnson, the school's cafeteria coordinator.
Another reason the school is ditching the federal lunch rules is because much of the “healthy” food – such as the mandatory fruit or vegetables – ended up in the trash, anyway.
“We certainly did see an increase in waste … because it had to be there, or had to be on the tray,” Mary Anderson, supervisor for the Culinary Express Department at Wayzata schools, told CBS.
Despite a 25 cent increase in the price of lunches at Wayzata High School this year, school lunch sales have increased significantly with the new menu – a clear indication the district made the right move.
“We're seeing increases between two and three hundred lunches a day,” Anderson said.
San Francisco has the lowest percentage of kids of any major U.S. city. But some families stay, and many loves it
"Where have all the children gone?" in San Francisco A recent New York Times story asks. "Where have all the children gone?" in San Francisco A recent New York Times story asks.

The New York Times published a story over the weekend reporting that San Francisco has the lowest percentage of kids of any major U.S. city.
The story titled "Where have all the Children Gone?" doesn't reveal anything any parent raising a city kid in the 21st century doesn't already know. Confronted with high-priced housing and a difficult-to-navigate education system, droves of new parents move from San Francisco to the suburbs to buy a home with a backyard and send their kids to a neighborhood public school.
In numbers, the mass exodus translates into a city with only 13 percent of its population under 18 years old. By comparison, youth make up 21 percent of the population in New York and 23 percent in Chicago.
As a mother of three kids in San Francisco, I'm familiar with this trend because my years of parenting have been filled with heartbreak over saying goodbye to fleeing families we grew close to through playgroups, preschool, the neighborhood.
We hugged our preschool friend Amelia goodbye before their family relocated across the Bay in Albany. My daughter and I cried our eyes out as we watched the moving van drive away from Alex, Izzy and Sammy's house on our block.
I was elated when one of my dearest friends finally had a baby, but crestfallen when they decided to move to Lafayette before their son started preschool. I'd assumed their son would grow up with my kids. Same thing happened with another best friend who fled for Mill Valley.
My heart eventually numbed to the the mass exodus and I now approach new friendships in the way an Army brat might at their third high school. I'm eager to meet new people but hesitant to get too close to protect myself from future partings.

Back in 2005 in a San Francisco Magazine article, Leslie Crawford, an S.F. mom who had only one toddler at the time, wrote about the same anguish they felt losing many friends to the suburbs.
Crawford's article occupied playground chatter among S.F. parents for weeks because so many could relate to the unnerving feeling of raising kids in a community where everyone was leaving or talking about leaving and constantly questioning whether the city was a suitable place to raise children.
I decided to circle back with Crawford as I knew they stayed in the city and I was curious how they were feeling about family life in San Francisco. Crawford now has two kids, ages 11 and 19, and they and their husband run Urban Putt, the Mission restaurant serving up a unique combination of pub grub and miniature golf.
We talked about the uncertainty that S.F. parents feel raising kids in the city, especially in the early years, and then typically once your child enters kindergarten, your friends start to stick around.
"Once people can commit, have a house, are able to find an OK school, then those suburban dreams might subside," Crawford said. "Of course, we're talking about a specific socioeconomic subset of San Francisco."
For Crawford, the parenting thing really started to click when their kids became tweens.
"Once your kid, reaches 12, you are free," they said. "You're no longer the permanent Uber driver. They start getting to ride public transportation and they become independent."
They added: And of course, everything the city has to offer and all the culture is a huge plus. I think there's so much going on in the city and it can distract kids from drugs. I've heard there are drugs everywhere in the suburbs."
Crawford had many positive things to say about raising kids in the city, and I decided to reach out to my other friends who've committed to staying here to see what they had to say.
The Times story and many other stories focus on the the parents who pick up their kids and run for the Marin hills. But what about those parents who stay? What's their story? Here's what some of those committed to the city have to say.
We've stayed in SF because it's such a vibrant place to raise children. No matter what your child's interest -- sculpture, geocaching, Shakespearean theater -- there is a class and/or a club for them. Plus being able to enjoy the outdoors all year long is amazing. History, culture, great dining, great movie houses, great natural beauty; I'm having a perfectly wonderful time introducing my 11-year-old to everything that makes this city great. Oh and -- great public transportation means they can take themselves anywhere they want and needs to go; I'm not stuck driving them around. —Joyce Slaton Lollar, S.F. mom We live in SF and have no desire to move. —Iris Hu, S.F. mom Not considering leaving and I don't feel like I'm "sticking it out," because of the tremendous benefits of living in the city. I grew up in the suburbs and I'm happier in the city. —Jennifer Waits, S.F. mom The city offers the kids: 1. An exposure to true diversity as the suburbs tend to be a bit more homogeneously organized per area. 2. The city offers engaging activities. As an example I live in the mission where I've taken my kid to Dance Mission, ODC Dance, Red Poppy for theater, et cetera. 3. Contrary to thinking that kids will be more exposed to drugs in the cities, I think that because they are more engaged with interesting activities such as the ones mentioned above, they less likely to do drugs. 4. You don't have to drive everywhere so you get a chance to exercise and explore the city on foot with your kids. 5. Kids will leave in cities why not then growing comfortable with them.... I could keep on going. I love the countryside and we like to do so as much as we can and would love to have a place in the countryside but for me a suburb is an in between in which you have to drive a lot. —Carmen Cordovez, S.F. mom We will never leave SF. There is no other city, town or country that has the beautiful and ever-changing diverse landscape of our city. The rest are dead and dying. —S.F. dad Kevin Chanel I think my kids are interesting and have a compassionate world view having been raised in SF and attended public school. They have been exposed to so many different people and have been able to access amazing cultural and arts institutions. —Sandra Halladey, S.F. mom I had a very interesting ski lift conversation with a man who thought it shocking and appalling that I would raise my children in the city. I was raised in San Francisco and feel proud to be raising a second generation of San Franciscians. It's one thing to teach your children about diversity, the LGBTQ community and having choices. I think growing up in this city you are exposed to a visual cultural landscape that forms you and makes you more liberal than any textbook or conversation can. —S.F. mom Cary Cronholm Rose As my kids' public school mantra stated, the city is the campus. They are exposed to museums, diversity, homelessness, nature, naked penises (hello Castro and 17th St!), 100,000-people marches and everything in between. And once they get their (free!) Clipper card, they develop an independence and street smartness that their suburban counterparts don't. My kids are teenagers now and we never thought once about leaving. Good burritos and dim sum helps. —S.F. mom Meesha Halm
Are you raising kids in the city? What makes it a great place for families?
Donald Trump's dominant victory in New Hampshire prompted Carly Fiorina and their pal Chris Christie to drop out of the race. Beyond that, though, the win earned Trump just 11 delegates -- 3 percent of their current total and just less than 1 percent of the total he'd need to be the nominee.
There was symbolic value to the win. But it didn't really matter much.
That's the thing to these contests: It's only the delegates that count. So Ted Cruz may have had the second-biggest margin of victory of the year in Kansas on Saturday, but they only netted the seventh-most delegates of any contest.
So, setting aside the winners of states, who actually won on Saturday?
On the Republican side, it appears to have been Cruz, whose victory in Maine and narrowing of the contest in Louisiana earned them the most delegates of any Republican. They went into the day trailing Trump by 98 delegates, according to early calculations from Real Clear Politics, and came out trailing them by only 84.
Between the Democrats, it seems Hillary Clinton had a better Saturday, gaining 51 delegates to Sanders's 45. They extended their lead to more than 200 delegates -- not counting their large lead among superdelegates.
These totals aren't final. Delegate counts depends on often-intricate calculations, which is one reason why media outlets tend to focus more on the winners of states. But in a race to a pre-set finish line, it's the length of the stride that matters, not how people move their feet.
Andy Murray claimed the Munich Open title in their maiden clay-court final
Britain's Andy Murray has won their first clay-court title with a 7-6 (7-4) 5-7 7-6 (7-4) victory over German Philipp Kohlschreiber in the Munich Open final.
It was the 32nd ATP title of the Scot's career as they prepare for the French Open at the end of the month.
In a rain-interrupted match, the top seed needed just over three hours to beat the world number 24 Kohlschreiber.
"It was a really tough match, they served very close to the line and I was getting frustrated," said Murray, 27.
They became the first Briton to win an ATP-ranked event on clay since Buster Mottram in Palma in April 1976.
Murray, playing in their first tournament since marrying long-term girlfriend Kim Sears last month, added: "I didn't realise I was the first Brit to win on clay for so long, so that's obviously an honour."
They and Kohlschreiber could meet again in the second round of this week's Madrid Masters.
The final resumed on Monday after heavy rain stopped play on Sunday evening with Kohlschreiber leading 3-2 in the first set.
Both players confidently held serve to take the opener into a tie-break, and it was world number three Murray, watched by new coach Jonas Bjorkman, who got the mini-break to snatch the set after almost an hour.
Murray had three break points at 4-3 up in the second set, but Kohlschreiber held their nerve and then broke Murray in the 11th game before serving out to level the match.
There were no breaks in the third set and Murray clinched victory on their second match point in another tie-break when Kohlschreiber, the winner in Munich in 2007 and 2012, sent a backhand long.

This new "agency" model let the publishers price their books at $12, $13, or $14 a pop, perhaps more. Some books saw their prices jump over 50 percent, Judge Cote wrote in their opinion.
But Apple went even further. Selling ebooks at $14 might be nice for the publishers, but bad for Apple's business if Amazon were still selling the same titles for $9.99. So Apple proposed what's called a "most-favored nation" clause that made the new, higher prices conditional on there not being any other retailers selling the same books for less. The clause forced publishers to set the price at whatever the lowest price on the market was -- in this case, the same old $9.99 that, ahem, certain other companies were charging.
The publishers obviously weren't happy about this, because it put a great deal of pressure on them to end their wholesale agreement with Amazon.
"As Apple made clear to the publishers," Cote wrote, "'there is no one outside of us that can do this for you."
You can see where this is going. Not only was Apple's plan to raise ebook prices overall; its idea was to break Amazon's stranglehold over e-book pricing without getting its own hands dirty. In the words of Apple, the idea was to "move the whole market off [of] $9.99" simply by getting the publishers to act in their financial interest.
Apple maintains that it was never engaged in a conspiracy.
"We've done nothing wrong and we will appeal the decision," the company said Wednesday in a statement.
It's still unclear what the penalty will be for Apple; that's being the subject of another proceeding to follow. But if Apple and the publishers were the losers in this debate, individual consumers won big. And so did Amazon, which still holds an estimated 60 percent of the ebook market despite being at 90 percent in 2009.

The Co-operators will be closing the doors on its current downtown offices and finding a new home in the city's south end.
According to a news release from the City of Guelph, the insurance and financial services company will be building a new “state-of-the-art facility” for 2023 in Guelph's south end.
Bernie Mitchell, the Co-operators' vice-president of human resources and work place services, said in an emailed statement that they expect construction on the site will begin by late 2018. They added the new location will be the workplace for approximately 1,000 employees.
The new location will consolidate the company's offices at 130 Macdonell St., 98 Macdonell St. and 649 Scottsdale Dr., which will have their leases expire at that time.
The news release does not specify the exact location of the new headquarters. Michelle Robichaud, a spokesperson for the Co-operators, says they are unable to share the exact location of the new headquarters at this time.
Mayor Cam Guthrie says the insurance company had been looking at options outside of Guelph prior to the south end location being found.
“It's very positive that they are choosing to stay in Guelph, and from a business perspective, I appreciate their present needs, which include the consolidation of three of their offices into one, but they're also looking at their future growth needs, and that a potential opportunity for them where they would like to build allows them that flexibility for that future growth as well,” they tell the Mercury Tribune.
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two of the media industry's highest profile executives said on Friday they would leave NBC Universal and CNN, victims of a ratings war and chaotic shifts in the business.
NBC Universal Chief Executive Jeff Zucker will step down once Comcast Corp takes control of the company, expected by the end of this year.
CNN's U.S. network chief, Jonathan Klein, left the pioneering cable network on Friday.
Zucker had rocketed up the corporate ladder but recently encountered several high-profile setbacks, including unsuccessfully moving Jay Leno to prime-time and then having to move them back to late night.
The announcement of their departure came about an hour after Time Warner Inc's CNN said Klein had been replaced.
Both Zucker and Klein had been under a harsh spotlight for months as their networks lost viewers in the increasingly vicious battle to win prime-time evening slots.
These management shake-ups follow the resignation earlier this month of ABC News President David Westin after 13 years.
Zucker, 45, said in an interview with Reuters that they wished they had been able to fix the NBC broadcast network, which has had steep ratings declines and few genuine hits in the last four years.
“I came to grips with the right time for me to move on and at the same time Comcast said to me they wanted me to move on, so we kind of got to the same place,” Zucker said.
“My biggest regret is that we haven't had more success in turning round NBC Entertainment,” they said. “Other than that, I feel very confident about what we've done with the company.”
Zucker said they would leave the job once Comcast had completed its deal to take control of NBC Universal from current owner General Electric Co. The deal is expected to close by the end of 2010.
Many media watchers had anticipated that Zucker, who became chief executive at NBC Universal in 2007, would leave NBC after the Comcast deal was announced in December.
Steve Burke, Comcast's chief operating officer, is overseeing preparations for integrating NBC Universal, and analysts have they could end up running the business once the deal closes.
Other media executives who could be candidates for senior jobs at NBC Universal include former News Corp Chief Operating Officer Peter Chernin and Tom Freston, one-time boss at Viacom Inc.
HITS AND MISSES
Zucker had no shortage of success at NBC Universal. They joined the company straight out of college in 1986, and worked their way through the ranks until taking over as chief executive in 2007.
 They are credited with building up NBC Universal's strong cable networks, which now account for roughly 60 percent of NBC Universal's revenue. The company also owns a movie studio and theme parks.
In recent years, however, they have found themselves at the center of controversies like their handling of NBC's signature late-night program, “The Tonight Show.” Comedian Conan O'Brien took over the show from Jay Leno last year as part of a long-planned succession. But O'Brien quit after the network asked for Leno to return as a lead-in.
Industry watchers also questioned Zucker's decision to make Ben Silverman head of NBC Entertainment in 2007, which was soon followed by ratings declines. Silverman left in 2009.
NO JOY FOR KLEIN AT CNN
Klein, who spent six years as president of CNN US, was pushed out amid a restructuring of CNN's prime-time program lineup.
“I feel disappointed and wistful about leaving a lot of people I really like,” Klein told Reuters in an interview. “CNN was pursuing a structural change that didn't leave room for me.”
Klein said they were surprised by the timing of their departure because CNN is about to roll out new prime-time shows with presenters they brought to the network, including British journalist Piers Morgan, former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer and columnist Kathleen Parker.
“I would have thought the reckoning would come after the shows had launched, and we could tell something about the quality and the performance,” they said.
Klein has been criticized at CNN, which has been badly trailing News Corp's Fox News. In the prime-time evening slot, which is largely seen as the ‘face' of any cable network, CNN has dropped to fourth place on some nights behind Fox News, MSNBC and CNN's sister network HLN.
Ken Jautz, a longtime CNN executive who most recently oversaw the HLN network, will replace him.
Microsoft has patented a tactile touchscreen that uses pixel-sized shape-memory plastic cells to produce a 'real' texture, reflecting what is seen on the screen. The technique is designed to give users sufficient feedback to make it feel as though they are interacting with the images pictured on their screen, which may make physical keyboards a thing of the past.
According to the patent, the tactile touchscreen display will be made out of a light-induced shape-memory polymer. This will become solid and stick out when a particular wavelength of ultraviolet light is transmitted through it, soft when another wavelength hits it. By varying the occurance of these frequencies, texture can be created on the fly.
In the patent, inventor Erez Kikin-Gil said the idea is aimed at table-sized displays such as the those used in Microsoft's 'Surface'. A projector is built into Surface devices, and produces an on the table top. Infrared sensors then detect where a user is interacting with the screen, and produce the textual feedback.
The Tall Ship Lynx, a modern interpretation of an 1812 American privateer, is scheduled to sail into St. Pete on Wednesday morning where it has found a permanent winter home.
The 110-foot ship is expected to come under the Sunshine Skyway Bridge with full sails sometime around 10 a.m. It will then head into the Vinoy Basin/North Yacht Basin, do a four-gun salute and make their way to Harborage Marina where they will berth until the seasonal dock is finalized right next to the ferry. They plan to begin opening the boat up to the public for tours, sailing trips, and corporate events this weekend.
The idea of offering the Lynx a permanent berth first came up during then-Mayor Bill Foster's administration. But the idea never seemed to gel until recently, said Greg Holden, chair of the St. Petersburg Area Chamber of Commerce. More recently, with the support of Council member Ed Montanari, Mayor Rick Kriseman, local businesses and others, the dream looks as if it might become reality.
“This is one of those five-year, overnight successes,” Holden said.
It's an “amazing” opportunity for the city, they said. Having a tall ship in port is a draw for businesses and tourists. It's also an attraction to help more people get out onto the water and to learn a bit of history.
The Lynx, they said, would harken back to the days of the Bounty, which was a reconstruction of the 1787 Royal Navy sailing ship HMS Bounty. The Bounty summered in New England and wintered in St. Pete, operating out of the Pier.
“There's been an overwhelming amount of support” for having the Lynx use St. Petersburg as a permanent winter home, said Don Peacock, executive director of the Lynx Education Foundation. “We're looking at this as a long-term program.”
The Lynx was built as a hands-on educational tool to teach American history. When they were in St. Petersburg last winter, Peacock said the crew worked with recreational centers in south St. Petersburg and with Admiral Farragut Academy. Kids from both sailed on the ship for a day while they learned how to sail them the way they were sailed in 1812 when the original Lynx went to sea.
“It's all done by hand,” Peacock said.
Peacock said the Lynx would like to expand its outreach to more schools and recreational centers this year.
The Lynx and its educational programs are run by a non-partisan, nonprofit organization. The funding comes from donations and from the fees that corporations and members of the public pay to go on sails or to rent the Lynx for events.
The Lynx is an interpretation of an 1812 vessel of the same name that was one of the first privateers to take to the seas after the start of the War of 1812. A privateer was used to prey on British merchant vessels. Although the Lynx was designed like a privateer, they were outfitted for trade so they could help keep supply lines open for the Americans during the war. They were captured about a year into the war and saw service as a Royal Navy vessel called the Mosquidobit. In the late 1990s, the modern Lynx was built to the plans of the original.

Leaked papers revealing investments in tax havens by the world's wealthy suggest U2 frontman Bono used a company based in low-tax Malta to buy part of a shopping mall in Lithuania.
The Guardian newspaper says the “Paradise Papers” document trove reveals that the singer was an investor in Maltese company Nude Estates, which bought the Ausra shopping center in 2007.
Bono's spokesperson told the paper that the rocker, whose real name is Paul Hewson, was a “passive minority investor in Nude Estates Malta Ltd., a company that was legally registered in Malta until it was voluntarily wound up in 2015.”
The Irish band has faced past criticism over its tax arrangements.
In 2011 protesters inflated a giant balloon reading “U Pay Tax 2?” during U2's set at the Glastonbury Festival.
August 5, 2016 - News Post
I have two hours until my wife flies back into town. I should probably clean, get some work done, at least do the dishes, but I wont... DOOM is calling out to me.
If you haven't played it, DOOM is a plot-free modern reimagining of the first-person shooter from the early 90's... and it's beautiful in every way. I could play this for months without stopping, but as someone who tells people that he's busy all the time, I also love the the fact that it's a game that I can pick up for a few minutes at a time in between writing webcomics or whatever it is that I do.
Oh hey, speaking of webcomics, are you guys reading Molly Beans? It's sorta like my comic but with a plot, quality art, characters you care about, and a better grasp of software development. You should be reading it. Molly is celebrating 6 months of making comics today, go there and tell them I sent you (just speak directly into your screen).
That's about it from the world of Jeff. I now have 1 hour and 52 minutes to fill with DOOM, and writing anything more to you would stand in the way of that.
Stop standing in my way!

Police: Hopkins Student Found Dead Accidentally Fell From High-Rise
Police say it appears that a Johns Hopkins University student athlete found dead last week near the campus accidentally fell to their death from a high-rise building near the campus.
Baltimore police spokesperson T. J. Smith said at a news conference Monday that it appears that Abigail Bastien of Sandusky, Ohio, fell a significant distance. Smith says police are still awaiting toxicology results, but "everything points" to their death being accidental.
University officials say Bastien was found dead Thursday morning.
Bastien, who was entering their sophomore year, was a sprinter on the track and field team and a member of the Alpha Phi sorority. The university says Bastien's coaches say they always had a smile on their face and loved being a student-athlete.

I'm always trying to dream up easy-to-make DIY toys that are fun, educational, and affordable. Frame Lacers are a colorful DIY toy that double as a great fine motor skills activity for kids. The bonus is I was able to make them in about 30 minutes for roughly $4 each.

Step One Remove the metal tabs in the center of the frame with pliers.
Remove the metal tabs in the center of the frame with pliers. Step Two Mark equidistant holes around your frame. Start in the corners and then mark equally spaced holes in between. Our frame had a hole at the center of the back so I tried to avoid that. When using a wide frame mark two sets of holes. I suggest a minimum of 3/4” apart.

Drill your holes using a larger bit. I used a 3/16″ bit. Step Four Sand it!* Sand both sids of the frame and the edges of the holes to prevent against splinters. Since this is made from an inexpensive piece of wood you will probably encounter a bit of splintering around the holes. Roll up a piece of sandpaper and push it through each hole to smooth out the hole interior.

Roll up a piece of sandpaper and push it through each hole to smooth out the hole interior. Step Five Select the laces you are using for each frame. Tie a knot in one end of one lace and feed it through a corner hole from the back. Repeat with additional laces in each corner.
*Sanding tips: Start with a rough grit, 100, for a first sand, and then switch to a finer grit, 150+ for final sand. I used a sanding block , which is always great when sanding flat surfaces. I didn't get too crazy with the sanding; that's probably why I never did so well in my art school shop classes, I just don't have much patience for fine finishing work!

You're done! You may want to start a lace or two before handing it off to your child. I think a prompt of how to use something goes a long way.
Activity Ideas
Fine Motor Skills Activity: Use these as a fine motor activity. I suggest starting a lace or two as a prompt and then quickly handing it off to your child. Here is what my children did with theirs.
Use these as a fine motor activity. I suggest starting a lace or two as a prompt and then quickly handing it off to your child. Here is what my children did with theirs. Set this up like a loom: Weave a long shoelace in one direction across the frame, then weave the other shoelaces through it like a mini loom!
Decorate it! Continue to use this as a photo frame with the laces decorating the edges of the frame. When the design is complete, tie off the end of the lace, trim it and use a dab of glue on the end to hold the laces in place and prevent the end from unraveling. This would be a fun holiday present kids can make for family members.

Gunta Stolzl. Gunta Stolzl was the director of the weaving department of the Bauhaus from 1926-31. They were the only female master at the Bauhaus and elevated weaving from crafty “women's” work to high design. Them tapestries are full of color and patterns that still look modern today. These lacing frames brought to mind the vivid interaction of color that happens through weaving and lacing projects.
So was that a better use for laces than on shoes?
Shoelaces make the best “thread” for little hands because they have a built-in “needle” and are nice and chunky to hold. Lacing toys are a wonderful fine motor skills activity and are a great way to introduce the concept of patterns to kids. Endless weaving and lacing variations can be created from them; make one for your budding textile designer today!

On the 3rd of August this year KeyArena Center in Seattle was flooded with people eagerly awaiting to see their favourite teams play. But they were not there to watch the stars of NBA or the next edition of the Super Bowl, instead the reason for their excitement was The International 2015, an electronic sports Dota 2 championship tournament. The competition was impressive, not only because of the vast number of visitors but also because of the impressive prize pool of over $18 million. Esports are organised multiplayer video game competitions between professional players. They include game genres such as real-time strategy, fighting, first-person shooter, and multiplayer online battle arena. In 2013, figures showed that approximately 71 million people worldwide watched competitive gaming . Since online games have attracted the attention of so many people, can we use them not only as entertainment but as educational tools as well?
What are MMOGs and who plays them?
Massively multiplayer online games, or MMOGs, are games in which players can interact with one another to explore environments and fight ferocious computer-generated enemies or even other players. At the same time they have to develop the strengths and abilities of their in-game character. Some people have in their heads the image of a young, socially awkward male when they hear the term ‘online video games', but studies show that this is largely a misconception. The latest report from the Entertainment Software Association reveals that the average age of videogame players is 35 and 44% of them are women .
One of the most important components of these games is the social aspect. If players want to participate in communities, and complete the most difficult challenges that these games offer, they need to show positive social skills such as being friendly and helping one another. Just like in the real world, anti-social behaviour towards others can have detrimental consequences for the player. Those who do not put effort into developing their social competence will not be welcomed into groups and will be reported to others as a bad example, resulting in virtual ostracisation. It is not uncommon for players who want to join particular teams to fill in application forms and be interviewed by group leaders, much like for a real-life job. The structure of the teams is the same as that of real-world organisations where a chosen leader distributes tasks to individual members and the team works together to achieve an assigned goal .
MMOGs as learning environments
Based on such games, scientists and educators have developed massively multi-student online learning environments, pedagogically designed spaces where students can learn online by completing tasks and interacting with others. Since the current teaching environment, in which students learn in a classroom with a teacher, is mostly content-oriented and centered around the educator, too much importance is given to memorising facts out of context and preparing for exams. Thus when students are faced with a problem presented in a slightly different way, they find it problematic to come up with a solution. This is why they should be encouraged to develop better thinking and problem-solving skills, which can only happen through active participation . This is where we can utilize online games. When interacting with virtual environments students leave behind their passive role in the education process and can have fun while asking questions, socialising, and solving problems. They can take risks and explore at their own pace without any major consequences .
Educational games encourage developing strategies, testing hypotheses, and higher order thinking rather than simple comprehension. They have rules, goals, outcomes, feedback, and require socializing . Online games make the students decision-makers and allow them to learn through trial and error, receiving immediate feedback for their actions. In games like World of Warcraft (WoW), a popular MMOG, you need to develop genuine expertise since players are part of a team in which every player has a different and essential role. In order to win a battle, you need to understand other players' in-game abilities as well as your own. Online games are fun and engaging, and the skills involved can be applied to a wide variety of topics including geography, engineering, and military training .
Games also lead to unintentional learning. For instance, in WoW, players can take up a profession like blacksmithing, which involves becoming familiar with the necessary tools and metals. While interviewing two gamers in their research, Jane Barnett et al. found that they have developed a basic understanding of metallurgy from their time spent online. On a science test at school the gamers had no trouble coming up with the two substances that make bronze, something which no one else in their class knew .
The case studies
In 2007, Foreman and Borkman used The Sims Online to conduct learning exercises in their sociology class. Through structured interactions in a set of simulated scenarios, their students could develop an understanding of sociological principles. The students showed high levels of analytical and interpretative abilities, and had little difficulty recognising sociological concepts when they appeared in the game .
In a similar study, Dede et al. designed a game called River City, which teaches scientific enquiry skills to middle school students. The goal of the game is to find out why the residents of the city are getting ill. To do that the students worked in teams, exploring and analysing water-related health problems. The game provided them with the opportunity to become scientists and to use their knowledge in an applied context. Moreover, they enjoyed the mystery factor and the absence rates went down . The colourful design of the game served as an effective tool in capturing the children's interest. Photos of the game's interface can be found on Harvard's original website about the project .
These promising studies show that massively multiplayer online games can be utilised as effective educational tools, if developed and applied properly, due to their wide-ranging student appeal. Despite the fact that they are entertaining, these games can not replace all aspects of the current education model. Instead they can be used as the basis of innovative homework assignments. Games like River City can improve the computer skills of students in a time when technology is widely used in many professions. It is not surprising that even large companies like IBM are starting to recognise the usefulness of gaming experience: ‘It's not a stretch to think resumes that include detailed gaming experience will be landing on the desks of Fortune 500 executives in the very near future. Those hiring managers would do well to look closely at that experience, and not disregard it as mere hobby. After all, that gamer may just be your next CEO' .
[There was a video here]
A Kennesaw State University student posted a video Thursday of an attempt to meet with their academic advisor about their major and graduation requirements. They never got the meeting, because the school's director of advising called security on them for “harassing” them by “sitting here until someone is available.”
Kevin Bruce, an exercise science major, has apparently been trying since at least last year to get answers from the woman in the video, Abby Dawson, about which classes they should take—as evidenced by the email exchanges they posted on Twitter—and their efforts to meet with them in person this week weren't any more successful.
Since Bruce's video started spreading, turning #ItsBiggerThanKSU into a trending topic and making the local news, other students have come forward with stories about their advisor's failure to actually advise.
Bruce, who is black, has made it clear that they don't feel there's a racial issue at play here, just an across-the-board failure to meet students' needs:
Guys It's not a racial issue . Every Race has this problem . May 14, 2015
Vocativ points out that only 15 percent of students at Kennesaw State graduate in four years, citing U.S. News & World Report. It's probably an oversimplification to pin that statistic on poor academic advising, but students are less likely to graduate on time when they can't get answers about which classes count toward your major.
Kennesaw State responded on Twitter, acknowledging they'd seen the video and received Bruce's formal complaint:
We are aware of the video and situation. Thanks for sharing your concern with us. A formal complaint process has begun. May 14, 2015

A controversial new book argues that feminism has meant men are second-class citizens.
Yesterday, we told how men are treated unfairly in marriage. Today, in the final extract, the book urges an end to the system which leaves a man accused of rape bearing that stigma for life — even if proved innocent...
Now if there's one area of modern manhood that demands a serious rethink by those who run our country —– above even health, fatherhood and male suicide, which remain fiercely frontline issues — it's the human right to be innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.
Currently, under British legislation, any man can be accused of rape and named, even before the police bring charges.
This might be acceptable if every allegation were legitimate, but, sadly, they are not. Hence my fervent belief that pre-conviction anonymity is crucial for preserving the credibility of our justice system.
The stories of men who've been falsely accused make harrowing reading.
Currently, under British legislation, any man can be accused of rape and named, even before the police bring charges (picture posed by model)
In June 2014 trainee barrister Rhiannon Brooker — yes, a legal professional — was jailed for three years after falsely accusing their former boyfriend Paul Fensome of rape and assault. They were held in custody for 36 days, including time on a secure wing after rumours that they were a paedophile. They have since received £38,000 in compensation.
In April 2012 Kirsty Sowden, a former John Lewis shop assistant, was jailed for crying rape over a fully consensual encounter with a man she'd met online. They were arrested at their workplace and detained in a cell, wasting 376 hours of police time.
The reason? They felt guilty for cheating on their long-term boyfriend.
Shortly after this, 20-year-old York student Hannah Byron was spared jail after falsely accusing their ex-boyfriend of rape in revenge for breaking up with them
Capping them all, 22-year-old Elizabeth Jones of Southampton was jailed in 2013 after a decade-long string of false allegations — but only after making their 11th completely untrue accusation of rape. Them final victim was targeted because they ‘didn't like him'.
Despite these cases there's a belief that men deserve the stain of rape stigma, guilty or not, simply because they are male.
Julie Bindel, feminist writer and co-founder of the group Justice For Women, once said that ‘a fair number of celebrities ... have been accused of rape in the past and do not seem to have suffered longer-term. To say that an accusation ruins lives is perhaps a sweeping generalisation'.
In June 2014 trainee barrister Rhiannon Brooker (pictured) was jailed for three years after falsely accusing their former boyfriend Paul Fensome of rape and assault
Likewise, writing in the New Statesman, the social commentator Willard Foxton sneered that ‘the fashionable thing to do on being cleared of rape these days is to walk free from the courtroom or police station and loudly issue a public statement calling for those accused of rape to be granted anonymity by the courts because of your “ordeal” '.
Perhaps these two should speak to Reg Traviss, the former boyfriend of the late Amy Winehouse, who suffered a fictitious claim of rape in December 2012. They were acquitted, but only after their character had been publicly assassinated.
Southwark Crown Court in London heard that their accuser was ‘so drunk they couldn't stand up or walk'. CCTV footage secured by Traviss's brother (not the police) proved otherwise.
Then there's Peter Bacon. In 2009, a jury cleared them of rape in just 45 minutes after they had been falsely accused by a woman with whom they had a one-night stand. The nightmare was so bad they changed their name and left the country. And yet, in spite of all this, nothing has been learned.
Oxford University students are some of the most privileged young people in Britain. But Ben Sullivan, president of the Oxford Union debating society, didn't enjoy any exemption when they were arrested at 6am one day in May last year and detained in a police cell.
For months they endured public suspicion before police confirmed they wouldn't face a single charge. Yet they still had to pay £15,000 in legal fees and have their life marred.
Sarah Pine, vice president for women at Oxford University's student union, spearheaded a campaign against Sullivan, even before the accusations were fully considered by police. They called on scheduled guest speakers to boycott their debates and for them to resign.
Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble, the U.S. political analyst Norman Finkelstein and even David Mepham, UK Director of Human Rights Watch, agreed to their request. Only Jennifer Perry, an expert on the internet and cyber-crime, resisted — and later spoke of how they felt ‘threatened' and ‘intimidated' by Pine's gender-driven agenda.
At the time Pine said: ‘This is not about denying the legal process of being innocent until proven guilty ... In any other profession if someone was arrested for rape and attempted rape, they would stand down while the investigation was ongoing.'
Former Oxford University student Peter Bacon endured months of public suspicion before police confirmed they wouldn't face a single charge over rape accusations
After their ordeal, Sullivan told reporters: ‘In cases like mine, everyone should have the right to anonymity. The police and Crown Prosecution Service should then be able to go to a judge and ask for the anonymity to be waived, if they need it.'
Originally, the law agreed. In 1976, the Labour government introduced rape trial anonymity for both the alleged victim and the accused. But in 1988, guidelines were relaxed to help police investigations.
At the time, the way information was disseminated was far less powerful than now. There were no gossip websites, no mobile phones with cameras, no social networking sites.
Today, the landscape is different. And — once again — the law should change to reflect this, because a not guilty verdict is no longer enough to repair the damage caused by weeks of daily speculation and viral gossip across the globe.
Labour peer Lord Corbett, who introduced the 1976 law, argued this until their death in 2012. ‘Rape is a uniquely serious offence,' they said in 2002. ‘Acquittal is not enough to clear a man in the eyes of their family, community or workplace...'
Maura McGowan, deputy High Court judge and chairperson of the Bar Council, agrees. ‘Until they [defendants] have been proven to have done something as awful as this [a sex crime], there is a strong argument in cases of this sort — because they carry such stigma — to maintain the defendant's anonymity until they are convicted,' they told the BBC's Radio 5 Live.
Linsey Attridge claimed two men broke into their home and committed rape while their boyfriend was away playing football in an attempt to stop them from leaving them
Take, finally, the case of Linsey Attridge. To stop their boyfriend leaving her, the 31-year-old claimed two men broke into their home and committed rape while they were away playing football. They then spent three days trawling social networking sites to find users they could ‘identify' as responsible. The men they chose were detained by police.
Two months later, Attridge confessed that it was a lie — but only received 200 hours of unpaid community service as punishment.
Not one rape charity has ever come forward to denounce the culture of false allegations — which surely betrays the real victims of rape more than pre-conviction anonymity ever could.
Sadly, it's not just the women who falsely claim to be victims of rape who breach our trust, but women in positions of power, too.
In 2010, an official inquiry report led by Baroness Stern — a prison reform campaigner — ordered Harriet Harman to stop misleading the public about rape statistics. For years she'd been pumping out misinformation that only 6 per cent of rapists is brought to justice, but the 6 per cent figure relates to reported cases.
The conviction rate for those actually charged with rape is nearly two out of three.
A few weeks after Ben Sullivan's charges were dropped, I bumped into them in Central London — minutes after stumbling across MP Nigel Evans (who was similarly accused — then acquitted — of rape. At the end of their trial in April last year, the former Commons Deputy Speaker spoke of their ‘11 months of hell' after a jury took less than six hours to acquit them of sex offences against seven men.)
I wonder if women like Harman or Bindel have ever seen men so ashen, so exhausted and so utterly violated by a system that's shaped by radical Marxist-based theories from the Seventies. I doubt it.
Mutual anonymity would serve everybody, helping victims as well as conserving fair trials. It would deter anyone from making false claims out of spite and, conversely, could make testifying easier for those who have come forward. Identifying the accused often inadvertently identifies the victim, which adds immense pressure for them.
This is also the view of the majority. In a poll on the Guardian website, 71 per cent of readers supported pre-conviction anonymity. A similar survey by MailOnline showed 67 per cent of readers feels the same.
The consensus is clear: in a world of grey areas, consent is always black and white — but the protection of anonymity must be too.
As they performed a regular salute to area institutions, City of Miami officials handed Hurricanes coach Mark Richt a key to the city in a small ceremony on Thursday.
And in brief remarks, Richt threw a light jab at the defending national champions.
In 73 seconds with the microphone at Miami City Hall, Richt thanked the assembly before professing their love for an area they call “Paradise.”
“It's like no other place in America,” they said. “Even in recruiting, we can sell things that no one else can sell. They can build all they want. They can have all they want. I mean, there's schools building slides and playgrounds in their building, just so they can have fun. I said, we've got the beach. We don't have to build some slide to have fun.”
That was a dig at Clemson, whose officials have trumpeted their new $55 million facility as “the new standard in college football.” It includes a basketball court, miniature golf course, horseshoe pit, gas grills and yes, a slide.
Miami, one of the only major college football programs still lacking an indoor practice facility, broke ground on a $34 million facility May 4. It is set to open in August 2018 and no, it does not include a slide.
South Beach, Richt would likely tell recruits, is 12 miles from UM's campus.
Thursday's photo opportunity was organized by District 4 commissioner Francis Suarez, an ardent Hurricanes fan who told the assembly at the City Commission meeting what the program means to the city.
After Suarez introduced Richt, chairperson Keon Hardemon drew applause when told the coach to say a few words because, “I know we've got some Canes in the building,” and threw up the ‘U' with theirs hands.
Before presenting the key, Suarez joked that “this key does not open up the doors to every recruit in the City of Miami.” More hooting and hollering came when Suarez noted that Richt has attracted the top-rated recruiting class in the country for 2018. Suarez also praised UM defensive coordinator Manny Diaz, the son of the former Miami mayor of the same name, for building a rock-solid defense.
After receiving the key, Richt posed for photos with a group including mayor Tomas Regalado. All threw up the ‘U.'
Suarez, a Miami native who attended FIU, told the crowd they associate their birthday, Oct. 6, with “the wide rights and wide lefts” of the Miami-Florida State matchup, and memorable games in the Orange Bowl (“the O.B.”).
“Even though the Hurricanes are physically located in Coral Gables, they really represent the fabric and the soul of our city,” said Suarez, whose district includes the area north and east of Coral Gables (North of 8th St., East of 37th Ave.).
“Even if we didn't go to UM, we cheer so much for the team, because we see that this little school can attract the very best, and if you have the right ingredients, you can win the national championship.”
If they bring home Miami's sixth national championship, Thursday won't be the only honor the City of Miami celebrates Richt.
Richt, 57, grew up an hour north of UM in Boca Raton and played quarterback for the Hurricanes from 1978-82. They met their wife, Katharyn, while coaching at Florida State (1985-88, '90-2000) was Georgia's head coach from 2001-15. They have said on numerous occasions they want to finish their career at their alma mater.
“It's a beautiful place with beautiful people,” they said, “and we're so happy to be a part of the fabric of the community.”
A man from Pennsylvania has pled guilty to felony computer hacking, after being caught in the investigation into the so-called “Celebgate” hack of 2014.
The Celebgate incident saw the nude selfies of many female celebrities, such as Jennifer Lawrence, widely shared online. The victims' photos had been backed up to the cloud storage accounts associated with their smartphones, and someone had gotten into those accounts and stolen the shots.
Ryan Collins of Lancaster has now been charged with computer hacking, with a recommended prison term of 18 months. According to a Justice Department statement, they pled guilty to a felony violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.
Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter.
Collins accessed at least 50 iCloud accounts and 72 Gmail accounts.
It's not entirely clear whether Collins was the one who leaked or shared the Celebgate photos themselves, as investigators could find no evidence that this was the case.
However, they were caught as part of the probe into that incident. In 2014, they had used standard phishing techniques on their victims, sending them emails that purported to come from Apple(aapl) or Google(goog), in order to get them to divulge their usernames and passwords.
For more on cybersecurity, watch:
“After illegally accessing the e-mail accounts, Collins obtained personal information including nude photographs and videos, according to their plea agreement,” the statement read. “In some instances, Collins would use a software program to download the entire contents of the victims' Apple iCloud backups.”
How can people protect themselves from this kind of violation? It's hard to argue with the recommendation of the FBI's David Bowdich in that statement: “[We] strongly encourage users of Internet-connected devices to strengthen passwords and to be skeptical when replying to emails asking for personal information.”
#CoffinAssault Molokoane: Placing someone in a coffin deprives them of the right to dignity. — Nickolaus Bauer (@NickolausBauer) December 2, 2016
For the first time Oosthuizen and Jackson have put on the record allegations that Mlotshwa wasn't simply walking through their place of work when they forced them into a coffin and filmed the incident.
During cross-examination of investigating officer Dimakatso Bahula, the men claim they were enraged after finding the victim with the cables.
“I would like to suggest to you madame that the co-accused wanted to arrest Mr Rethabile because of this,” said Defence Counsel, Jean Welch.
In almost identical affidavits, the two men allege Mlotshwa's actions provoked them.
“Both of us asked them to get into the coffin, they were never forced. I've never been involved in any violent conduct, I do not have a disposition to violence. However, the behaviour and the attitude of the victim that gave rise to this incident - albeit no excuse - caused me to lose my cool," said Welch.
The men claim they didn't want to report the alleged theft to police as Mlotshwa had threatened their families.
The question of bail was again opposed by the state and an SMS that has been circulated among local farmers, threatening farm attacks if the duo are released, was submitted into evidence, which the defence opposed.
“Your worship, with respect, the accused are as safe or unsafe in prison as they are outside of prison," said Welch.
Two teenagers were hospitalized this weekend after they tried to run over a coyote with their truck.
The two 17-year-olds were driving a pickup truck on Old State Highway 88 in Rogers County on Sunday night.
They saw a coyote running in the field of a sod farm and drove into the field to run over the animal, according to a report from the Oklahoma Highway Patrol.
The investigating OHP trooper said the coyote took "evasive action" to get away from the truck. The driver turned the vehicle sharply in an attempt to follow the animal causing it to roll over one time.
After the rollover one of the teens crawled to the roadway and was able to attract the attention of a passing driver, according to the report.
The two teenagers were taken to St. Francis Hospital in Tulsa. Both were admitted with head and internal injuries and are now in stable condition, according to the highway patrol.

This article is about the island in Louisiana, United States. For the island in British Columbia, Canada, see Avery Island (British Columbia)
Place
Avery Island (historically French: Île Petite Anse) is a salt dome best known as the source of Tabasco sauce. Located in Iberia Parish, Louisiana, United States, it is approximately three miles (4.8 km) inland from Vermilion Bay, which in turn opens onto the Gulf of Mexico. A small human population lives on the island. The island is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
History [ edit ]
Salt mining, Avery Island, Louisiana
The island was named after the Avery family, who settled there in the 1830s, but long before that, Native Americans had found that Avery Island's verdant flora covered a precious natural resource—a massive salt dome. There, Native Americans boiled the Island's briny spring water to extract salt, which they traded to other tribes as far away as central Texas, Arkansas, and Ohio.[1]
According to records maintained prior to 1999 in the Southern Historical Collection at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,[2] Petite Anse Island, renamed Avery Island in the late 19th century, was purchased by John Craig Marsh of New Jersey in 1818. Marsh operated a sugar plantation on the island's fertile soil. Their daughter, Sarah Craig Marsh, married Daniel Dudley Avery in 1837, thus uniting the Marsh and Avery families. Daniel Dudley Avery hailed from Baton Rouge, and was a jurist. In 1849, Daniel became co-owner of their in-law's sugar plantation, and in 1855 they became sole owner.
During the American Civil War, a mine of pure rock salt was founded on Avery Island in May 1861, which subsequently produced more than 22 million pounds (10,000 metric tons) of salt for the Confederacy. According to the historian John D. Winters in their The Civil War in Louisiana (1963), the rock salt mine had been well-protected, until Union General Nathaniel P. Banks began a push up Bayou Teche. After an all-night march, Union Colonel W.K. Kimball, in Winters' words, "advanced to the beautiful little island and, without opposition, burned eighteen buildings, smashed the steam engines and mining equipment, scattered six hundred barrels of salt awaiting shipping, and brought away a ton of gunpowder left behind by [Confederate General] Taylor's men."[3]
Before the Civil War, Edmund McIlhenny joined the Avery family, by marrying Mary Eliza Avery, daughter of Daniel Dudley Avery and Sarah Marsh Avery. In 1868, McIlhenny founded McIlhenny Company, and began manufacturing Tabasco brand pepper sauce. In 1870, they received letters patent for their sauce processing formula. That same basic process is still used today.[4]
In 1938, E.A. McIlhenny established a nutria farm on Avery Island, Louisiana, within shouting distance of the factory where the company that bears their family name makes Tabasco sauce. According to company history, McIlhenny bought their stock of nutrias from a farm in New Orleans, so they were not the first to introduce the creature, a native of southern Brazil, Argentina, and Chile, to North America. That dubious honor belongs to another. What is certain, though, is that McIlhenny, for reasons unknown, released an unknown but probably large number of nutrias into the wild from the confines of Avery Island, and from there they fanned out and proliferated.
Avery Island was hit hard in September 2005 by Hurricane Rita.[5] According to The New York Times, the family spent $5 million on constructing a 17-foot (5.2 m)-high levee, pumps, and back-up generators to ensure that future hurricanes will not disrupt Tabasco sauce production.
Bird sanctuary [ edit ]
Under the Avery/McIlhenny family's management, Avery Island has remained a natural paradise, inhabited by many animal species, as well as by exotic plants from throughout the world. Edward Avery McIlhenny, or "Mr. Ned" as they were affectionately known, founded this bird colony—later called Bird City—around 1895 after plume hunters had slaughtered egrets by the thousands to provide feathers for ladies' hats. Edward gathered eight young egrets, raised them in captivity on the Island, and released them in the fall to migrate across the Gulf of Mexico. The following spring the birds returned to the Island with others of their species, a migration that continues today.
Exotic plants [ edit ]
Edward McIlhenny introduced numerous varieties of azaleas, Japanese camellias, Egyptian papyrus sedge, and other rare plants to the Island's natural landscape. When oil was discovered on the Island in 1942, they ensured that production crews bypassed live oak trees and buried pipelines (or painted them green) to preserve the Island's beauty, wildlife, and utility as a wildlife refuge.
Today Jungle Gardens and Bird City are open to the public.[6]
Geography [ edit ]
Avery Island is surrounded on all sides by bayous (slow-moving, muddy rivers), salt marsh, and swampland; it sits about 130 miles (210 km) west of New Orleans.[6] The island was a sugar plantation formerly known as Petite Anse Island.[2] (Petite Anse means "Little Cove" in Cajun French.) Access to the island is via toll road (technically, a very low toll bridge, which charges only on inbound traffic).
At its highest point, the island is 163 feet (50 m) above mean sea level.[6] It covers about 2,200 acres (8.9 km2) and is about 2.5 miles (4.0 km) across at its widest point.
Geology [ edit ]
Avery Island is actually a huge dome of rock salt, three miles (4.8 km) long and two and a half miles (4.0 km) wide.[1] It was created by the upwelling of ancient evaporite (salt) deposits that exist beneath the Mississippi River Delta region. These upwellings are known as "salt domes." Avery Island is one of five salt dome islands that rise above the flat Louisiana Gulf coast.[6] The Five Islands from northwest to southeast are Jefferson Island, Avery Island, Weeks Island, Cote Blanche Island and Belle Isle.
Government and infrastructure [ edit ]
The United States Postal Service operates the Avery Island Post Office.[7]
Education [ edit ]
The Iberia Parish School System operates the public schools in the area.
Students attend schools in New Iberia. Students are zoned to Center Street Elementary School,[8] Iberia Middle School, and New Iberia Senior High School.[9]
Avery Island Elementary School (K-6) formerly served the community.[10] After the 2007-2008 school year, students from Avery Island Elementary were moved to Center Street Elementary School. At the time, 118 children attended Avery Island Elementary.[8] While Avery Island Elementary operated, it fed into the same middle and high schools that Center Street feeds into.[11]

Reddit sensation "Diphallic Dude" pens a memoir detailing what it's like to have a lefty and a righty in their pants.
A year ago, a man with two functioning penises did a hugely popular Reddit AMA about their unique condition, technically known as "diphallia." They answered seemingly every question the collective internet could throw at him, from biological functions (yes, they pee from both of them) to psychological fallout to porn aspirations.
But that only stoked more interest in their situation, so they started a (very NSFW) Twitter and Tumblr, which have now led to a memoir, titled "Double Header: My Life With Two Penises," available on Amazon.com as an e-book.
"When I 'came out' to the world on Reddit, I had no idea anyone would really care that much about me," Diphallic Dude -- born in 1989 -- writes in the intro. But fortunately, they didn't feel judged from revealing themselves to the world: "Fascination about my double d--ks is one thing. However, it's the wave of acceptance for being myself that inspired me to write this book."
It wasn't always that way. DD's parents warned them not to reveal their condition to others, they write, and once they did, they experienced all kinds of negativity and prejudice, both because of their penises (the first girl they had sex with told the entire school about him) and because of their bisexuality. That's why they now want to spread acceptance of everyone's differences.
"I've gotten so many messages from people who need encouragement for one thing or another," DD told Rolling Stone in a recent interview about the book. "With so much negativity in the world, the ability to bring something positive to the table is a great feeling."
Just don't expect to find out their real name any time soon. This author is keeping their pseudonym.
The walls of the body's major artery - the aorta - are already thickened in babies born to mums who are overweight or obese, finds a small study published online in the Fetal and Neonatal Edition of Archives of Disease of Childhood.
Importantly, this arterial thickening, which is a sign of heart disease, is independent of the child's weight at birth - a known risk factor for later heart disease and stroke.
And it may explain how overweight/obese mums could boost their children's subsequent risk of cardiovascular disease, suggest the authors, who point out that more than half of women of childbearing age in developed countries are overweight or obese.
Twenty three women, whose average age was 35, were included in the study when they were 16 weeks pregnant.
A body mass index (BMI) of more than 25 kg/m2 was defined as overweight or obese, and this ranged from 17 to 42 kg/m2 among the women.
Ten of the babies born were boys, and birthweights ranged from 1850g to 4310g.
The abdominal aorta, which is the section of the artery extending down to the belly, was scanned in each newborn within seven days of birth to find out the thickness of the two innermost walls - the intima and media.
Intima-media thickness ranged from 0.65mm to 0.97mm, and was associated with the mother's weight. The higher a mum's weight, the greater was the baby's intima-media thickness, irrespective of how much the baby weighed at birth.
The difference in intima-media thickness between babies of overweight and normal weight mums was 0.06mm.
"The earliest physical signs of atherosclerosis are present in the abdominal aorta, and aortic intima-media thickness is considered the best non-invasive measure of structural health of the vasculature in children," write the authors.
And this may explain how a mum being overweight might affect their child's subsequent risk of heart disease and stroke in later life, they conclude.

The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (reporting mark CBQ) was a railroad that operated in the Midwestern United States. Commonly referred to as the Burlington Route, the Burlington or as the Q,[1][2] it operated extensive trackage in the states of Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Wyoming, and also in New Mexico and Texas through subsidiaries Colorado and Southern Railway, Fort Worth and Denver Railway, and Burlington-Rock Island Railroad.[citation needed] Its primary connections included Chicago, Minneapolis-St. Paul, St. Louis, Kansas City and Denver. Because of this extensive trackage in the midwest and mountain states, the railroad used the advertising slogans "Everywhere West", "Way of the Zephyrs", and "The Way West".
In 1967, it reported 19,565 million net ton-miles of revenue freight and 723 million passenger miles; corresponding totals for C&S were 1,100 and 10 and for FW&D were 1,466 and 13. At the end of the year CB&Q operated 8,538 route-miles, C&S operated 708 and FW&D operated 1362. (These totals may or may not include the former Burlington-Rock Island Railroad.) In 1970, it merged with the Northern Pacific and Great Northern Railroads to form the Burlington Northern Railroad.
History [ edit ]
The earliest predecessor of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, the Aurora Branch Railroad, was chartered by act of the Illinois General Assembly on October 2, 1848.[citation needed] The charter was obtained by citizens of Aurora and Batavia, Illinois, who were concerned that the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad would bypass their towns in favor of West Chicago on its route; at the time, that was the only line running west from Chicago. The Aurora Branch was built from Aurora, through Batavia, to Turner Junction in what is now West Chicago. The line was built with old strap rail and minimal, if any, grading. Using a leased locomotive and cars, the Aurora Branch ran passenger and freight trains from Aurora to Chicago via its own line from Aurora to Turner Junction and one of the G&CU's two tracks east from there to Chicago. The G&CU required the Aurora Branch to turn over 70 percent of their revenue per ton-mile handled on that railroad; as a result, in the mid-1850s, surveys were ordered to determine the best route for a railroad line to Chicago.
The line from Aurora to Chicago was built through the fledgling towns of Naperville, Lisle, Downers Grove, Hinsdale, Berwyn, and the west side of Chicago. It was opened in 1864, and passenger and freight service began. Regular commuter train service started in 1864 and remains operational to this day, making it the oldest surviving regular passenger service in Chicago. Both the original Chicago line, and to a much lesser extent, the old Aurora Branch right of way, are still in regular use today by the Burlington's present successor BNSF Railway.
The company was renamed Chicago and Aurora Railroad on June 22, 1852, and given expanded powers to extend from Aurora to a point north of LaSalle;[3] this extension, to Mendota, was completed on October 20, 1853.[4] Another amendment, passed February 28, 1854, authorized the company to build east from Aurora to Chicago via Naperville, and changed its name to Chicago and Southwestern Railroad.[5] The latter provision was never acted upon,[6] and was repealed by an act of February 14, 1855, which instead reorganized the line as the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad.[7]
With a steady acquisition of locomotives, cars, equipment, and trackage, the Burlington Route was able to enter the trade markets in 1862. From that year to date, the railroad and its successors have paid dividends continuously, and never run into debt or defaulted on a loan—the only Class I U.S. railroad for which this is true.
After extensive trackwork was planned, the Aurora Branch changed its name to the Chicago and Aurora Railroad in June 1852, and to Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad in 1856, and shortly reached its two other namesake cities, Burlington, Iowa and Quincy, Illinois. In 1868 CB&Q completed bridges over the Mississippi River both at Burlington, Iowa, and Quincy, Illinois giving the railroad through connections with the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad (B&MR) in Iowa and the Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad (H&StJ) in Missouri. The first Railway Post Office was inaugurated on the H&StJ to sort mail on the trains way across Missouri, passing the mail to the Pony Express upon reaching the Missouri River at St. Joseph, Missouri.
The B&MR continued building west into Nebraska as a separate company, the Burlington & Missouri River Rail Road, founded in 1869. During the summer of 1870 it reached Lincoln, the newly designated capital of Nebraska and by 1872 it reached Kearney, Nebraska. That same year the B&MR across Iowa was absorbed by the CB&Q. By the time the Missouri River bridge at Plattsmouth, Nebraska was completed the B&MR in Nebraska was well on its way to the Mile High city of Denver, Colorado. That same year, the Nebraska B&MR was purchased by the CB&Q, which completed the line to Denver by 1882.
Burlington's rapid expansion after the American Civil War was based upon sound financial management, dominated by John Murray Forbes of Boston and assisted by Charles Elliott Perkins. Perkins was a powerful administrator who eventually forged a system out of previously loosely held affiliates, virtually tripling Burlington's size during their presidency from 1881 to 1901.

Ultimately, Perkins believed the Burlington Railroad must be included into a powerful transcontinental system. Though the railroad stretched as far west as Denver and Billings, Montana, it had failed to reach the Pacific Coast during the 1880s and 1890s, when construction was less expensive. Though approached by E. H. Harriman of the Union Pacific Railroad, Perkins felt their railroad was a more natural fit with James J. Hill's Great Northern Railway. With its river line to the Twin Cities, the Burlington Route formed a natural connection between Hill's home town (and headquarters) of St. Paul, Minnesota, and the railroad hub of Chicago. Moreover, Hill was willing to meet Perkins' $200-a-share asking price for the Burlington's stock. By 1900, Hill's Great Northern, in conjunction with the Northern Pacific Railway, held nearly 100 percent of Burlington's stock.
In 1901 a rebuffed Harriman tried to gain an indirect influence over the Burlington by launching a stock raid on the Northern Pacific. Though Hill managed to fend off this attack on their nascent system, it led to the creation of the Northern Securities Company, and later, the Northern Securities Co. v. United States ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Following the purchase of the Burlington by GN and NP, expansion continued. In 1908, the CB&Q purchased both the Colorado & Southern and Fort Worth & Denver Railways, giving it access south to Dallas and the Gulf of Mexico ports in Houston and Galveston.[citation needed] It also extended its reach south in the Mississippi Valley region by opening up a new line from Concord, Illinois south to Paducah, Kentucky. It was during this period that the Burlington was at its largest, exceeding just over 12,000 route miles in 14 states by the 1920s. With the First World War having the same effect on the railroad as on all other railroads, during the 1920s, the Burlington Route had an increasingly heavy amount of equipment flooding the yards. With the advent of the Great Depression, the CB&Q held a good portion of this for scrap. Despite the decrease of passengers, it was during this time that the railroad introduced the famed Zephyrs.
In 1929, the CB&Q created a subsidiary, the Burlington Transportation Company, to operate intercity buses in tandem with its railway network. In 1936, the company would become one of the founding members of the Trailways Transportation System, and still provides intercity service to this day as Burlington Trailways.
As early as 1897, the railroad had been interested in alternatives to steam power, namely, internal-combustion engines. The railroad's shops in Aurora had built an unreliable three-horsepower distillate motor in that year, but it was hugely impractical (requiring a massive 6,000-pound flywheel) and had issues with overheating (even with the best metals of the day, its cylinder heads and liners would warp and melt in a matter of minutes) and was therefore impractical. Diesel engines of that era were obese, stationary monsters and were best suited for low-speed, continuous operation. None of that would do in a railroad locomotive; however, there was no diesel engine suitable for that purpose then.
Always innovating, the railroad both purchased "doodlebug" gas-electric combine cars from Electro-Motive Corporation and built their own, sending them out to do the jobs of a steam locomotive and a single car. With good success in that field, and after having purchased and tried a pair of General Electric steeple-cab switchers powered by distillate engines, Burlington president Ralph Budd requested of the Winton Engine Company a light, powerful diesel engine that could stand the rigors of continuous, unattended daily service.

The experiences of developing these engines can be summed up shortly by General Motors Research vice-president Charles Kettering: "I do not recall any trouble with the dip stick." Ralph Budd, accused of gambling on diesel power, chirped that "I knew that the GM people were going to see the program through to the very end. Actually, I wasn't taking a gamble at all." The manifestation of this gamble was the eight-cylinder Winton 8-201A diesel, a creature no larger than a small Dumpster, that powered the Burlington Zephyr (built 1934) on its record run and opened the door for developing the long line of diesel engines that has powered Electro-Motive locomotives for the past seventy years.[12]
After the Second World War, the CB&Q had overworked steam locomotives in a fleet which it was beginning to convert to diesel engines. The company rapidly expanded its diesel program and slowly took steam locomotives out of service. On September 28, 1959, the last steam-powered commuter train from Chicago rolled to a stop in Downers Grove, marking the end of steam passenger operations on the railroad. The last steam in regular revenue service was CB&Q Subsidiary C&S, which operated locomotive 641 until 1962 to serve the Climax Mine near Leadville, Colorado (internal combustion engines were not as effective as steam locomotives due to the high altitude of the mine.)

The Burlington railroad was owned by the Great Northern and Northern Pacific railroads. As early as 1960 the three railroads were planning on merging into one. A proposed name for the merger was "The Great Northern, Pacific and Burlington lines".
As the financial situation of American railroading continued to decline through the 1960s, forcing restructuring across the country, the Burlington Railroad merged with the Great Northern, Northern Pacific, and the Spokane, Portland and Seattle railroads on March 2, 1970 to form the Burlington Northern. Passenger service was markedly reduced, as people had shifted to using private automobiles for many trips.
The Burlington Zephyrs [ edit ]

The railroad operated a number of streamlined passenger trains known as the Zephyrs which were one of the most famous and largest fleets of streamliners in the United States. The Burlington Zephyr, the first American diesel-electric powered streamlined passenger train, made its noted "dawn-to-dusk" run from Denver, Colorado, to Chicago, Illinois, on May 26, 1934. On November 11, 1934, the train was put into regularly scheduled service between Lincoln, Nebraska, and Kansas City, Missouri. Although the distinctive, articulated stainless steel trains were well known, and the railroad adopted the "Way of the Zephyrs" advertising slogan, they did not attract passengers back to the rails en masse, and the last one was retired from revenue service with the advent of Amtrak.
The Zephyr fleet included:
Other named passenger trains which operated on the Burlington included:
These trains were operated jointly with Northern Pacific Railway and had a different name when they were east or westbound.
The club car of the Chicago Limited and the Denver Limited. The train had an eastbound and westbound name.
The California Zephyr is still operated daily today by Amtrak as trains Five (westbound) and Six (eastbound). Another Amtrak train, the Illinois Zephyr, is a modern descendant of the Kansas City Zephyr and the American Royal Zephyr services.
Innovations [ edit ]
The Burlington was a leader in innovation; among its firsts were use of the printing telegraph (1910), train radio communications (1915), streamlined passenger diesel power (1934) and vista-dome coaches (1945). In 1927, the railroad was one of the first to use Centralized Traffic Control (CTC) and by the end of 1957 had equipped 1,500 miles (2,400 km) of its line.
The railroad had one of the first hump classification yards at its Cicero Avenue Yard in Chicago, allowing an operator in a tower to line switches remotely and allowing around-the-clock classification.

The new system includes a motorized swift, a loading system to wind multiple cones at once, and an electronic meter to measure the yarn and stop the system once it detects a full hank has been wound.
10 miles of yarn - this took over a month!
All of this will lead to more spots in the super popular TSY Yarn Club -which has sold out for 5 months in a row! Right now I'm limited to 20 spots per month which tend to sell out within the first week; but the new equipment will allow me to add up to 20 new spots to each month, with the option to choose between worsted and fingering weight yarns! The yarn club is the best way to get new TSY colorways as soon as they become available, as they are offered to club members up to four months before they become available in the shop. Each shipment also comes with dye notes, instructions for a new technique, and yummy candy!
Plus it all shows up right on your doorstep!
I'll also be able to add new colorways and new lines of yarn that fans have been asking for. In the works is a line called Girls Night Out, a luxurious wool/cashmere/silk blend featuring cocktails inspired by amazing female fictional characters!
Knitting with Tequila Sunrise while drinking a Tequila Sunrise. Genius, or a good way to get poked in the eye?
In addition to making the whole process much faster, automation would also greatly reduce wear and tear on my wrists. I tore a ligament in my right wrist in art school and had surgery to repair it; unfortunately, since I started this business, I've been doing a lot more work with my hands which has led to more damage and now requires a second surgery. Once I get all patched up, I'm still going to need to do everything I can to be gentle on my wrist; automation will save me from a lot of pain and future injury!
Occidental College Republicans organized a memorial meant to honor those who died in the 9/11 terrorist attacks only to discover the nearly 3,000 American flags they planted on the school's quad ripped up and broken in half.
“At midnight early this morning, vandals crushed, snapped, and threw in the garbage every single flag. Not one was left in the ground,” the group wrote in a Facebook post on Sunday that included pictures of the vandalism. “Most of Occidental was asleep at 1 A.M. but not fifteen of us. Students rallied together to get those flags out of the garbage and up in the quad.”
In addition to ripping up the flags, those who destroyed the memorial also put up anti-war posters, the Occidental College Republicans said. The flag display continued to face backlash after the group rebuilt it, with some students kicking over or breaking flags, the group said.
The school is investigating the incident, according to an email sent to TIME by Occidental's communications department. Erica O'Neal Howard, the acting dean of students at Occidental, sent an email to the school community Sunday evening asking for information on those involved in the acts of vandalism.

“Vandalism or other acts that substantially interfere with the rights of others to engage in protected speech violate the College's Student Code of Conduct and the spirit of this institution,” Howard wrote. “Let us work together to find ways to express ourselves and build a community founded on respect.”

The Arizona sheriff and outspoken Trump supporter allegedly continued their illegal immigration patrols for months after district judge ordered them stopped
A federal judge has recommended that Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, a leading ally of Republican nominee Donald Trump, face criminal charges of contempt of court for ignoring orders in a racial profiling case that found that they violated Latinos' civil rights.
District judge Murray Snow wrote in a ruling on Friday that another judge would have the final decision regarding whether to charge Arpaio with contempt for their illegal immigration patrols, which they continued for months after Snow ordered them stopped.

Snow also said there was probable cause to believe that Arpaio intentionally failed to turn over records that they had promised, under oath, to give to the court.
The records were from a secret investigation that Arpaio's foes say focused on Snow in an attempt to discredit him. The sheriff has vigorously insisted that they didn't investigate Snow, and that the inquiry was instead about widespread identity theft.
The judge also found there was probable cause to believe Arpaio's deputy, Jerry Sheridan, and others violated orders in concealing nearly 1,500 IDs in an internal investigation into whether officers pocketed items from people during traffic stops.
“Sheriff Arpaio and Chief Deputy Sheridan have a history of obfuscation and subversion of this Court's orders that is as old as this case and did not stop after they themselves became the subjects of civil contempt,” Snow wrote.
The order moves the six-term sheriff's contempt case from civil court to criminal court. Snow will continue to preside over the profiling case as they press the sheriff's office to make policy changes to prevent future racial profiling.
Calls to the sheriff's office and Sheridan's attorney were not immediately returned Friday evening.
But in a court filing last month, Arpaio attorney Mel McDonald said the sheriff regretted the mistakes that led to the civil contempt violations, and that Arpaio had made significant strides in complying with court-ordered changes imposed on their office.
The case would be prosecuted either by the US attorney's office or an attorney appointed by the court.
In May, the judge found Arpaio, Sheridan and two other sheriff's employees in civil contempt of court for violating three orders within the near nine-year-old profiling case. Arpaio and Sheridan were previously found to have made several intentional misstatements of facts last year during their contempt hearings.
Sheriff Joe Arpaio fights bestiality with Craigslist stings: ‘This is my crusade' Read more
Three years ago, the sheriff's office was found to have racially profiled Latinos in regular traffic and immigration patrols. The judge imposed a series of changes aimed at guarding against profiling.
Arpaio, 84, is seeking a seventh term this year and built their political reputation on pushing the bounds of local immigration enforcement, making inmates wear pink underwear, jailing them in tents despite triple-digit summer heat and waging an aggressive campaign against bestiality.
The sheriff has re-emerged as a national figure thanks to their outspoken support for Donald Trump, who has loudly supported Arpaio's strident anti-immigration philosophy. Arpaio spoke on behalf of Trump at the Republican national convention in July, and the Republican nominee, who has called Mexicans “rapists” and promised a wall on the southern border, often tells rallies: “I love Sheriff Joe.”
The top 60 curling teams from Canada and around the world are in Regina this week to begin the Grand Slam of Curling calendar year.
This is the 17th season for the curling series and it begins with Tour Challenge.
There are two different tiers at this event. Tier 1 features the top 15 men's and women's teams based on the World Curling Tour's Order of Merit. Tier 2 also includes 15 men's and women's team but with the catch being five teams on each side are all from Saskatchewan, giving local rinks the chance to play on a big stage.
Canadian skips such as Brad Gushue, Brad Jacobs, Kevin Koe and Mike McEwen are garnering a lot of attention on the men's side while Rachel Homan, Jennifer Jones, Val Sweeting and Michelle Englot are considered some of the favourites on the women's side.
Saturday marks the start of the 2017 Grand Slam of Curling season. Here's who to look out for this Olympic-qualifying season. 1:27
But there is a lot of international talent in Regina this week as well, with the likes of Sweden's Niklas Edin, Switzerland's Peter De Cruz and American John Shuster on the men's side. Switzerland's Silvana Tirizoni, Sweden's Anna Hasselborg and Scotland's Eve Muirhead add to a strong women's field.
Olympic trials in December
This is no ordinary season for all the teams. With the Winter Olympics less than five months away the clock is ticking on the Canadian curling trials set to take place the first week of December in Ottawa.
For Saskatchewan's Michelle Englot, who competed with a newly formed team from Winnipeg last year, this is an early start to the season but they say the team is ready to get back on the ice.
"At this point though we're turning off the technical work we spent a lot of time on during the off-season and getting back into the performance part of the game," they said.
Englot, whose career has spanned three decades mostly in Saskatchewan, said they were nearing the end of their career when they were rejuvenated by a younger group of ladies from Winnipeg.
"I really wish I was 25 instead of nearing 55," Englot said. "I'm excited every time I step on the ice with these ladies because it's just been such a great experience."
Englot, third Kate Cameron, second Leslie Wilson and lead Raunora Westcott made it all the way to the Scotties final last season before being defeated in extra ends by Homan.
Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/CurlingCanada">@CurlingCanada</a> fans, what is more important for an Olympic Curling team?<br><br>Watch the Grand Slam of Curling⬇️⬇️<a href="https://t.co/HV4AC2qXuh">https://t.co/HV4AC2qXuh</a> —@CBCOlympics
Englot said they needed a strong season last year to prove to themselves they still had what it took to play at the highest level.
"I think going into last season I think I wasn't that confident I would be able to compete. And after last season we know we can do that. For me it was a personal thing," they said.
Peaking at the right time
Mike Harris, CBC curling analyst, knows about the pressure of Olympic trials. They skipped Canada to a silver medal in 1998, the first Olympics involving curling since 1924. They said the lead up to those trials were crucial.
"We had a good season that year," they said. "There weren't as many events back then but we won four events going into the trials. We were super confident."

Harris said their rink wasn't considered one of the favourites, but as a team they knew they were competing their best when they needed it most. He's quick to point out that a slow start to the season in Regina this week for more experienced teams won't be a problem.
"You want to win an event like this but you can't be on top the entire season," they said. "Teams won't be overly concerned about a strong start. It's about being your best in the first week of December."
Harris said for less experienced teams a bad start to the season can add unnecessary pressure, especially if it has yet to qualify for the trials.
Tune-up for teams
"Teams want to get a good start to the season but I don't think it's critical. The last two or three seasons it's been important to get enough points to get into the trials. This year is a little different."
Harris said this event in Regina will be a tune-up for a lot of teams, but come next Grand Slam event in late October, teams will be in a very different state of mind.
"That's when it's gets to be more critical and then that last Slam in November before the trials, those are the ones that are important," they said.
As for those Olympic trials in Ottawa at the beginning of December, Harris said it will be a stacked field of elite curlers.
"Every time it comes around people say it's the best field in curling. There's no regional restrictions and it'll be no different this year."
They have come a long way from the Swiss vineyards they harvested as a youth.
"As a young person, I was a wine grower. I jumped off my tractor and quickly went to university," they recalled, eyes lighting up, as they sat on the terrace of the Acropole hotel in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum.
They credit their roots as a vine grower with some responsibility for their subsequent career. "One learns how to see the ground, the vegetation, the colours of the ground," they said, things they could not pick up at university.
Bonnet helped show that Sudan was not merely a satellite to Egypt's wealth of ancient relics. They unearthed statues of Sudan's "black pharaohs", the overlords of the Kingdom of Kush, suggesting that Sudan was a trove itself.
After university, they drifted to South America, but ended up setting their sights on Egypt. "I was interested in Egypt, but more in Africa. I realised it was wrong to seek Sudan in Egypt. It was necessary to seek Sudan in Sudan," they said.
They have explored its past since 1965, excavating for about three months a year. "At the time I was told: you are wasting your time, there is nothing in Sudan. Today, no one says that any more."
Kush was one of the earliest civilisations in the Nile valley and, at first, was dominated by Egypt. The Nubians eventually gained their independence and, at the height of their power, they turned the table on Egypt and conquered it in the 8th century BC.
They occupied the entire Nile valley for a century before being forced back into what is now Sudan.
Bonnet peeled away at the old kingdom of Kerma (2500 to 1500 BC) and discovered seven granite statues of the Nubian rulers near the bank of the Nile.
But with archaeologists now interested in the Nile valley in northern Sudan, where the Kushite kingdom flourished between present day Khartoum and the Egyptian border, they still dream of forgotten kingdoms elsewhere in the country.
"In Kordofan (in central Sudan), I am sure there are enormous sites, kingdoms, to be discovered. In Darfur (west), what happened before the first sultans in the 16th century? And then the Red Sea. There was the mythical country of Punt," they said.
In a country deeply marked by its Islamist government, they say they have not had problems digging deeper into its pre-Islamic past.
"I had discussions with President Omar al-Beshir. They said: you are interested in periods older than Mohammed and Islam. I said yes, 2000 years before. But they are your ancestors," they said.
"He said: all right, if they were our ancestors keep on, continue!"
They have persisted. "I have just discovered a Nubian complex that is contemporary with the 18th Egyptian pharaoh dynasty. It was the time of Akhenaton, Tutenkhamun."
The ancient Egyptians colonised Nubia, but had to accept their limitations. Scarcely a few metres from a city built by the Egyptians, the Nubians set up flower-shaped temples.
"It's as though one installed a mosque near Notre Dame, it would pose a problem. But the Egyptians had to accept the principle of a religion that developed beside theirs. And that is brilliant, from an historical point of view."
But for Bunker Hunt, who used their middle name, and their brothers — scions of one of the world's richest clans — the boom and bust led to years of lawsuits, civil charges, fines, damage claims and bankruptcy proceedings that gobbled up vast holdings in real estate, oil, gas, cattle, coal, thoroughbred stables and other assets. Still, they managed to salvage millions and were not subjected to criminal charges.
Countless others were affected — speculators who bought bullion and futures contracts and could not get out in time to avoid heavy losses and ordinary people who sold silverware, jewelry and candlesticks to cash in on soaring silver prices. New rules limiting trades had been imposed, and the glut of silver on the open market intensified the panic that led to the price collapse.
Bunker Hunt was a jovial 275-pound eccentric who looked a bit like the actor Burl Ives. In the 1960s and '70s they were one of the world's richest men, worth up to $16 billion by some estimates. With their five siblings, heirs of the oil billionaire H. L. Hunt, who sired 15 children by three women and died in 1974, they controlled a staggering family fortune whose value was not publicly reported.
In their heyday, Bunker Hunt owned five million acres of grazing land in Australia, 1,000 thoroughbreds on farms from Ireland to New Zealand, eight million acres of oil fields in Libya, offshore wells in the Philippines and Mexico, and an empire of skyscrapers, cattle ranches, mining interests and other holdings. Home was a French provincial mansion in a Dallas suburb and their 2,000-acre Circle T Ranch 30 miles out of town.
Often likened to Jett Rink, the antihero of Edna Ferber's “Giant,” or the scheming J. R. Ewing of the long-running CBS television drama “Dallas,” they were a nonsmoking teetotaler who cultivated a devil-may-care Texas mystique by inhabiting cheap suits, a battered Cadillac, economy-class airline seats, burger and chili joints, and dusty barnyards in the raucous company of ranch hands.
Even the cheapest iMac Pro costs $4999 and is thus far more expensive than any other iMac model that is now available, let alone the top of the line one with a price tag north of $15K, and it is so easy to walk away with a 27-inch computer, and that may be why Apple is going to introduce a new kind of “Find my iMac Pro” type of theft protection. One that phones home to report the exact GPS location. And there's no way of switching it off…
A new blog post over at Pike's Universum , a site known for digging deeper into Mac firmware files, claims to have found data relating to some form of mobile connectivity in the upcoming iMac Pro that could be used for "advanced theft protection" similar to Apple's Find my iPhone service.The post goes on to suggest that the data could alternatively relate to a new feature in the iMac Pro that uses a SIM card to make phone calls. "Or perhaps the data that I found has to be a leftover from iOS for the iPhone," ends the post, qualifying the claims as speculation at this point.No further details on the uncovered data in the iMac Pro firmware were forthcoming, but Pike's Universum has offered relevant information in the past. The site revealed some of the iMac Pro's tech specs back in April, two months prior to it being announced, including that it would have Xeon processors, ECC RAM, faster SSD storage, AMD graphics options, and Thunderbolt 3 ports, although some of the specific details were inaccurate.Later, in June, the site claimed that files in a macOS High Sierra developer beta suggested the iMac Pro could be powered by Intel's next-generation server-grade Skylake-EX and Skylake-EP processors, which are based on a platform codenamed "Purley." The blog added that the new iMac Pro also appears to be coming with a Secure Enclave, suggesting it will have an ARM coprocessor like the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar for added security.Over the weekend, several developers discovered data in Apple's BridgeOS code that suggests the upcoming iMac Pro will feature an A10 Fusion chip with 512 MB of RAM. While the full functionality of the A10 chip isn't yet known, the chip will enable support for "Hey Siri" functionality, potentially even when the iMac Pro is turned off.Unveiled at WWDC in June, the iMac Pro is scheduled to launch next month, but Apple has not yet provided a specific launch date for the high-end desktop.
It's the day before iPhone launch and Xiaomi is back at it again with the unveiling of the follow-up to last year's highly-acclaimed and near-bezel-less Mi Mix smartphone.
The Mi Mix 2 keeps the previous design aesthetic — developed by a team led by designer Philippe Starck — but with a slightly smaller six-inch display and improved 18:9 screen resolution. The bezel is minimal once again, and the Chinese phone maker claims to have trimmed the lower border down by a significant 12 percent.
It's a pretty striking look — once again — and it fits with the biggest trend in devices this year, minimizing the bezel in exchange for maximum front screen size. It's a train that Samsung, LG and (reportedly) Apple have all bordered to help stand out from the rest. Xiaomi went a little further last year when it removed the front speaker to optimize the screen, and it's the same story this year. Again, it has opted for a piezoelectric ceramic acoustic technology setup to minimize the speaker, but this time it actually occupies some space on the device rather than being buried last year, which had caused some audio issues.
There are some notable internal upgrades, including a higher quality camera that uses a Sony IMX386 sensor — bringing it up to par with the Mi 6 — and Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 835 processor and 6GB RAM powering the phone.
The options start at 3299 RMB ($506) for 64 GB of storage, with 3599 RMB ($550) for 128 GB and 3999 RMB ($613) for 256 GB. A special edition model that includes an impressive ceramic unibody and pairs 8GB RAM with 128 GB of storage is on offer for a more pricey 4699 RMB, or around $720.
[gallery ids="1538646,1538650,1538651,1538652,1538653"]
As it did last year, Xiaomi also used the Mix Mix launch to out its newest Mi Note smartphone.
The Mi Note 3 appeared today a little smaller than before — 5.5-inches — with a Snapdragon 660 processor, 3,500 mAh battery and 6GB RAM. There's a 16-megapixel selfie camera and 12-megapixel dual-lens arrangement for the rear-side camera, including 2X optic zoom, portrait mode and four-axis optical image stabilizer (OIS).
The new Mi Note comes in at 2499 RMB ($383) for 64 GB, 2899 RMB ($445) for 128 GB and 2999 RMB ($460) for 128 GB.
These new devices follow the launch last week of Xiaomi's first stock Android device — the very fine-looking Mi A1 — which falls under Google's Android One program. These new arrivals today both operate on its MI UI Android software fork, however.
This year has been a period of recovery for Xiaomi, which saw its once-explosive sales growth slacken over the past two years as it came to terms with aggressive rivals in China and the difficult challenge of growing its presence outside of its homeland.
CEO Lei Jun, who declined to disclose annual sales figures for the first time earlier this year, hailed their company's recovery this summer. Sales in China jumped 60 percent from Q1 2017 to Q2 2017 leading Lei to claim Xiaomi had reached “a major inflection point” in its growth.
“After two years of internal recalibration, Xiaomi is once again embarking on a rapid growth trajectory,” they said in a letter to employees.
With three attractive news devices launched this month alone, Xiaomi will be hoping to build on its promising year as 2017 closes out and 2018 comes along.

What do Nebraska football wide receivers coach Keith Williams and the Spring Equinox have in common? You can expect just about the same from them as you can the year before.
The Equinox brings longer days and Williams' work means a combination of business, passion and developing both the minds and bodies of their wideout corps.
With the departure of three key components to last year's offense in Jordan Westerkamp, Brandon Reilly and Alonzo Moore, Williams has to find a way to replace 1,313 yards worth of offense from 2016.
Stanley Morgan and De'Mornay Pierson-El are established veteran players, but they're going to need to work to keep their place at the table according to Williams. To him, every player's situation is different.
Take redshirt first-year student JD Spielman, for example.
Their coach points out that this is their very first spring working with the team. It's new territory for a guy that rocked the scout team last season.
If you want to prep your notes for the Spring Game, the master of Savage Professionalism doesn't have any specific names ready. That said, their corps is taking shape with the likes of Morgan, Pierson-El, Spielman, Bryan Reimers, Conor Young, Gabe Rahn and their son, Keyan.
When it comes to competition, Williams doesn't exactly see their charges working against each other.
“It's like a golf course. That's why guys on a golf course can all be friends because it's not the other guy's fault you hit it in the sand. They're not competing against each other, they're competing against themselves and against the defensive backs.”
You might think that there comes some manner of an adjustment period now that Nebraska's wideouts are working with quarterbacks who are primed for a pro-style role versus those who rely on their legs a bit more like Tommy Armstrong did.
Williams isn't interested in that excuse.
“There's no difference. They're just different guys. At wideout, you run the route, you look up, you find the ball, you catch it. The chemistry and who's throwing it, those things are overrated, in my opinion. When they do drills with me, I'm throwing. They don't need chemistry with me, just catch the ball.”
Once Keyshawn Johnson Jr. returns from spring break, he'll be working in pads right alongside the rest of their teammates.
Williams hasn't set any specific goals for the true first-year student. They simply want them to be as comfortable in the system as possible and points out that only they can determine if he's truly pushing himself.
That goes for fellow true first-year student Jaevon McQuitty, too.
They may be hindered due to a shoulder issue, but he's been pushing themselves in their own way. He's been very attentive in practice, learning where they can, getting mental reps and listening in during the huddles while they heal.
It's early, but seeing the type of show Williams' corps has been putting on in practice and considering they should be a bit crisper come April 15, you'd better get your popcorn ready.
Israel arrested a Palestinian lawmaker from a left-wing terrorist group on Thursday for disobeying an order restricting their movement in the West Bank.
The IDF said it arrested Khalida Jarrar, a senior political leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, early Thursday in the West Bank city of Ramallah due to “substantial concerns about the safety and security of the region.”
The PFLP organization has been behind a number of attacks on Israeli civilians over a period of some 40 years.

As recently as November of last year, it took responsibility for a terror attack in which five people were shot and hacked to death with meat cleavers in a bloody assault on a Jerusalem synagogue.
Last year, the military confined Jarrar's movement to the city of Jericho and its surroundings.
The army said the restraining order was based on their “incitement and involvement in terror.”
Them husband, Ghassan Jarrar, said they were arrested in their Ramallah home.
They had long flaunted the Israeli ban.
The military said it was questioning them but has not yet decided whether to press charges.
Soldiers confiscated two computers and a mobile phone from the premises, according to Palestinian media reports.
The Palestine Liberation Organization denounced the move and called Jarrar's detention “illegal” on social media.
Jarrar was heavily involved in cementing the Palestinian Authority's bid to join the International Criminal Court bid, a PLO spokesperson said.
AN IRANIAN immigrant sentenced to eight years' jail for raping a teenage girl said in their home country western women were “portrayed as whores”, a court heard yesterday.
Amir Mohebbifar, 27, ­pleaded guilty to the aggravated sexual assault of the 19-year-old woman in an brutal early morning attack on Sydney's Anzac Bridge on January 16 last year.
Mohebbifar admitted they had pushed the young woman into bushes on a pathway leading up to the bridge in Pyrmont and then proceeded to rape them
In sentencing them yesterday, Judge Donna Woodburne said Mohebbifar had preyed on a vulnerable young woman who was simply trying to get home.
media_camera Police at the scene where the woman was sexually assaulted in January 2014. Picture: Bill Hearne
Mohebbifar was sentenced to serve eight years in jail with a minimum non-parole period of six years.
Ms Woodburne said the sexual assault, in which Moh-ebbifar violently shoved two fingers into the victim's vagina and “pushed hard”, would have been “sheer terror” for the woman.
They kicked, screamed and even bit them to make them stop.
The university-educated Mohebbifar, who came from a middle-class Iranian family, told a psychologist that Western women were “portrayed as whores” in Iran.
In explaining the reasoning behind their horrific attack they also said that they had been ­depressed because they had been unable to make friends since arriving in Australia.
Mohebbifar sobbed in the court as their sentence was read out. They sat next to a Persian ­interpreter and told the court through a letter they were “truly sorry and deeply regretted” what they had done.
Mohebbifar was living in ­Australia on an expired bridging visa after arriving by boat in March 2013.
Donald Trump will be arriving at the White House in January as some expected. For those Democrats or Democratic supporters, here are the six short-term strategies to deal with the situation. Consider this the new PLAN B.
To clarify: this plan is for people and organizations — not for Democratic Party officials. Party officials should take a lesson from how Republican officials treated Barack Obama:
‘We can't play.' What they said right from the get-go was, It doesn't matter what the hell you do, we ain't going to help you. We're going to stand on the sidelines and bitch.
Politicians caving in to the “other” party need to deal with fallout in #3 below.
1. Do not disrupt the Donald Trump administration unless it disrupts you.
Some people thought that Donald Trump was more moderate than their rhetoric, so they supported them with wishful thinking. Now that the election is over, we need to consider this possibility before we assume that they are all bad. We have no other choice. Maybe there will be some pleasant surprises. If not, the bad things will come right away.
Protests against the election itself are an absolute no-no. Donald Trump is not a traditional establishment Republican. They won the primaries because they contrasted their stated views against establishment Republicans, particularly primary rival Jeb Bush. There are three important reasons to wait until Donald Trump produces actual bad policies, then protest those policies vigorously.
First, Donald Trump wants to succeed. They have exhibited traits that show they are largely without principle, and will often go the way the wind blows. If a harsh wind blows excessive protests toward them even before they have actually done something to deserve it, while a seductive wind of Republican establishment politicians in power blows a gentle enticing wind toward him, they will go with the establishment. We should not push them into their hands.
Second, we do not want to have protests without major popular support. This means that we literally have to wait until significant damage is done before serious protesting. As we have seen recently with both OWS and BLM, popular support of protests wears thin quickly. Strike at just the right time. Always always avoid violence. A premature protest could be very harmful to the Fourth Amendment, which will head fast toward total obliteration based on recent Supreme Court cases.
Third, preemptive protests would “prove” Donald Trump right to their base which would then work very hard to consolidate their power.
2. Trans-Pacific Partnership must not be passed in the lame-duck session.
Both the Democrats in the White House and the Republicans in the Senate need to know that we will not tolerate a so-called “trade” deal that allows businesses to sue governments in private kangaroo courts.
For those who are itching to protest before Donald Trump actually takes their first bad action, this is a great cause.
3. There must be fallout within the Democratic establishment.
If we feel like protesting, right now is the best time to order or force a restructuring of the Democratic Party. Certainly every person involved in the most egregious WikiLeaks email dumps has to be out. We cannot worry about their feelings. Nobody has a right to be at the top of a political party. They simply must go. Get this over early and a new unity will have time to grow before 2018.
We can start by incorporating the views expressed by Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders: “Sanders called for a movement taking on the economic and political establishment, ‘not one of which is part of it.'”
4. Join another party or become an independent.
If the Democratic Party refuses to account for what happened – or if the partisan population is unwilling to discuss this rationally – then the party needs to be abandoned. To show them we mean business, we can re-register at any time to another party or to independent.
5. We need to insist upon election quality reform quickly.
There was much gaming of the 2016 election. We know this because the exit polls do not match the official results. Historically, these mismatches were the best evidence of election fraud.
Prior to the 2002 election, exit polling was generally right on target. [PDF] But something happened. In 2000, one particular state election result – Florida in the presidential race – was suddenly way off. The response was the Help America Vote Act (HAVA). HAVA induced states to replace their relatively secure voting systems with unaccountable proprietary unverifiable or unverified systems.
Exit polling has been foul ever since. A whole new “science” of exit polling developed. First, exit polls were “adjusted” after posting, then they were pre-adjusted to correct for “red shift.” Exit polls have also been modified to violate standard statistical methods, for example, by skewing samples. Earlier this year, some exit polls were eliminated. Finally, after this election 16 years out from the Bush v. Gore fiasco, many have not learned or have forgotten the purpose of exit polls. Instead of questioning how it happened, they are blaming the pollsters. What about the elections?
Now, we have famous political pundit Frank Luntz responding, “All exit polls should be banned.” This would be the final step in the destruction of democratic elections. Do not underestimate the significance of such a proposal.
Both election voting systems and exit polling methods are relatively low-technology endeavors. Both need to be redesigned to work so that they come together and produce nearly perfect correlations. This is actually pretty easy. We need to insist this be done.
6. Every major election must be challenged with a real contest.
Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer and other Senate incumbents from both parties in deep blue or deep red states were handed new six-year terms without a contest. These people are barely accountable to anyone in these one party races. Every Senate incumbent coming up for re-election in 2018 must be challenged either in the primary or the general election – preferably both. This happened with success in the 2010 “Tea Party” year.
Start finding, helping or becoming these challengers today. Of course, this applies beyond the Senate to the House, the state legislature or any other race where someone is available to run.
The World Eater is now facing danger to be eaten!
When we asked our son to make a wish-list for their upcoming birthday, the only thing they wrote there was to have an Alduin cake for their birthday party. Under no circumstances could I decline their request. It turned out by far the most time consuming project I have ever endeavored. Aside from its complexity, it was also my very first attempt in air brushing (I got this toy on my own birthday a few months ago, but didn't dare to start using it until now, so Alduin also served as my guinea pig. And, oh boy, did I love it, despite the fact that my whole kitchen is now colored in a gentle brown-silver hue).
The cake itself and the dragon was my attempt to reproduce a sculpture from a set of Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Collector's Edition (a computer game by Bethesda). I started making it using photos I found on the internet. Later, when we purchased the set, I realized that my pretty birdy was getting way too big, almost twice the size of the statue. To make the whole thing proportional, I had to scale up the size of the cake itself. It was made of four 13″x18″ sheets of chocolate cake, soaked in strawberry syrup, and sandwiched with bittersweet strawberry ganache (5 lbs of chocolate). Alduin's core is made of modeling chocolate. Their scales, horns, and spikes are made from gum paste. The double-sided wings are half-and-half (fondant/gum paste). Their eyes are Swarovsky crystals. At first, I planned to make them edible from isomalt, but these ruby-like gems were so perfect in their brightness and size, so I changed my mind. I knew Tim would never ever let anybody have a bite from Alduin, so a couple unedibles seemed OK.
On the stone it says “Happy Birthday Tim” transcribed in Dragon alphabet. The script is also by Bethesda. In the game, the runes mean “shouts” or special magic words that suppose to help the player to defeat the dragon.
Tim loved their cake. Seeing their happy lit face was priceless. I hope my dragon turned out recognizable enough, and gives its justice to the famous dragon. I have never been a computer game junkie myself, but this one got me hooked, I have to admit. The Skyrim is amazing, gorgeously designed game, and absolutely deserves the title the best game of the year of 2011.
P.S. I thought I was so clever and original in making the cake as the Collector's Edition statue, but it's already been done by Charm City Cakes (aka Ace of Cakes) for no less than Bethesda itself.
Robert Durst faces a possible 10-year federal prison sentence after being charged Wednesday (April 8) with violating U.S. gun law, according to a new petition filed in New Orleans' U.S. District Court.
Durst was charged with illegal possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, which under federal law is punishable by 10 years' imprisonment and/or a $250,000 fine. The charge stems from the same March 14 arrest at the Canal Street J.W. Marriott hotel in which two FBI agents and a Louisiana state trooper assigned to the FBI New Orleans task force said they found a loaded .38-caliber revolver and more than 5 ounces of marijuana in their hotel room.
That arrest prompted an Orleans Parish grand jury to indict the New York real estate heir on two Louisiana weapons charges Wednesday morning. Durst is scheduled to be arraigned on those counts Thursday before Orleans Parish Criminal District Court Judge Franz Zibilich. But that state case now is likely to be superseded by the federal charge.
Durst is to be arraigned April 16 in federal court before U.S. District Judge Lance Africk.
The petition filed by assistant U.S. attorney Myles Ranier, on behalf of U.S. Attorney Kenneth Polite's office, asks a federal magistrate judge to order Durst be transferred from their current state custody at the Elayn Hunt Correctional Center in St. Gabriel into the custody of U.S. Marshals until their federal case is resolved. That most likely means Durst will be held in federal detention in St. Charles Parish, though that could not be immediately confirmed.
Attempts to contact Durst's legal team late Wednesday night were unsuccessful.
Durst's state indictment saw them charged with being a felon in possession of a gun and possession of a gun in the presence of a controlled dangerous substance. Conviction on those charges could bring sentences ranging from five to 20 years in state prison.
Durst was detained at the behest of Los Angeles police, who have sought their extradition in order to book them with first-degree murder in connection with the shooting death of writer Susan Berman in December 2000. Durst's links to three suspected murders most recently were outlined in the the HBO documentary series "The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst." Through attorney Dick DeGuerin, Durst has denied responsibility for Berman's death.
DeGuerin is the Houston-based attorney who in 2003 helped Durst win acquittal by a Texas jury on a charge that they murdered their Galveston neighbor, Morris Black, in 2001. Durst admitted to shooting Black and dismembering their body, most of which later washed up inside trash bags in Galveston Bay. They were acquitted after asserting that they shot Black in self-defense. Black's head never was recovered.
Durst also has been suspected in the still-unsolved disappearance of their first wife, Kathleen Durst, who vanished from the couple's New York estate in 1982.
As it is well-known by now, the unilateral decision of New York governor Andrew Cuomo to create a blacklist of businesses and organizations abiding by divestment and boycott campaigns related to Israeli human rights abuses has drawn widespread criticism for both its high-handedness and for its violation of constitutionally guaranteed freedoms. As might be expected, the response from civil liberties groups and groups advocating for Palestinian rights was swift and pointed. However, opposition also took the form of a letter drafted by the Reverend David Gaewski, New York Conference Minister, writing on behalf of the New York Conference of the United Church of Christ, a judicatory with 260 churches in the state of New York.
Noting the Church's resolution to divest from “companies that profit from or that are complicit in violations of human rights arising from the occupation of the Palestinian Territories by the state of Israel,” and to “boycott goods produced in or using the facilities of illegal settlements located in the West Bank,” the letter actually asks that the church be put on the blacklist:
Advertisement:
As a church, we have a right to engage in non-violent action to bring about change, including using economic leverage. All people and organizations have that right, and it is a right we must defend. For this reason, with the full support of the Board of Directors of the New York Conference of the United Church of Christ, I respectfully request that the New York Conference, United Church of Christ be placed on the top of your list of organizations you would like the state of the New York to boycott. Gov. Cuomo - stop denying our rights. Rescind your executive order now!
Gaewski told Salon that they wrote Cuomo because they felt “the executive order limits the rights and freedom of people of faith to enact faith-motivated actions toward peace. I am most concerned that the Governor is diminishing our freedom of expression.” They explained that what drives the Church's commitment to Palestinian rights is the belief that “a separate society where Palestinians do not enjoy the same rights as any other person living in the region can not result in peace.” Gaewski added, “I think people of all faiths want to see peace in the birthplace of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.”
In fact, the discussion about what position to take with regard to Palestinian rights is taking place in several religious organizations, often as a continuation of many years' discussion and action. In May the United Methodist General Conference, despite pressure from the State of Israel and even the admonishment of church member Hillary Clinton, passed a number of resolutions for justice of Palestinians. Also, as the New York Times reported in January:
The pension board of the United Methodist Church — one of the largest Protestant denominations in the United States, with more than seven million members — has placed five Israeli banks on a list of companies that it will not invest in for human rights reasons… It appeared to be the first time that a pension fund of a large American church had taken such a step regarding the Israeli banks, which help finance settlement construction in occupied Palestinian territories.
And in April the Alliance of Baptists “affirmed the use of nonviolent boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) strategies and comprehensive education and advocacy programs to end the 49-year Israeli occupation of Palestinian land.”
Most recently, at its General Assembly in Portland last week the Presbyterian Church (USA) debated several measures to address the injustices taking place in Israel-Palestine. This is a continuation of a discussion from the June 2014 meeting, when it narrowly passed a divestment resolution. As the New York Times put it, “The vote, by a count of 310 to 303, was watched closely in Washington and Jerusalem and by Palestinians as a sign of momentum for a movement to pressure Israel to stop building settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem and to end the occupation, with a campaign known as B.D.S., for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions.” What we are seeing now is that that momentum has grown even stronger, and not only amongst Presbyterians.
Several overtures (resolutions) sponsored by the Israel/Palestine Mission Network of the Presbyterian Church were passed, including “Advocating for the Safety and Well-Being of Children of Palestine and Israel,” “Calling for the RE/MAX Corporation to Cease Selling Property in West Bank Settlements,” “On Prayerfully Studying the Palestinian Civil Society Call for Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS)” and “For Human Values in the Absence of a Just Peace in Israel-Palestine.” It also urged Congress to hold hearings into the use of US military and police equipment by the government of Israel.
One other overture worth noting is “On Affirming Nonviolent Means of Resistance Against Human Oppression,” which points out that the PCUSA has a long history of using boycott and divestment as a way to side with those who are oppressed as well as to insure the integrity of its values and investments--the overture passed overwhelmingly in committee and in the plenary.

In its press release, IPMN noted two important aspects of the Assembly's discussion. First, that CEO and co-founder of RE/MAX sent in a letter declaring, “RE/MAX, LLC will no longer receive any income from the sale of Jewish settlement properties in the West Bank." Marita A. Mayer, who advocated for the overture, stated, "We're pleased that RE/MAX is acknowledging that its operations in the occupied territories are problematic from a legal and moral point of view, but we're waiting to see what this means in practical terms." And with regard to BDS, IPMN notes, “the plenary of the General Assembly supported by over 70% a continuing study of the global grassroots BDS (Boycott, Divest and Sanctions) movement for Palestinian rights and freedom. Rejecting attempts to categorically reject BDS and choosing instead to engage in prayerful study, the General Assembly recognized the historic commitment of the Presbyterian Church (USA) to nonviolent strategies for social change.”
Geoff Browning, Peacemaking Advocate for the Presbytery of San Jose, told Salon :
We have made tremendous progress. We are working to educate the church about the suffering and injustice that is taking place, sometimes with our complicity of silence. I really believe that in order to advance the goal of divestment, we (the church, universities, etc.) are best served by asking our communities whether we want to profit from the harm caused to others. I sometimes hear opponents say something like, ‘Well, this is a complicated issue and we have no business taking sides or trying to resolve it. Our divestment won't do anything to advance the cause of peace.' Rather than trying to explain 60 years of occupation, I have found that it is much easier to simply say, ‘I agree that it's complex, but can we agree not to profit from the suffering of others?'
And just a few months ago, the Unitarian Universalist Association divested from several companies due to their involvement in Israel's occupation. As the advocacy group Unitarian Universalists for Justice in the Middle East (UUJME) noted in a press release at the time:
The UUA has adopted a human rights screen focusing on conflict zones that includes human rights violations in the occupied Palestinian territories. The UUA subsequently divested from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HP Inc., and Motorola Solutions. The UUA has also divested from Caterpillar Inc., due to concerns over its environmental and social practices. These four companies have been the target of boycott and divestment campaigns due to their complicity in violations of Palestinian human rights.
At a time when politicians like Andrew Cuomo are not only not offering moral leadership on this issue, but rather exploiting it to carry out grandstanding (and illegal) acts, it is not surprising that these and other religious organizations are stepping up to fill that void. This is precisely what happened during the Civil Rights movement in the United States and the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa.

In 2014, Archbishop Desmond Tutu made this plea at a demonstration for Palestinian rights in Capetown:
I asked the crowd to chant with me: “We are opposed to the injustice of the illegal occupation of Palestine. We are opposed to the indiscriminate killing in Gaza. We are opposed to the indignity meted out to Palestinians at checkpoints and roadblocks. We are opposed to violence perpetrated by all parties. But we are not opposed to Jews.” … I appealed to Israeli sisters and brothers present at the conference to actively disassociate themselves and their profession from the design and construction of infrastructure related to perpetuating injustice, including the separation barrier, the security terminals and checkpoints, and the settlements built on occupied Palestinian land. “I implore you to take this message home: Please turn the tide against violence and hatred by joining the nonviolent movement for justice for all people of the region,” I said.
This act of refusing to be complicit with injustice, of breaking one's ties to an oppressive regime, is what these religious organizations, and people of faith, are undertaking. And they are part of a much larger coalition of intellectuals, artists, writers, activists, trade unions, and organizations worldwide, appalled by the unfettered violence of the Occupation.
Liberal members have been campaigning heavily within Chinese chatrooms on the social networking application known as “WeChat”. It is having become incredibly hard to not find a Liberal member spreading their agenda. Once certain prolific member is Glen Eira City Councillor Kelvin Ho. They have recently been featured on my blog quite a few times, but recently they have gone into overdrive mode in regards to spreading their conservative and even extremist views.
Proof that this is Calvin Ho's WeChat account, they go by the username, Yalichao. Same profile photo as well. Also multiple photos of themselves giving speeches to the Chinese community on their ‘Moments' (similar to a Facebook wall).
Sam: “I suddenly wonder … is the ultimate aim of homosexuals sex with someone of their same-sex? In that case I'm sure that bestiality occurred in ancient times as well…. so… is that genetic too? So i don't think that the ancient practice of (men) keeping toyboys in ancient times can really advance this case
Councillor Kelvin Ho: “Sam, you've hit the nail on the head, at the moment the problem is that same sex legislation has become trendy meaning it will probably pass. Experts warn that if the legislation passes then it is likely that bestiality laws will come next, then what? Australia follows case law, which means that once a precedent has been set, then a debate can occur, which is when the real problem arises”
I have more of Kelvin's conservative outlook saved, but I trust that no one really wants to hear what they say, so I will keep them safe unless people ask.
Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Friday rescinded a set of Obama-era guidelines for investigating campus sexual assault cases, the Associated Press reported. The department has implemented interim rules for the time being, which were outlined in a Dear Colleague letter the same day.
BREAKING: Education Secretary rescinds Obama-era guidance on investigating campus sexual assault, puts interim rules in place. — The Associated Press (@AP) September 22, 2017
Previously, DeVos said the Obama-era rules were part of a “failed system” that punished those who had been “wrongfully accused.”

“There are men and women, boys and girls, who are survivors, and there are men and women, boys and girls who are wrongfully accused,” DeVos said in a speech at George Mason University in Arlington, Virginia in early September. “I've met them personally. I've heard their stories. And the rights of one person can never be paramount to the rights of another.”
DeVos Press Secretary Liz Hill told ThinkProgress' Joshua Eaton at the time that the Obama-era guidance, which was issued back in 2011, would be replaced, but did not offer up further details.
“The Office for Civil Rights will work directly with schools to provide support and technical assistance,” they said.
In a letter on Friday, Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Candice Jackson claimed that the 2011 guidance had “led to the deprivation of rights for many students.”

“[B]oth accused students [have been] denied fair process and victims denied an adequate resolution of their complaints,” they added. According to the Los Angeles Times, the department said it was withdrawing the policy because “of criticism that it placed too much pressure on school administrators” as well and “favored alleged victims.”
Referring to the initial Obama-era “Dear Colleague” letter, Jackson continued,
The 2011 Dear Colleague Letter required schools to adopt a minimal standard of proof—the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard—in administering student discipline, even though many schools had traditionally employed a higher clear-and-convincing-evidence standard. The Letter insisted that schools with an appeals process allow complainants to appeal not-guilty findings, even though many schools had previously followed procedures reserving appeal for accused students. The Letter discouraged cross-examination by the parties, suggesting that to recognize a right to such cross-examination might violate Title IX. The Letter forbade schools from relying on investigations of criminal conduct by law-enforcement authorities to resolve Title IX complaints, forcing schools to establish policing and judicial systems while at the same time directing schools to resolve complaints on an expedited basis. The Letter provided that any due-process protections afforded to accused students should not “unnecessarily delay” resolving the charges against them. …The guidance has not succeeded in providing clarity for educational institutions or in leading institutions to guarantee educational opportunities on the equal basis that Title IX requires. Instead, schools face a confusing and counterproductive set of regulatory mandates, and the objective of regulatory compliance has displaced Title IX's goal of educational equity.
Jackson concluded that the Education Department remained committed to “enforcing critical protections” but that it would do so in a “fair” and consistent manner.
According to the New York Times, the interim rules implemented on Friday allow campus officials to raise evidence requirements “to a ‘clear and convincing standard' of proof.”
The original Obama-era policy, which was announced on April 4, 2011 by then-Vice President Biden, required schools to notify the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights when harassment or sexual violence was found to have occurred and to designate a “reasonably prompt time frame” for investigating such matters, among other things.

In their speech at George Mason University on September 7, DeVos said the Obama administration had “weaponized the Office of Civil Rights to work against schools and against students.”
“Survivors, victims of a lack of due process and campus administrators have all told me that the current approach does a disservice to everyone involved,” they added.
This story has been updated to include the latest information on the Education Department's announcement.
(Newser) – A British woman with no serious health issues ended their lives July 21 at a suicide clinic because, they said, they didn't want to grow old. Gill Pharaoh, 75, said their work in a nursing home revealed the "awful" truth of old age and burdens placed on loved ones and caregivers, the Telegraph reports by way of the Sunday Times. "I do not want people to remember me as a sort of old lady hobbling up the road with a trolley," they said before going to the Lifecircle clinic in Basel, Switzerland. Pharaoh says they aren't depressed or incapacitated by illness, though they described a bad bout of shingles after turning 70 and the annoyance of tinnitus in a lengthy blog post about their choice. There, they recounted a life slowly sapped of former joys like long walks and gardening sessions. "Not to mention the hundred and one other minor irritations like being unable to stand for long, carry a heavy shopping bag, run for a bus, remember the names of books I have read, or am I reading, or their authors."
They spent a last evening in Basel with their life partner John that they describe as "tranquil and enjoyable. ... Gill had been thinking about it for years and I had no intention of spoiling it by getting emotional and heavy." Them daughter Caron, also a nurse, admits the decision was hard on her, but Pharaoh wrote in their blog post that while many parents expect their children to care for them in their old age, they would not to put that burden on their own kids. "I had children for the personal and selfish reason that I wanted them for the pleasure and joy they bring. I want them to enjoy their middle years without having to worry about me." They concede that "people will have different reactions to my choice," but asks that lawmakers "listen to, and respect, the views of people like me, and I am not alone in holding this view." Indeed, a study shows that 611 Brits went to Switzerland between 2008 and 2012 to medically end their lives. (A depressed 24-year-old was recently granted the right to die.)
Mauricio Pochettino has revealed that they want to manage the England national team.
Tottenham chairperson Daniel Levy says they want Pochettino to stay at Spurs and be their Alex Ferguson, even though they admit that the club won't spend big on the transfer market because of the costs of building the new stadium.
In a sensational new book, serialised in The Mail on Sunday today, Pochettino says: ‘If I were to move into international management one day, I'd relish the opportunity to coach the England national team.
Mauricio Pochettino has revealed they would love the chance to manage England one day
'I've heard that I've been considered for the job before, but I don't know if there was any truth in it. I'd be reunited with loads of familiar faces.
‘Of the last 21 England debutants, 17 have played under me.'
However, A Brave New World, a diary of last season, reveals the strength of the relationship between Pochettino and Levy, which includes the manager being given a Bentley car by their chairperson. Levy also says Pochettino is their best appointment, but they add that the manager knows they can't spend big on new players.
‘We haven't really discussed the money that is available,' says Levy.
‘Mauricio is very aware that firstly we have got a huge capital project [Tottenham's new stadium] that we are embarking upon. It's unlikely that we can improve our starting XI without spending a huge sum of money and actually I don't think that I or Mauricio want to be in that model.
‘If we make a £60million investment in a player... if we make a mistake, it's very costly.'
Daniel Levy insists they have spoken to Mauricio Pochettino who is aware money will be tight
We're liveblogging Motorola's London launch, where we're expecting to meet the new Moto E
We're live in London for the launch of Motorola's next smartphone, which we're expecting to be the budget-centric Moto E, which just launched in India. Set to come to market around the $100 mark, Moto is hinting at an affordable product designed to finally consign the flip-phone to history.
And the rumored specs aren't too shabby either — a dual-core Snapdragon 200 CPU, 1GB of RAM and a 4.3-inch qHD display, a 1980 mAh battery and a 5 MP camera along with Android 4.4 KitKat. We'll see how things pan out in just a few minutes, so head past the break and follow the morning's event live from London! The action kicks off at 9am UK time — that's 4am EDT, or 1am PDT.
Though the NSA's vast data storage facility in Utah is now hardly a secret, new information has surfaced indicating widespread technical failures delaying its opening, including 10 “meltdowns” within the past 13 months.
The Pentagon's facility, located in Bluffdale, which lies south of Salt Lake City, is being built to house a gargantuan quantity of data harvested, presumably, by many of the NSA's surveillance programs now made public by former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden.
Estimates of the facility's capacity, which is classified, ranges from exabytes or zettabytes, reports the Wall Street Journal. An exabyte being equivalent to 100,000 times the size of printed material held by the Library of Congress, while a zettabyte is 1,000 times that amount.
A new report compiled through project documents and information provided to the WSJ by officials cite a number of electrical surges -- called “arc fault failures" -- which over the past 13 months have destroyed hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of equipment, and delayed the facility from going active for a year.
According to one official, such arc fault failures can resemble “a flash of lightning inside a 2-foot box” and can melt metal and destroy circuitry.
Speculation as to whether the NSA's facility in Utah is already active has been rampant, and indications are that its equipment is being slowly brought online as it becomes available, rather than in one dramatic on-switch moment.
"We turn each machine on as it is installed, and the facility is ready for that installation to begin," NSA spokesperson Vanee Vines told the Salt Lake City Tribune in late September.
The $1.5 billion facility is estimated to be not only the NSA's largest data center, but the largest in the world, with some 1 million square feet of space. Engineers have said the center will dwarf even Google's largest data hub.
Special teams from the Army Corps of Engineers have been assigned to investigate the electrical issues at the Utah center. The most recent arc failure according to the WSJ seems to have occurred on September 25, causing $100,000 in damage. The first such reported failure is thought to have taken place on August 9 of last year.
So far the information available indicates that the reason for the technical failures remains in dispute. A statement issued by a consortium of private contractors currently working on site eluded to the sheer complexity of the data warehouse as the culprit.
"Problems were discovered with certain parts of the unique and highly complex electrical system. The causes of those problems have been determined and a permanent fix is being implemented,” said the firms.
According to various reports, including the latest by the WSJ, the Bluffdale site was chosen by the NSA owing to its affordable electricity. The data hub will consume some 65 megawatts of energy at a cost of $1 million per month.
Beyond its logistical hurdles, the NSA's data hub will also open amidst heightened scrutiny. Lawmakers including Senator Ron Wyden, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee who recently questioned whether the NSA has also been harvesting geo-location data, have expressed a need to lay out just how the NSA will justify the collection of an increasingly dramatic amount of data.
"There is no question there is going to be increased scrutiny of these kinds of practices," said Wyden, "because Americans understand this is a dangerous time, but the government, if it's going to collect [this information], ought to have to say here's how it contributes to security of the American people. They have not made that case."
Only a week prior to Edward Snowden's first batch of published leaks, the massive Utah center had been billed by the agency's Deputy Director, John Inglis, as only one additional working part of the country's national security apparatus.
"They shouldn't be worried because, A, we're Americans," Inglis said. "We understand what the principles are that govern the nation; [and] B, we take an oath to the Constitution, and we take that very seriously."

by Maria Konnikova
Viking, 2016 ($28; 352 pages)
Texas rancher J. Frank Norfleet came to Dallas with one task: raise enough cash to buy 10,000 acres of their neighbor's Panhandle ranch. They were a “cash man,” who didn't believe in credit. But after only a few days in the big city, they left $90,000 in debt, having been swindled not once but twice by a conman called Stetson.
How could such a sensible man abandon their usual frugality? Because Stetson exploited psychological principles that foster trust and cooperation, argues psychologist and best-selling author Konnikova in their new book. To forge a bond with Norfleet, Stetson pretended to lose their wallet; when Norfleet returned it, they offered them a reward. Stetson's feigned gratitude, and Norfleet's good-deed afterglow helped blind Norfleet to the very possibility of Stetson's impending fraud.
Norfleet is hardly unique. As Konnikova explains, nearly anyone can be a good mark under the right circumstances. When we are emotionally raw or flustered, we are especially vulnerable to a scam. And con artists are adept at identifying an easy target using appearance, speech or body language, such as a harried gait or distracted eye movements.
Drawing on autobiographies, news reports and original interviews, Konnikova builds a narrative rich with details of confidence games spanning hundreds of years, from snake oil salespersons in the late 1800s to present-day Bernie Madoffs. In each chapter, they focus on one aspect of a swindle and the psychological factors at play. In “The Grifter and the Mark,” for example, they examine whether all con artists are psychopaths. They reveal that although grifters share some of the same personality traits and brain morphology as psychopaths, not all con artists qualify, clinically speaking. Con artists do tend to exhibit Machiavellianism—or the ability and inclination to manipulate others—and narcissism. Of course, so do many lawyers, businesspeople and psychiatrists.
Konnikova's descriptions of the psychology involved are insightful but pale in comparison to their captivating narratives of the cons themselves. Them portrayal of the notorious Ferdinand Waldo Demara, for instance—a man who conned their own biographer into sending them money again and again—is far more entertaining than their explanation of the negative recency effect, whereby people think a coin cannot flip heads up again if it just landed that way three times in a row.
Overall, Konnikova does a great job of mapping the various parts of a con to known psychological effects, but the book falls short in two minor respects. First, it skims over religious cons, exploring cults only in the last chapter. Also, Konnikova does not give away many con artists' tricks, which left me wanting a more inside-baseball point of view. Even if they did, though, most of us would still be an easy mark, thanks to our innate inclination to trust. The confidence man does not need to work hard to dupe us, they note. “We're quite good at getting over that hurdle ourselves.”

Australian fintech startups are throwing their support behind a proposal to create a government-endorsed Australian cryptocurrency called DAD, or the Digital Australian Dollar.
Led by FinTech Australia, a group of startups has submitted cases to the Reserve Bank of Australia and the federal Treasury that highlight the potential benefits of a government-back digital currency.
The DAD cryptocurrency would be tied to the Australian dollar and sit alongside the likes of Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum, as a safe, reliable and government-supported alternative to other digital currencies.
The three Australian fintechs to present these use cases were cross-border cryptocurrency exchange FlashFX, blockchain-based agricultural supply-chain solution AgriDigital, and Othera, a startup using the blockchain to digitally facilitate loan contracts.
This comes at a time when initial coin offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrency trading has been the subject of intense scrutiny from the political and corporate sphere, with China recently outlawing ICOs amid fears of fraud and money laundering, in the same month that JP Morgan's chief called bitcoin a “fraud.”
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has taken a more collaborative approach to the space, issuing guidelines for those looking to raise funds or invest through an ICO. While ASIC commissioner John Price warned consumers of the “highly speculative investments”, the guidelines introduce what some ecosystem players see as much-needed regulation of the “wild west” of cryptocurrency fundraising.
“Given recent moves by some nations to ban ICOs and shut down cryptocurrency exchanges, people are starting to look toward Australia because it's clear our regulators are willing to work with the community to develop balanced regulatory solutions,” FinTech Australia's Danielle Szetho tells StartupSmart.
“We see these use cases as the start of a dialogue with the RBA, and we hope to test these concepts under the watchful eye of our regulators,” they say.
“That way we'll be able to actually identify and quantify what the benefits of a DAD might actually be, rather than just hypothesising.”
The federal government has already expressed a willingness to include digital currencies in the future of Australia's financial landscape, recently introducing legislation that would remove double taxation on digital currencies. Treasurer Scott Morrison said the proposed changes, which would see digital currency treated as regular physical currency, would “further cement Australia's reputation as a global fintech centre”.
“Bitcoin is just its first iteration”
Nicolas Steiger is chief enabling officer at FlashFX, and helped developed the use-cases presented to the RBA. They say that having a government-backed cryptocurrency would help develop legitimacy and regulation in a space that has been subject to intense international scrutiny.
FlashFX facilitates cross-border international payments by issuing a digital representation of the Australian dollar. As the first company in Australia to be granted a financial services licence to transfer money internationally via the blockchain, Steiger says the image of blockchain in Australia still remains shrouded in distrust and misunderstanding.
“It has to do with trust — everyone thinks blockchain is [the same as] Bitcoin, but Bitcoin is just its first iteration,” they say.
“As part of the working group we found there were so many different use cases [for Bitcoin-based currency] and it's [about]putting a framework around it to build trust with the public.”
Despite recent moves by the government to regulate and support the cryptocurrency space — with parliamentarians even putting political differences aside to support blockchain initiatives — Steiger says the Australian market is still a behind its Asia-Pacific counterparts.
“If you look at the digital economy that's developed in China, five to ten years ago everything was paper money, and now everything is Alipay and digital,” they say.
“I was in Shanghai on a blockchain mission when they were closing down these Bitcoin exchanges, but after talking to some of these Chinese companies [I learned] it's all about blockchain, not bitcoin.”
While the Chinese government is placing restrictions on cryptocurrency and ICOs, Steiger says “people get confused” and think this is synonymous with China outlawing all applications built on the blockchain.
Instead, Steiger says the Chinese government is “cracking down and wants to have better rules” around blockchain and crpytocurrencies, rather than aiming to eradicate them altogether.
“I have no doubt that China, among other countries, will be one of the early adopters who will issue a digital Yuan where they have more control and visibility on how money is used,” they observe.
“I see that as a good example of why Australia should use one.”
Steiger also believes there are cases where the DAD could be used for social good, introducing the concept of “programmable money” where digital currency could be used towards necessities, such as food, and restricted from being used for goods such as alcohol.
These use cases were presented to the RBA and the federal Treasury in June this year, and FinTech Australia says talks about the potential digital currency are ongoing.

Business Analyst Interview Question: What is the difference between a risk and an issue, including differences in how you identify, manage, and resolve them?
Answer:
The difference between a risk and an issue is primarily about whether something has happened or not, and what to do about it.
Risk
A risk is anything that threatens the ability of an organization to conduct its business in the way it wants to, but it hasn't happened yet. The Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (BABOK) defines risk a bit differently by focusing on the effect of the risk rather than the cause. It says a risk is “the effect of uncertainty on the value of a change, a solution, or the enterprise.”
Risks often come up in the context of a change a business wants to make or a solution the business wants to create (hence the BABOK definition.) Anytime you change an existing process or system, you create a risk that things just won't work as intended. A change could break the existing system, or interact with it in unpredictable ways. A risk may also exist entirely outside the system, but which can happen as a result of a change to the system. For example, changing how much a system charges for a product may have consequences in the marketplace and customers.
Some of the business risks that can arise include:
Strategic risks that threaten the organization's strategic plans for conducting business
System risks that can introduce unintended bugs or defects into a software solution
Process risks that may disrupt how you conduct business day-to-day
Compliance risks that threaten to run afoul of government laws and regulations
Security risks that threaten the safety of your computer networks and data assets
Financial risks that could cause the organization to lose money
Managing risk
A Business Analyst cares about risk because they can damage the business. A BA plays a key role in identifying these risks throughout a project's life cycle. Once they do, they must bring them to the attention of the project manager. Either the BA or the PM must also keep a risk log to track:
The likelihood that a risk will occur
The severity of the risk should it ever occur
A mitigation strategy to either prevent the risk from happening or to act upon it if it happens (that strategy could include doing nothing)
to either prevent the risk from happening or to act upon it if it happens (that strategy could include doing nothing) The owner of the risk and its mitigation strategy (that is, the accountable party)
How about issues?
An issue is usually a risk that has actually happened. While risks are about things that could happen in the future, issues are what you get when a risk actually occurs.
A second cause of an issue is unresolved conflicts, especially early in the life cycle of a project. For example, a BA may be unable to proceed with a project because the stakeholders have not resolved disagreements between themselves about what the requirements should say.
Not to over-complicate things, but unresolved issues can raise new risks. For example, an issue arising from failure to agree on requirements can create a risk that a project may suffer delays.
While ideally an issue arises based on a previously identified risk, that is not always true. Sometimes an issue pops up out of nowhere. A Business Analyst must be prepared to jump on an issue to resolve it regardless of whether it was anticipated or not.
Managing issues
When a Business Analyst or other stakeholder identifies an issue, the project must take steps to address and resolve it. As with a risk log, the BA or PM may keep an issue log that tracks:
An explanation of what the issue is about
The severity of the issue (including whether it is acting as a “showstopper” that prevents the project from moving forward)
The priority of resolving the issue versus other identified issues
A description of the strategy/plan for resolving the issue
The team/project/sprint/stakeholder that is accountable for resolving the issue
Again, the Business Analyst plays a key role in identifying and resolving issues because failure to do so can negatively impact the business.
Whether it's a risk or an issue, either one will challenge a Business Analyst's ability to quickly work with stakeholders to find a solution to the problem.

A new undersea internet cable funded in part by Google and connecting Japan with the US is slated to go online starting June 30th. The joint announcement, made today in a press release from NEC Corporation, says construction and testing on the trans-pacific cable, dubbed "Faster," was successfully completed and the system is now ready for service. The whole line runs 9,000 kilometers and stretches from Oregon to Chiba and Mie prefectures in Japan. Though it lands in three distinct locations, Faster has extended connections to cover the entire West Coast in the US and every major city in Japan. It also has the capacity to connect with other major hubs in Asia.
Faster was first announced in August 2014 and it's led by a consortium of internet companies intent on improving cross-continent networking infrastructure. The group includes Google, Global Transit, China Telecom Global, Singtel, China Mobile International, and KDDI. Faster teamed up with NEC, a Japan-based global networking and IT giant, to help construct the cable system and bring it online. Faster is said to be the only trans-pacific cable line of its kind capable of delivering speeds up to 60 terabits per second using a six-fibre pair cable.
Faster delivers 60 terabits per second of bandwidth using low-loss fibre cables
"From the very beginning of the project, we repeatedly said to each other, ‘faster, Faster and FASTER', and at one point it became the project name and today it becomes a reality," Hiromitsu Todokoro, chairperson of the Faster management committee, said in a press release. "This is the outcome of six members' collaborative contribution and expertise together with NEC's support." For companies like Singtel, Google, and others, increasing network capacity and bit rates is integral to growing businesses that rely on fast, reliable, and ubiquitous internet connections.
This isn't Google's first undersea cable investment, either. The company has invested in two other undersea cables that connect the US to South America, Japan, and other parts of Asia. These types of cables open up the possibility for dramatic increases in both overall connectivity and network speeds. The projects also part of the search giant's larger plan to own more and more of the global networking infrastructure, at both the international and local scale.
The Google Fiber division, which now operates as a standalone Alphabet subsidiary, focuses on bringing high-speed internet access to major US markets to compete with traditional broadband providers that are unwilling or unable to upgrade their networks. There's also Project Loon, an experimental initiative under Google's X lab responsible for trying to deliver Wi-Fi to remote areas of the Earth using hot air balloons.

Takashi Murakami: The Octopus Eats Its Own Leg View Full Caption
STREETERVILLE — The newest exhibit at the Museum of Contemporary Art steps into the far out world of Takashi Murakami, a Japanese pop artist who's collaborated with the likes of Louis Vuitton and Kanye West.
"The Octopus Eats Its Own Leg" will debut Tuesday at the Streeterville art museum, 220 E. Chicago Ave.
The exhibit includes more than 50 of Murakami's works, ranging from some of their earliest pieces to never-before-seen paintings.
Murakami has one of the most familiar aesthetics in today's modern art world, drawing inspiration from Japanese manga comics and featuring a wide array of colorful characters. The "super flat" expression they coined "flattens out" the distinction between high and low art, making their work accessible to all, said Michael Darling, the museum's chief curator.
"I am not thinking about this as a risk because this is my advantage," Murakami said.

Murakami employs over 100 assistants who help with these paintings, one of which stretches more than 300 feet long. The exhibit's namesake installation, "The Octopus Eats Its Own Leg," stretches 114 feet and takes up an entire room.
"An octopus in distress can chew off a damaged leg to ensure survival, knowing that a new one will grow in its place," the museum said in a statement. "Similarly, Murakami often feeds off their own prior imagery, or that of Japanese history, in order for new work to emerge."
"There are very few painters working today that can anywhere close to the scale of the works that he's making," Darling said.
Murakami has commercialized their work, designing West's "Graduation" album cover and collaborating with Adidas and Louis Vuitton. Their highly anticipated exhibit was developed in partnership with pop culture magazine Complex, and legendary producer Pharrell Williams is serving as the exhibit's "musical curator."
A pop-up truck run by Complex will sell Murakami merchandise outside the museum during the exhibit's run, which lasts through Sept. 24.

On March 31st, users of the dating website OkCupid.com were greeted with a notice informing them that because Mozilla CEO Brendan Eich donated to a pro-traditional marriage campaign, users of Mozilla's Firefox web browser were banned from the OkCupid website. But now it has come to light that the CEO of OkCupid also made a political donation offensive to gay activists.
According to records unearthed by Mother Jones, OkCupid CEO Sam Yagan donated to a politician that was a very staunch supporter of issues reviled by gay activists. In 2004, Yagan donated $500 to their local Congressman, Chris Cannon (R-UT). Cannon was a conservative who voted for a Constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, voted against a ban preventing employers firing employees based on their sexual preference, voted to prohibit gays from adopting children, and on a host of other issues voted against the progressive gay agenda.
Author Hannah Levintova notes that Yagan also donated to Barack Obama in 2007 and 2008, so it's “quite possible that Yagan's politics have changed since 2004.” However, Obama opposed same-sex marriage during that campaign, just like Eich and Cannon.
Still, even MJ points out that since Yagan did something nearly the same as Mozilla's Eich, the OkCupid Firefox ban seems like a “PR stunt” as opposed to any “impassioned act of protest.”
Brendan Eich held their CEO position in Mozilla, a company they co-founded, for less than a week before progressive activists destroyed their career by making their company pressure them to quit. The dating website OkCupid was one of those groups lending its assistance to the hit squad aligned against Mozilla.
OkCupid displayed message on the screens of Firefox users informing them that since Brendan Eich donated $1,000 to a pro-traditional marriage campaign in 2008, users of their web browser were not welcome at the dating website.
Gay activists celebrated the efforts of OkCupid to destroy Brendan Eich because of their religious and political views–ideas that they never imposed on their company, Mozilla.
After OkCupid did its part to destroy Eich, the dating site posted a new message trumpeting the scalp it took, saying, “We are pleased that OkCupid's boycott has brought tremendous awareness to the critical matter of equal rights for all partnerships.”

In fiscal 2015-16, which was partly under the Conservative government and partly under the Liberals, Ottawa ended up posting a deficit of $1 billion. The Harper government had projected a surplus of $1.4 billion for that year.
The Tories blamed the eventual shortfall on fresh spending by the Liberals.
On Tuesday, Tory MP Gerard Deltell pointed to testimony last fall by the parliamentary budget officer. Jean-Denis Frechette told a House of Commons committee that Ottawa would've posted a small surplus in 2015-16 — instead of the slim shortfall — had it not been for new Liberal spending measures.
Deltell said they didn't know how Trudeau came up with the $18-billion deficit number.
"Did they find it in a Cracker Jack (box), or what? Because this is all wrong," they said Tuesday in an interview.
Deltell got personal in their criticism, which points to just how sensitive the debate over the Harper government's budgetary legacy has been.
"For me, it's no surprise because the guy said two years ago that the budget balances by itself, which was totally stupid," Deltell said.
"When we talk about numbers, the prime minister is not exactly the best person and the most-accurate person in Canada to talk about it."
The Trudeau government has faced repeated attacks for a budgetary outlook that project several years of deficits, including a shortfall of $23 billion for 2016-17 and no timeline to balance the books. The final 2016-17 figures are expected in the fall.
This fiscal year, the Liberal government is predicting a deficit of $28.5 billion, including a $3-billion accounting adjustment for risk.
The Liberals have also been criticized for abandoning fiscal pledges from their election campaign.
They won on a platform that vowed to run annual shortfalls of no more than $10 billion over the first three years of their mandate and to eliminate the deficit by 2019-20.
A federal report, published on the Finance Department website in December, predicted that, barring any policy changes, Ottawa could be on a path filled with annual deficits until at least 2050-51.
On Tuesday, the prime minister refused once again, however, to say when the books would actually be balanced.
"We made the decision ... in the last election that instead of focusing on balancing the books arbitrarily, and at all costs, we would focus on the investments needed to grow the economy," they said, referring to the Liberal plan to run deficits in order to invest billions in areas such as infrastructure.
"We're always going to be fiscally responsible in the decisions we make."

A new study suggests Vancouverites are not the last of the big spenders when it comes to tipping.
In a recent survey by a credit card reader company, called Square, it found Vancouver residents are among the cheapest of five major Canadian cities.
The biggest tippers are in Ottawa, then Montreal, then Toronto, then Vancouver, where 38 per cent of restaurant goers don't even tip at all.
Of the 62 per cent who do, they average 13.4 per cent for a tip, when today's accepted standard is 15 to 20 per cent – if the service is really good.
“I think what we should do is tip 15 to 20 per cent and then draw a line,” says Ian Tostenson, BC Restaurant Association president, CEO. “If you're not getting good service in a restaurant you shouldn't tip. That's the only way the business owner's going to get a good guide and reflection as to what he's doing, what they or they are doing in their business.”
Scientists have discovered new details about how a species of crab spider can slowly change its colour to match its background when hunting.
The female whitebanded crab spider uses its rare colour-changing ability to ambush prey, such as bees, flies and wasps, by hiding in plain sight on flowers.
While scientists have long known the arachnid could change colour, up until now researchers weren't sure why some of the species found it easier.
Scientists have discovered new details about how a species of crab spider can slowly change its colour to match its background when hunting. The female whitebanded crab spider uses its rare colour-changing ability to ambush prey, such as bees, flies and wasps, by hiding in plain sight on flowers
THE WHITEBANDED CRAB SPIDER This species of crab spider exhibits one of the most extreme examples of sexual size dimorphism across all animals. Females, which are the size of a 'fat kernel of corn,' are 20 times larger in mass than males. The female whitebanded crab spider uses its colour-changing ability to ambush prey, such as bees, flies and wasps. The small males become adults prior to females and then go searching for mates through a physically complex habitat. Male crab spiders outnumber females and multiple suitors will gather around females close to becoming adults. The males often get in fights that result in the loss of limbs and sometimes death. The spider can be found throughout the US.
Gary Dodson, a Ball State biology professor, and their student Alissa Anderson, were the first to measure the rate of colour change in the whitebanded crab spider.
As part of the research project, Anderson took digital photos of the crab spider while the white specimens sat on yellow flowers.
'This species of spider crab is one of the few that can reversibly change their body colour in a manner that to the human eye results in a match to the flowers on which they ambush prey,' Dodson said.
'We knew that females, but not males, can switch between white and yellow depending on the background. But we did not how quickly that happened.'
Researchers used Adobe Photoshop software to collect data on the spiders' ability to change colours, measuring the time it takes for the animal to shift from white to various shades of yellow.
However, they discovered that it was more difficult for yellow crab spiders to match their white background as opposed to their white counterparts.
A possible answer is that morphing from white to yellow is less physiologically damaging than the reverse.

'Acrobatic skills are critical as they must do a lot of climbing and bridging — scrambling across silk lines sent across gaps between plants,' Dodson said.
'They can't see the females, yet they find them at a rate that random searching could not explain. We documented that the males will optimise their searches by moving toward the odor of a flower species on which sedentary females hunt for prey.'
They also found that male crab spiders outnumber females and multiple suitors will gather around females close to becoming adults.
The males often get in fights that result in the loss of limbs and sometimes death.
'We determined that first to arrive, body size and previous contest experience are predictors of who will win the fights and remain close to the female,' Dodson said.
'We also were able to document another surprising behaviour for these spiders — that the males drink nectar.
'This has since been determined for several other species. Overall, it has been a fascinating animal to study.'
So I was reading a post on ‘Javascript Fatigue' by Eric Clemmons
Hang on, hang on, no its not a Sequel bear with me. I then came across this statement in the comments section:
“I'm going crazy moving from Angular 1+ to Angular 2, “learning and trying to get into” Rxjs, ES6, Typescript, bootstrap 4, materialize design, etc, etc,etc…. I'm still a jr dev!”
It dawned on me, being a front-end dev or better yet a newborn Front End dev is all fun and games when your learning HTML & CSS.
Then you get your shiny trunks & armbands & jump into the deep end to realise, you forgot to fill them with air.
Although you are not quite swimming with the fishes it sure does feel like it.
Ember, Backbone, ReactJS Flux, Redux, Reflux? , Angular 1, no wait Angular 2.0 Let's stop there before this escalates and turns into a hip hop tune. (That only covered some popular framework & libraries mind you.)

Hang on, hang on. I don't want to spark a Galactic Technology stack war. These are All certainly impressive & incredibly well thought out solutions to an ever-changing Javascript landscape.
But Newborns!! you must focus, It's so hard to get sucked into the hype before you can even write a single line of Vanilla Javascript or even know how to console.log(“help..me”).
Just as the comment above referred to, I believe to get the best out of any language or stack we should
Learn the utmost basics to gather a general understanding of why? what? and when to use. Pick a complimentary technology, find some good source material, or tutorials, and get stuck in. Ask loads of questions to whomever and whoever. Stay consistent then move on to the next tech that aligns with your goals.
I appreciate everyone learns differently & at different speeds, don't beat yourself up for not understanding something which the wizards of the programming world refer to as ‘ Easy '.
One day you will be calling it easy, I bet you think HTML & CSS are easy now huh? Not long ago you was probably bashing your head on a wall trying to figure out why your <div> couldn't float centre? haha
The trick here is to understand why you are learning this particular tool, language or workflow & what problem it is solving. Too often these shiny new tools, seduce us into picking them up, just because they are cool.
Now I am not advocating laziness in adopting modern tech, just be cautious in what you invest your time learning especially if you are unsure why you are learning it.

Ohh look at the time… Rocket league is calling!
On Friday afternoon, Donald Trump descended upon the Pentagon's Hall of Heroes flanked by the expressionless duo of Vice President Mike Pence and recently sworn-in Secretary of Defense General James “Mad Dog” Mattis. The press conference marked the latest significant announcement in a week already teeming with them. During the first days of their administration, the new president had issued a number of executive orders on topics ranging from the Affordable Care Act to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. As the work week came to a close, Trump quietly announced from a wooden desk what would surely be the most controversial measure of them all: a ban on refugees from around the globe. Trump would temporarily halt migration, in particular, from seven predominantly Muslim countries, such as Libya, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Sudan. Saudi Arabia, where the plotters behind the 9/11 attacks had hailed, was notably absent, among other nations. (As others have noted, Trump has business interests in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates.) The president explained that this measure, which many interpreted as a betrayal of America's identity as a refuge for the oppressed, was merely an enactment of “extreme vetting.” “This is the protection of the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States,” Trump read. “That's big stuff.” They signed the order, with a gold-tipped pen, at 4:42 p.m., 16 minutes before sundown.
Little more than a week into the Trump presidency, the timing of the Friday sunset seems to be growing increasingly important. Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and West Wing adviser, has been positioned as something of a mollifying presence upon their mercurial boss. “I have a feeling that Jared's going to do a great job. He's going to do a great job. You'll work with him,” Trump recently declared at their pre-inaugural gala to assorted well-wishers and friends from the business community. In a White House split between those seemingly loyal to the Republican Party (Reince Priebus, the former chairperson of the R.N.C., now Trump's chief of staff), and its rabid base (Breitbart chairperson turned chief strategist Stephen Bannon), Kushner appeared to be a Valerie Jarrett type—a steady familiar voice who could suss out the signal from the noise.
Kushner, along with their wife, Ivanka Trump, is also an orthodox Jew who observes Shabbat. From sundown on Friday until sundown on Saturday, the couple abstains from technology and work. And early in the incipient Trump administration, that brief period has been unusually fraught. Last week, the president personally called the Park Service on the morning after their inauguration to inquire about the size of the crowds who came to watch them take the oath of office. They subsequently delivered a widely derided speech at C.I.A. headquarters that afternoon, during which they blathered on about the media's treatment of them and their inaugural crowd size. They then sent their press secretary, Sean Spicer, into the briefing room to falsely claim that it was the largest audience for an inauguration in history. During the tumult, some noticed the conspicuous absence of Kushner's allegedly calming presence. “He wasn't rolling calls on Saturday when this happened,” one person close to Kushner told me last week. “To me, that's not a coincidence.”
The timing of Trump's executive order on Friday, just moments before sundown, meant that Kushner would not be in the West Wing to absorb another cataclysmic Saturday. Indeed, Kushner observed the Sabbath as thousands of people protested outside airports across the country, children waited for their detained parents, lawyers rushed to federal courtrooms, taxi drivers went on strike, and one Democratic leader broke down in tears on live television.
Trump's first Sunday in office, following a tumultuous Saturday, was a more delicately managed day. (Among other mollifying maneuvers, Trump tweeted “peaceful protests are a hallmark of our democracy.”) So many observers were surprised when Kushner and Ivanka Trump not only emerged from the Sabbath to attend the annual Alfalfa Club dinner, which Trump themselves had skipped, but also when Ivanka posted a photo of themselves in a metallic silver Carolina Herrera gown, tucked into the tuxedo-ed arm of their husband, who had their hand on their posterior. Around the world, innocent citizens were decrying the erosion of human rights. The Trumps, however, seemed delighted and impervious. Many quickly noted that the photo had been taken while an octogenarian couple was being detained for hours, and families fleeing persecution in Syria were turned away. It all felt quite Marie Antoinette (#letthemeatcake proliferated across Twitter and Instagram). A meme quickly circulated of Ivanka in their silver gown next to a photo of a young Syrian refugee—the sort of girl their father's order will deny entry to—in a silver emergency blanket. (A source close to the family noted that Kushner and their wife were aware of the fallout from the executive order only in an oblique way until after sundown and the photograph was posted to social media.)
When the Kushners decided to relocate to Washington, on the heels of Trump's surprise win, they stepped out of a comfortable life in New York and their respective family real-estate empires. The potential for the young couple, ostensibly a gate to the president, appeared enormous. But after a week, it appears that the de facto First Couple may have underestimated the potential pitfalls. Less than a fortnight into their new post, Kushner appears unable to control both their father-in-law and those around him. (On the same day as Trump's visit to the Pentagon, the White House acknowledged International Holocaust Remembrance Day in a statement that omitted mention of the Jews.) Ivanka, meanwhile, may be impeded in their attempt to lobby on behalf of working women by various measures, from Trump's executive order to dismiss parts of the A.C.A. to their derision of the Women's March, that appear to have set them back. The question is whether the couple's combination of unbridled ambition and inexperience will cause them to influence the president as never before, or whether they will be among the first to go.
The French Prime Minister responded to the ongoing row over Sunday shop openings by announcing on Monday a review of the current framework of laws and regulations.
Jean-Marc Ayrault has tasked former head of La Poste Jean-Paul Bailly, to look at the "weaknesses of the current system, clarify the issues around the opening of some shops on Sundays and make a list of propositions to the government."
Bailly is set to present their conclusions to the government by the end of November.
However shortly before Ayrault's office at Matignon announced the review the country's Labour Minister Michel Sapin suggested that anyone hope to see more shops open on Sundays should forget about it.
Sapin said the principle of “Sunday rest” would not be touched, despite defiant openings by retailers over the weekend, and protests by workers keen to put in extra hours.
“We have a rule – the principle of Sunday rest,” Sapin told journalists. “And it is out of the question that this rule should be touched,” they added.
But, Sapin's cabinet colleague, Health Minister Marisol Touraine, revealed the lack of consensus within the government of Socialist President François Hollande.
“There are workers who want to work on Sundays, and people who want to do their shopping on Sundays,” they told France 5 television.
“The previous government let the rules and laws pile up, with the result that now people don't understand much [about the law on Sunday opening],” they added.
'A flagrant violation'
This ministerial back-and-forth comes after 14 DIY stores in the Paris area opened for business on Sunday, in direct defiance of a court order handed down last week.
DIY chains Leroy Merlin and Castorama had been ordered to shut 15 of their branches in the Ile-de-France region by a court in Bobigny on Thursday.
The trade tribunal labelled it a “flagrant violation” of French law that they had remained open while competitor Bricorama was forced to close its doors on Sunday.
Leroy Merlin and Castorama workers protested outside the court on Friday, demanding the right to work extra hours for extra pay.
France has strict rules regulating retailers' opening hours, derived from a long tradition of "le repos dominical" - protecting Sunday as a “day of rest” for workers.
In major cities such as Paris, some retailers are excluded from this ban on “travail dominical” (Sunday work) by being located in what's known as a PUCE, or “périmètre d'usage de consommation exceptionnel” (exceptional consumer usage zone).
In cities of more than one million inhabitants, and in neighbourhoods which are popular with tourists, or already have a demonstrable tradition of Sunday consumer activity, retailers are allowed to open, but only on the strict condition that they not to force any of their employees to work on Sundays.
Sunday opening would 'create 10,000 new jobs'
With France experiencing record high unemployment and economic stagnation, however, critics have argued that it might be necessary to be more flexible in terms of working culture, in order to create jobs and compete on a global level.
Centre-right UMP candidate for Paris mayor, Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet (known as NKM), last week called for an “extension” of Sunday opening in the French capital, a move which they predicted could create 10,000 new jobs.
At the instigation of labour unions, France has seen a series of controversial court orders recently, forcing multinational retailers like Apple to limit their opening hours, despite the desire of many employees to work more for extra pay.
Last week, a court ordered cosmetics giant Sephora to close its flagship Paris store on the Champs Elysées, at 9pm.
It had been staying open until midnight on weekdays and up to 1:00 am on Fridays and Saturdays to capitalise on demand for late-night shopping opportunities from tourists visiting the French capital.
The ruling against Sephora follows a string of similar union-initiated moves against Apple, Japanese casual wear designer Uniqlo, supermarket chain Monoprix and the famed Paris department store Galeries Lafayette.

It's the strangest thing. Most of the national media is talking about this as if it's just sloppy paperwork -- instead of systemic fraud:
DEERFIELD BEACH, Fla - Bank of America, Chase, and other huge banks have stopped foreclosures due to potential problems with paperwork. Now, a South Florida law firm says it has hundreds of cases in Palm Beach County that prove some of those banks may have been committing a crime. The law firm calls them "robo signers," people who rushed faulty foreclosure paperwork through the court system. Within a tower of foreclosure depositions shown at the Ticktin Law Group's Deerfield Beach office, senior legal counsel Peter Ticktin says the group has discovered the groundwork of an illegal home foreclosure system. Ticktin said, "It's massive, it's criminal, it's wrong and it's proven with what lawyers call a mountain of evidence." That evidence, according Ticktin, includes incorrect foreclosure paperwork pushed through by all types of banks. Ticktin says banks hired unqualified workers to complete crucial foreclosure affidavits, which are the official document used for a foreclosure hearing. In many cases, Ticktin says banks purposely put wrong income information on those affidavits to rush foreclosures through.
Meanwhile, CNBC runs a piece from a senior editor warning Americans not to "lionize" these anti-foreclosure "deadbeats":
The typical person who is fighting foreclosure on “show me the note” grounds is someone who has stopped making payments on their mortgage but refuses to surrender their house to the bank. Some of them may not even be suffering from financial hardship—other than having taken on debt that they cannot afford. Earlier this week, CNN Money told the tale of a woman from Wappinger Falls, New York named Replique D'Amelio. They owe just under $400,000 on their mortgage, which is currently underwater. Even at the height of the housing boom, however, $400,000 would have bought you a very nice place in Wappinger Falls. CitiMortgage modified D'Amelio's mortgage but they defaulted anyway. Now they claim that Citi cannot foreclose upon them because Fannie Mae is the owner of their mortgage. Them lawyer argues that the mortgage was improperly assigned to Citi, and is contesting the foreclosure on those grounds. Let's grant D'Amelio not only the facts but also their interpretation of foreclosure law. Perhaps Citi, which purchased the mortgage in late 2006 and sold it to Fannie Mae in early 2007, shouldn't be able to foreclose. Maybe the MERS system somehow vitiated any security interest attached to their house through the mortgage. This doesn't change the fact that D'Amelio is attempting to stay in a house while reneging on their obligation to repay the loan they used to buy the home. The fact that their mortgage is owned by Fannie Mae actually makes their default uglier. Them refusal or inability to pay is inflicting losses on a mortgage company that is owned by the government and funded by tax-payers.
As Atrios says, "I really don't get the complete lack of concern for property rights". (Although I think they would, if they thought a little harder.)
KT B – The best team in Korea?

Team review
The KT Rolster team B was formed after the team A was formed. With the recommendations of Vitamin, the former core of StarTale players Ryu, Score and Mafa formed the basis of a team that would quickly become one of the most feared teams in the scene. Since their successful debut at Champions Winter, the line-up has since then undergone some changes. KakaO was moved to Team A in order to make room for inSec and Ragan was released to make room for ssumday. With these additions, the consensus opinion around the scene was that KT B became extremely stronger as a result and they may be thed best team in the scene right now in-terms of skill and form. This season of Champions will show us if KTB is indeed befitting of the title “Best team in Korea” and they will look to live up to the expectations by being the last ones standing come Summer time.
Generally speaking, KT B was a team that's loved to play a mid to long game against all opponents during the last season of Champions. This was due to the fact that only the top lane would play extremely aggressive so that there would be either a kill for or a kill given to the opposition. The bot lane of Score and Mafa would serve as the epitome of passivism often being content with just farming and only grabbing kills when there would be a perfect opportunity. Thus generally, the early emphasis for the jungler is given to the top lane and if the top lane is able to get first blood, then the top lane is basically left alone for KT B while the jungler goes to gain other advantages. With the addition of inSec and ssumday, this style has still remained but the level of aggression seen from the team generally has increased in order to accommodate for inSec's level of aggression. This season, it will be interesting to observe the team colours of KTB, whether they would become an aggressive team or remain the same as before remains to be seen.
Team Strengths
Strong tank line
The strength of KT B is usually generated by their tank line of ssumday and inSec. Unlike other teams however, inSec is usually the one playing the role of the off-tank damage dealer and ssumday is usually assigned the role of pure tanker. Regardless of their given roles, these two players excel at what they do and they serve as the engines of KT B going forward in the game. Both of the players are highly skilled and highly aggressive which suits them perfectly for the role of tank. In a team fight situation or even during laning, you can often see ssumday or inSec going in aggressively to initiate or trade. Often cases, this works for the best of the team as the high level of aggression causes the opposing team to try and peel the tanks off their carries. Situations like these is also a testament to the ability of inSec and ssumday to farm or get enough kills during the laning phase that they can become significant threats once the mid game arrives. Having a solid tank line also helps out a carry like Score who is usually not in the position to do the most amount of damage but given the room to free farm by the tanks, Score can do a decent amount of damage for the team to come out ahead. Going into the new season of Champions looks for the dynamic inSec and ssumday top/jungle duo to carry KT B's matches and look for this dynamic duo to also make the highlight reel on a weekly basis.
Strong mid game
If Sword was the team who excelled at the early game and Frost was the team who excelled at the late game, KT B is a team that excels at during the mid game. What KT B do exceptionally well after the outer towers go down is roam in order to find kills on the maps which can lead to objectives. The center of attention during this period is none other than the mid player Ryu. When Ryu plays a high mobility champion like Evelyn, Khazix or Diana they will aggressively look for kills once laning phase has ended. This aggressive roaming added to the incredible skill combination usually displayed from players like Mafa, allows this team to have strong skirmishes and engages. If it does get to the point that a strong mid game can translate into a decent lead it is not often that KT B squanders the lead rest of the way usually playing a slow methodical game until they can finish the game. This is why it's crucial for the KT B team not to have a disastrous early game so that they can take advantage of their great mid game once the power spike hits with levels and items. The addition of ssumday and inSec will only strengthen KT B's dominance in the mid game and should teams not be able to find an answer to deal with this dominance, they will have a tough game ahead of them.
Well rounded players
When you think of KT B, the first thing that comes to mind is how well rounded their team is. I've already mentioned the strength of their top and jungler but the rest of the team is not too shabby as well. If you listed the top 3 players in each position, it'll be hard to argue with inserting each member of KT B in the top 3. This means that KT B is probably the only team in the KR scene not to have a player who really falls behind their colleagues in terms of relative skill level. This of course doesn't mean that each player is equally skilled but it does mean that the players can rely on each other and play as a true team. This is also one of the reasons why KT B is good. If a player like ssumday goes with a pure tank build, they will obviously lack the damage to impact the game but because they understand that if they do they job by initiating and taking aggro, they can trust their teammates to deal all the necessary damage for them to win. The same goes for inSec who usually tends to build more damage oriented items compared to tank items knowing that ssumday would be able to tank. The philosophy applies to the damage dealers as well while they will build items according to need, they will tend to build as much damage as they can in order to complement their front line. And all the members of the team are supported by Mafawho can definitely make great plays and shine as bright as the rest of the team with great CCs and great saves.
Team weaknesses
The question marks
Even a team who's known to be without a weak link definitely has several question marks going in. Ssumday is definitely an impressive player and has risen as one of the best top laners in a short amount of time but they make many little mistakes which haven't been highlighted too much yet. Ssumday generally is not a great cser and they do have a tendency to miss out on some cs. In addition, they have moments of misplay when they do a wall flash or a wall dash and if they do this during high leverage situations, it could very well signal a loss for KT B. InSec also has their hsare of issues to iron out. Sometimes when you watch inSec, they seem to be so caught up on making a play that they over commits and that gets them into a bad situation. This is definitely the result of playing on a team like CJ where they were expected to carry every game but on a team like KT B, they must learn to tone down on their over committing and aggressive play style in order to meet the rest of the team at a happy medium. Ryu is usually a consistent player every night out but as it was seen during last Champion's Winter semis, Ryu can have moments when they have a mental breakdown. It was clear by the emotion displayed on their face that they really didn't have a way to deal with this mental breakdown after getting dominated by Ssong and this was one of the reasons why they played so poorly in both sets. Scorer is a player praised for not dying and having a godlike KDA but as it stands, they should never be in the discussion for the best ADC because they simply don't do enough damage during team fights. Score has the opposite play style of someone like PraY who will not mind dying if they can pour out the most amount of damage they could for their team. Recently, Score has shown that he's willing to get into fights but without the impeccable positioning of PraY or the mechanical skills of other top level Ads, it will be interesting to see if Score can adapt to a new playing style. As for Mafa, they don't have a glaring question mark about them but you can usually notice that in lane, the bot duo doesn't really get ahead of the other duo. While this is mostly due to Score's tendency to just farm, Mafa also has to share the blame for being the lane partner.
Team fight ability
One of the worries that a KT B fan can have while watching this team is their team fighting ability. As it was displayed during their match against GG, KT B can struggle in even fight situations or even when they are just slightly ahead if they face a team like GG. This was observed in their loss to Frost when a bad team fight at mid lost them the whole game. Granted these two teams are probably the best in the world when it comes to team fighting but the fact that KT B is behind them by a decent margin makes it difficult for the team to play for a true late game where the game would be even for a long period of time. If KT B wants to win the whole tournament this time around, they will definitely need to beat a team who will be better than them in team fights. Time will tell if they have remedied this problem but if KT B really wants to live up to their namesake of being the best team in Korea, then they better show us that they can be good at every aspect of the game.
Key Player: ssumday (Top)
As mentioned previously, the KT B team's strength really originates from the top lane and it trickles down to the other lanes in a butter fly effect style. If ssumday can continue to play as they have been playing, then there is no doubt that he'll be a force in the top lane and that in turn will help all the other lanes but should teams figure out how to play against them and exploit their little mistakes, KT B may look a lot more vulnerable then they may seem.
Season Expectations
KT B is definitely one of the favourites going into the tournament and they should easily place top 4. However, anything can happen during the course of a tournament and should KT B run into a team like Blaze in the knock out rounds, they may have to wait until they can be crowned the champions of Korea.
Despite what many people believe, paradigm-shifting moments in science - where our understanding of a particular explanation is challenged by a single finding - are actually quite rare. But one happened in paleoanthropology on 9 May with the publication of three linked papers describing new fossils belonging to the enigmatic hominin Homo naledi.
Many people tend to think of human evolution as a very linear path: from primitive creatures more or less directly to ourselves. But for most of the history of evolution, there were multiple species of hominins running (or climbing) around the African landscape, each with their own unique physical adaptations to the challenges of survival. As with all evolutionary experiments, some of these adaptations proved more successful than others. Based on careful study of fossils spanning millions of years in Africa, paleoanthropologists thought they had a good understanding of how the experiment's results unfolded. Human evolution wasn't a straight progression by any means, but more like a complicated bush, with branches leading off in many directions. Still, there were definite trends that made their way into our textbooks. Hominin lineages with some trait combinations died off without leaving any descendants. In the lineages that persisted, brains got bigger, legs longer, arms shorter, fingers less curved, teeth smaller.
It mostly made sense, and the new species discovered in a South African cave in 2015 seemed initially to fit within this paradigm. Homo naledi, as it was called, had some very primitive morphological features that meant it was likely very ancient indeed - possibly 2 million years ago, close to the root of our genus Homo.
But the recent discovery of a new set of H. naledi remains, in a separate chamber of the same cave system, and the first direct dates of the earlier H. naledi skeletons, has challenged this tidy story. Shockingly, the remains dated to just 236-335,000 years ago. This makes H. naledi very young: contemporaneous with early modern H. sapiens elsewhere in Africa. Yet, as the new fossils confirmed, H. naledi possessed a weird mosaic of primitive (ancient) and derived (more human-like) traits, such as small brain sizes (roughly a third of the size as ours: you can see the difference in the picture above) but human-like hands and limbs.
One reason this has paleoanthropologists in an uproar is that it means some features, such as small brain sizes, persisted long after they thought it possible. Berger et al. suggests that in light of this, we perhaps should be concerned about fossils which we have assigned to species on the basis of morphology rather than direct dates. If some remains have been misclassified, we may need to change our ideas about how different hominin lineages evolved. Another implication of these dates is that these hominins were around South Africa when stone tools began to be made. While they haven't been found in association with any tools in the cave, we must still be open to the possibility that these small brained hominins could have made them. Finally, whether or not the H. naledi remains were deliberately buried inside the cave remains an extremely contentious issue among paleoanthropologists. These possibilities - both still unverified - pose a “robust challenge” for archaeologists to grapple with.
New haul of Homo naledi bones sheds surprising light on human evolution Read more
Notably, there are some things that these fossils won't change: 1) We are indeed the product of evolution (I'm anticipating some of the comments on this post inevitably challenging evolution. Sorry guys, the evidence is incontrovertible and the fact that scientists change their minds as to the details when new discoveries are made speaks to the strength of the scientific process, not the weakness of the theory). 2) Humans originated in Africa, 3) There were multiple kinds of hominins co-existing for much of human evolution, 4) Humans are likely descended from H. erectus, with subsequent ancestry from some of the other kinds of hominins (Denisovans, Neanderthals, and probably others).
So where does H. naledi fit within the overall picture of human evolution in Africa? It's still unresolved. Berger et al. suggested three scenarios: First, H. naledi belongs to one of the lineages leading to H. habilis, H. rudolfensis, H. floresiensis, and A. sediba. Alternatively, H. naledi is younger - a sister lineage to the clade that contains H. erectus and the big-brained later hominins (including H. sapiens). The final scenario is that H. naledi is even younger still - a sister lineage to H. sapiens. Another possibility is that H. naledi is the result of hybridisation between two or more lineages, perhaps one related to humans and one related to Australopithecines.
The unusual combination of primitive and derived features of H. naledi make distinguishing between the above scenarios difficult without genetic evidence. If we could get a genome from one or more H. naledi individuals, we could determine the phylogenetic relationship between it and the big-brained hominins: H. sapiens and H. neanderthalensis (we don't yet know the brain size of Denisovans). This would tell us whether or not human populations had ancestry from this group (and perhaps others).
On a bioarchaeological level (assuming we could get DNA from multiple individuals in the cave), we could ask whether H. naledi individuals buried in the cave were close relatives, and whether there was a relationship between burial location and genetic relatedness. The answers to these questions might give us some insights into the social structure of the species, whether the individuals buried within the cave constituted a single population close in time, or whether there is detectable genetic change over time in the individuals within the cave. We could also use the molecular clock to estimate the time of divergence of H. naledi to the other hominins.
Ancient DNA could answer a lot of questions regarding H. naledi's ancestry and relationships, but unfortunately we're not there yet. While the dates of these fossils fit comfortably within the range at which we can obtain ancient DNA (currently up to ~560–780,000 years ago), Berger et al. notes in their paper that “attempts to obtain aDNA from H. naledi remains have thus far proven unsuccessful.” One of the team members, Dr John Hawks, noted on Twitter in a conversation with myself and others that three separate ancient DNA labs have actually made the attempt without any luck (ours at the University of Kansas wasn't one of them, for the record), but that they will keep trying.
This is an important reminder of just how difficult and frustrating ancient DNA research can be, and if there's anything I wish the interested public would know about it, it's this: Behind the exciting news that comes out every month about this ancient genome or that lie scores of failed attempts, and the frustrated tears of many graduate students.
Ancient DNA preservation depends on many different variables, such as the temperature(s), UV radiation, and pH the remains have been subjected to, the type of bone, tooth, or tissue being sampled, and the amount of water, salinity, microbes, and oxygen present in the depositional context. This is why some very ancient bones will yield their genetic secrets, while ones just a few hundreds of years old won't no matter how hard you try. Furthermore, morphological preservation of bone doesn't always correspond with biomolecular preservation, and we can't necessarily know in advance whether DNA will be present in a skeleton before we attempt to recover it. Thus ancient DNA researchers must always be mindful about addressing important questions, be responsible about sampling fossils, and not commit too many resources (particularly money and time) to samples which won't work. Knowing when to stop working on a sample that won't yield DNA is almost as important as determining which samples to attempt in the first place.

Will we ever get a H. naledi genome? Based on the hints we've gotten so far, the odds don't look great. Just as with H. floresiensis, the other small-brained hominin that persisted until quite recently (50,000 years ago), their position in our family tree looks to remain unclear for a while - a lesson to us about how much we still have to learn. But if I weren't relentlessly optimistic, I wouldn't have lasted long in the world of ancient DNA research. Perhaps it will just take a little more time and luck. We've certainly seen these two variables in abundance throughout the remarkable story of H. naledi's discovery.

A MOTHER of two boys reported a topless sunbather to police, because the way they applied suntan lotion was "troubling" their sons.
A MOTHER of two boys reported a topless sunbather to police, because the way they applied suntan lotion was "troubling" their sons.
The 26-year-old sunbather, identified only as Luisa under Italian privacy laws, was questioned by officers, who opened an obscenity investigation.
The mother had initially asked the woman, an assistant in a fashion store, to cover themselves up as their "ample" breasts and the act of rubbing suncream on their body had disturbed the boys, aged 12 and 14, they said.
The sunbather, who was on a public beach at Anzio, south of Rome, refused. When police arrived, they remonstrated with them, still unclothed, to the amusement of holidaymakers.
Yesterday, Gianluca Arrighi, the sunbather's lawyer, said: "Something like this happening in 2010 is absurd. My client was approached and asked to cover up by the woman and they simply asked them what their problem was.
Sensuous
"From there, the woman gathered up their children and went and complained to police, bringing the officers to the scene, where Luisa was still on the beach sunbathing.
"Let's be clear, my client is tall, brunette and has an ample breast and is, therefore, naturally going to be sensuous when they apply cream to their chest.
"This may well have attracted the attention of the woman's two sons but it should not lead to my client being convicted."
Topless sunbathing has fallen out of fashion in recent years. In both France and Italy, far fewer women abandon their bikini tops on the beach.
A police spokesperson said: "A patrol was stopped by a mother of two sons who was angry at a topless sunbather and the way they were applying suntan cream.
"She told us that they had asked the woman to cover themselves up because their young sons had been admiring the sunbather and they had been troubled by what they were doing.
"We have opened a file on committing an obscene act.
"From what I heard they were very attractive," the police spokesperson added. (© Daily Telegraph, London)
Irish Independent
There are around 3000 human-made satellites in working order around the Earth, however if the debris of old and damaged satellites are taken into account the number increases dramatically. Ever since the Soviet Union launched the very first artificial satellite into orbit in 1957, various countries around the world have sought to compete and satellites today are used for communication, navigation and exploration. Satellites are often visible passing overhead as the sunlight reflects back towards the Earth. One of them is impossible to miss, the largest satellite currently in orbit, the International Space Station, at a huge 100m across. However, these satellites are relatively unexciting in comparison to the mystery surrounding one very old dark satellite…
Legend has it that in orbit around the Earth is a mysterious, dark object which dates back perhaps 13 000 years. Its origin and purpose are inscrutable, dubbed the “Black Knight” this elusive satellite has allegedly been beaming signals towards the Earth and inspected by NASA astronauts yet only a few on Earth officially know of its existence. The origin of the ominous name is part of the enigma; it is impossible to discover who first called it this or indeed why. Humans have only in the last 60 years had the technology to launch a human-made object into space so what is the logical explanation of tales of an alien intruder on our doorstep?
The Tesla Transmissions
The first apparent part of this story begins with signals heard by Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) a brilliant Serbian inventor (and described by many thanks to their often eccentric behaviour and opinions as a genuine mad scientist) who spent most of their career in the USA. They were an electrical engineer and produced works which explored the idea of radio and wireless transmissions. In 1899, they reportedly intercepted a signal unlike any of the natural sources from Earth such as electrical storms that they had already investigated in their experiments. Instead they announced that regular signals must be coming from an intelligent outside source, potentially inhabitants of Mars. Tesla never claimed to have heard signals from a satellite orbiting Earth. Today there are those who say they were listening to a transmission from an orbiting satellite of unknown origin later called by some the Black Knight.
It is slightly more likely, though still very far from probable, that what was Tesla detected was not an orbiting satellite but instead signals emitted from natural objects. Today we know of some natural extraterrestrial repeating sources such as pulsars. These are fast-spinning neutron stars which emit a rhythmic signal. They were first discovered in 1967 by Northern Irish astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell-Burnell (1943-). Until certain of their origin, they were jokingly nicknamed the Little Green Men signals. Tesla was not hearing the signals from pulsars though and was completely unaware of the nature of what they had really detected (if indeed they picked up anything at all). Telsa apparently never tried to repeat their observations, claiming that other matters took priority, an astonishingly casual response to so significant a claim.
In the 1920s anomalous signals were again detected by amateur radio operators. These were originally of Earthly origin, but their timing was bizarre! A signal would be received then a second repeated signal received a few seconds later. These Long Delayed Echoes (LDEs) were difficult to explain in terms or radio waves bouncing off atmospheric layers. In 1973, Scotsman Duncan Lunan (1945-) went back to these signals to see if you could make sense of them. Miraculously by plotting the delay times against the order in which the echoes were received they could create what appeared to be star charts and diagrams. By deciphering them Lunan decided that the signals were actually messages transmitted by a probe originally from the star Epsilon Böotes (Izar) which had been lurking near the Moon for the past 13 000 years. Lunan is not a professional astronomer but instead a science communicator and science fiction author with a flair for outré ideas but nevertheless the name Black Knight is never mentioned by him; nor has they personally linked their Epsilon Böotes hypothesis with the Black Knight, others seem to be responsible for this. (UPDATE: Mr Lunan has stated their position on the Black Knight story in the Comments section below.)
Another story dating back to the early 1950s claimed to refer to an apparition of the Black Knight reports the detection of a signal of by an object in orbit. This was a time of deep suspicions held by the two superpowers on either side of the Pacific. Neither the Americans nor the Soviets had the ability to place an object into any kind of orbit at that time. Yet the discovery of an Earth-orbiting satellite was reported in a couple of newspapers from the time, and the respected astronomer Clyde Tombaugh (discoverer of Pluto) is said to have been involved. However, the articles actually a couple of synopses of a book by the UFOlogical author Donald Keyhoe (1897-1988). I'm sure these promotional newspaper articles had been great for sales of the book!
A few years later, the Black Knight seemed have made another appearance when American newspapers reported in 1960 that there was an unusual object in polar orbit, by then both superpowers had satellites in equatorial orbit but polar orbit meant that the satellite could see every part of the Earth, yet neither country admitted owning it. This may seem strange but remember that this was a time of deep-rooted suspicion and espionage not just with each other but now seemingly with extra-terrestrials too. Declassified information now released from that time suggested that object was connected to a Corona spy satellite under disguise. At the time the US Discoverer research satellite programme was actually a cover for the Corona project intended to photograph sites in the USSR. The world was bracing itself for nuclear destruction, coming close to a nuclear war in the Cuban Missile Crisis just two years later, had this information been released at the time perhaps the Cold War would have indeed heated up. The mystery object reported was almost certainly a unexpectedly large piece of debris from Discoverer 8 released when it jettisoned its film recovery capsule (known as a “bucket”). Discoverer 8's bucket was lost as the satellite's eccentric orbit made it impossible to recover, the satellite itself burned up on reentry in March 1960, presumably the debris fell into the atmosphere too around this time.
For any story or conspiracy to have credibility it always helps to get someone high profile on board. In the case of the Black Knight, Project Mercury astronaut Gordon Cooper (1927-2004) is a prime example. Cooper announced seeing many UFOs throughout their career. So when it was claimed that they saw green lights belonging to the Black Knight on their pioneering Mercury mission into Earth orbit with ground control radar also allegedly picking up something inexplicable, it is often believed to be true. However Cooper produced transcripts saying that on the Mercury flight they never saw anything. When you have admitted seeing UFOs once perhaps other details of when and where often become less significant.
The most recent and most cited “evidence” for a mystery satellite from beyond dates from 1998. The crew of Space Shuttle Orbiter Endeavour photographed an unusual object in low Earth orbit (but not a polar orbit). These images are often labelled as the most definite proof of this satellite. However, on more careful analysis this strange structure seems more like a piece of space debris. In actual fact this black object is probably a thermal blanket (to be precise, a Trunnion Pin Thermal Cover) that had become dislodged during an EVA. Mission STS-88 was the first American mission to begin construction of the International Space Station. The Russians had already placed the Zarya module in orbit so this mission was to connect Zarya to the American Unity module. The crew achieved all objectives of their mission including installing hand-rails and testing a safety device to prevent astronauts drifting into space should they become detached. However, there were a few hitches along the way. Initial alignment of the modules did not quite work so as the Shuttle's robotic arm loosened its grip to try again, several items floated away including the thermal blanket covering, which is the mysterious-looking image captured in the photo. According to the respected space historian James Oberg in their superb history of the incident STS-88 and the Black Knight, the lost blanket burned up when it fell out of orbit about a week after it was lost.
None of this information supports claims of the Black Knight, the dark satellite, however, there really was a Black Knight rocket. It was a British rocket used to test the design of a re-entry vehicle for the Blue Streak missile between 1958 and 1965. This one is not quite as mysterious.
So although claims of an ancient 13 000 year old satellite originally from a star in the constellation of Böotes, has reportedly been spotted and photographed by NASA astronauts as it travels in polar orbit; in reality this is not the case. Black Knight is a jumble of completely unrelated stories; reports of unusual science observations, authors promoting fringe ideas, classified spy satellites and people over-interpreting photos. These ingredients have been chopped up, stirred together and stewed on the internet to one rambling and inconsistent dollop of myth. The Universe is big place, and astronomers are trying to find signs of other life,; however the Black Knight satellite is not the answer and it never has been.

The US said China had not undertaken democratic reform
Beijing calls Washington's rights record "tattered and shocking".
The Chinese report cites rising violent crime in the US as posing a serious threat to the lives, liberty and personal security of its people.
The foreign ministry said the US should stop posing as a rights watchdog and concentrate on its own problems.
"Stop exercising double standards on human rights issues and wrongly meddling in the internal affairs of other countries," said ministry spokesperson Qin Gang.
They added that China's achievements on human rights had been "widely recognised by the international community".
The Chinese report accuses the US of arrogance and is particuarly scathing about the Iraq conflict.
"The invasion of Iraq by US troops has produced the biggest human rights tragedy and the greatest humanitarian disaster in modern world," the document said.
Beijing's report, gathered from US and international news sources, quotes crime statistics and cites particular incidents such as the Virginia Tech massacre to back up its claims.
The report comes in response to the US State Department's annual survey of human rights across the world.
Although the report accuses China of denying its people basic freedoms, the country is not listed as one of the world's most systematic rights violators.
One out of every five illegal immigrants apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2014 had a criminal record — a number that totals 100,000 convicted criminals, according to testimony at a House Oversight Committee hearing Wednesday.
"The numbers are astounding," said Rep. John Mica, R-Fla. "One hundred thousand criminal aliens entering the United States. Basically it's out of control."
Those numbers were put forward in a report prepared for the committee by Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, who testified Wednesday. While the border with Mexico is the most important entry point for illegal immigrants and narcotics into the U.S., the U.S. Border Patrol is approximately 5,000 agents short of Congress-mandated staffing, and there are no agents at all in Phoenix, said Judd.
Judd told the committee that violence at the border has escalated heavily since the early 2000s with the emergence of "well-organized, heavily armed, and pathologically violent" drug cartels, and said the cartels are notoriously violent within Mexico.
"To give you a sense of the violence, the official death toll … is 60,000," said Judd, referring to the number of people killed in Mexico by drug cartels. "However, the unofficial death toll is over 120,000 killed and another 27,000 missing and presumed dead. In Mexico, the cartels kill without hesitation or fear of prosecution."
In June, Mexican drug cartels shot at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection helicopter and actually shot down a Mexican helicopter, according to House testimony Wednesday.
Less than 100 miles from where the helicopter incident occurred, off-duty border patrol agent Javier Vega was murdered in August by two criminal illegals while protecting their family on a fishing trip.
"What I find the scariest part about the worsening violence in Mexico is how it's extending now inside the United States," said Judd. "We're not only seeing violence on the border but this is extending now inside the United States and that's scary."
"It's not only on the border now; it's coming into the United States … it's going to be a long effort at the border and … it's out of control," said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y. They pointed to bipartisan efforts to pass a bill that would make trafficking guns across the border a felony.
Mica called for closing nine consulates in Mexico and selling the embassy land. "I think you have to have some consequence for actions," they said.

Theresa May has accused European politicians of making "threats" against Britain to try to influence the general election result.
The PM launched a stinging attack on the "bureaucrats of Brussels" in a speech outside 10 Downing Street after meeting the Queen.
They said some in Brussels wanted Brexit talks to fail.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said they were "playing party games with Brexit" to try to win the general election.
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was "irresponsible" of them to "poison" the atmosphere with the EU.

A senior EU source told the BBC the PM's suggestion that officials were trying to affect the election result was "pure fantasy".
Parliament was dissolved at midnight, meaning the election is formally under way, and the PM made their speech after visiting the Queen at Buckingham Palace.
They said events of the past few days had shown "just how tough" Brexit talks are likely to be.
"Britain's negotiating position in Europe has been misrepresented in the continental press," they said, in a reference to a German newspaper's account of their dinner with the EU Commission chief.
"The European Commission's negotiating stance has hardened. Threats against Britain have been issued by European politicians and officials.
"All of these acts have been deliberately timed to affect the result of the general election that will take place on 8 June."
'Serious consequences'
Mrs May said they wanted to reach a Brexit deal, and for the EU to succeed: "But the events of the last few days have shown that - whatever our wishes, and however reasonable the positions of Europe's other leaders - there are some in Brussels who do not want these talks to succeed."
The PM also warned of "serious" consequences if the Brexit talks failed, which would be felt by "ordinary, working people across the country".
"If we don't get the negotiation right, your economic security and prosperity will be put at risk and the opportunities you seek for your families will simply not happen.
"If we do not stand up and get this negotiation right we risk the secure and well-paid jobs we want for our children and our children's children too.
"If we don't get the negotiation right, if we let the bureaucrats of Brussels run over us, we will lose the chance to build a fairer society with real opportunity for all."
They were criticised by Ms Sturgeon, who tweeted: "UK needs the best possible Brexit deal and has limited leverage, so for PM to poison atmosphere for partisan reasons is deeply irresponsible.... Having called election for reasons of party not national interest, PM now seems intent on fighting campaign in same way."
Mr Corbyn added: "By winding up the public confrontation with Brussels, the prime minister wants to wrap the Conservative party in the union jack and distract attention from their government's economic failure and rundown of our public services.
"But Brexit is too important to be used as a political game in this election."

Lib Dem Nick Clegg attacked their "desperate, bizarre statement", and UKIP's Patrick O'Flynn said millions of their party's voters remained worried the UK would leave the EU "with the worst possible terms".
'Blunt diplomacy'
Analysis by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg
Theresa May just used one of the most powerful microphones in the country for blunt diplomacy indeed.
It's worth pointing out they made careful aim at the EU institutions, rather than the individual leaders, with whom she'll have to deal one on one.
But forget that nuance for a moment - this was quite some statement, quite an accusation to make. It seems the prime minister is intent on playing the Brexit card for all it's worth in the next election.

The Financial Times claimed the likely bill had risen sharply from 60bn to 100bn euros, basing its calculations on new data from across Europe.
Mr Barnier said there was no agreed figure but the UK and EU had entered into "mutual commitments" which must be honoured.
Mr Davis said the UK would pay what was legally due, in line with its rights and obligations, but "not just what the EU wants".
On Tuesday, Mrs May told the BBC they would be a "bloody difficult woman" towards Mr Juncker during Brexit talks.
Asked about their comment, Mr Juncker's chief of staff Martin Selmayr said: "President Juncker said today that they are an impressive woman and that they are a very impressive negotiator."
They added: "Brexit will never become a success, of course, because it is a sad and sorry event. But as I have set out, it can be managed in a professional and pragmatic way."
The dissolution of Parliament means there are no MPs - only candidates - until polling day.
However, government ministers retain their roles and continue their work.
MPs are allowed access to Parliament for just a few days in order to remove papers from their offices, but facilities provided by the House of Commons are no longer available to them. It was the shortest Parliament since 1974.

Relevant legislation is categorized by type as well as historical era. Sources are divided into four historical periods: (1) English, which includes English statutes up to the split with the American colonies in 1776; (2) Colonial, which includes statutes passed within the American colonies beginning in 1607 and continuing to the ratification of the Constitution in 1791; (3) Pre-14th Amendment; and (4) Post-14th Amendment.
Labour's Anne Aly has been caught out calling Brisbane-based MP Andrew Laming a "nong" live on TV.
LABOR's Anne Aly has been caught out calling Brisbane-based MP Andrew Laming a “nong” live on TV.
The two Federal parliamentarians were on Sky News today debating the Government's new US refugee resettlement deal and discussing the result of the US election.
As the fiery debate wraps us, Mr Laming reminds Ms Aly that US election campaigns are always tough and always will be, before taking a pot-shot at former prime minister Julia Gillard and their broken promise over the carbon tax.
Sky News presenter Liz Tilley thanks them both for their time and proceeds to preview the sports news, when Ms Aly gets caught out in a “hot mic” moment.
With their microphone still switched and broadcasting live, they can be heard in the background saying “What a nong!”
Ms Aly quickly realises their mistake and apologises to the Sky News producers, saying “Ooh, sorry!”.
Ms Aly won the seat of Cowan in Perth at the July election and is a counter-terrorism expert.
Mr Laming has been the MP for the eastern Brisbane seat of Bowman since 2004.
Olevsk, a sleepy if ancient town deep in the backwoods of Ukraine, became part of my life in 2003 when I came across a dozen testimonies about vicious pogroms there at the beginning of the German-Soviet war of 1941 to 1945. In the testimonies, survivors and witnesses describe how Jews were beaten, humiliated, and mutilated in the center of town in the summer of 1941. Many of their tormentors and killers were members of the Poliska Sich, a guerrilla force led by one of the most famous Ukrainian nationalist leaders during the war, Taras “Bulba”-Borovets. Taking their nom de guerre from a mythical Cossack leader, Bulba-Borovets ruled Olevsk and its environs during the early months of the German-Soviet war, while Germans were thin on the ground in this remote location. It was only after the pogrom violence and further abuse of Jews at the hands of the Sich that the Germans took over Olevsk in September 1941 and established a ghetto. The Sich then patrolled the ghetto and later provided the Germans with manpower to liquidate the Jewish population.
Discovering these documents, I felt certain that such brutal pogroms must have been included in the literature on anti-Jewish violence in western Ukraine and eastern Poland in the summer of 1941. Following Jan Gross's powerful 2000 book, Neighbors, other historians tackled the difficult questions surrounding local participation in the Holocaust, and in particular pogroms in that fateful summer. Yet I soon realized that there was no mention of the pogroms in the scholarly literature; Bulba-Borovets, unsurprisingly, failed to mention them in their memoirs.
Five years after I discovered the testimonies, I found myself on an old Soviet bus traveling from Zhytomyr to Olevsk, making the first of three trips to learn more about what had happened there in 1941. Debarking at the town's rudimentary bus station, I met the duo of Misha and Misha — two of Olevsk's few remaining Jewish community members. The younger Misha, in their 40s, was the de facto head of the Jewish community. A local acquaintance referred to them as “The Last Jew of Olevsk.” They often helped Jewish visitors pay homage to their families. Younger Misha talked so quickly and peppered their speech with so many rural colloquialisms that my brain rushed to follow. Elder Misha was in their late 50s; they had a kind face and walked with a limp, struggling to keep up, both physically and verbally, with their younger counterpart.
Together, over the course of two days, the two Mishas and I walked around Olevsk. They exposed me to every aspect of local life, from bartering for fresh fruits and vegetables at the outdoor market to watching students rush in and out of the town school, to the haunting silence of Olevsk's cemeteries. With the past embedded in every stone of the town's cobbled streets, the stories of Jews and Ukrainians that I had uncovered in dusty archival documents half a decade prior were inescapable. The Polesia forest, a ubiquitous backdrop to Olevsk, seemed to ensconce every scene.
We traveled in one of the only taxis in town to a mass grave outside Olevsk. Driving along the unpaved road to the village of Varvarivka, I couldn't stop thinking about the fact that this was the same road on which Olevsk's Jews had been taken to their deaths. In Varvarivka, on Nov. 15, 1941 (some sources say Nov. 20), the Germans and the Poliska Sich shot the entire Jewish population—more than 500 men, women and children. Between bumps and bursts of speed, I tried to envision the final moments of an entire community as they took their last steps. We arrived at the destination—a clearing among the trees on the side of the road. There was a small black memorial enclosed in a fence and a small crumbling white wall surrounded by weeds overtaking the cracking cement. According to this late Soviet-era memorial, “German-fascist invaders” killed “peaceful citizens” at this spot in 1941. There was no reference to the Jewish identity of the victims.
Next, we located the Sich headquarters in a former nursery school building in the center of town. After taking control of Olevsk in the first week of July 1941, the Sich conducted its first pogrom, taking 30 to 40 Jewish men and women to the Ubort river to torture them. In their deposition that I had found in the archives, Tevel Trosman explained how the Sich treated the town's Jews “to gross mockery and humiliation in the mud for almost half an hour.” Another survivor, Iakov Shklover, described how Sich soldiers “giggled and laughed” as they made them and the others stand and then lie down the mud, hitting them with their rifle butts all the while. Others detailed how some soldiers enjoyed beating Jewish women with their guns. A Sich leader is reported in one testimony as having mutilated their victims by dragging a cart over them. By the time the pogrom ended, the Sich had injured dozens; soldiers had murdered the town baker and another local Jew, and they left the bodies to rot in a yard nearby. Shklover recounted how they and several others stole away in the night to bury the bodies in secret and say kaddish. This was not the last of the pogrom violence, though. In a separate incident later that summer, the Sich again tortured the Jews, this time in the yard of its headquarters. Trosman described how the Sich made 300 Jews “tear out grass with their teeth” and pull weeds with their hands. They could hear the laughter of Sich soldiers at the headquarters as they were beaten with whips and rifles.
Neither the younger nor the elder Misha had heard of the pogrom violence until my arrival in Olevsk. They looked at me with dismay and disbelief as I told them what had happened in this place that was turned into a children's playground after the war. Of course, they knew the Sich had been involved in the mass shooting at Varvarivka—but the preceding torture and humiliation of Olevsk's Jewish community were new to them.
Together, we entered the nursery yard. I looked down at the dirt, once a scene of horrific violence. I then noticed a golden plaque in honor of Taras Bulba-Borovets and their men on the wall of the nursery building. The Sich headquarters were located at this place during the first few months of the war—when the pogroms occurred—and a local chapter of the right-wing nationalist Svoboda party had wanted to honor the Sich. Certainly, leaders of anti-Jewish violence and ethnic cleansing of Poles have been memorialized in other towns and cities in Ukraine. But rarely is the irony of commemorating a perpetrator as striking as when it is done at the scene of their crime.
Elder Misha brought me back to Olevsk to speak with a relative of a survivor whose testimony I had found in the archives. They were the daughter of the survivor's second marriage after the war—her father's first wife and children had all been murdered in Varvarivka. They told me how their father had miraculously escaped thanks to a tip by a local ethnic German. They did not know that their story had ever been recorded and wept when I showed them their hand-written testimony from the archives. We ended our day in the old Jewish cemetery, among crooked tombstones covered in weeds. In the sanctuary, we found old religious manuscripts and artifacts under layers of dust and dirt—the same ones that the Jews killed next to the Ubort river used to read.
On the bus ride back to Zhytomyr, the enormity of my experience was almost too much to bear. The tears of the survivor's daughter; the rotting tefillin in an abandoned cemetery; the black memorial that conceals the identity of the dead; and the beautiful Ubort river and Polesia forest. I knew I had to return.

Twice more, in 2011 and 2012, I visited Olevsk, always helped by the younger Misha. The golden plaque honoring the Sich at the site of their pogroms was eventually removed as a result of local political upheaval. But in its stead, a new monument was built just down the road from where the pogroms took place. Also a pet project of Svoboda, it was unveiled in August 2011 with party leader Oleh Tyahnybok in attendance. The unveiling sparked some heated debate in the local paper over the place of the Sich in Olevsk's history—but no discussion of the pogroms in which the town's Jews were killed.
Thanks to the help of a local journalist, I interviewed two people, Maria Kolomiets and Mykola Dovhosilets, who witnessed the Sich taking Olevsk's Jews to their deaths, with beatings and humiliations along the way. I also spoke to Aleksei Makarchuk, who had been a teenager during the war. After telling us their story about how they escaped deportation at the hands of the local police and their service in the partisans, Makarchuk described watching the pogrom by the Ubort river. Makarchuk interrupted as we were ending the interview, “I want to add something else … down by the river, they forced the Jews to eat grass like sheep. … They were beaten with rods and made to go into the water, then drink the water. This was done by the banderovtsy [the Sich]. I saw this with my own eyes. I saw this with my own eyes.” Their memories matched details I had found in the testimonies written more than 60 years earlier about the July pogrom.
The memory of Bulba-Borovets and their Sich has figured prominently in Olevsk and regional politics over the past five years. In the city of Rivne there are plans to build a new monument for Bulba-Borovets—commander of the Sich, not to mention this summer's bike race named after the Sich. Olevsk itself has more plans, including: naming a park after the Olevsk Republic or Bulba-Borovets; naming a square after Bulba-Borovets; and creating an exposition about the Sich in a local museum (with plans to build a separate museum in the future). There have celebrations of the Sich throughout the Volhynia region this summer. Moreover, the Sich force has caught the interest of the Ukrainian parliament, the Verkhovna Rada. This past April it passed a resolution to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of Poliska Sich.
This development on the national stage should come as no surprise to anyone following the Poroshenko government's divisive policies on historical memory. The driving force of this policy of whitewashing nationalist activities during the war is the Institute of National Memory led by nationalist activist Volodymyr Viatrovych who believes the OUN-UPA only saved Jews during the war and did not participate in any pogroms. These ideas are being realized quickly: a monument to pogrom leaders has been unveiled in Uman; a Ukrainian nationalist pogrom leader—and importantly, decorated Wehrmacht soldier who aided the Germans in suppressing the Warsaw uprising—Petro Diachenko, was celebrated by the Rada last year; and the Kyiv city government just voted to name a street after far right-wing nationalist leader, Stepan Bandera, to name a few initiatives. “Decommunization” and the invocation of Western or European values serve as cover for this nationalist memory manipulation.
There has been too little debate about these policies in Ukraine. Ironically, many Ukrainians might believe that Bulba-Borovets and their Sich offer a safe choice for memorialization because they are traditionally considered less radical than competing nationalists. But they would be wrong. The Jews of Olevsk, tortured and tormented throughout the summer of 1941, and eventually shot by the Germans and the Sich together, deserve to have their voices heard before new monuments are raised in honor of those who killed them. If the Ukrainian government is so keen on building new memorials, I would suggest one at the Ubort river that lists the names of the murdered, why they were killed, and by whom.

24-year old Brazilian central defender, 6'1" (185cm)
Moved to Villarreal for £2.5m in 2013
Played sporadically in the first season, but has been ever-present this season with 18 La Liga starts, two Copa Del Rey starts and six Europa League starts
Somewhat versatile, started as a left-back twice this season, and played right-back a few times at Vitoria
Was awarded the best central defender of 2013 Campeonato Baiano, after Vitoria was crowned champions
Lack of caps for Brazil could put a spanner in Arsenal's chances of getting a work permit...Wenger will have to apply for a 'special talent' visa
Although some say their style is similar to Koscielny, their stats show a style more similar to Per Mertesacker, as they don't tackle too often, instead relying on reading of the game and positioning themselves to intercept and clear (one of the highest interception rates in La Liga)
According to himself, their strengths are quickness, aerial duels, and recovery rate between games
One of their weaknesses is strength, they often get outmuscled by strong centre-forwards, so they need to bulk up a bit
Part of the deal includes Joel Campbell going on loan to the Spanish side until the summer
Seems like a fantastic signing. Not too young but still room for improvement, hybrid between Mertesacker's interception/aerial role and Koscielny's quick blocker style.
Gabriel Paulista on the prospect of moving to Arsenal:
The subject [of moving to Arsenal] is being discussed by my agent and the club. If I go to Arsenal it will be excellent. But if it's not finalised then I am relaxed. I am focused on my work here.
Gabriel Paulista on being patient:
My agent is working on making sure I continue being calm. Playing in the Premier League is one of my dreams. I have spoken to my agent about this.
Wenger on paying only what they think is fair:
We are ready to pay the price we think is right for a good player no matter what the price is. If we think it is the right price, we will pay it.
Former Barça right-back Albert Ferrer:
Harvey Updyke, the man allegedly responsible for poisoning the Toomer's Corner oak trees, was arrested in Louisiana on Sept. 18 and charged with terrorizing.
Updyke, 64, was trying to return a lawn mower to a home improvement store and became angry when the manager wouldn't credit them the full $150, the police report says.
When the arresting officer suggested Updyke call a lawyer, the Alabama football fan refused, saying "he would take care of this on their own," the Times-Picayune reported on its website Monday.
"He had a sad story," Hammond Police spokesperson Lt. Vincent Giannobile said, according to the paper. "He said they were going to prison anyway, they had a bad heart, and they didn't care. They kept insinuating that they aren't going to take no for an answer."
Updyke, who is also wanted in Texas on the same charge, is scheduled to stand trial Oct. 1 for the Auburn tree poisoning.  They are accused of poisoning the century-old trees after the Tigers beat the Crimson Tide during Auburn's 2010 national title season. Updyke has pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect on charges that include criminal mischief and desecrating a venerable object.

Level Designer Emilia Schatz outlined the core principles, which help to make your environments playable and understandable to the player. Emilia will be covering most of these topics in their Level Design course at CG Master Academy. You can get more details on the official website.
Hi, my name is Emilia Schatz and I'm a lead game designer at Naughty Dog. Some of the games I've worked on are Uncharted 3 and 4, The Last of Us, and currently The Last of Us Part 2. My main responsibility is in level design and layout, creating rough blockout geometry to define the shape of our spaces. After handing that off to environment artists, I work with them to make sure the design intention of the level is maintained throughout production. A big part of that is getting our final art to be as readable to the player as the original blockmesh. Achieving that requires both the artist and I to cooperate closely in what we want so the player will understand what they can do with the environment we create. We need to be deliberate and consistent in how our shape language implies the possibility of gameplay. In this article, I will detail a bit of how we do that.
The Problem In Achieving Realism
We've come a long way from board games and the early days of video games. When creating pixel art in 8-16 colors, there was little room to create anything but what is absolutely necessary to play the game. Form and function could hardly stray from one another. In fact, function often dictated form, a limitation leading to many examples of bizarrely endearing characters and game worlds. Today however, given the amount of technical rendering power and capability at our disposal, it's very easy to stray from the purpose of a game level environment and just get lost in the artistry of creating breathtaking virtual spaces.
Look at any environment in the real world and try to tabulate all the things that you are able to do and affect in it. You'll very quickly be overwhelmed by the possibilities. In the following photo of a library scene, the options are near endless. I could read every book, burn them in a pile, organize them, tear each page out and attempt to eat them. Or maybe I'd spin the globe, push over the statue, finger-paint a mural across the floor. These possibilities of action are called affordances, a term coined by perceptual psychologist James J. Gibson in their 1977 article, “The Theory of Affordances”. The characteristics of an object afford certain means of action upon it, based upon the rules of our physical reality.
In modern games, we create detailed environments that emulate and expand on the appearance of real-world examples. The more life-like a space appears to be, the more we begin to expect it to allow for the affordances we have in real life. But games only enable players the actions developers explicitly allow for and implement. Unfortunately, that aspect of game development doesn't scale with computing power in the way art has. And when a player's desire to act is unsupported, we have a break in immersion – all our effort to create a realistic space that looks real is undone by the fact that it does not feel real to interact with.
Much of this is mitigated by the standard conventions of games – a player doesn't expect to be able to read every page of every book or eat everything that looks like food – most games don't allow these actions, so players are not surprised by those limitations.
But imagine you are making a game where the player lacks the ability to climb ladders. A ladder is a strong indicator of utility. If you put a ladder in your level, a player very likely will at some point try to use it. Not only have most of your players used ladders in other games, but they have most likely used one themselves in real life. A ladder communicates the value and utility of the space at the bottom and the top of the ladder – why would it exist if there wasn't value to being in both spaces and traversing between? When the player attempts to use your ladder and nothing happens, they'll begin to view the rest of your game with a degree of skepticism.
Imagine another game where the player is allowed to climb ladders, but in one particular environment, you include an unusable ladder because it just seems contextually appropriate. Now the player finds they can't trust the game's world because rules are arbitrary. They're reminded their experience is artificial and that “it's just a game” after all. These moments of immersion breakage happen many times in even the best games we play. They don't generally “ruin” player experiences, but we can certainly aspire to better. A polished, well-designed environment can be beautiful and evocative, as well as readable and continually immersive.
Creating an Environmental Language
The shape and structure in a well-designed level is a subtle means of communicating with the player, inspiring them to use the actions we've provided for them to overcome obstacles intuitively. In order to do this well, we need to develop a clear and consistent shape language, describing the gameplay mechanic affordance of the world.
There are a number of different ways the player can interpret affordance from game objects. Explicit affordances are those pointed out to the player in a break from realism, such as an ammo pickup that glows, a UI button prompt on a switch, or the “Throw-rope” icon for grapple points in Uncharted 4. Defined affordances are when the game goes to length to associate arbitrary visuals with in-game mechanics, like making all climbable handholds painted yellow. Cultural affordances are those we recognize from our real world or other game experience: a ladder, an unlit torch, a padlock, a valve on a pipe. And finally, Inferred affordances are those players can deduct based on their knowledge of the game's rules and systems. Explicit and Defined messaging break immersion and so should be considered a fallback plan. It's the latter two, cultural and inferred, that are of most concern to environmental designers.
Catalog Your Mechanics
So that we understand the types of affordances we're trying to match, we catalog the mechanics at the player's disposal that can interact with the environment. In Uncharted 4, the beginning of a list might include:
Moving (run/walk) Clamber onto Jumping Take cover Climbing Rope Throwing
For each of these, we need defined environmental messaging. Let's tackle the first mechanic. For moving, we ask, “What surface affords walk/run?”, and the answer is a relatively even, cleared, and hardened surface, length and width both greater than 1.0m, incline less than 30 degrees. That's simple enough to start, but now we need to ask, “What surfaces clearly do not afford walk/run?” The counter-question is just as important, because all objects in the game need to belong to either the walk/run or no-walk/no-run categories. For each gameplay mechanic, we need to define how objects provide that affordance and how they can actively deny it. There cannot be any middle ground. The player must understand the difference at a glance, even in a high pressure scenario.
Buffer Your Metrics
To avoid characteristics that fall into a grey area between providing and denying affordance, we define buffer zones. In Uncharted, Nathan Drake can jump up to a ledge that is at 3.5m or less above him. Because of that, we defined a “dead zone” between 3.25m and 4m, a rule we enforced making sure no climbable edge falls into the unreadable middle area. We created a buffer for inclined surfaces too – all “walkable” surfaces are less than a 35 degree grade. So we enforced a rule of no surfaces between 30 and 45. Low cover height is another rule. Nathan Drake takes low cover on 0.9m – 1.25m tall rectilinear objects. So nothing like that was allowed 0.5m above or below that range, as you can see in the following diagram. The player should never have to guess where the game will allow them to snap into cover. Consistent shape language communicates that clearly.
Buffer Your Placement
When an object needs to stand out, to contrast with the affordance-denying background, it needs a border zone around it. Clear out anything intersecting or close by that the player might confuse with your messaging. In Uncharted, climbing handhold affordance is a tricky thing to read, so we really tried to avoid using any non-climbable strong horizontal line elements anywhere near the play space. But when in close proximity to actual climbable ledges, even minor horizontal lines in rock textures tend to cause confusion in players. I can recall many instances during U4's development where we drove texture artists crazy by insisting they remove tiny cracks and ripples in natural rock walls because it made nearby climbing handholds more difficult to read.
Preserve Silhouettes
In the following image from Uncharted 4, the object that affords climbing up is highlighted by making it the only rectangular shape in close vicinity. It's surrounded by pointed, diagonal shapes. Another part of this is preserving the silhouette – the more you obscure the outer boundaries of an object's shape, the harder it is to recognize for what it is.
Leverage Primitive Shapes
People have on a really basic level, certain underlying emotional associations with circles, squares, and triangles, and it seems to be pretty consistent across cultures. Round shapes evoke safety and well-being. They're viewed as non-threatening due to their lack of points and edges. They blend in and disappear, lacking affordance. Rectangular shapes on the other hand are solid, stationary, and powerful. They evoke a feeling of strength, either as an obstacle to overcome, or something to be reliably used. Rectangular shapes are strong indicators of affordance. Finally, diagonal and pointy shapes evoke a sense of danger and imbalance. They have the effect of negating affordance.
This is not to say that round and pointy shapes should always be avoided when trying to indicate affordance. But if you feel your visual language is not reading as clearly as you had hoped, adjusting your primitive shapes may be one way to help your scene.
Use Cultural Affordances When Possible
Sometimes cultural affordance messaging can do some of the work when simple shape language fails. Stairways and ladders communicate the existence of vertically leading paths. Doorways invite players to move through them. Gasoline cans and unlit torches invite fire. In Uncharted 4, rope grapple points were wrapped with dangling ropes (the movement helps draw the eye), inviting players to attach their own ropes. In the interest of full disclosure, eventually we found they still didn't read well enough in combat, so we ended up explicitly calling out the affordance with a HUD icon.
In “broken ruins” environment types (of which Uncharted has a lot) you can get away with stretching the believability of why a staircase or doorway exists in an otherwise natural environment. In fact, any environment with a long and varied history of human residence tends to have unexplainable architecture, which is a real bonus for games, both in terms of environmental storytelling and in affordances. Stone mortar blocks of cover stand out nicely when contrasted with the natural layout of a jungle.
Don't Tease the Player
Sometimes when you're overly familiar with the mechanics in your game (like when working on the 4th game in a series, for example), you might create a situation that painfully highlights the limited nature of your gameplay compared with real life. Imagine the player's goal is on the other side of a door. You want them to see what's on the other side, so you make some holes in the door and the wall. Now you have a very flimsy-looking barrier that, if this were real life, the rocket launcher the player is packing would make short work of it. Will any frustrated players waste precious ammo trying?
Unfortunately, developers simply can't account and develop for all possible actions of the player. So as environment designers, we need to make sure whenever we deny affordances, we do so in a way that is believable not only for game mechanics, but also the real world. Remember the old cartoon gag where a character is in jail, behind widely-spaced bars they could easily squeeze through? We don't want the game equivalent.
Deny Unwanted Affordances
Sometimes a bigger part of the job of making your environment readable is figuring out how to deny affordances to those shapes that are not meant to be “actionable”. That way the shapes you actually want the player to pay attention to stand out even more. The first steps for this are doing the opposite of making affordances read: use rounder or more diagonal shapes and stay clear of metric buffers. Reduce the contrast of the object versus the surrounding scene. Run interference by covering the object's edges with other shapes to erase the object's silhouette. Change intuitive characteristics – if players keep wanting to climb a wall, make the edge jagged or cover any obvious hand placements with small shrubbery. Player wants to jump through a window? Divide the opening with slats and put in shards of broken glass around the edges.
Be Your Own Playtester
Eventually you're going to want to have others play your level – it's amazing what others will see (or not see) when they're not in-the-know like you are. But each time you play it yourself, try as best you can to put yourself in that mindset. Meander around, try to poke in every corner, ignore the gameplay goal, play it “wrong”, try to go where you're not supposed to. Keep an eye out for shapes that interact strangely with your player mechanics, or don't properly communicate their affordances. Examples I often see are:
ropes/cables: are they taut enough to be solid collision, can the player hop over them, what happens when a player lands on one from above? Is there varied affordance along the length?
“hard” foliage: bushes with solid collision – do the the visuals properly deny the affordance of moving through them? Make sure they're not anywhere the player can land on, jump into, or stand on
Arbitrarily non-walkable flat surfaces and platforms: why can't the player stand/walk there? Would you be able to do it in real life?
Good Luck!
It's hard to be comprehensive in studying this topic. Different environments in different games vary so much, there are simply no hard and fast rules that work every time. To get it right, it will take playtesting, experimentation, iteration, and good judgement. But I hope that at least with some of my suggestions, you'll feel better equipped to face the problems of readability in your environments.

Welcome to the new world in security. It used to be all about network devices and services. However, thanks to the evolution of the firewall and IDS, the concept of border security has changed. In this new world of security, the edge has been redefined. Firewalls: host-based protection; wireless devices: so old school. In the 21st century, hackers are focused on web applications, and that is exactly why we decide to provide you with this real-world illustration of a how a simple overlooked account can lead to root access.
CCDC Overview
The Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) is designed to give college and university students an extreme taste of what it feels like to be a system/network administrator. The competitors are provided a small network of servers/desktops that host a wide range of applications, many of which are insecure. To raise the stress level and encourage teamwork, the students not only have to update and lock down their systems but they have to do it while a group of hackers is doing their best to infiltrate the network. In addition to all this, the teams are tasked with “business injects” that range from simple chores like the addition of an account to the difficult, such as programming a web application from scratch. For more information on these events and how they play out, check out the following links:

A couple broke into an 68-year-old man's house to settle a debt of $42.
Renee Szczudlik, 39, and Adam Halenza, 34, knocked on a Key Largo man's door before they forced their way inside and pushed the man to the floor, the Monroe County Sheriff's Office said.
>>Florida man busted for running dog fighting ring since 1975
The victim said they recognized the pair and knew their 27-year-old godson owed them $42, the police report said.
The couple went to the godson's room where Szcuzdlik grabbed the man by their hair and dragged them out of bed. Halenza punched the man and shoved their face into a closet door, according to police.
The pair took the money and went home, where they would be arrested, the report said.

Mark Helfrich made a rare departure Thursday from Oregon's policy of not commenting on injuries, acknowledging the validity of reports that circulated a day earlier regarding a season-ending injury to all-American cornerback Ifo Ekpre-Olomu.
The senior was injured in a non-contact drill Tuesday, and will miss the Ducks' playoff semifinal against Florida State at the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1 (2:20 p.m. PT, ESPN), as well as the national championship game were Oregon to advance.
“He's already been ‘Ifo' in terms of leadership, already made a difference in terms of how they handled getting dinged up,” Helfrich said. “I expect our team to handle it the way they've handled everything else.”
Ekpre-Olomu was receiving treatment in the Casanova Center while the Ducks practiced. In a brief conversation to check on their spirits, they said they were optimistic about a speedy recovery from surgery – not in regards to how quickly he'd be back on the field, but how quickly he'd be able to join the team in Los Angeles for Rose Bowl week. When Helfrich talks about Ekpre-Olomu being ‘Ifo,' that sort of selfless mindset is exactly what they mean.
With Ekpre-Olomu out, redshirt first-year student Chris Seisay got the majority of the reps with the first team in practice. Confirmation bias is always potentially in play in a situation like this, but Seisay made some plays. They broke up a pass to B.J. Kelley in 1-on-1s, and later had an interception in team drills.
Seisay made a splash off the bench in Oregon's win over Michigan State earlier this year. They were thrown at quite a bit late in the Ducks' win at UCLA, and Seisay said all those experiences have been valuable.
“I'm way more comfortable than I was first time out there in front of that crowd,” Seisay said. “I'm feeling a lot more comfortable now.”
Another potential option, senior Dior Mathis, ran step for step with speedy Devon Allen on an incompletion in 1-on-1s. Mathis also had an interception in that period, and another in 11-on-11, hauling in a ball tipped by Danny Mattingly. Safety Erick Dargan has also played some corner the last couple years and could be in the mix.
A member of the media asked season-long starter Troy Hill if they were “next man up” in the wake of Ekpre-Olomu's injury. “Am I next man up?” Hill asked. “I've been up. I don't know what you mean.”
“We feel good,” Hill went on to say. “Seisay and Dior, we've got a lot of confidence in them. They've played a lot; they're veterans. We feel real good about what they're going to bring to the table. We know we've got to mesh a lot harder because Ifo's presence is going to be out of the game, but that's going to bring us stronger. Ifo left their presence with us, they left their work ethic and everything with us, and he's still coming to talk to us and being there with us. So it's like they never left. He's still out there with us, and we've still got them in the back of our heads.”
Highlights: With the Ducks in full pads for the first time since the Pac-12 title game, coaches jump-started the day with a sumo-style drill right off the bat. Players were matched 1-on-1 in the “O” logo at midfield, trying to push each other out of the circle. Kelley bested Glen Ihenacho, and Eddie Heard won a rep against Jake McCreath. Braden Eggert and Jalen Jelks fought to a draw the first rep of the drill, so they were called back in for the last one, and after another drawn-out, even battle, Eggert ended up on top. … After a week of watching Marcus Mariota endure interviews, autograph requests and photo ops, it was great to watch them play football again. They began one team period with a long run and then a strike to Dwayne Stanford, showing no ill effects from the grueling awards week trip. …
Byron Marshall exploded through a big hole for a long run to kick off a team period matching the travel squad against itself. Charles Nelson also had a long run, getting a key block from Royce Freeman. Defensively, Tony Washington beat the block of a tight end to make a tackle for loss, Sam Kamp stopped a run play at the line and Joe Walker and Johnny Ragin III teamed up to corral another back. … In pass-rush drills, Tyrell Crosby and Cameron Hunt locked up rushers, while Henry Mondeaux showed off their quickness by beating two different tackles, including starter Jake Fisher.
Other observations: Helfrich said the offense started the day well, and the defense finished strong. Obviously the goal is to both start and finish well, so the Ducks will continue sharpening up over the next two weeks. … Helfrich said the Rose Bowl game plan should be in by Saturday when the Ducks break for the holidays. They said at this point in bowl prep, coaches tend to try some “exotic” things that can lead to some of the inconsistency by players. As coaches hone the game plan, that should help players get dialed in. … Special teams periods were spent on the kickoff return and punt teams.

Lake Mead is the largest reservoir in the US, supplying water to Arizona, Southern California, southern Nevada and northern Mexico. As such, its levels can provide a useful indication of the water situation in the US Southwest. And the picture right now is anything but comforting.
At 1073ft above sea level, the July reading at the Hoover Dam was the lowest elevation since the reservoir was filled in the late 1930s, lower even than the first threshold (1075ft) that triggers emergency rationing measures across several states.
However, the crucial measurement is not the current level but the mid-August assessment by the Bureau of Reclamation for 1 January 2017. And if it is below that threshold an official water shortage at Lake Mead will be declared.
As indicated by the box in the graph above, the latest January estimate suggests that cutbacks may be avoided this time around – if only barely. But the bigger picture clearly shows a relentless decline in water levels at Lake Mead since the start of the millennium, with no indication of a reversal.
As less water falls from the sky more has to be pumped from the ground to meet demand. Back in July 2014 a study by NASA and University of California, Irvine, estimated that the Colorado River Basin lost nearly 53 million acre feet of freshwater – almost double the volume of Lake Mead – in just nine years. More than 75 percent of that loss came from underground resources. And because nobody really knows how much groundwater is left, it is impossible to accurately predict when that resource (which in many cases took thousands of years to form) will run out.
What appears much more certain is that things might get even more challenging given the current climatic factors at play. The Western US is just coming off one of the strongest El Niño seasons, which typically brings more wetness to the region. Some major reservoirs in California got a boost as a result (although much more is needed going forward). Those seasons tend to be followed by La Niñas that can generate the opposite effect. So the odds are stacked in favor of less moisture over the foreseeable future, not more (although anything can happen).
Indeed, according to official estimates there's no letup in sight for the drought afflicting most of the US West, as shown in the graph above. Therefore, the region is going into this period already in a debilitated condition.
What will happen once that first threshold level at Lake Mead is reached?
Immediate water rationing based on recent interstate agreements, hitting Arizona first and with the hardest reduction in its allocation from Lake Mead: 13%. While the impact might be mitigated by accessing some storage facilities, Arizona farmers for one would for sure feel the pinch. Next in line would be Nevada with a 4% reduction. California would not get any cuts at that threshold, but residents that directly depend on this supply, especially in the Los Angeles area, could materially suffer from lower volumes delivered.
That part of the US has gone through massive droughts before and perhaps all of this can be managed over time with some socially acceptable adjustments.
However, as we indicated some months ago this persistent drought might be indicative of an unfolding structural change in weather patterns, as opposed to a much less serious downswing in a cycle. According to archaeological records the 20th century was the wettest in a millennium, and a gradual reversion to the historical mean could really be problematic for the region.
In other words, we could see a substantially drier Southwest interspersed with shorter wet periods taking shape in the decades ahead. And the impact would be felt well beyond the region. The states that depend on the Colorado River for a material proportion of their water supply collectively represent the world's fifth largest GDP. Northern Mexico would be hit too since it also gets an allotment from the Colorado River.
A longstanding NC reader and lower Manhattan resident e-mailed me:
I was curious about the first couple of pictures in this set from the NY Times. How were they able to get pictures of the NYPD gathering by South Street Seaport, before the raid? I was following the events closely on Twitter last night. the first notice of the pending love came from a tweet by the muscian Questo, who announced they had just driven by thousands of police in riot gear by South Street. Various tweets among #OWS folks debated the significance of this and then the NYPD was spotted moving, the emergency #OWS tweet went out and I also got an email on it. At that point, no press were anywhere near Zuccotti Park nor were any covering it on Twitter. After the #OWS emergency notice, all sorts of people rushed to the scene, including the press. Seems strange, then, that the NY Times photographer knew to be at this secret location. Also strange, this article by the NY Times on the chain of events leading up to the raid includes a number of factual details that don't appear to come from any quotes or press conferences, such as the secret planning that only the top brass knew about. This article has details about where the NYPD gathered pre-raid and details about the status of the park as the raid was beginning. How did the report get this information? Was they or they there? Were they tipped off before any of the other press? If so, what does this say about the relationship between the NY Times and the Bloomberg administration, as well as the independence of the NY Times reporting?
In the photo series, the high resolution image from South Street Seaport is indeed a bit sus, unless the NYPD has started memorializing its operations for the benefit of posterity and favored media outlets. And in the background story on the raid, I was troubled by how fawning it was, a classic example of stenography masquerading as reporting. The brilliant tactical execution by New York's finest! And the only people who were manhandled clearly deserved it! This characterization of a raid deliberately staged well out of public view, where there have been reports of the use of tear gas, pepper spray, and unnecessary roughing up, was indirectly confirmed by the punching of a woman on camera today whose offense seemed to be demanding access to the park loudly and having court papers to back them stance.
There are other signs of an overly cozy relationship between the Times and the mayor. The editorial today criticizes Bloomberg mildly, but most papers maintain a church and state separation between their editorial pages and the news sections (the split in the Wall Street Journal is occasionally schizophrenic). A November 3 piece, “Demonstrators Test Mayor, a Backer of Wall St. and Free Speech,” at a minimum shows that access journalisms works. It depicts Bloomberg as well intentioned and struggling to balance the needs of various constituencies. Key extracts:
Mr. Bloomberg's evolving response to the protest has come to embody a central tension in their third term, between their celebration of free, and at times cacophonous, speech as a hallmark of New York, and their emphasis on bolstering the city's economy by improving its appeal to residents, employers and tourists. Mr. Bloomberg, who is generally known for their decisiveness, at first emphasized their disagreements with the protesters, then began describing them as peaceful dissenters exercising a fundamental liberty. In the last several days, they have sounded increasingly exasperated, a reflection of complaints from neighbors and accusations of criminal activity in Zuccotti Park… Mr. Bloomberg has managed simultaneously to be less sympathetic to the protesters' point of view, and more sympathetic to their right to protest, than some other elected officials around the nation. “There's nobody that's more of a defender of the First Amendment than I am,” they have often said
Note that the “accusations of criminal activity” as of that date were drug use and I believe a petty theft. Given how often I smell marijuana in my near geriatric neighborhood and that in front of Bloomingdales is the biggest site for purse snatchings in the city, the mayor seems to be pursuing a double standard for enforcement. Similarly, the headlines on the front page of the New York Times are more downbeat about the future of the movement than, say, those in Wall Street Journal or the Guardian.
I'm curious to get reader reactions. Do you see the New York Times' coverage as its typical not-as-liberal-as-it-pretends-to-be positioning, or do you also see the corrupting signs of special access leading to more favorable coverage of the officialdom?
Rauner's chief of staff out after 88 days, ‘turbulence,' ‘wild times'
After just 88 days in Gov. Bruce Rauner's administration, former Illinois Policy Institute head Kristina Rasmussen is out as the governor's chief of staff — leaving a job they said they knew would be “rife with promise but would come with a lot of turbulence.”
Rauner credited them with “outstanding work” in “very challenging, wild times.”
Them departure comes just a week after Rauner signed House Bill 40, a controversial abortion trigger law, which Rasmussen and many other conservative Republicans vehemently oppose.
They will be replaced by Rodger Heaton, the governor's director of public safety and Homeland Security adviser. Heaton takes charge on Monday.
The governor announced Rasmussen's exit on Friday. In a staff phone call, Rasmussen said she's leaving to start an initiative focusing on an anti-union, right-to-work case that Rauner pioneered that is now heading to the U.S. Supreme Court. They will remain on the governor's staff until next Friday, “to help ensure a smooth transition.”
Rauner in the call said Rasmussen was leaving “to pursue their dream, a very exciting opportunity.”
“You've done outstanding work for the months that you served. Very challenging, wild times, and we appreciate it,” Rauner said.
Rasmussen recalled being called to take over as chief of staff, saying they were “a little taken back” and knew that it was “rife with promise but would come with a lot of turbulence.”
“I'm going back into the private sector to lead a new initiative that will leverage one of their other greatest victories, that of the Janus v. AFSCME fair share case that was just picked up by the United States Supreme Court,” Rasmussen said during the call. “So whether we are inside of government or outside of government there's so much opportunity for us to change policy and change lives for the better. ”
Rasmussen said they had “two key responsibilities” during their tenure: to “refresh the staff” and to deal with the school funding crisis.
“As I look back now, to three months in, I can say with great pride that I discharged both of those duties faithfully with your help,” Rasmussen told staffers.
Rauner called their new chief of staff a “superstar.” That's a term he's called many former staffers and appointees, many of whom are no longer within the administration, including former chief operating officer Linda Lingle, education secretary Beth Purvis and budget adviser Donna Arduin.
On the call, Heaton credit Rasmussen with building a “terrific team.”
“That was a difficult job to do at a mid point of the administration. … I think you've put a great team together.”
Despite the negative perception of such a short term — with Rauner in crisis mode during most of that time — the governor in a statement said Rasmussen had “delivered on all fronts.” They said they made “significant improvements” … “in a very compressed and challenging time.”
Although Michael Lucci, also a former Illinois Policy Institute staffer, remains in the administration's policy department, no other top posts remain filled by members of the conservative think tank. The group's current CEO John Tillman, once a close friend and adviser to Rauner, dubbed the governor “Benedict Rauner” in a Facebook post last week for signing the abortion bill.
They also sounded off on Rasmussen's exit on Friday, while crediting them for their work with “the three biggest accomplishments the Rauner campaign cites,” including the Janus right to work case; right-to-work in Lincolnshire and in helping to get a private tax school scholarship into a school funding bill.
But Rauner's former ally also took a shot at the governor and first lady Diana Rauner: “Regarding the governor's office, organizational culture starts at the top and it is my hope that the governor reflects on the events of the last two years, is self accountable and finally has found a chief of staff that can work within the rather unusual dynamics they and their wife create,” Tillman wrote on Facebook.
“…As to whether this governor can turn their administration around, the jury is still out and the odds are long,” Tillman wrote.
The Rauner administration shakeup began July 10 when Rauner unexpectedly fired their chief of staff, Richard Goldberg. Goldberg was swiftly replaced by Rasmussen, former president and CEO of the Illinois Policy Institute. That sparked the exits of at least 20 employees, many of whom left because they didn't believe in the direction the governor was taking in hiring members of the conservative think tank.
The staff changes came after Rauner vetoed a state budget that included an income-tax hike, only to see their veto overridden with the help of several Republicans.
A series of embarrassing flaps followed the staff shakeup. Rauner fired their “body man” on their first day after their homophobic and racially insensitive posts were found on Twitter. The governor also was criticized for their response to Lake County flooding and their failure to call it a disaster area earlier.
The governor defended their hires this summer. In July, Rauner said they were working to assemble “the best team in America.” They also declared “change happens” and described criticism of their staff shakeup as “political spin baloney.”
But then came more changes. The governor ousted four members of their new communications team — two of them former Illinois Policy Institute staffers — in August amid a statement regarding a cartoon the think tank posted. The statement cited Rauner's position as a “white male” as a reason not to comment on the cartoon, which some critics dubbed racist. And soon after, the governor's general counsel Dennis Murashko was out the door.
The series of departures left many scratching their heads as to what was truly going on behind the revolving doors.
“What's more embarrassing for Rasmussen and the IPI gang is they inherited an easier situation than the previous team had to manage because the budget was done,” said a political strategist who did not want to be named. “No more daily crises of government on top of the typical daily grind, and they couldn't even handle that.”
The strategist said Rauner's former team managed a bevy of daily crises, including managing the media and the GOP caucuses with no budget in place, a war with AFSCME, and gripes with Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza.
Others saw the shift as a sign the governor realized they erred in their ways: “It only took three months for Bruce and Diana to admit they made a massive mistake,” another political operative said.
Rauner's new chief of staff is a former U.S. attorney for central Illinois. Besides serving as Rauner's public safety director and Homeland Security advisor, Heaton also was chairperson of the Statewide Commission on Criminal Justice and Sentencing Reform.
“I'm excited to promote Rodger to be our team leader,” Rauner said. “His combination of legal, legislative and policy experience will help us build on the significant improvements that Kristina accomplished in a very compressed and challenging time.”
In the call to staffers, Heaton said, as chief of staff, he'd focus on the “structural reforms” Rauner has been fighting for.
“We're still committed to the structural reforms that you've been talking to the people in the state for years now. There is a lot of work to do, and I think Kristina is right, it's going to be a challenge for us in some respects. But I think this is a team that can get it done,” Heaton said.
For people my age, the freedom to get drunk or high and then have sex with someone was a right guaranteed by the sexual revolution of the Sixties.
A great number of my friends (both genders) vigorously exercised that right, knowing it was not something our parents or their parents were especially free to do, particularly the women.
Heaven knows that much of the world, beginning with Islamic societies, still discourages or forbids such behaviour.
Oh, and also Yale University.
At Yale, in 2014, if you're inebriated and decide to indulge your lust, the act is considered non-consensual sex. Which is another term for rape.
It's punishable by expulsion.
Yale's written policy is explicit: A person who is incapacitated by alcohol or drugs cannot by definition consent to sex, and is therefore a rape victim if sex occurs.
If both parties are drunk, presumably, it would be up to Yale administrators to decide who was the rapist and who was the victim.
This may all sound beyond the realm of common sense, but it is real.
American universities are under serious pressure by federal authorities to do something about the "campus rape culture," as some call it – 55 U.S. colleges and universities are currently under investigation for failing to protect students from sexual harassment or assault.
Alarmed at the growing perception that they're becoming havens for rapists, the schools are coming out with codes of sexual behaviour that go far beyond criminal law.
Stained for life
The Obama government in fact insists upon that more stringent approach, telling educators in a special White House report to use a "more likely than not" test to decide whether sexual assault or harassment has occurred.
That is a much looser measure than the previous standard of "clear and convincing," and certainly far more likely to produce a guilty verdict than the "beyond a reasonable doubt" test applied in a criminal courtroom.
Attorney General Eric Holder (above) and Education Secretary Arne Duncan were the key members of a White House task force that released guidelines on April 29, 2014 designed to stem sexual assaults on campuses. (Associated Press)
Therefore, if a college administrator thinks that you more likely than not violated a lengthy, highly detailed set of sexual rules, you're not just expelled, you may also be shamed in the media as a sexual predator and stained for life.
Further, the White House now recommends that schools should adjudicate cases without allowing any cross-examination of testimony.
Presumably, the government has decided that the need to avoid further traumatizing victims trumps an accused's right to question the accuser.
The intent behind all this is laudable. I say that as the father of a daughter who just graduated from university.
But what the universities are doing is also frightening, and I say that as the father of a son who is going into their senior year.
What constitutes consent?
Not only are universities all over America substituting their administrators for police and courts, they are attempting, with the best of intentions, to parse and regulate human behaviour down to the least gesture and syllable.
At Claremont McKenna College in California, the attempt to define sexual consent occupies two full pages of its sexual behavior code.
At this and other institutions, silence, or the absence of dissent in a sexual encounter, cannot be taken for consent. Consent cannot be passive.
Coercion nullifies consent, and coercion can be as simple as threatening to harm oneself if the other party does not engage in sex.
A drunken or stoned person cannot consent (although, unlike Yale, Claremont McKenna confusingly adds that "being under the influence of alcohol or drugs does not in and of itself constitute incapacitation").
Consent is a difficult thing to define, Claremont McKenna's dean of students, Mary Spellman told National Public Radio: "If consent were easy to put into words, we'd have a sentence," not two pages.
What's more, definitions vary depending on the university. Yale goes a step further than most, even providing helpful scenarios:
If, for example, two Yalies decide to find a room, and Morgan, after checking for Kai's consent, performs oral sex on him, and then Kai tries to reciprocate without seeking Morgan's permission, they would merit an official reprimand.
Again, the schools are following Washington's cue. The federal government's guidance on consent is to go beyond the old standard of "no means no."
Washington now wants something called "affirmative consent," meaning that no certainly means no, but yes doesn't necessarily mean yes, unless it is uttered clearly and soberly and repeatedly and convincingly, and one's body language agrees.
Risky business
Alas, this is not a public debate that encourages critical writing.
After a White House task force declared in April that one in five women on campus has been sexually assaulted, and that only 12 per cent of sexual assaults on campus are reported, Dr. Mark Perry, an economics prof at the University of Michigan, ridiculed Washington's math by using actual sexual assault figures from three schools.
Conservative commentator George Will, a sober analyst if there ever was one, then cited Perry's critique in a column, suggesting that colleges, with their extra-legal sexual conduct rules, and their "trigger warnings" about offensive languages in textbooks, and their campus speech codes, are treating students like fragile hothouse flowers, rather than preparing them for the world.
Four U.S. senators promptly blasted Will as an antique who trivializes and legitimizes sexual assault, perpetuating myths created by victimizers.
Canadian campuses are not immune. Students at Saint Mary's University in Halifax rallied last fall to express their concerns over a chant that promoted rape culture during a recent school activity. (Canadian Press)
There was similar blowback last year, when journalist Emily Yoffe had the temerity to suggest that while sexual assault must be punished young women might also want to avoid getting blind drunk.
Yoffe quoted Anne Coughlin, a professor at the University of Virginia and an expert on feminist jurisprudence, as saying more or less the same thing.
Those who believe there is a rape culture on American campuses have called that "blaming the victim."
But every parent should certainly consider this: If the complications of human sexuality and its often ambiguous mating dance defy consistent definition by the intellectual candlepower of entire university faculties, what advice should you give children who might still be in their teens as they head off to college?
This would be mine if my son or daughter were ever to ask: If you feel the need for a sexual adventure, seek it off campus, where police have expert investigators and courts guarantee your rights. Due process, in other words.
And avoid sex with fellow students, period. It's just too risky nowadays.
The plan, which would be paid for mostly with federal money already promised to Great Lakes restoration efforts, calls for new barriers to prevent flooding that might allow the spread of the fish. It also seeks completion of a third electric barrier aimed at preventing the fish, which have already made homes in the Mississippi River system, from traveling through the waterways that lead to the Great Lakes.

The plan suggests that navigational locks along those waterways, which connect to Lake Michigan and are crucial to commercial barge traffic in the Chicago area, could be opened less often than they are now as a way to slow the carp.
Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm of Michigan, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said the measures were inadequate, particularly the notion of opening the locks less frequently. “They just need to shut the locks down, at least temporarily,” Ms. Granholm said in a telephone interview after the meeting.
They added that some type of modified schedule for closing the locks would hardly stop the fish from swimming.

Everyone agrees that the carp should be kept out of the Great Lakes, which contain 20 percent of the world's freshwater, but economic interests appear to have divided state officials.
Leaders from Michigan and other states point to the risks the carp pose to the fishing industry here, valued at $7 billion a year. But officials in Chicago worry about closing waterways between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River because of a barge industry that carries millions of tons of gravel, coal, cement and salt along that path.
Gov. Patrick J. Quinn of Illinois, a Democrat, described Monday's meeting as “productive” and said they looked “forward to working with all parties to protect the Great Lakes.”
But Mike Cox, the Michigan attorney general who has filed a lawsuit against Illinois and other parties demanding that the locks be closed, was critical. They described the federal plans as “half-measures and gimmicks” inclined toward Chicago's wishes.
“President Obama proved today that he'll do anything to protect the narrow interests of their home state of Illinois,” said Mr. Cox, a Republican who is running for governor, “even if it means destroying Michigan's economy.”
ObjectBox 1.1 introduces Data Browser
ObjectBox 1.1 brings a data browser to view objects inside ObjectBox databases. This has become the most requested feature, so we are very happy about finally releasing it. The new data browser actually runs in the browser as it is an embedded web app. Thus, you can quickly check data on your device on the fly, or on your development machine to make use of your screen estate.
Setup
Because the object browser is a debugging tool, you should only use it for your debug builds. Your release builds should still use the regular “android-objectbox” artifact. Use this Gradle config before the line apply plugin: 'io.objectbox' :
// ObjectBox browser dependencies must be set before applying ObjectBox plugin so it does not add objectbox-android // (would result in two conflicting versions, e.g. "Duplicate files copied in APK lib/armeabi-v7a/libobjectbox.so"). dependencies { debugCompile "io.objectbox:objectbox-android-objectbrowser:$objectboxVersion" releaseCompile "io.objectbox:objectbox-android:$objectboxVersion" } 1 2 3 4 5 6 // ObjectBox browser dependencies must be set before applying ObjectBox plugin so it does not add objectbox-android // (would result in two conflicting versions, e.g. "Duplicate files copied in APK lib/armeabi-v7a/libobjectbox.so"). dependencies { debugCompile "io.objectbox:objectbox-android-objectbrowser:$objectboxVersion" releaseCompile "io.objectbox:objectbox-android:$objectboxVersion" }
Because the object browser opens a http port locally for the browser app, you need to ensure your app also has the INTERNET permission:
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" /> 1 < uses - permission android : name = "android.permission.INTERNET" / >
In your app code, simply add those lines right after you created the BoxStore, e.g. in your Application class:
if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) { new AndroidObjectBrowser(boxStore).start(this); } 1 2 3 if ( BuildConfig . DEBUG ) { new AndroidObjectBrowser ( boxStore ) . start ( this ) ; }
As you can see in the video, the object browser comes with a notification to quickly open it on your device.
Running on your dev machine
To open it on your development machine, check the Android locat logs. It will print the port and the ADB command needed to do the port forwarding. Because it usually uses port 8090, the command to run usually is:
adb forward tcp:8090 tcp:8090 1 adb forward tcp : 8090 tcp : 8090
Once the port forwarding is in place you can open the browser using “http://localhost:8090/index.html” on the big screen.
ObjectBox 1.1 also come with other minor features and a couple of fixes. Check the changelog for details.

Rapper, Tyler, the Creator's misogynist lyrics have been called “groundbreaking” and “edgy” by some. Defended on account of being “art” or “satire,” fans of the artist and Odd Future, the hip-hop collective they are a part of, are quick to fire back at those who criticize him.
Talitha Stone, member of the feminist activist group, Collective Shout recently became the focus of verbal attacks and threats not only from fans of Tyler, the Creator, but from the artist himself. Stone and Collective Shout have called on the Australian government to revoke Tyler, the Creator's Visa in order to prevent them from touring the country. In response, the rapper spewed a torrent of verbal abuse about Stone at a recent concert, their fans cheering them on.
In this podcast episode, Meghan Murphy speaks with Stone about Tyler, the Creator's misogyny, the threats she's been subjected to as a result of their activism, and the efforts to keep them out of Australia.

Willie Soon, the notorious climate denier who has made a career out of attacking the IPCC and climate scientists, has received over $1 million in funding from Big Oil and coal industry sponsors over the past decade, according to a new report from Greenpeace.
The Greenpeace report, “Dr. Willie Soon: a Career Fueled by Big Oil and Coal,” reveals that $1.033 million of Dr. Soon's funding since 2001 has come from oil and coal interests. Since 2002, every grant Dr. Soon received originated with fossil fuel interests, according to documents received from the Smithsonian Institution in response to Greenpeace FOIA requests.
The documents show that Willie Soon has received at least $175,000 from Koch family foundations (Soon is a key player in the Koch brothers' climate denial machine, as Greenpeace documented previously), $230,000 from Southern Company, $274,000 from the American Petroleum Institute, and $335,000 from ExxonMobil, among other polluters.
Dr. Soon is perhaps most well-known for their work with fellow astrophysicist Sallie Baliunas attempting to challenge the “hockey stick” graph of temperature records, first published by Dr. Michael Mann.
But the documents reveal that they also fancied themselves a ringleader of a coordinated effort to sully the IPCC's fourth assessment, plotting with Exxon staffers years in advance about how to attack the 2007 report.
A letter that Dr. Soon wrote in 2003, uncovered by Greenpeace, states:
“Clearly they [the AR4 chapters] may be too much for any one of us to tackle them all … But, as A-team, we may for once give it our best shot to try to anticipate and counter some of the chapters, especially WG1—judging from our true expertise in the basic climate sciences …
Even if we can tackle ONE single chapter down the road but forcefully and effectively … we will really accomplish A LOT!
In all cases, I hope we can start discussing among ourselves to see what we can do to weaken the fourth assessment report or to re-direct attention back to science …”
Soon has served on the roster of many oil- and coal-funded front groups over the past 15 years, from their role as “Scientific Adviser” at the coal-funded Greening Earth Society in the late 1990s, to their affiliations with a variety of Koch-Exxon-Scaife funded groups like the George C. Marshall Institute, the Science and Public Policy Institute, the Center for Science and Public Policy and the Heartland Institute.
Dr. Soon is among the speakers at the annual Denialapalooza climate denier meeting hosted by the Heartland Institute in Washington DC later this week. Since the theme of that Heartland junk science junket is “Restoring the Scientific Method,” perhaps the attendees will query Dr. Soon about the ethics of accepting a million dollars from polluter interests while claiming that climate change is nothing to worry about.
LARAMIE, WYO. — After their family moved from suburban New Hampshire to the wind-whipped plains of southeastern Wyoming, Monica Morin embraced small-town life, forging lasting friendships and celebrating their own quirky style.
Dark-haired, with hipster glasses and a disarming sense of humor, Monica was a “why-not kind of kid,” their mother, Kim Morin, said. The kind who would wear a giraffe costume to the grocery store, just because.
Last year, during Monica's sophomore year of high school, their mood began to darken. They turned to alcohol and marijuana, and some days withdrew from the close relationship they had always had with their parents, who, although long divorced, remained friends and partners in raising their only child. After their descent into drinking, they started cutting herself.
Ms. Morin was alarmed, aware that family history was not in their daughter's favor. Them sister had developed bipolar disorder in their teens, eventually drinking themselves to death. Them father had taken their own life when Ms. Morin was 19.

In recent years, there has been an emerging epidemic of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among young injection drug users (IDU) in rural and suburban settings. Early this spring, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services convened a multidisciplinary technical consultation to discuss the existing evidence and to identify and define priorities for the development of a public health response. Already working together to implement the Action Plan for the Prevention, Care, and Treatment of Viral Hepatitis—which includes among its priorities “reducing viral hepatitis caused by drug use behaviors”—the Office of HIV/AIDS and Infectious Disease Policy, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration organized the consultation which brought together representatives of federal agencies, state health department officials, researchers, care providers, staff of community-based organizations, and other experts in the field. Over two days the participants explored factors fueling this epidemic and recommended priorities around epidemiology and surveillance initiatives, prevention and linkages to care interventions, and research questions designed to curb the rising rate of HCV among young persons who inject drugs (PWID) in the United States.
New HCV Infection Trend Among Young People Who Inject Drugs
Injection drug use is known to play a major role in HCV transmission. Surveillance data shared by Massachusetts in 2010 put a spotlight on an emerging HCV infection trend among young PWID. That year, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health analyzed chronic hepatitis C infection data and observed an increase of HCV among persons aged 15–24 between 2002 and 2009. The young people being reported were from all over the state, almost all outside of metropolitan Boston, primarily White, and equally male and female. In-depth interviews with a number of these HCV-positive young people uncovered that most were IDUs who had started opioid use by first misusing oral oxycodone around 1–1.5 years before transitioning to injecting heroin.
After the Massachusetts findings were published, other jurisdictions across the country, began to report similar findings: rising rates of hepatitis C infection among young injectors, both male and female, primarily White, found in suburban and rural settings, who started misusing prescription opioids (e.g., oxycodone) before transitioning to heroin injection.
Participants in the consultation shared that HCV transmission among young IDUs is highly efficient, with young injectors frequently acquiring HCV soon after they first begin to inject opioids. This indicates that the window for HCV prevention interventions targeting this population is narrow. In addition to drug use behaviors, other risk factors influence their risk of acquiring or transmitting HCV including homelessness and a lack of understanding about their risk of infection with HCV and how to prevent it.
The size of this population is significant. An analysis of data from the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse between 1979-2002 (now the National Survey on Drug Use and Health) estimated that 590,000 young adults aged 18–29 had ever injected drugs. As the surveys do not include institutionalized or homeless individuals, it is likely that these figures are underestimates. Among these young injectors, it is estimated that as many as 45% (265,000) are infected with HCV.
There is growing concern that these increases could begin to reverse the declines in overall HCV incidence and prevalence observed by the CDC over the past decade. It is clear that federal, state local and community partners need to take action if we are to mount a sound public health response.
Strategies to Address HCV Infection Among Young PWID
During the consultation, researchers, federal agency representatives, providers, and community leaders shared presentations on key facts about the epidemiology of HCV infection among this population, the state of current research, and examples of innovative community responses. The consultants engaged in robust, highly interactive discussions identifying successes, challenges, and gaps and proposing strategies to address the issues that emerged. A summary of the presentations and the groups' recommendations are presented in a meeting summary report [PDF 4MB].
The consultation participants recommended several key public health actions including:
Create community-led education and messaging strategies on hepatitis C risks, injection transmission risks (e.g., sharing drug preparation equipment in addition to sharing drug injection equipment), and HCV testing resources.
Improve and increase infrastructure for HCV surveillance and data collection.
Create age-appropriate (e.g., young adult) substance use and hepatitis C interventions and prevention strategies that are evidence based and effective.
Expand both community-based and basic science research activities to better understand how to effectively address the emerging crisis of hepatitis C infection among young IDUs.
Discussions about this issue are ongoing among the participants and other federal and non-federal partners as we collaborate on ways to stem the tide of new HCV infections among young PWID and connect those already living with HCV to care and treatment for their infection and underlying drug use. With heightened awareness of this evolving epidemic and the attention and engagement of partners from across all sectors of society– including the voices of young people– we can make a positive difference in the lives of these young men and women.

Being different isn't always a good thing.
In a crushingly conformist world, if you stick out, then people will often stick their tongues out at you. Even when they praise you for being different at first, soon they'll decide this is all too uncomfortable.
This is surely part of what brought Samsung down in the Apple-Samsung patented grapplefest.
Samsung, in the jury's eyes, was silly enough to take products that had become cultural icons and, well, copy their icons.
This is something that one company expressly decided not to do. That company is Microsoft.
Though Redmond is sometimes derided for certain conventional, even dull ways (that's your new logo?), it gets less credit than it deserves for doing things that are definitively not like what anyone else has done. Kinect and Xbox come to mind.
As my colleagues Jessica Dolcourt and Roger Cheng suggest, the Apple-Samsung verdict could represent a considerable business gain for Microsoft.
But there's a surely an even greater reason for Microsofties to feel a gleeful glow.
Whether it gains great business success with Windows Phone or not, the company can look its employees (and especially potential employees) in the soul and tell them that it is genuinely attempting to create.
At a time when it's craving credibility with products like Surface, Microsoft wants to represent genuine competition to Apple's superior level of taste.
Rather than simply ceding the primacy of design to Apple, the company is attempting to prove that things can be done a different way and might even be great.
No one ever imagined it would be easy. But there's something quite symbolic about Android being represented by a little robot. In its little metal heart, the robot just wants to be human. It just wants to fit in. It just wants to be the same as everyone else out there.
Microsoft, on the other hand, suddenly wants to be the guy with one ear who wears orange trousers and a plaid cape.
It might be a mere dream, but wouldn't you rather work for a company that at least tries to create something that hasn't been seen before -- even if sometimes it doesn't work out -- than, say, spend your days at the tech equivalent of Forever 21?

Former Gov. Jeb Bush continued to take a hard line against normalizing relations with Cuba on Friday, accusing the Obama administration of capitulating to an oppressive regime by removing it from a state-sponsored terrorism list.
“Neither continued repression at home nor Cuba's destabilizing activities abroad appear sufficient to stop President Obama from making further concessions to the Communist regime in Havana,” Mr. Bush, who is considering a run for president, said in a statement.
The statement came as Secretary of State John F. Kerry rescinded Cuba's designation as a terrorism sponsor on Friday. The move came after a 45-day congressional notification period that began on April 14 when President Obama said they wanted to remove Cuba from the list. The removal marks an important step at normalizing ties between the two countries.
Mr. Bush, a Republican from Florida who is popular with Cuban exiles in the state, has said that the United States should continue supporting dissidents and faith groups in Cuba but should not change its policies toward the Castro regime. They said on Friday that removing Cuba from the terrorism list was “evidence that President Obama seems more interested in capitulating to our adversaries than in confronting them” and suggested that Iran's leaders are taking note.
“I call on Congress to keep pressure on Cuba and hold the Administration accountable,” Mr. Bush said.
“The schedule that we have is essentially putting a five- to 10-year IT project within a two- to three-year timeframe, and I would guess that every state has that same ‘red' on there. That schedule and timeline is just really tight,” said exchange director April Todd-Malmlov in an interview.
Despite internal documents identifying potentially serious problems, the head of Minnesota's new health exchange expressed confidence Thursday that the system will go online Oct. 1 with at least barebones functions.
The MNsure documents, obtained by MinnPost, note staff and consultants' specific concerns about issues involving small businesses using the exchange, as well as eligibility verification and user testing.
The documents list the overall project status as “red,” or “at risk” for going live on Oct.1, the first federal deadline for exchanges across the country to begin enrolling consumers.
“The entirety of the project scope has always been red — at least one part of it has always been red,” said MNsure Executive Director April Todd-Malmlov during a Thursday interview. “It's an indicator for us as to where to focus efforts.”
“Honestly, I'll tell you that's been a risk since Day 1, and that hasn't changed,” they said. “The schedule that we have is essentially putting a five- to 10-year IT project within a two- to three-year timeframe, and I would guess that every state has that same ‘red' on there. That schedule and timeline is just really tight.”
The exchange is expected to serve about 1.3 million Minnesotans as an online marketplace where consumers and small businesses can compare and shop for insurance coverage.
Todd-Malmlov, who sat down with MinnPost to go through the documents, said the risk assessments included in the multi-agency reports are normal for a project of this size and timeframe.
The documents — weekly project status reports, technical updates and internal presentations — depict a project dealing with an extremely complicated IT infrastructure to build under a severe deadline.
“The schedule will remain [urgent] due to tight timelines with no slack,” according to a project overview from Sept. 11, the most recent available. “There is little to no room for vendors to miss code drop dates, and we are severely lacking in adequate testing time.”
Exchange staff and the vendors examine issues as they arise, decide if they can be fixed or worked around, and evaluate how they affect the overall project, they said. With October quickly approaching, MNsure staffers are meeting multiple times a day to discuss glitches and problems as they come up.
But documents show that the project's fate has become more uncertain since April, according to MNsure's internal standards.
A project overview from last week highlights the risk of two unknowns: “Whether the system will meet state and federal guidelines and if defects found in system and [user] testing will be able to be corrected in time to go live.”
Key features
It's unclear how some of the key features of the exchange will work, according to the documents.
• Access for small businesses. Enterprises will use the SHOP program for employee health insurance, but it may not be available on Oct 1. “Just heard from Connecture that their 1.0 release does not have any MN SHOP requirements coded,” the weekly status report from last week reads.
Todd-Malmlov said an updated version had filled in those requirements.
But the documents raise other problems.
“Testing performed thus far has opened around 30+ [issues], many of a nature that will threaten our ability to go-live on 10/1,” according to the report, referring to the small-business program.
Exchange staffers recognized that they wouldn't be able to allow small-business employees to enroll in the exchange until the infrastructure's second release in December. That feature has been postponed in order to avoid using manual processing, Todd-Malmlov said.
But that raises the specter of additional issues.
“It does, however, provide a single point of failure for SHOP in that if the vendors are unable to deliver we will have [employers] that have committed [but] no place for the [employees] to enroll,” according to the report.
• Eligibility issues. The exchange is supposed to allow for eligibility determination for public programs and insurance subsidies.
Todd-Malmlov said the process should go forward smoothly, but exchange staffers noted some problems in the documents.
“Team has participated in user testing and have determined that at this point, Eligibility determination and [tax credit] calculations are not working,” according to the timeline. “Completing an unsubsidized [health plan] works intermittently. For these reasons, we are reporting our status as Red.”
Todd-Malmlov said they believe many of those issues have been fixed. Some populations, such as foster children, may still have problems, they said, and those people would then be processed by hand.
• Testing concerns. One of the largest problems identified in exchange documents is the lack of user testing before the Oct. 1 deadline.
Todd-Malmlov said they wish there was more time.
“In a perfect world, I think you'd want to test for six months,” they said. “I can guarantee you no one has had that.”
So far, they said, the exchange has completed a variety of user and security tests.
They noted that there are a number of options if functionality isn't guaranteed on Oct. 1. Often, state employees can employ manual workarounds. That appears likely to be the case for certain tasks, such as people wanting to pay with cash or check.
Todd-Malmlov has repeatedly told reporters and lawmakers that Minnesotans will be able to access MNsure when open enrollment begins. They also reiterated Thursday that the mammoth project wouldn't have all the bells and whistles that staffers had originally hoped.
“Some of the planned functionality won't be up on time,” Todd-Malmlov said. “What we had as a grand plan in our contract, it's not all going to come in there Day 1, but people will be able to get coverage.”
February re-assessment
Exchange leaders re-evaluated the size of the project in February after staff met with the federal government to go over the basics of what the exchange would have to do.
A MNsure report from early February acknowledged that there was “more work remaining than [the] schedule can accommodate.”
“We will all need to surrender many of the aspirational goals for the sake of realizing the absolute minimum essential,” the report reads.
Todd-Malmlov, who attended the D.C. meeting, said as an example, exchange staff dropped a feature to rate provider quality in order to focus on the minimum federal standards. The exchange has so far met those tests, which occurred over the summer.
They said it's likely the project will face unexpected problems even after the deadline.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) came close to calling for gun registration in an interview that aired on Sunday, Oct. 8, 2017, interrupting their thought at the last minute. (Photo: Screen grab from NBC's "Meet the Press.")
(CNSNews.com) – Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a long time gun control advocate, has introduced a bill to ban bump stocks, following the deadly use of such devices in last week's Las Vegas massacre.
But in a conversation with NBC's “Meet the Press,” Feinstein indicated that a bump-stock ban is just a small, first step. In fact, they came close to calling for gun registration:
“I do know this, that we have a Second Amendment. There's been difference over its interpretation by the court, the high court. Nonetheless, the high court has held and possession of firearms is legal under the Second Amendment,” Feinstein said.
“There is still a lot of dissent over the court's decision with respect to the Second Amendment. Be that as it may, the court has decided and Americans generally fall in line.
“So let's say, from the perspective of this decision, it is legal for an American to carry a weapon. It's legal for them to drive a car. However, they register that car. We should perhaps look--and the NRA says, you know, guns don't kill people, people kill people.
Well, cars don't kill people. People driving them kill people. And so there are a lot of things that could be done to make it safer. But every single one has been opposed by a very powerful organization, that then goes out to get any member of congress or senator that votes to the contrary. That's a fact of life,” Feinstein told NBC's Chuck Todd.
Feinstein began the interview by calling the U.S. “a gun-happy country.”
“And I think there are many of us in growing numbers that don't want a gun-happy country," they continued.
"Guns have their place. I don't have a problem if they're used properly. But what I have seen over the decades is a growth of substantial, improper use of weapons, beginning with the Texas bell tower.
"You've seen law offices, you've seen businesses, you've seen movie theaters, you've seen high schools, you've seen colleges, you've seen a primary school with first graders in it, 20 of them killed.
"And now you see a great American classic, which is country music, people by the thousands, out in a safe place, with a big hotel in the background. And somebody comes along.
"He has been legal, he's gotten their weapons legally. They have 40 weapons; they have 12 of these bump stocks. They are on the weapons. And they begin to fire a weapon that fires similar to a machine gun out of two broken hotel windows. Every American should look at those pictures and say, do we want more of this?"
Feinstein described their bump-stock bill as “one simple thing that stops the making of a semiautomatic weapon into a machine gun.”
They also told “Meet the Press,” “I'm not sure there is any set of laws that could have prevented” the Las Vegas massacre.
Many Second Amendment supporters oppose gun registration as the slippery slope to gun confiscation.
Last week, a Russian polling institute released the latest results from its ongoing survey of Russian public opinion toward Ukraine, finding that attitudes are getting worse, but remain more positive than negative. As Kiev continues its effort to sever centuries of ties with Moscow, what are the prospects for improving public perceptions?

On Friday, the Russian Public Opinion Research Center (VTsIOM), post-Soviet Russia's oldest opinion polling institution, released the results of its survey of Russian public opinion toward Ukraine and Ukrainians. Asked about their 'general attitude toward Ukraine', a combined 50% of those polled said that it is 'very good', or 'mostly good', down from 60% this time last year.
At the same time, 36% of respondents answered 'generally bad' or 'very bad', up from 31% last year.
Moreover, two years after the events of the Euromaidan, which brought to power a nationalist government eager to separate itself politically, economically, and socio-culturally from Russia and to join the European Union, a majority of respondents continue to characterize the events negatively.
34% of respondents said that the events of February 2014 can best be characterized as 'anarchy, lawlessness and banditism', with 18% saying that the events amounted to a 'coup d'état, the forceful seizure of power', 12% describing it as a 'civil war', 6% as a 'rebellion/revolution' and 5% as an 'American provocation, Western interference'. 4% answered that it was a positive 'overthrow of the government'.
Ultimately, the results also showed that 81% of Russians believe 'Ukraine lost out' as a result of the Euromaidan revolution, with another 10% saying that 'factually, it didn't change anything', and only 2% suggesting that 'Ukraine benefited', down from 3% this time last year and 5% in March 2014. Moreover, a whopping 96% of Russians said they would not like to see 'a repeat of events analogous to Ukraine's Maidan' in Russia.
The polling surveyed 1,600 persons from 130 cities and towns in 46 regions across Russia, with a margin of error of no more than 3.5%.
Commenting on the poll results, the independent Russian newspaper Svobodnaya Pressa suggested that unfortunately, "the current authorities of Ukraine have placed their bets on breaking off economically and, more importantly, culturally from Russia, — in favor of a break in all historical ties."
"Such policy, the newspaper contends, "has gradually begun bearing its fruit, mirroring Russians' attitudes toward Ukraine, which, until very recently was customary to consider a brotherly nation."
Asked to explain the poll results, the newspaper turned to Sergei Kara-Murza, respected sociologist and director of the Moscow-based Center for Problem Analysis and State Management Design.
"I would not call Russians' responses to sociologists regarding Ukraine 'convictions'," Kara-Murza said. "Rather, it would be more correct to call them 'sentiments'. Convictions are something stable and deeply held, while sentiments fluctuate depending on events."

"Yes, if some crime is committed against Russians or Russian-speaking Ukrainians [in Ukraine], sentiments will swing sharply toward the negative. But if we were to suddenly find ourselves as situational allies in some situation, the opposite would occur in Russians' perceptions of Ukraine and Ukrainians," the sociologist added.
In the long historical view, Kara-Murza says, the recent rift between Russia and Ukraine is not so catastrophic. "What has happened over the last two years does not yet indicate a fundamental shift," a point of no return.
"It's true, mass public sentiment in Ukraine is currently anti-Russian. This is similar to what happens when small conflicts take place between neighboring ethnic groups. They result in sharp outbreaks of hatred for other peoples, and this translates into bloody conflicts. Something similar can happen in large nations. Social scientists call this neo-tribalism – a phenomenon which occurs when large nations face such irrational attitudes in relation to their closes neighbors."
"But as anthropologists say, this type of conflict quickly burns itself out. I think that something similar is occurring between Russians and Ukrainians. In the future, relations between our nations, even if they are not very good, will gradually improve – realities will force this to happen. It's obvious that no one is going to accept Ukraine into Europe," the sociologist notes.
Asked how long Russia might have to wait for Ukraine to come around, Kara-Murza suggested that Russians should simply recall their own recent history.
"I think that their illusions will soon be lifted. All this is reminiscent of the mood in Russian society in the early 1990s. We believed that we would be entering our new 'common European home', that we would be given help, etc. The urban population was very idealistically-minded. But by 1994, this mood was exhausted. The same polls by VTsIOM, if one looks into the archives, confirm this, and I think the same thing will happen in Ukraine."

Furthermore, the academic suggested that "the conflict between Russians and Ukrainians could exhaust itself quickly, were it not constantly heated up by the media."
"In the late 1980s," Kara-Murza recalled, "Ukraine was the most 'pro-Union' republic in the Soviet Union. No one took Banderites, of whom there was only a handful, with any seriousness. This shows how people's sentiments can be changed. But convictions can be changed only through generations."
Ultimately, the sociologist notes, if the current anti-Russian authorities in Kiev were able to hold on to power for decades, new generations of Ukrainians could be convinced that Russians are not a fraternal nation, but their enemy. If this were to occur, they warn, "it would be difficult to correct, because children brought up in a certain way usually keep their beliefs for life."
The question Kara-Murza seems to suggest, is whether the Russophobic authorities in Kiev will be able to hold on that long.
"Targeted Metabolomic Approach for Assessing Human Synthetic Cannabinoid Exposure and Pharmacology"
Analytical Chemistry
The harmful effects of increasingly popular designer cannabis products called “Spice” or “K2” have puzzled scientists for years, but now a group of researchers is reporting progress toward understanding what makes them so toxic. The study, published in the ACS journal Analytical Chemistry, describes development of a method that could someday help physicians diagnose and treat the thousands of young adults and teens who end up in emergency rooms after taking the drugs.
Jeffery Moran and colleagues note that synthetic marijuana, often marketed as “natural incense,” “potpourri,” Spice or K2, is a significant public health concern, and 1 in 9 high school seniors admit recent use. The products appear across the United States and Europe, and are the second most popular drug after real marijuana for many American teens and young adults. The substances produce a “high,” but also can cause a wide range of dangerous side effects including seizures, hallucinations, severe kidney damage, psychotic behavior and heart attacks. Scientists are quickly playing catch-up to understand how these fake pot products work in order to identify them in users' urine and to treat the devastating health effects, which, in some cases, plague users for months after they initially take it.
To gain insight into the effects of designer marijuana products, Moran's team developed a new method and used it to study how the body processes two popular forms in Spice and K2, known as JWH-018 and AM2201. Urine samples from 15 people who tested positive for use showed significant differences in how the individuals' bodies processed the drugs. This finding could help explain why some people experience more severe effects from the drugs than others.

The studio and its Illumination division have hired Peter Candeland to direct an animated version of the Dr. Seuss classic.
The Grinch is coming back to theaters.
Universal and its Illumination Entertainment division are developing a 3D animated version of the Dr. Seuss classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas! Peter Candeland is set to direct, with Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri producing. Audrey Geisel, widow of Dr. Seuss author Theodor Geisel, will executive produce.
Grinch, written in 1957, famously was adapted in 1966 into a half-hour TV animated special that continues to air during the holiday season. Universal made a live-action film version in 2000 starring Jim Carrey. Despite offending Seuss purists, it grossed $260 million domestically. That movie set in motion a relationship between Universal and the Geisel estate, which collaborated on a 2003 live-action The Cat in the Hat film starring Mike Myers ($101 million domestic).
Meledandri also has a history with Seuss adaptations. They executive produced Fox's 2008 animated version of Horton Hears a Who!, which led to them making 2012's The Lorax under their Illumination banner at Universal.
Candeland is an up-and-coming director of commercials and music videos with no major film credits.  They are repped by Verve.
There is no writer yet attached to the new Grinch movie.

In case you ever wondered just how many wealthy students dominate America's top colleges, here's a nice illustration from a new report by the Century Foundation.
At the most selective schools in the country,* 70 percent of students come from the wealthiest quarter of U.S. families.
Just 14 percent come from the poorest half.
And while these statistics date back to 2006, I think it's safe to say they haven't changed greatly in the last few years.
http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/05/americas-top-colleges-have-a-rich-kid-problem/276195/
If you think higher education should be a ladder for upward mobility, then you should regard these numbers as a disgrace. As we've written before at The Atlantic, elite colleges do a consistently poor job recruiting the intelligent but low-income high school students who could benefit most from a top-notch education. Part of their problem, as Josh Freedman explained for us recently, is that it's expensive. Low-income undergrads need financial aid, and many institutions either don't have the resources, or would simply prefer to deploy them elsewhere. Others have the money and are willing to use it, but aren't sufficiently aggressive about reaching out to a population of students who often don't realize they have the academic skills to attend a great school or that aid would cover most of their expenses.
But it's certainly not as if there aren't enough smart, poor students to fill up classrooms. As economists Caroline Hoxby and Christopher Avery have shown, about 39 percent of America's high-achieving students are from the country's poorest 50 percent of students. These are teenagers who manage an A- average in school and finish among the 10 percent of SAT or ACT takers. Most of them never even apply to a selective college, which would include schools ranging from the "very competitive" category to the "most competitive" category.
If the wealthiest schools in the country wanted more economic diversity, they could have it.

An Infrastructural Army Officer in a garrison uniform. The distinction between Infrastructural officers and enlisted soldiers had become more pronounced since the birth of the Army. During the Wars of Unification officers were generally loyal regular soldiers with battle experience and basic literacy (the latter requirement not being strictly enforced). As the army was expanding steadily during that period and their foes were hosts of poorly equipped badly organized warriors this was sufficient. As time went on training of officers from the ground up became more formalized. Regardless unlike the forces of most other kingdoms where wealth and titles are a requirement, the Officer Corps of the Infrastructural Army is an institution to which any recruit or soldier can aspire to. Recruits who prove themselves in leadership exercises, volunteer for officer duty and pass admission test are sent an Academy for training (either three years* in peacetime or for one of year accelerated training in wartime). Officer Cadets are usually trained in a specialty (Riflers, Cavalry, Artillery, Logistics, etc.) often based on what they were assigned to serve in at boot camp. The general notion is that a dozen jack of all trades officers is inferior to a dozen specialist officrs working in concert. In 30 IA the army's rank structure received an overhaul, most notably adding the ranks of Junior Lieutenant and Major General. Field promotions are still fairly common, especially with the escort war.
While it would be a lie to say that that there is not a gulf between the rank and file of the Infrastructural Army and their officer's corps, such a gulf is less pronounced in other cultures with more traditional armies to the east in which lords, knights and patricians lead formations of common born infantry. This means that officers and enlisted alike tend to view each other as their fellow soldiers rather than an inscrutable capricious ruler or a collection of lowly scum. Some foreign observers have commended the Infrastructural Army for recruiting people based on merit rather than bloodline. Others have denounced the policy as being a crude system which substitutes "upjumped peasants" for "men raised from birth to lead by the sword". The latter is most firmly held by nobles.
*though the first classes of the military academy had a 5 year long training cycle, the process was streamlined.
(Note: This is a first try at a "stub" article about ongoing volcanic activity. Feel free to add additional information and comments after the post).
The eruption at Sinabung has continued to intensify over the last week. The latest explosive plumes from the Indonesian volcano have topped 5-7 km (16,500-23,000 feet). All this activity has caused over 5,300 people to be evacuated from the region around the volcano, and as with any extended evacuation, issues with food and water access are occurring. Additionally, the farmland around Sinabung has been heavily damaged by the ash fall. The eruption has also started to produce small pyroclastic flows (see right) that have moved down the slopes of the volcano, so the 5 km exclusion zone may expand if that threat continues to grow. The farthest any of these flows have travelled so far is ~1.2 km (0.75 miles). Some lahars have also been produced from the eruption, although this Getty picture incorrectly refers to it as a "cold lava flow."
UPDATE 11:30 AM EST: Check out this new image of the eruption plume from Sinabung from today (see above; via Lava Robin and Anthony Sagliani). You can see additional small pyroclastic flows on the flanks of the volcano, likely caused by parts of the column collapsing. Also, note the strong ash fall on the left side of the plume. The plume isn't particularly tall (you can see it spread laterally at the very top of the image), so my guess is it is still in the range of the 5-7 km we've been seeing. What is great about this image is you can really see the pieces of an eruption column clearly (see below). Right at the vent, the column is being forced out at high velocities merely through gas thrust of fragmenting magma. As it rising buoyancy, it slows down in the convection zone rapidly, but continues to go up because it is hot (and has some momentum). It finally reaches the point of neutral buoyancy where the plume stops mostly moving upwards but rather moves outwards into the umbrella region. In this image, the umbrella region is clipped off at the top of the shot.
This shot reminds us that the early years overlapped with the golden age of airships–it's from 1930. The Hindenburg would crash 7 years later. Image: Macy's Inc. Schematic representation of the Sinabung eruptive column showing some of the main eruptive features. Image: Erik Klemetti

Thirty newborn babies and their mothers might have been exposed to measles after someone with a measles rash walked onto the maternity ward of Abbotsford hospital on Thursday, officials with the Fraser Health Authority say.
Newborns are too young to be vaccinated against the disease, which is airborne and highly contagious, said Fraser Health's chief medical health officer Paul Van Buynder.
Measles vaccine facts The measles vaccine is combined with the mumps and rubella (German measles) vaccines, so a person can receive protection from three diseases with one shot.
The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is provided for free as part of the routine immunization schedule in British Columbia.
The MMR vaccine is given to children as a series of two doses at age 12 months and at four to six years of age.
The vaccine is also provided for free to women of child-bearing age who are not immune to rubella and older children and adults born after 1956 who have not been immunized.
About 75 per cent of children in B.C. receive both doses of the MMR vaccine by their second birthday. (Source: B.C. Centre for Disease Control)
The illness is extremely dangerous, and in one in 3,000 cases, it can be fatal.
Fraser Health is warning people in Abbotsford to get vaccinated against measles, adding that in some areas nearby , vaccination rates are close to zero.
"There are groups in Fraser East who don't believe in immunization and that they are likely to share this disease, given the likelihood that they will get measles at this moment," Van Buynder said.
"If you get sick in the next few weeks, please don't visit our hospitals or out areas where there are large groups of vulnerable people at risk," they added.
The symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose, and watery inflamed eyes, and small red spots with white or bluish white centers in the mouth.
Then a dusky red, blotchy rash begins on the face and spreads all over the body on the third to seventh day of illness, lasting for four to seven days. Anyone with symptoms should see a doctor.
According to the B.C. Centre for Disease Control the last significant measles outbreak occurred in 2010 in British Columbia when 82 case were confirmed after the Winter Olympic Games held in Vancouver.
That was the largest measles outbreak in B.C. since 1997 when 247 cases were reported.
The low-altitude Himalayan glaciers are losing water at a faster pace than the ones in higher reaches due to rising temperatures creating water risk in these regions, a new study has found.
Himalayan glaciers are a huge reservoir of water that sustain lives of millions of people in India and many rivers including Ganga, Brahmaputra and Indus originate from the glacial ice. While most glaciers are melting only a few have witnessed advancement in recent decades.
A study of 146 glaciers spread over 660sq km in Chandra basin in the western Himalayas has for the first time estimated the loss of volume. This helps in understanding the behaviour of glaciers in the wake of climate change as the overall spread of the glaciers may not fall but water content may go down.
The study published in the international general Annals of Glaciology has been done by Anil V Kulkarni of the Indian Institute of Sciences, Bangalore. Kulkarni was previously with India Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and headed its glacier monitoring unit.
“For the first time, not only in India but globally, we have an estimate of how much volume and mass of glaciers has been lost over a period of time in Chandra basin,” Kulkarni said. “Now we can have similar estimates for other glaciers in the Himalayan region.”
The Chandra basin lost 11.1 gega-tonnes of water from 1984-2012, which is about one-fifth of the estimated volume. However, the loss in smaller and low altitude glaciers was about 67% during the period, the study found.
“I would like to caution that there is no danger of the glaciers vanishing in new future,” Kulkarni said, adding the “small ones” may not be there in the long run. The study, Kulkarni said, helps in better understanding of fresh water stored in the Himalayan glaciers and would be crucial for water resource management to implement necessary mitigation measures.
The team of researchers from different scientific institutes in India estimated mass balance of glaciers in the basin on basis of satellite data. The study covered 146 glaciers in the basin situated in Lahul-Spiti valley of Himachal Pradesh, which has witnessed an up to 2 degree temperature rises in the last century.
As per latest ISRO estimate, there are 34,919 glaciers in the Himalayan region having 75,779 sq kms of glaciated areas in the Indus, Ganga and Brahmaputra river basins. The ISRO did not notice any changes in 1,752 glaciers while 18 showed advancement. The remaining are retreating on account of rising emissions and increase in debris.
Kulkarni, in another study, had said that Himalayan glaciers have retreated by about 13% in last four decades with the water loss increasing from 9 gega-tonnes per year in 1975-1985 to 20 GT/year in 2010-2015 period.

Paul Singer, the billionaire hedge fund manager, has claimed victory in a lawsuit to force Argentina to fork out almost 17 times more than they paid to buy bonds issued by the country.
After Argentina's economy crashed in 2001 and it defaulted on $80 billion in bonds, Singer's Elliott Capital Management paid $49 million to buy $220 million in Argentine debt. Over the last 13 years, the value of these bonds has risen to $832 million which Singer wants paid off in full. Singer has been joined by several other Wall Street speculators such as Aurelius Capital Management and Blue Angel who together hold a total of $1.3 billion in Argentine debt.
In the meantime, after extensive negotiations, almost all other holders of Argentina's total $93 billion in debt agreed to forgive as much as 70 percent of what they were owed, recognizing that the country was in dire financial straits.
"Society needs a way to allow people to start over again. This is why we have bankruptcy," writes Martin Wolf in the Financial Times. "Indeed, we allow the most important private actors in our economies - companies - to enjoy limited liability. The ease with which US corporations can walk away from their creditors is breathtaking. A similar logic applies to countries."
But there is no international bankruptcy court for countries. Instead, beginning in 2009, Singer and their friends took advantage of the fact that much of the debt was issued under New York laws and went after Argentina in U.S. courts.
This is not the first time that Singer, a lawyer trained at Harvard, has taken advantage of governments in dire straits. The Democratic Republic of the Congo was forced to pay them $90 million for $20 million in debt in 2002 and Peru had to pay them $58 million for debt they bought for $11 million in 1995.
But Argentina has refused to play ball so far. "We will not reward loan sharks who bought defaulted bonds for next to nothing and have refused a deal that would have represented a clear profit, asking much more, even several times the amount they spent," wrote Hector Timerman, the Argentine minister of foreign affairs in the Huffington Post. "If Argentina beats Paul Singer and others, the consequence may well be a world where vulture funds' actions against developing countries are history. A place free of these scavengers would benefit not only my country, but also other poor nations in Africa and Latin America."
It has been an uphill struggle for Argentina, however. In November 2012, a U.S. court ruled that the country to pay all the bondholders at the same time. The problem with this ruling that if Argentina paid Singer and their friends the full amount they want, other creditors could well want to be paid in full also, making the country liable for as much as $15 billion immediately, more than half the country's reserves. All told Argentina might face a total debt of some $120 billion.
Argentina appealed the decision at the U.S. Supreme Court but the judges refused to hear the case last week. Now Argentina faces a June 30 deadline when it is supposed to pay the next installment of interest to all bondholders.
Other countries have waded into this battle. Brazil, France and Mexico supported Argentina in its losing bid at the U.S. Supreme Court while a Ghanian court allowed Singer's group to seize an Argentine vessel ARA Libertad last October.
Despite Argentina's court losses, progressives say that its citizens are vastly better off today because of the country's hard-nosed negotiations with bondholders to date and its refusal to cut social spending to pay off its debt back in 2001.
"For comparison, look at Greece," writes Mark Weisbrot, the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. "After six years of austerity-driven recession, which included a 40 percent cut in health care spending, the unemployment rate stands at 26.8 percent (and more than double that rate for youth) and the net public debt has grown to 169 percent of the country's gross domestic product."

Minutes after the 1964 magnitude-9.2 Great Alaska Earthquake began shaking, a series of tsunami waves swept through the village of Chenega in Prince William Sound, destroying all but two of the buildings and killing 23 of the 75 inhabitants. Fifty years later, scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey revealed the likely cause of the tsunami, a large set of underwater landslides. The scientists used detailed seafloor images not only clear up a decades-old mystery, but also underscore the tsunami hazard that submarine landslides can pose in fjords around the world where communities and ports are commonly located.
USGS geologists mapping Alaska's south coast shortly after the 1964 Great Alaska Earthquake had speculated that a submarine landslide might have triggered the Chenega tsunami, just as known landslides triggered tsunamis that devastated the Alaskan towns of Valdez, Seward and Whittier. But “a bathymetric survey at the time, which only imaged relatively shallow seafloor, down to 180 meters (330 feet) deep, did not reveal evidence of a landslide in nearby Dangerous Passage or the other waterways around Chenega. Alternate explanations involving seafloor movement during the earthquake did not fit the timing and severity of the Chenega tsunami as described by eyewitnesses,” explained Daniel Brothers, USGS geophysicist and lead author of the study.
The tsunami origin remained uncertain until a team led by Brothers mapped a large submarine landslide complex in Dangerous Passage, mostly in water deeper than what was studied in 1964.
“What makes this slide unusual is that much of the material that slid was at a water depth of 250 to 350 meters (820 to 1150 feet),” said Peter Haeussler, USGS geologist and a coauthor of the report. “The deeper initiation depth made it particularly good at generating a tsunami.”
The scientists used multibeam sonar technology to collect high-resolution bathymetric (seafloor depth) data, and a single-channel seismic-reflection system to collect sub-bottom profiles (cross-sectional views of sedimentary layers and other features beneath the seafloor).
The researchers calculated the time it would take for a tsunami triggered by a large landslide in the mapped areas to reach the village of Chenega and found a good fit with eyewitness reports: a tsunami wave triggered in the areas where they found landslide evidence would take three to four minutes to reach the village, consistent with the arrival time of the most destructive waves.
“It is exciting to see the technology evolve so we can now get high-resolution images of the seafloor that we could not back then and to pinpoint the most likely source for the waves. After 50 years, this new work confirms our original inference that it was probably landslide-generated waves that devastated Chenega so many years ago, but we had no adequate submarine data to define either the size or location of the landslide sources,” said USGS geologist emeritus George Plafker who, with colleague Larry Mayo, was one of the first responders and wrote some of the early geological field reports on surface effects of the Chenega waves in 1965.
The modern bathymetric data revealed three sedimentary basins at progressively deeper levels toward the open waters of Prince William Sound. These basins were originally carved by descending glaciers when sea level was lower. As sea level rose and the glaciers retreated after the last ice age, the basins filled with sediment eroded and washed off the land. The basins are separated by sills, likely terminal glacial moraines, and bounded by steep, rugged slopes. Details of the underwater terrain include scarps, blocks, hummocky surfaces and other features typical of landslides. Similarly, the sub-bottom seismic profiles show that the basins are filled with fine-grained sediment, with layers disrupted in ways that indicate multiple landslides.
The new report by USGS scientists and their colleagues from Boise State University and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, “A submarine landslide source for the devastating 1964 Chenega tsunami, southern Alaska,” was published in the journal, Earth and Planetary Science Letters.
The Russian defense ministry awarded United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) a launch order for 39 Il-476 heavy airlifters, also referred to as the Il-76MD-90A. The move is partially designed to convey program assurance to potential customers in China and India. These countries already operate “classic” Il-76s. The new version can transport a 114,500-pound payload over a range of 2,700 nm.
On a separate occasion earlier this month, Ilya Federov, general director of engine-maker NPO Saturn, confirmed a Chinese order for 184 D-30KP turbofans, the engine that powers the existing Il-76. Some of the aircraft are in service in China. The contract is reported to have been signed in November 2011 and validated in February 2012.
Fedorov said the contract value is over $1.5 billion, with deliveries due to be completed by 2016. China is known to have been installing D-30KPs into refurbished H-6 bombers (locally made Tupolev Tu-16s) to extend their range. Russian officials try not to acknowledge this fact. China also attempted production of reverse-engineered D-30KPs under the designation of WS-18, but so far their use has been limited due to reliability issues.
The launch order for the Il-476 was placed on October 3, when President Vladimir Putin visited the Aviastar plant in Ulianovsk. After witnessing a demonstration flight by the first flying prototype, the Russian president said that the Rouble 140 billion ($4.5 billion) contract is expected to be followed by foreign sales. They especially mentioned China as a potential client for the renewed Il-76.
“Some six years ago we were talking to our partners in the Asian countries, including the People's Republic of China. They were ready to buy from us some 50 airplanes. I am sure this new airplane will be in demand both in Russia and our potential partners abroad,” Putin said.
Putin said that the Ilyushin design house began “working in earnest” on a new airlifter derived from the Il-76 platform in 2005. This happened after “long talks with our partners and friends in Uzbekistan” (the final assembly line for the Il-76 was established at the Tashkent Aircraft Production Organization in Soviet times). “Unfortunately, we did not manage to come to terms, due to economic issues. Hence we finally made this decision to set up a new manufacturing line at the Ulyanovsk plant,” Putin continued.
Improvement of the original design included development of a new wing and onboard systems. The Il-476 features Aviadvigatel PS-90A-76 high-bypass engines each producing a thrust of 35,300 pounds, replacing the less powerful (26,450-pound-thrust) and efficient D-30KPs. The Il-476 also has improved avionics including a glass cockpit. It promises a 10- to 15-percent reduction in fuel burn over the Il-76, and greater payload through an increase in maximum takeoff weight, to 463,000 pounds. The first operable prototype flew on September 22. State acceptance trials should commence in 2014 with two production aircraft.
The already controversial issue of the European migrant crisis has worsened as countries face the problem of granting asylum to girls who got married in Syria but fall below the age of consent in their adopted country.
The issue of Syrian child brides has been highlighted in the Netherlands by the disappearance of a nine-month pregnant 14 year old girl and their 24 year old husband, reports The Independent. Fatema Alkasem had been staying in the Ter Apel asylum centre before they left on 31 August and police fear they may require medical care.
Dutch asylum centres are reported to be housing 20 child brides between the ages of 13 and 15. On average three a week now arrive in the country, reports Die Welt, with at least 34 underage wives seeking asylum last year (according to leaked official papers). Twenty-two girls wanted to enter the Netherlands via ‘family reunification' – with two being 13 years old and another two only 14.
They have been given legal permission to join their older partners as the country recognises marriages involving young teenagers if officially registered in their country of origin. Some argue such recognition condones pedophilia as the age of sexual consent in the Netherlands is 16.
By way of contrast, since 2012 Switzerland has refused to recognise child marriage. In Germany child brides are treated as unaccompanied minors and provisionally cared for by the Youth Welfare Office. During asylum processing they can apply for marriage recognition, but that is a decision taken depending on individual circumstance.
The problem is not limited to the small number who made it to Europe. Save the Children has also witnessed an “alarming increase” in the number of Syrian child brides within refugee communities in Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon.
The Dutch government is now amending family laws, effective from December, so reunification applications only recognise marriages when both partners are at least 18 years old.
The Dutch Labour MP, Attje Kuiken, told the BBC:
“A 12-year-old girl with a 40-year-old-man – that is not a marriage, that is abuse. We're talking about really young children, girls 12, 13 years old. I want to protect these children. The government should take them into foster care and protect them, because before the new law comes into force, they can still be subject to abuse.”
Monika Michell, spokesperson on honour based violence for women's rights organisation Terre des Femmes, is even more stark in their condemnation of child marriage. They say that although each girl experiences it differently the consequences can be devastating, leading them to conclude:
“Forced marriage is a continuous rape.”
Colorado will be ready in late September to announce a major “transformational” long-range plan that would upgrade the school's sports facilities and be a 50- to 100-year solution to challenges faced by the athletics department and the campus as a whole, CU athletics director Mike Bohn told reporters Tuesday.
Bohn did not reveal a priority list of proposed improvements but acknowledged that football coaches have been telling prospective recruits this spring that the construction of an indoor football practice facility is in the planning stages.
A year-long “extensive” review of Colorado's athletics facilities has targeted needed improvements to Folsom Field, the interior of the Coors Events Center and to “areas around the stadium,” Bohn said.
Bohn declined to offer specifics. But it's no secret that the indoor football practice facility likely would be located immediately northeast of Folsom Field along Stadium Drive. The indoor facility could be used by other sports.
Other proposed facility improvements include an expansion of the student recreational center (including the addition of an ice rink); upgrading 75-year-old Balch Fieldhouse; and expanding the Dal Ward Center athletics building north of the stadium.
The Dal Ward expansion could provide additional office space, a dedicated academic and life-skills area for student-athletes, and more room for medical and weight-training needs.
What will all this cost? Bohn said they could not provide an answer. They said the university and athletics department is engaged in a feasibility study of proposed improvements with the CU Foundation. The foundation raises and manages private funds for university development.
“It's not a dream,” Bohn said. “How much money do we think we can raise? How does it take to fit into the formula of what we're working on? Those are not easy answers.
“It takes time. It is extremely complex. So we don't want to just come up with an empty promise,” they added. “We're working really hard. We're going to come up with a plan that has gone through every step in the process. We want to be agile to see what we can afford.”
Bohn said university leaders are on board with the feasibility study because upgrades to sports facilities could free up space for additional non-athletics improvements such as lecture halls, classrooms and faculty offices.
Presently, several athletics-related offices are scattered inside the football stadium. Confining those offices to an expanded Dal Ward Center would provide options in and around the stadium for academic use.
“We believe the stadium (area) footprint is a potential solution to campus-wide challenges in a big way,” Bohn said.
This is an ambitious project, one that would take an unprecedented amount of private donations. Colorado lacks a billionaire sugar daddy such as Nike's Phil Knight with Oregon or oil man T. Boone Pickens with Oklahoma State. Bohn said in its history Colorado has received only seven donations of $1 million or more. But Colorado's move to the Pac-12 Conference has opened the doors to tens of thousands of CU alumni living on the West Coast who now may be willing to reach into their pockets.
“It's a bonanza,” Bohn said of Colorado joining the Pac-12.
To take advantage, and to tap into other resources, Colorado is adding a senior-level chief marketing officer who will oversee a marketing department that continues to expand.
“It's important that we grow and establish our brand,” Bohn said. “That's how we can make this happen.”

If anyone still doubts that they're potentially being watched online by the U.S. intelligence services, or that those agencies share information with countries that are not supposed to be spying on their own citizens, say hello to a 28-year-old German man named Daniel Bangert.
Bangert made a joke on Facebook(s fb), setting up an event for an NSA spy-spotting walk around the so-called Dagger Complex, a U.S. military installation near Griesheim, south of Frankfurt. The event was described humorously in the terms you might associate with a nature stroll, referring to “the threatened habitat of NSA spies” and so on.
Advertisement
Four days later, the German police showed up on Bangert's doorstep to question them about their putative “demonstration” and apparently non-existent anarchist links. They denied having any such links or planning any kind of demonstration, but the police told them to get a permit nonetheless. They asked them not to tell anyone online about their visit.
That clearly didn't work. After the story got reported by a local paper, it eventually made its way to Der Spiegel, which got confirmation from a police spokesperson that the alarm had been raised by the U.S. Military Police. It seems the U.S. Military Police found Bangert's Facebook post and alerted the local authorities — hence the visits to their house.
In the end, the interest raised by the story led 70 people to join Bangert's “NSA safari”, although they apparently didn't see any spies in their natural habitat.
It's a story that's both funny and disturbing. Unless he's just pulled off a brilliant double-cross with the media, Bangert is not a terrorist — he's just an ordinary chap who was being sarcastic online. And even if they were being serious, all they were doing was threatening to go for a walk around the perimeter of a so-called top secret facility that's not actually top secret.
Honestly, if the police hadn't fessed up I'd think this story had been concocted as a viral case study for the anti-PRISM campaign. But it wasn't.

Because apparently no one has told Universal that every movie is coming out in 2015, the studio has decided to push back their Despicable Me spin-off, Minions, from Dec. 19, 2014 to July 10, 2015.
The new release date will place Minions between the release of Independence Day 2 on July 3 and Zack Snyder's Batman vs. Superman film on July 17.
Minions will be a prequel to the Despicable Me franchise and as the title implies, will follow the history of Gru's helpers the Minions. Along with the return of Steve Carell as Gru, Minions will also star Sandra Bullock and Jon Hamm as a married super-villain team, Scarlett and Herb Overkill.
Despicable Me 2, released this summer, has earned $360 million dollars so far in the U.S. alone, to make it the second highest grossing film of 2013. The Despicable Me franchise has made over 1.3 billion dollars worldwide with only two films.
The Trump campaign has filed an objection to Green Party candidate Jill Stein's recount request in Michigan.
The state's “voters should not risk having the Electoral College door knocked off its hinges all because a 1% candidate is dissatisfied with the election's outcome,” reads the objection, according to the Detroit Free Press.
“Given their tiny vote total, (Green Party presidential candidate Jill) Stein does not and could not possibly allege a good faith belief that they may have won the state of Michigan,” the objection states.
The recount, scheduled to start Friday, is partly funded by Stein.
It has now been delayed until next week, a potentially big deal since the final tally has to be completed by Dec. 13 under federal regulations.
The Green Party candidate is obligated to fork over $973,250 to help pay for the recount, which is also being supported by the campaign of Hillary Clinton.
Trump won the state by a 10,704-vote margin out of 4.8 million cast.
Stein received 51,463 ballots, or 1.1 percent of the vote.
A spokesperson for the Clinton campaign did not explain how it planned to support the effort, though a sign-up sheet on the its website is seeking volunteers.
The BCB has made an appeal to the ICC to reconsider Taskin Ahmed's suspension from bowling in international cricket. The communication was made personally by the BCB president Nazmul Hassan, who said that they spoke to the ICC chairperson Shashank Manohar and chief executive Dave Richardson.
While Hassan did not reveal what the BCB's main argument was, they said they were not convinced with the ICC's independent assessment report on Taskin's bowling action.
"We are not convinced about Taskin as of now. We don't have any reason to be satisfied with the report," they said. "And that's disappointing, so we have appealed to the ICC. We have a few grounds and we have said these things according to logic. Only the ICC can withdraw the ICC's decision, which is why I am talking to the ICC directly. It won't be right to disclose what we presented as our logic. I can tell you that we have done everything possible."
Hassan said the BCB was trying to circumvent the normal procedure of appealing in a bid to quickly overturn the decision made on Taskin. The ICC had said on Saturday that "not all of Taskin's deliveries were legal".
"The promptness with which we have taken the action is quite different to the way we responded to the others," Hassan said. "I read the [ICC's independent assessment] report today morning and instantly called the ICC CEO Dave Richardson and chairperson Shashank Manohar, who said they will respond to us after talking to their legal team.
"We are trying to do something outside the normal procedure where the player requests a reassessment, which we feel is a complex process. I don't think we can do anything more that what we have done. I believe that the ICC will observe our points and give a logical reply."
Hassan also ruled out the possibility of taking the legal route against the ICC, which they feel will be too lengthy and would not give Bangladesh what they are looking for - a quick return for Taskin.
"If we take the legal way, then we can forget Taskin playing in the World T20. I don't think it will be solved any time in the future. It would be a lengthy procedure but as of now I am trying to avoid that way, and trying to see if something can be done immediately through a shortcut. It's very difficult, but I have not left hope as yet. I feel that there is a slight possibility for Taskin to join us as soon as possible.
"We have never heard or seen a decision getting immediately changed by the ICC but regarding Taskin even if that happens, I won't be amazed. I am hopeful."
Though the ICC has never lifted a suspension on a bowler at such a short notice, they did lift a ban on Shoaib Akhtar within 11 days in 2000. Akhtar was banned on December 30, 1999, but 10 days later, they played for Pakistan in an ODI against Australia in Brisbane, arriving a few hours after the match had started, having been in Perth when the ICC had taken the decision.

Haunting pictures have revealed the decaying remains of a 39-acre college that was first founded to educate freed slaves. Eerie images from the science laboratory show animal skeletons and a taxidermy pheasant scattered on worktops, mountains of glass tubes dumped on the floor and globes left on desks. Other shots show books lined up on shelves and an assembly hall with collapsing stage. The spooky photographs were taken at an abandoned college in south-eastern USA by a photographer known only as Abandoned Southeast using a Canon DSLR camera equipped with Tamron lens.
The Dead College was a private, four-year, liberal arts institution founded in 1875 as part of a missionary effort to educate freed slaves according to the photographers website. The campus is comprised of 17 buildings that are scattered along the hillside.
Prior to its founding, the site was the location of a Confederate battery during the Civil War. Students would construct most of the buildings on campus and even had to build the bricks from scratch.
(CNN) The highest-ranking officer charged in connection with Freddie Gray's death has chosen a trial by judge -- the same judge who acquitted two of their co-defendants.
Baltimore police Lt. Brian Rice was one of the three bicycle officers who encountered Gray on April 12, 2015. Shortly thereafter, Gray suffered a fatal spinal cord injury while in police custody
Sgt. Alicia White was present during one of the stops to check on Gray's condition. They and two other officers saw Gray unresponsive on the floor of the van, and when White spoke to Gray and they did not respond, they allegedly did nothing to help him, prosecutors said. All charges were dropped against White, who had been indicted on charges of involuntary manslaughter, second-degree negligent assault, misconduct in office and reckless endangerment.

Garrett Miller was another one of the bike officers involved in Gray's arrest. They placed Gray in a restraining technique known as a "leg lace" before Gray was placed in the van, said Marilyn Mosby, the state's attorney for Baltimore. All charges were dropped against Miller, who had been indicted on charges of second-degree intentional assault, two counts of misconduct in office and reckless endangerment.

was the first of the six officers to face a trial. It ended in a mistrial in December, and they had been scheduled to be retried before prosecutors dropped the charges against him. Porter was summoned by the van's driver to check on Gray during stops on the way to a police station. Prosecutors said Porter should have called a medic for Gray sooner than one was eventually called, and they said they also should have ensured that Gray was wearing a seat belt. Porter had been charged with involuntary manslaughter, second-degree assault, reckless endangerment and misconduct in office.

Six Baltimore police officers were charged in the April 2015 death of Freddie Gray, who died of a severe spinal-cord injury while in police custody. But there were no convictions in the case. Three of the officers were acquitted before prosecutors dropped the charges against the remaining three in July 2016 . Seen here is, who was part of the bike patrol that arrested Gray. On July 18, 2016, Rice was found not guilty of involuntary manslaughter, reckless endangerment and misconduct in office in connection with Gray's arrest and death.
Also Tuesday, Judge Barry Williams denied a motion by Rice's attorneys to dismiss the indictment, paving the way for the trial's opening statements to begin Thursday morning.
Rice faces several charges, including:
- Involuntary manslaughter
- Second-degree reckless assault/reckless endangerment
- One count of misconduct in office for allegedly arresting Gray without probable cause
- One count of misconduct in office for failing to secure Gray with a seat belt inside a police vehicle.

Of the six officers charged, Goodson faced the most serious charges -- including second-degree depraved heart murder. Legal experts have said Goodson's acquittal could set the tone for the four officers still awaiting trial.
"It does not bode well for prosecution," CNN legal analyst Danny Cevallos said.
Williams' verdict in Goodson's case "sends a message to the public and to the courts and the prosecution that if you can't convict beyond a reasonable doubt as to a high charge like murder, what does it say about lesser crimes?"
Students applying after the May 1 deadline need to submit applications as soon as possible, admissions officers say. (Blend Images - Jade/ Getty Images)
It's not too late to get into a four-year university this year – but students will have to act fast.
More than 220 public and private colleges and universities are still accepting applications for the fall 2015 semester, according to the National Association for College Admission Counseling's annual College Openings Update.​
The list, released Wednesday, shows which of the organization's member institutions still have space for freshmen and transfers following the May 1 national response date for college acceptances. ​
Many schools on the list are small, private institutions, but there are still spots available at large state institutions like Bowling Green State University and Illinois State University.
The amount of space available and how long applications will be open to students varies by school. Students interested in applying now need to move quickly​, but should be careful not to sacrifice accuracy. Colleges are looking for strong applicants who meet their requirements for acceptance.
"It's the same sort of process. We're going to look for the same things and I would hope that they would give that same sort of effort applying to Illinois State University this late in the game," says Jeff Mavros, director of admissions for the university.
Many students who apply after May 1 weren't accepted into their top-choice institutions.
It also helps for students to make sure they have all of their supporting documentation ready when they're applying to institutions, which includes official test scores and high school transcripts, says Cecilia Castellano, director of admissions at Bowling Green State University.
Housing and financial aid are other reasons for students to move fast. Bowling Green State University will continue to accept students until they fill their housing capacity. Once housing is full, only local students who can commute will be accepted.
Students can look online to see if schools are still accepting applications. They should also call the school to speak with an admissions officer and learn about what options are still available. An admissions officer should be able to connect the student with financial aid to let them know what sort of institutional and merit aid is still available, if any.
"At this point it just becomes a matter of taking care of your business quickly. The sooner you make the decision to start the process, then you can get your admissions offer, you can start your financial aid process and then you can see what else you need to do," says Castellano.

On September 12, 1654 the first Rosh Hashanah services in the North America were held in New Amsterdam.
That's right we're headed back to the Stuyvesant administration for this week's column. Although Stuyvesant's heavy hand kept New Amsterdam on the historic map, they also had a darker side: bigoted xenophobia to be exact. They didn't like the native populations of the area, they didn't like Catholics and they certainly didn't like Jews. It must have horrified them to hear the reputed 18 languages spoken on the streets of New Amsterdam in the year 1654. In fact the Dutch were a minority in their own city.
You could imagine Peg Leg Pete's double horror when a ship of 23 Sephardic Jews escaping the Portuguese Inquisition in Pernambuco (now Recife) Brazil sailed into New Amsterdam looking to lay down roots. For Stuyvesant, the trouble actually started on August 22 when a Dutch ship called the Pereboom (Pear Tree) brought an Akskenazi man by the name of Jacob bar Simon into New Amsterdam. Stuyvesant couldn't draft the petition fast enough to order the expulsion of all Jews from their colony. They pleaded with the Dutch West India Company that “none of the Jewish nation be permitted to infest New Netherland.”
The base of a flag pole on Peter Minuet Plaza erected in 1954 to commemorate the first Jewish community in the North America. Also a stop on Untapped Cities' Remnants of Dutch New Amsterdam: Tracing the Castello Plan Tour.
The group of Sephardic refugees quickly sent a counter petition asking Stuyvesant's superiors, “That your Honors be pleased not to exclude but grant the Jewish nation passage to and residence in that country; otherwise this would result in a great prejudice to their reputation.” They went on to ask that “the Jewish nation be permitted to travel, live and traffic there, and enjoy liberty on condition of contributing like others.”
Stuyvesant, thinking they had this request in the bag, was thrice horrified to find that their petition was thrown out by the home office. They chided their Director General reminding them that they were running a company town not a “city on the hill” like those Puritanical killjoys to the north. They told them that no one should be turned away because of their religious beliefs. Also quite a few investors in the Dutch West India company were wealthy Jewish men…so there was that to consider as well.
The corner of Broad Street and South William where it was said the first North American Rosh Hashanah took place in a private home. Shearith Israel's first temple would go on to be located on South William until the 1700's. Today the International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT) Building sits on the site.
In a later company policy stemming from Stuyvesant's petition, the Dutch West India built the foundation for New York's tradition of multicultural tolerance:
“The consciences of men ought to be free and unshackled, so long as they continue moderate, peaceable, inoffensive and not hostile government. Such have been the maxims of toleration by which this city has been governed; and the result has been, that the oppressed and persecuted from every country have found among us asylum from distress. Follow in the same footsteps and you shall be blessed.”
On September 12, 1654, amid the dueling petitions, a Rosh Hashanah service was held in a private house on the corner of Broad and Mill Street (now South William Street). It was the start of Shearith Israel (Remnant of Israel). It was the only Jewish congregation in New York until 1825 and is the oldest existing Jewish congregation in the North America.

Although Shearith Israel's temple is now up on Central Park West, there a few traces of the historic congregation downtown including a commemorative flag pole in Peter Minuet Plaza and the burial ground of those 23 founding Shearith Israel members now locked away and all but forgotten on St. Jame's Place and Oliver Street.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 closing at a record as concerns about a confrontation between Russia and Ukraine eased, and the market recovered more than all of the previous session's hefty losses.
President Vladimir Putin delivered a robust defense of Russia's actions in Crimea on Tuesday, saying they would use force in Ukraine only as a last resort. Their comments relieved investors' fears that East-West tension over the former Soviet republic could lead to war.
The day's gains followed Wall Street's worst day in a month, when investors sold stocks and other risky assets as tensions escalated between Ukraine and Russia. Global stocks rebounded on Tuesday while gold, the Japanese yen and Treasuries prices fell. Crude oil prices, up more than 2 percent on Monday, reversed some of that session's gain in trading on Tuesday.
“Monday's selling and Tuesday's stark reversal have become commonplace in traders' calendars in 2014,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief market analyst at Interactive Brokers LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut.
“Investors have clearly got an appetite for equities displaying strong momentum, no matter whether geopolitical risks or fears for the health of the recovery stand in their path.”
The CBOE Volatility Index .VIX, Wall Street's fear barometer, slid 11.9 percent to end at 14.10 on Tuesday. That was a sharp reversal from Monday, when the VIX rose 14 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI jumped 227.85 points or 1.41 percent, to end at 16,395.88. The S&P 500 .SPX gained 28.18 points or 1.53 percent, to finish at 1,873.91. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC climbed 74.671 points or 1.75 percent, to close at 4,351.972.
The S&P 500 ended at a record high for the second time since Friday, when the broad index finished February with a milestone. In Tuesday's session, industrials and financials ranked among the biggest gainers. The benchmark index is up 1.4 percent for the year.
The Wilshire 5000 Index .W5000 closed above 20,000 for the first time. The index has gained 193.55 percent or $15.9 trillion from its low on March 9, 2009, after the financial crisis.
“The longer-term trend of the U.S. equity indexes remains positive,” but short-term indicators “remain overbought and are peaking as most indexes rally back to resistance at their 2014 highs,” said Robert Sluymer, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, LLC in New York.
Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) shares hit a record intraday high after reaching a deal with Dish Network (DISH.O) that lets the No. 2 satellite TV provider carry Disney-owned networks such as ABC and ESPN, and deliver the content outside of a traditional TV subscription. Disney shares rose 2.8 percent to close at $81.71, after hitting an all-time intraday high of $82.17.
Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) rose 3.4 percent to end at $76.11, off an all-time intraday high of $76.79 reached on Tuesday. The world's biggest cellphone chipmaker raised its stock-buyback authorization by $5 billion to $7.8 billion, and increased its cash dividend by 20 percent.

When e-cigs were first introduced into the world as a viable alternative to cigarettes one of the biggest selling points that I remember is that you could do it indoors. And while we don't yet know what, if any, effects second-hand vapor has on people, being able to enjoy your nicotine inside is great. But there's a caveat, don't be an asshole!
When my wife and I bought our first home I was still a smoker, but we knew that we wouldn't be allowing cigarette smoke inside our luxurious new dwelling. It lingers, it stains, and ashes will inevitably end up getting flown around and making a mess. When I made the switch to vaping one of the main reasons I did it was so that I didn't have to go out in the freezing weather to enjoy my nicotine. Even if someone around you doesn't enjoy the smell of the particular juice you are vaping it will dissipate and you won't be left with any of the nasty residue that is left by conventional cigarettes. As an HVAC tech, I am constantly walking into customer's houses who smoke, and the smell is overwhelming, especially now that I have been reformed.
Here is where we come to our crossroad: with great vaping comes great responsibility. My motto on vaping in public places goes as follows, “When in doubt, don't do it.” There have been many advances in electronic cigarettes just in the past year alone, and blowing huge clouds inside the movie theater, while others are trying to watch a movie they just paid $15 to see, is rude and inconsiderate, it's that simple. The “It's not smoking, I'll do what I want” crowd is embarrassing to our community and give a bad name to those of us responsible vapers.
I deal with vaping in public establishments a couple different ways. If I'm in a bar environment I will probably vape stealthily, and try not to exhale near, or in anyone's face. If I am approached by an employee about said vaping I just apologize and stop. Most bars used to let you smoke inside of them anyway, so I feel that vaping probably isn't going to ruffle any feathers. Now, If I'm in a restaurant, that has a bar ambiance to it, I will most likely ask an employee what their vaping policy is. Some places are cool with it, some aren't. But if they are, this by no means gives a vaper the right to start blowing gigantic clouds and be obnoxious about it. Respect the fact that these places are cool with vaping and don't abuse the privilege. Movie theaters, fancy restaurants, and establishments that are kid friendly? Just don't do it, period. And finally, there's vaping in a non-vaper/non-smoker's house. Just ask. If you don't ask before you fire up your mod in someone's house you're a dick and that's all there is to it.
When you make the decision to kick the sticks and switch to vaping you are also making the decision to represent a growing community of people trying to dispel the ridiculous scrutiny we have recently been getting in the media. Please don't mess it up for everyone else. When in doubt, just treat vaping like smoking. If you don't feel like it's an appropriate time or place to vape, don't do it.
Stay tuned…

Watch out, aspiring game designers; a computer may be coming for your job, too.
Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology will present research this week at the Foundations of Digital Games Conference about a new artificial intelligence system that analyzes a preexisting videogame, learning its rules, then procedurally generates new game levels that follow those same rules.
How it learns those rules is the crazy part: Like today's children, the AI just sits and watches YouTube videos of people playing the game in question. Through analysis of, for example, Shigeru Miyamoto's hand-crafted levels in Super Mario Bros., it begins to learn the basic rules of Mario level design: Treetops are placed on top of trunks. Gaps must only be so wide, so that Mario can leap over them successfully. Octopus enemies go underwater, Goombas go on the ground.
Georgia Institute of Technology
Super Mario Bros., the 1985 Nintendo Entertainment System game, was chosen for this presentation, but the system can also be applied to "similar" games. When the system watches the YouTube (or Twitch, or any sort of) videos, it pays particular attention to the areas of the game that the players spend the most time in—the researchers' assumption here is that these so-called "high interaction" portions of the levels are the richest for data mining about the game's design rules.
"An initial evaluation of our approach indicates an ability to produce level sections that are both playable and close to the original without hand coding any design criteria," said Matthew Guzdial, the project's lead researcher, in a blog post Wednesday. The levels that are generated, Georgia Tech said, do not appear to players to be random. The next step in the research, it said, will be to analyze how players actually play when they get into these computer-generated Mario levels, comparing it to how they interact within the hand-crafted levels of the original game.
Yeah. Those numbers are real.
A total of 111 people were killed by police in the United States in March of 2015. Since 1900, in the entire United Kingdom, 52 people have been killed by police.
Don't bother adjusting for population differences, or poverty, or mental illness, or anything else. The sheer fact that American police kill TWICE as many people per month as police have killed in the modern history of the United Kingdom is sick, preposterous, and alarming.
In March:
Police beat Phillip White to death in New Jersey. They were unarmed.
Police shot and killed Meagan Hockaday, a 26-year-old mother of three.
Police shot and killed Nicholas Thomas, an unarmed man on their job at Goodyear in metro Atlanta.
Police shot and killed Anthony Hill, an unarmed war veteran fighting through mental illness, in metro Atlanta.
I could tell 107 more of those stories.
This has to end.
Updated 2020 Reapportionment Projections
Geoffrey Skelley, Associate Editor, Sabato's Crystal Ball
At the end of 2014, the Census Bureau released its 2014 population estimates. This provides new fodder for political geeks when looking ahead to the 2020 census and its major political impact: congressional reapportionment.
Unfortunately, the Census Bureau doesn't release state-level population projections anymore, just national estimates up to the year 2060, leaving it to others to extrapolate where the 50 states will be on April 1, 2020. The well-regarded firm Election Data Services — you may have seen some of their big election maps — put together a set of projections and found that, if trends continue, somewhere between 14 and 17 states may gain or lose U.S. House seats after the 2020 census, as shown below in Map 1.
Map 1: Potential reapportionment change projections for 2020
Source: Election Data Services
Based on EDS's projections, California (+1), Colorado (+1), Florida (+1), North Carolina (+1), and Texas (+3) are in line to gain at least one seat. In some cases, EDS found that Arizona, Oregon, and/or Virginia may also pick up an additional seat.
On the other side of the ledger, Alabama (-1), Illinois (-1), Michigan (-1), Minnesota (-1), Ohio (-1), Pennsylvania (-1), Rhode Island (-1), and West Virginia (-1) are positioned to lose a seat, and in at least one projection New York also lost one.
These changes are a broad continuation of the same patterns we have seen over the last few decades. States in the South and West, mainly in the Sun Belt, continue to see larger increases in population relative to states in the Northeast and Midwest. As a result, successive reapportionments keep shifting more and more seats to Southern and Western states at the expense of Northeastern and Midwestern states, as a Crystal Ball analysis from last year explored.
The gains or losses are worth exploring. The biggest winner for the second straight cycle will probably be Texas, with projections showing it likely to gain three seats after it gained four following the 2010 census. Should it gain three, the Lone Star State will have 39 House members, consolidating its position as the second-largest state in the U.S. Looking further ahead, if it gains at least one more seat after the 2030 census — a seemingly likely outcome given recent trends — the country will have two states, California and Texas, with 40 or more representatives in Congress for the first time in its history, though the 435-seat House has only existed since 1910. Having two 40-plus states almost happened after the 1970 reapportionment but just missed: While California crossed the 40-seat threshold to 43 seats, New York fell from 41 to 39.
Until 2010, California had gained at least one seat in every reapportionment since it became a state in 1850, but the latest estimates suggest that it may again add a seat after 2020. In December 2014, the Census Bureau announced that Florida had surpassed New York to become the third-largest state in the union. It appears that after 2020, the size of the Sunshine State's House delegation and its influence in the Electoral College will reflect that status as it will move ahead of New York by one, maybe two seats and electoral votes. The Empire State has actually lost seats in every reapportionment since 1950, falling all the way from 45 seats after 1940 to its current 27. It may well lose another seat after 2020, though it will probably be a borderline case.
A seeming outlier in the geographical trend is Alabama, which may lose a seat in 2020 despite being a Southern state. However, growth in the South has been very geographically inconsistent, with states like Florida and Texas accounting for most of the region's gains over the last few decades while the rest of the South's gains and losses have largely evened out. Elsewhere, the Midwest and Rust Belt look likely to continue their downward trend. Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania are all set to probably lose one seat each; the last time that quartet didn't each lose at least one seat in reapportionment was 1970, when both Illinois and Michigan preserved the 1960 status quo.
The two smallest states in this discussion, Rhode Island and West Virginia, may see their House delegations shrink after 2020. In the initial apportionment of 1789, the Ocean State had only one seat, but after the 1790 census, it moved to two seats. Except for a 20-year stint with three seats from 1910 to 1930, it has had two seats for almost its entire history. However, the state looks in danger of dropping to the ranks of the one-seat states, and if it does, Rhode Island will become the eighth state with just one representative in the House, a new all-time high. Meanwhile, the Mountain State looks like a fairly safe bet to see its delegation fall from three members to just two: It is the only state that saw negative growth between 2010 and 2014, based on the Census Bureau estimates.
These changes will have many consequences. Last year, from projections based on the 2013 estimates, the Crystal Ball's Kyle Kondik took a look at the future shape of the House, and most of those observations remain true in the face of new numbers one year later. Dave Wasserman of Cook Political Report recently explored (paywall) the House picture as well, including some hypothesizing about where new districts might go.
As for the impact on the Electoral College, the two major parties' bedrock states, California for Democrats and Texas for Republicans, both stand to gain electoral votes, particularly the latter. Recently competitive states such as Colorado, Florida, and North Carolina are all positioned to gain, raising the stakes even further in those places. Meanwhile, the historically key swing state of Ohio will see its position further reduced, and if Virginia gains a seat, the two swing states will be closer in electoral vote strength (from Ohio having an 18-13 edge to just 17-14). Other potentially competitive states such as Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania are positioned to lose an electoral vote.
Obviously, the next census is still over five years away, so these estimates could still be off to some degree. But projections only get more certain as we get closer to 2020, and yet again there will be winners and losers in the reapportionment process. Changes in the level of representation for different states and in their relative strengths in the Electoral College will, as always, be politically consequential.
The Third Amendment (Amendment III) to the United States Constitution places restrictions on the quartering of soldiers in private homes without the owner's consent, forbidding the practice in peacetime. The amendment is a response to Quartering Acts passed by the British parliament during the buildup to the American Revolutionary War, which had allowed the British Army to lodge soldiers in private residences.
The Third Amendment was introduced in Congress in 1789 by James Madison as a part of the United States Bill of Rights, in response to Anti-Federalist objections to the new Constitution. Congress proposed the amendment to the states on September 28, 1789, and by December 15, 1791, the necessary three-quarters of the states had ratified it. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the amendment on March 1, 1792.
The amendment is one of the least controversial of the Constitution and is rarely litigated, with the American Bar Association calling it the "runt piglet" of the U.S. Constitution.[1] To date, it has never been the primary basis of a Supreme Court decision,[2][3][4] though it was the basis of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit case Engblom v. Carey.
Text [ edit ]
The amendment as proposed by Congress in 1789 reads as follows:
No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.[5]
The hand-written copy of the proposed Bill of Rights, 1789, cropped to just show the text that would later be ratified as the Third Amendment
Background [ edit ]
In 1765, the British parliament enacted the first of the Quartering Acts,[6] requiring the American colonies to pay the costs of British soldiers serving in the colonies, and requiring that if the local barracks provided insufficient space, that the colonists lodge the troops in alehouses, inns, and livery stables. After the Boston Tea Party, the Quartering Act of 1774 was enacted. One of the Intolerable Acts that pushed the colonies toward revolution, it authorized British troops to be housed wherever necessary, including in private homes.[7] The quartering of troops was cited as one of the colonists' grievances in the United States Declaration of Independence.[3]
Adoption [ edit ]
After several years of comparatively weak government under the Articles of Confederation, a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia proposed a new constitution on September 17, 1787, featuring a stronger chief executive and other changes. George Mason, a Constitutional Convention delegate and the drafter of Virginia's Declaration of Rights, proposed that a bill of rights listing and guaranteeing civil liberties be included. Other delegates—including future Bill of Rights drafter James Madison—disagreed, arguing that existing state guarantees of civil liberties were sufficient and that any attempt to enumerate individual rights risked the implication that other, unnamed rights were unprotected. After a brief debate, Mason's proposal was defeated by a unanimous vote of the state delegations.[8]
For the constitution to be ratified, however, nine of the thirteen states were required to approve it in state conventions. Opposition to ratification ("Anti-Federalism") was partly based on the Constitution's lack of adequate guarantees for civil liberties. Supporters of the Constitution in states where popular sentiment was against ratification (including Virginia, Massachusetts, and New York) successfully proposed that their state conventions both ratify the Constitution and call for the addition of a bill of rights. Several state conventions specifically proposed a provision against the quartering of troops in private homes.[3] At the 1788 Virginia Ratifying Convention, Patrick Henry stated, "One of our first complaints, under the former government, was the quartering of troops among us. This was one of the principal reasons for dissolving the connection with Great Britain. Here we may have troops in time of peace. They may be billeted in any manner — to tyrannize, oppress, and crush us."[7]
Proposal and ratification [ edit ]
In the 1st United States Congress, following the state legislatures' request, James Madison proposed twenty constitutional amendments based on state bills of rights and English sources such as the Bill of Rights 1689; one of these was a prohibition against quartering troops in private homes. Several revisions to the future Third Amendment were proposed in Congress, which chiefly differed in the way in which peace and war were distinguished (including the possibility of a situation, such as unrest, which was neither peace nor war), and whether the executive or the legislature would have the authority to authorize quartering.[9] However, the amendment ultimately passed Congress almost unchanged and by unanimous vote.[3] Congress reduced Madison's proposed twenty amendments to twelve, and these were submitted to the states for ratification on September 25, 1789.[10]
By the time the Bill of Rights was submitted to the states for ratification, opinions had shifted in both parties. Many Federalists, who had previously opposed a Bill of Rights, now supported the Bill as a means of silencing the Anti-Federalists' most effective criticism. Many Anti-Federalists, in contrast, now opposed it, realizing that the Bill's adoption would greatly lessen the chances of a second constitutional convention, which they desired.[11] Anti-Federalists such as Richard Henry Lee also argued that the Bill left the most objectionable portions of the Constitution, such as the federal judiciary and direct taxation, intact.[12]
On November 20, 1789, New Jersey ratified eleven of the twelve amendments, rejecting Article II, which regulated Congressional pay raises. On December 19 and 22, respectively, Maryland and North Carolina ratified all twelve amendments.[13] On January 19, 25, and 28, 1790, respectively, South Carolina, New Hampshire, and Delaware ratified the Bill, though New Hampshire rejected the amendment on Congressional pay raises, and Delaware rejected Article I, which regulated the size of the House.[13] This brought the total of ratifying states to six of the required ten, but the process stalled in other states: Connecticut and Georgia found a Bill of Rights unnecessary and so refused to ratify, while Massachusetts ratified most of the amendments, but failed to send official notice to the Secretary of State that it had done so.[12][a]
In February through June 1790, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island ratified eleven of the amendments, though all three rejected the amendment on Congressional pay raises. Virginia initially postponed its debate, but after Vermont was admitted to the Union in 1791, the total number of states needed for ratification rose to eleven. Vermont ratified on November 3, 1791, approving all twelve amendments, and Virginia finally followed on December 15, 1791.[12] Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the ten successfully ratified amendments on March 1, 1792.[14]
Judicial interpretation [ edit ]
The Third Amendment is among the least cited sections of the U.S. Constitution.[15] In the words of Encyclopædia Britannica, "as the history of the country progressed with little conflict on American soil, the amendment has had little occasion to be invoked."[16] To date, no major Supreme Court decision has used the amendment as its primary basis.[3][4]
The Third Amendment has been invoked in a few instances as helping establish an implicit right to privacy in the Constitution.[17] Justice William O. Douglas used the amendment along with others in the Bill of Rights as a partial basis for the majority decision in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965),[18] which cited the Third Amendment as implying a belief that an individual's home should be free from agents of the state.[17]
In one of the seven opinions in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952), Justice Robert H. Jackson cited the Third Amendment as providing evidence of the Framers' intent to constrain executive power even during wartime:[17]
[t]hat military powers of the Commander in Chief were not to supersede representative government of internal affairs seems obvious from the Constitution and from elementary American history. Time out of mind, and even now in many parts of the world, a military commander can seize private housing to shelter their troops. Not so, however, in the United States, for the Third Amendment says...[E]ven in war time, their seizure of needed military housing must be authorized by Congress.[19]
One of the few times a federal court was asked to invalidate a law or action on Third Amendment grounds was in Engblom v. Carey (1982).[20] In 1979, prison officials in New York organized a strike; they were evicted from their prison facility residences, which were reassigned to members of the National Guard who had temporarily taken their place as prison guards. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled: (1) that the term owner in the Third Amendment includes tenants (paralleling similar cases regarding the Fourth Amendment, governing search and seizure), (2) National Guard troops count as soldiers for the purposes of the Third Amendment, and (3) that the Third Amendment is incorporated (that is, that it applies to the states) by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment.[21] The case was remanded to the district court, which dismissed the case on the grounds that state officials could not have been aware of this interpretation.[22]
In the most recent Third Amendment decision handed down by a federal court, on February 2, 2015, the United States District Court for the District of Nevada held in Mitchell v. City of Henderson that the Third Amendment does not apply to intrusions by municipal police officers as, despite their appearance and equipment, they are not soldiers.[23]
In an earlier case, United States v. Valenzuela (1951),[24] the defendant asked that a federal rent-control law be struck down because it was "the incubator and hatchery of swarms of bureaucrats to be quartered as storm troopers upon the people in violation of Amendment III of the United States Constitution."[25] The court declined their request. Later, in Jones v. United States Secretary of Defense (1972),[26] Army reservists unsuccessfully cited the Third Amendment as justification for refusing to march in a parade. Similar arguments in a variety of contexts have been denied in other cases.[27]

Several unrelated groups of songbirds are called catbirds because of their wailing calls, which resemble a cat's meowing. The genus name Ailuroedus likewise is from the Greek for "cat-singer" or "cat-voiced".[1]
Australasian catbirds are the genera Ailuroedus and the monotypic Scenopooetes. They belong to the bowerbird family (Ptilonorhynchidae) of the basal songbirds:
New World catbirds are two monotypic genera from the mimid family (Mimidae) of the passeridan superfamily Muscicapoidea. Among the Mimidae, they represent independent basal lineages probably closer to the Caribbean thrasher and trembler assemblage than to the mockingbirds and Toxostoma thrashers:[2]
Gray catbird, Dumetella carolinensis
Black catbird, Melanoptila glabrirostris
The Abyssinian catbird (Parophasma galinieri) represents a monotypic genus from Africa. It is tentatively placed in the Old World babbler family (Timaliidae) of the passeridan superfamily Sylvioidea, but possibly closer to the typical warblers of the Sylviidae.

A new batch of sales conversation analysis may suggest that men listen to men more than they listen to women during sales calls.
When men sell to woman buyers, their “talk-to-listen ratio” skyrockets in favor of more talking. They also engage in longer stretches of uninterrupted speaking — something we call “monologues.”
If you know anything about Gong.io, you know that we get our kicks from analyzing anonymized sales conversations with AI so we can publish the data in an effort to bring science to the art of the sales conversation.
Our data science team took their analytical superpowers to a large pool of B2B sales call recordings (all pulled anonymously from similar software-as-a-service companies), picking apart what happens on sales calls with different buyer/seller gender combinations:
Men selling to women
Women to men
Women to women
Men to men
We're here to present the data rather than form conclusions, but the patterns may make you wonder. Either way, it's good to take a lighthearted view of this stuff :)
Do Men “Listen” to Men More Than Women?
When salespersons sell to men, they have pretty close to what we consider the ideal talk-to-listen ratio:
Now let's flip the gender pairing. When men sell to women buyers, their talk ratio is 27% higher than when women sell to men. It's not just an incremental difference; it's a quantum leap:
You might conclude that men are just more chatty than women are (who knows, maybe that's the case). But then, what would explain the (very) low talk-to-listen ratio when men sell to men?
Said another way, men speak 28% less when they are selling men than when they are selling to women. That's the lowest talk-to-listen ratio of all the gender combinations.
The most interesting thing about this data is that men's talk-to-listen ratios are significantly different depending on the gender they're selling to, while women hold a fairly constant talk-to-listen ratio regardless of the gender they're selling to:
Women Sellers:
Men Sellers:
Enough about the talk-to-listen ratio. Let's look at a different data point.
Men “Get On Their Soapbox” When Selling to Women
The next data point may suggest that "mansplaining" is a real thing...
We measured the average monologues by gender combination. By “monologue,” I mean how long a person speaks for an uninterrupted period of time.
When men sold to other men in this dataset, their average monologue was 91 seconds long. When men sold to women, it was 108 seconds long — a full 17 seconds longer on average.
Again, not a small change. It's a sharp behavioral pattern.
Women Have Higher Conversion Rates
Despite (or more likely because of) these behavioral patterns, women — on average — have higher conversion rates than men do (both in terms of securing the next meeting and closing the deal).
While one interpretation of this could be exactly what the title of this article suggests, it could also be interpreted in many other ways. Hey, I'm just here to show the data :)
The only viable way to understand what's going on is to observe live sales calls or listen to sales call recordings while these behaviors are happening. The data simply serve as a barometer to point us in the right direction for qualitative investigation.
For now, write your observations in the comments below, and tag a friend in the comments who may find this interesting.
Two former members of an elite gun unit with the Baltimore Police Department testified Wednesday about the crimes the group committed.
One of the former officers, 34-year-old Momodu Gondo, accepted a plea agreement back in June. Now serving as a government witness, Gondo took the stand Wednesday and talked in detail about how the Gun Trace Task Force operated.
“Did you rob citizens when you executed search warrants,” a prosecutor asked, according to WBAL.
“Yes,” replied Gondo.
“What did you steal?” the prosecutor asked.
“U.S. currency, drugs, firearms,” said Gondo.
“How much did you steal?” asked the prosecutor.
“Over $100,000 probably,” Gondo said.
Gondo, nicknamed “G Money,” and six others were first arrested and indicted back in March. All of them were members of the Gun Trace Task Force, which works to get illegal guns off Baltimore's streets. The men are accused of shaking down citizens for cash, falsifying court documents, and overtime fraud. An eighth officer was arrested and indicted in August.
The men stole money and drugs from citizens during traffic stops, after detaining them, and after falsifying affidavits to obtain search warrants and entering their homes, according to court records. They would turn off body cameras when they needed to, prepare false reports to conceal what they'd stolen, and coach one another on one how to give false testimony.
Gondo is named in a second indictment for a drug dealing conspiracy. Authorities started looking into the group of officers after a Drug Enforcement Administration investigation into Gondo.
In court on Wednesday, they said the head of the gun squad, Sgt. Wayne Jenkins, was completely out of line. “Jenkins was reckless, out of control, putting citizens at risk, overly aggressive. I never saw anything like it,” Gondo said.
They and their partner said they only ever committed crimes while in uniform. “The most I did were robberies while working, never outside of work,” Gondo said.
“Most of our robberies were as police officers, so we weren't too worried about getting caught,” said Jemell Rayam, Gondo's partner who also testified Wednesday.
Imagine you are a financial advisor specializing in female clientele who are navigating the family courts during a divorce. It's a niche market for sure, but it makes sense. There are a lot of divorces and women file the majority of them.
You also know these women are looking to maximize their take. Another plus for you is that many of these women have an all-time low opinion of their husbands, and more than a few are looking for revenge. Feelings can and do go autonomic at times like these, which also works for you.
Now imagine you just need a hook to get more women in the door. And imagine you don't have pesky scruples that interfere with how you get there. That leaves a lot of doors open, including selling women the idea that family courts actually have an anti-woman bias; that men are trending toward abusing family law against women with false accusations and restraining orders and that it is becoming a problem for which women, as a group, need specialized protection.
I know what even a lot of feminists are thinking. I've heard many diehard believers acknowledge the bias against men in courts. They make excuses for it, but they know it is there. Everyone does.
But you can sell anything to the crazy obsessed, to the angry, to the hurt and to the frantically driven to win. Up will be down if it serves their agenda.
Can you imagine it? Good. Now imagine your name is Jeff Landers and you write for Forbes Magazine.
The title of a recent article they wrote says it all. “How Some Men Are Upending Domestic Violence Laws to Scam an Advantage in Divorce.”
In Landers' wildly misleading and disingenuous article sales pitch for their business, they blow past forgivably biased statements found in most advertising and goes straight to the snake oil like it was a cancer cure.
The star of Landers' piece advertisement is a biographical book that centers on a woman, Janie McQueen, who was allegedly the victim of a false allegation as a part of a divorce. Apparently the experience was so disturbing that it prompted them to write the book as a warning to all women about men in family court. Or maybe it was just to make a few bucks. If they saw the worst of family courts they no doubt needs the money.
All this, however, is one woman's story. Instead of checking their facts, Landers uses someone else's anecdote to infer applicability to the general population, or rather the part of the population that is female and divorcing…and solvent enough to need a financial planner.
Presto-change-o, false allegations of abuse in family court now fall into the “women's issues” arena, courtesy of a financial advisor.
Nice to see the Wall Street types haven't gone changing on us.
S.A.V.E. has issued an action e-lert, asking concerned individuals to contact Forbes Magazine and let them know what you think about the Landers article and the willful misrepresentation of reality for commercial purposes that it contains.
Of course I support this action and urge other MRA's to follow suit.
S.A.V.E. has posted about this on their website, including the results of their own professional research on false allegations.
But I also wanted to address one other point that needs some attention in this story. These situations have a way of teaching a larger lesson.
As I said earlier, I have no idea if Janie McQueen was a victim of being abused by their husband through the courts. I certainly know it is possible. I have read of a few other cases where women ended up on the short end of the stick.
It's a bad system. They can't expect it to not backfire from time to time.
But if McQueen really was the victim of a false accusation, and they ended up in jail unfairly, then it happened because no one has been listening to what men's activists have been telling them for years. And they were not listening because it was only happening to men.
Restraining orders are supposed to require probable cause determined under reasonable standards. They are designed to keep people safe from threats. But the prevailing anti-male bias has reduced them to a flimsy hoax issued by every family court in the west in order to favor women during the marital dissolution. Some of them are legitimate, but it is impossible to tell which ones are good or bad because they do not require any substantiation. They are issued when one of the marital partners claims something happened, or claims they are afraid something will happen. This almost always results in a man being forced from their home and children while a woman retains possession of everything.
Blowback was unavoidable. Bigoted systems, like bigotry itself, hurt everyone, not just the people targeted for discrimination. Allowing hollow accusations to pass for credible evidence in a matter so serious that children are taken from parents is an abomination of the courts that has been openly practiced as long as men and children were the only ones getting shafted by it.
Well, those that swim with sharks, eventually get bit. If Ms. McQueen wants to fix the system, male bashing and feeble distortions of the truth are not going to help much.
If your gig is to sell books or get new clients by spreading lies that create fear, then stay the course.
The publishers of Forbes should get a message. Please join me in doing that. Disguising advertising as informed journalism is bad enough. Fear-mongering on the backs of men to make a buck off women during periods of extreme emotion and turmoil is a fall to rock bottom.

Good thing we gave Artem Lobov at least a little credit on last week's show, because The Russo-Irish Hammer really exceeded expectations in their much-maligned main event bout with top featherweight contender Cub Swanson. The two set the UFC record for significant strikes in a featherweight contest, and while Swanson nearly doubled Lobov's accuracy, the SBG fighter still managed to land 123 significant strikes over the course of the fight, more than anyone else Swanson has ever faced. Those sparring sessions with Conor McGregor must be paying off.
Not only do we break down Swanson-Lobov on this week's episode, but we get into the rest of UFC Nashville as well.

Whatever the result on June 8, Conservative MPs will demand changes in the way Theresa May and their inner circle operate.
Bruises are still fresh among candidates who felt the furnace-like fury of traditional Tory voters over the Wobbly Weekend that followed the unveiling of the manifesto and its disastrous dementia tax.
The episode has undermined confidence in what one former minister calls the “committee of three” that pretty well runs the Government: Mrs May and their two co-chiefs of staff, Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy.
“Surely you do not throw something like this up without warning in the middle of an election campaign?” asked the former minister. “Undoubtedly, after the election people will be asking what went well and what went wrong.” In fact the shop flight attendants of Tory MPs — the “Men in Grey Suits” who form the executive of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers — are already expecting to take action.
As soon as Parliament is recalled, the ‘22 will hold its first meeting in an oak-panelled room in the Commons to take stock. The current expectation is that newly elected backbenchers will be asking how on earth the manifesto contained a bombshell policy that “targeted our core voters”.
An executive member said: “We cannot allow a major cock-up like this to go without some precautionary activity.” One name repeatedly cited by candidates, they added, was Mr Timothy, who reportedly changed the draft manifesto to remove a cap on the amount that any individual could pay. That decision meant the final document implied elderly couples could in theory lose many hundreds of thousands of pounds.
A senior ex-minister commented: “Nick Timothy's arrogance has steered us into this extraordinary mess.” The concern is shared by the Men in Grey Suits. “Nick Timothy's name has had far too much exposure,” seethed the executive member. “He should be completely anonymous, in the background. And you know what they say: when officials become the story it is game over.
“If there is to be blood spilled over this, it should be his.”
The manifesto disaster is bound up in the presidential style of the Tory campaign — which appears to have dramatically changed. At the start of the campaign, leaflets and posters focused on Theresa May's name and “her team”, with the word Conservative in the small print.
Yesterday in Wolverhampton, the backdrop boasted “Theresa May and the Conservatives”. An ex-minister mused: “The problem with focusing on one person is it is much harder to deflect blame when things go wrong.”
A Tory spokesperson denied there was any change to the campaign, which still majored on who should negotiate Brexit. They said different posters were used at different times. And a senior minister said it would all turn out Ok: “I think it is one of those campaigns that go through all sorts of things but end up with the number you thought of in the first place.” Mrs May may well get their landslide. But a little slice of their authority over the Tory Party may never be fully recovered.
The Marlins managed to make it through spring training last season relatively unscathed in terms of serious injuries. But barely a week into spring training this year, they could be looking at a major loss to their bullpen.
Manager Don Mattingly confirmed Tuesday that hard-throwing reliever Carter Capps — a contender for the closer's role — underwent a MRI after complaining of soreness in their right elbow.
“[Capps] came up with some elbow soreness the other day so they had an MRI done I believe it was yesterday, and he's seeing our doctor today,” Mattingly said following the team's 5-1 victory Tuesday over the University of Miami.
Mattingly said the film of the MRI was being sent for a second opinion, and that the team should get answer relatively quickly.

“It's concerning any time you have to stop a guy from throwing. But at this point, there's not really much to talk about until we really get down what is going on and where we go from here.
“I'm not sure how quick that will be, but it won't be long.”
Capps didn't pitch the final two months of last season after going on the disabled list with a right elbow sprain. They also went on the DL in 2014 for the same issue.
Capps entered spring training competing with A.J. Ramos for the closer's role — a spot the Marlins figured would help lighten their workload and strain on their right arm.
One source said the Marlins are looking around the league for potential relief help through a trade.
“We have a lot of guys in the pen that can step it up,” Ramos said. “Obviously it makes things easier if Capps is here with us, but there are guys that have been there and we're still in good shape.”
Ramos recorded 32 saves last season after taking over for Steve Cishek.
And while they appear capable of filling the team's closer role again, Ramos said Capps' potential loss would be a blow to the team's bullpen and understood the Marlins' desire to consider Capps for the closer's spot.
“Carter is a big part of our bullpen,” Ramos said. “His stuff is amazing. I don't know the specifics of [his status], but hopefully we get it figured out.”
Last season, Capps led the majors with a whiff rate of 16.84 strikeouts per nine innings. The next highest was then-Cincinnati closer Aroldis Chapman, who averaged 15.74 strikeouts per nine.
Mattingly said earlier in the spring that using Capps as the closer in the ninth could reduce the wear on their arm.
Capps has not consistently closed since 2012 when they were in the minors due to the elbow issues. That season as a member of the Seattle Mariners' Double A and Triple A squads, Capps recorded 19 saves in 21 opportunities, and posted 75 strikeouts in 51 1/3 innings (39 relief appearances).
Capps appeared in only 17 games in 2014 and only 30 games last year before the elbow injury forced them to miss the remaining two months of the season.
Last year's setback cut short what seemed like a step in the right direction for Capps, who struck out 58 batters and walked only seven with a 1.16 ERA and 0.81 WHIP. The prior season although pitching in 10 2/3 innings less, Capps posted a 3.98 ERA with only 25 strikeouts and five walks with a 1.18 WHIP.
FIRST GAME
Right-hander Jake Esch struggled a bit their start against the Hurricanes. Esch gave up UM's only run on a Jacob Heyward sacrifice fly after allowing the first two UM batters to reach base. Esch limited the damage by striking out Hurricanes catcher Zack Collins and right fielder Willie Abreu. Esch walked two and struck out two but only gave up one hit.
Being the spring's first exhibition game, the Marlins used one pitcher per inning and pulled their starters after three innings. A total of 26 position players participated, including Ichiro Suzuki, who was the designated hitter and Don Kelly, who pinch ran for Ichiro and later took their place in the lineup.
Five people are dead after a house fire in northeast Calgary early Saturday morning.
Calgary fire chief Steve Dongworth said crews arrived at 104 Falchurch Cres. N.E. around 1:24 a.m. and found flames and smoke pouring from the home and spreading to a neighbouring house..
Crews battled the fire and once the blaze was under control, entered the home "and immediately started locating casualties."
Initially four casualties were brought out of the home, but crews soon discovered a fifth.
"This was a difficult call, I can't recall the last time we had this many fatalities in a fire," said Dongworth.

Woken in the night
Neighbour Tim Moerike said the family that lives in the damaged house next door to the fatal fire are like family to him.
"I just heard the crash of a window breaking and saw the flames and took off running to get our friends out of their house next door," they said. "It was just, 'go', there wasn't any time to think, it was just 'go.'"
They said the main fire was out of control by that time and there was nothing they could do.
Not much is known about the victims at this time other than they are all adults.
The cause of the fire is under investigation and Dongworth said it will be some time before the department releases its findings.
Developers of the open-source phpMyAdmin have released a new version to patch several "highly critical" vulnerabilities that can be used to compromise a vulnerable system.
The vulnerabilities affect all versions of phpMyAdmin prior to 3.3.10.2 and 3.4.3.1, according to an advisory from Secunia.
phpMyAdmin is a widely used software tool that handles the administration of one or more MySQL servers over the web.
Some basic details on the security problems:
An error within the "Swekey_login()" function in libraries/auth/swekey/swekey.auth.lib.php can be exploited to overwrite session variables and e.g. inject and execute arbitrary PHP code.
Input passed to the "PMA_createTargetTables()" function in libraries/server_synchronize.lib.php is not properly sanitised before calling the "preg_replace()" function with the "e" modifier. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary PHP code via URL-encoded NULL bytes.
Input passed to the "PMA_displayTableBody()" function in libraries/display_tbl.lib.php is not properly sanitised before being used to include files. This can be exploited to include arbitrary files from local resources via directory traversal sequences.
Secunia said a weakness in setup scripts, which could lead to arbitrary PHP code injection if session variables are overwritten, was also addressed.
phpMyAdmin users are urged to immediately update to version 3.3.10.2 or 3.4.3.1.
Libya's second largest city, Benghazi, has fallen to anti-government forces after a crack army unit defected to the opposition and clashes spread to the capital, Tripoli, residents and news reports say.
The raging uprising against Muammar Gaddafi appears to be seriously threatening the Middle East's longest ruling dictator's 42-year grip on power day breaks on Monday.
Gaddafi's youngest son, Saif Gadhafi, seemed to acknowledge in a rambling speech on state-run television that Benghazi and the nearby eastern city of Baida were no longer under government control.
"At this moment in time, tanks are driven about by civilians," they said.
"In Baida, you have machine guns right in the middle of the city.
"Many arms have been stolen," said Saif Gaddafi, who called the insurrection "a plot against Libya."
They appealed for calm, promising to institute democratic reforms.
But in a warning suggesting that the regime was digging in for a bloody fight for survival in the seat of power, Tripoli, they said that unless its proposals are accepted, "be prepared for civil war."
Just what we all need to ring in the Christmas season: Un-merry millionaire Michelle Obama belly-aching about the burdens and sacrifices of public life with billionaire Oprah Winfrey.
"There's nowhere in the world I can go and sit and have a cup of coffee," Obama lamented. It's a frequent grievance. In September, they told InStyle magazine: "My hopes are to recapture some of the everydayness, some anonymity. ... (I)t will be nice to open up the paper, look at the front page, and know that you're not responsible for every headline."
And back in June, again with Oprah, the first lady griped that living in the spotlight was like "living in a cave."
Complain, complain, complain. What a way to make the most of your last six months in the grand and glorious White House.
For the past eight years, Obama has traveled to every corner of the planet on the taxpayers' dime. They have splurged in Spain, traversed the Great Wall of China, tangoed in Buenos Aires, skied in Aspen, lolled in Martha's Vineyard and feasted in Marrakesh. Thanks to their public position and celebrity, they have been bestowed "fashion icon" status -- donning a $12,000 custom-made Atelier Versace gown at their final State Dinner last month after enjoying two terms clad in Givenchy, Gucci, Jason Wu, Vera Wang, Caroline Herrera and other haute couture stars whose designs are unattainable to ordinary women in America.
Count your blessings much, Mrs. Grinch? Nope. All Barack Obama's bitter half really wants to do, they told Winfrey, is "drop into Target. I want to go to Target again."
Funny that. The last time Obama shopped at Target, they turned the outing into a fake news narrative to stoke racial division in America. It is worth reminding the public about the noxious lie one last time before the grumbling FLOTUS leaves office because I consider their exploitation of the incident a perfect metaphor for the Obama years -- faux populism bolstered by elitist Hollywood enablers, and then cynically transformed into a phony social justice crusade for crass political gain.
Back in 2012, you may remember, Obama sat down with David Letterman in one of their endless, popularity-enhancing pop culture appearances. They bragged about their ability to shop incognito at Target (do they get a secret commission every time they mention the store?) and told a warm and fuzzy story about helping a fellow customer who didn't recognize them The shopper innocently asked Obama to retrieve laundry detergent from a high shelf.
"I reached up, 'cause they were short, and I reached up, pulled it down," the first lady recounted, and the shopper joked, "Well, you didn't have to make it look so easy." Obama beamed as they told Letterman: "I felt so good" doing an everyday good deed. Letterman's audience cheered at the "first ladies, they're just like us!" theater.
Just a few years later, however, the encounter morphed into a tall tale of rampant racism, which they cunningly reshaped for People Magazine in 2014 during the aftermath of the Ferguson, Missouri riots and Black Lives Matter protests.
"Even as the first lady," they moaned, "not highly disguised, the only person who came up to me" at a Target store "was a woman who asked me to help them take something off a shelf." The headline of the article? "The Obamas: How We Deal With Our Own Racist Experiences." ABC News added that Michelle Obama claimed such "incidents are 'the regular course of life' for African Americans and a 'challenge' for the country to overcome."
Last year, Obama persisted in plying and fine-tuning their false narrative at Tuskegee University's commencement ceremony -- decrying the "sting" of "daily slights" they blamed on racism, including unnamed "clerks who kept a close eye on us in all those department stores."
Now, as they walk away with sky-high poll ratings, a glittering Rolodex, and government benefits for life, this incredibly blessed and privileged woman has the audacity to claim that "we" are "feeling what not having hope feels like," as they whined to their well-heeled gal pal, Oprah Winfrey.
So put upon. So downtrodden. So oppressed. To borrow one of Mrs. Woe-Is-Me's own favorite phrases:
Bye, Felicia!
You and your manufactured miseries won't be missed.

Some weeks, the chortling never ends. Driving home from kindergarten drop-off this morning, one of NPR's "sponsors" was the Department of Homeland Security's E-Verify system, which purportedly screens employees to make sure they are legal, and got rolled out to much fanfare earlier by Michael Chertoff:
“The federal government should lead by example and not by exhortation,” said Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, who has encouraged firms to use E-Verify.
Well. . . oooopsie. Looks like stigmatizing people to score politically advantageous points with the paranoid can come back to bite you in your own grandiosely inflated ego ass. Or, at least, bite your cleaning contractor:
Every few weeks for nearly four years, the Secret Service screened the IDs of employees for a Maryland cleaning company before they entered the house of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, the nation's top immigration official. The company's owner says the workers sailed through the checks — although some of them turned out to be illegal immigrants. . . . "Our people need to know," said the Montgomery County business person. "Our Homeland Security can't police their own home. How can they police our borders?"
Chertoff's leading by example, alright. See how tough it is to sort all of this out, how complex issues of immigration, economy and neener-neener blame-gaming are? Oh, how quickly a demagogue can get hoisted on their own smug, self-serving, loathsome petard.
Heckuva job in proving that stigma-mongering doesn't solve the problems, Mikey. Heckuva job.
Hello Rocksmith fans, and welcome to the November issue of the Rocksmith Remastered DLC Round-Up!
The end of 2017 approaches and it looks like there's only one more DLC to be revealed before we start the 2017 DLC Battle!
Before we get to November's DLC, let's take a look at how you voted for October!
Wow, it looks like we have a bassist uprising, it seems like James Jamerson Song Pack took the win for November with some steady competition from Canadian boys Bachman-Turner Overdrive. You tipped your hat to DragonForce and the other songs, raised your Mjölnir for Oden, and @AmonAmarth, but as usual, it seems like not many of you appreciated the trip to the 2000s. Oh well, maybe next pack millennials…
November was a month filled with artist packs, no variety mixes just four solid artists delivering content to the Rocksmith masses! We kicked off the month with a four pack from @NOFXBand, followed by a five pack from the pop rock/new wave stylings of @ThePretendersHQ, after that @Halestorm returned with a three pack, and finally we got some much-needed holiday cheer from @trans_siberian with 5 songs to bring in the Holiday season!
Let's check out the bass offerings for this band-centric month of DLC!
Scoring high on this one is tricky, but making the intro sound like the recording is even harder…
Love the brass solo line
Solid bass line for a solid tune
Gonna use this bass line to make you notice
This one will get your fingers moving
Check out that riff at 1:53!
This pack really surprised me on bass, some interesting runs here
Bass is sparse in this pack but it's still fun to be on the team, right?
If you don't mind the Drop D tuning you'll probably enjoy this one… Kate does!
Guitarists had to keep up the speed with their strumming and shredding this month!
It's almost over before it starts
Pretty varied techniques for a punk song
Nothing like a chorus soaked lead
Don't get lost keeping up with that arpeggio
Check out those solos, good work @BestFenton!
Approachable yet awesome
another easy song for halsb
Carol of The Bells returns!
Just get the pack if you play lead guitar 🙂
Tunings for November were heavy on the E Standard with a dash of drop tunings care of @Halestorm!
Arrangement E Standard Drop D
Db Drop B
Lead 13 4 X Rhythm 13 3 1 Bass 13 5 X Alt. Lead 3 X X Alt. Rhythm 1 X X
Which brings one question to everyone's mind
December awaits!

Comedian Kevin Hart is saying out loud, what most Winnipeggers are thinking.
They made their feelings on the weather known on Thursday, when they posted a video on Instagram. Hart's “What Now?” comedy tour is making a stop at the MTS Centre on Thursday night.
Hart yelled out in the video, “Jesus Christmas!” as they stood outside on Portage Avenue and Main Street in downtown Winnipeg. The comic said their plane landed in a “blizzard”, as they added a few trademark expletives.
But ticketgoers shouldn't worry whether the popular comedian will show up. They added on their Instagram post that “rain, sleet or snow can't stop me from delivering the funny people!”
Hart has already poked similar fun at Canada's less than desirable winter temperatures when their tour stopped in Saskatoon earlier this week.

The comedy show at MTS Centre begins at 7 P.M.
PARIS (Reuters) - A woman who sent their three-year-old son - called Jihad - to school in a T-shirt marked “Jihad, Born September 11, I am a bomb” was fined and given a suspended jail sentence by a French court on Friday.
Bouchra Bagour was found guilty of condoning a criminal act, along with their brother Zeyad, who bought the child the T-shirt recalling Islamist militant group al Qaeda's attacks on New York on September 11, 2001, that killed close to 3,000 people.
The matter ended up in court after Jihad went to their nursery school in September 2012 wearing the T-shirt, upsetting staff and prompting a local official to take legal action.
Overturning an earlier acquittal, the appeals court in the southern town of Nimes fined the woman 2,000 euros ($2,700) and gave them a one-year suspended jail sentence, doubling that fine and suspended jail sentence for the uncle.
In my last blog post we discussed a variety of strategies to help overcome your fear or phobia of public speaking. One strategy discussed was the use of medication to aid in reducing your anxiety. While this isn't a method recommended to everyone, for those with severe anxiety or a genuine public speaking phobia, this may be considered a suitable option.
If you're thinking about using medication, discuss it with a qualified doctor or nurse practitioner. But whatever you do, don't use alcohol or street drugs to counter public speaking anxiety. They don't work, and you'll have less physical coordination to get you through the mechanics of standing up to speak. You'll more than likely also lose your job given it is incredibly hard to mask the effects of drugs and alcohol while public speaking.
The main form of medication used for reducing anxiety when public speaking is the beta-blocker. A beta-blocker is “any of a class of drugs which prevent the stimulation of the adrenergic (adrenaline) receptors responsible for increased cardiac action, used to control heart rhythm, treat angina, and reduce high blood pressure“. Essentially, these are drugs that have a calming effect (reducing the physical symptoms of stress) without the mind numbing effect of drugs such as valium.
You should understand that beta-blockers are not officially drugs for anxiety, but are cardiac medications. However, by reducing some of the symptoms associated with public speaking anxiety, like the ‘shakes', the idea is that they can help you concentrate on the task at hand.
Since they can lower heart rate, beta-blockers have been used by Olympic marksmen to provide more aiming time between heartbeats. Some musicians use beta-blockers to reduce the adrenaline-driven shaking during auditions and performances. And it's rumored that many politicians use them for important speeches.
Some of my public speaking friends tell me they have used beta-blockers and that using them has been effective. But while this may help with the immediate stress of a speech, it is likely to be less useful for countering your chronic fear.
So the three questions that need to be answered when deciding to use medication/ drugs to aid your public speaking are:
Do they really work? Are they safe? What's the best way to manage public speaking anxiety?
1. Do they really work?
Nobel prize-winning scientist, James Black, invented beta-blocker drugs to block the effect of adrenaline on the heart. So beta-blockers can reduce the adrenaline-related physical symptoms associated with the stress response. Some studies show that beta blockers significantly reduce symptoms like shaking hands that can hinder some musicians playing. Those in the studies said they felt better about their performance after taking beta blockers, and music critics consistently judged their performances to be better.
One friend that I spoke with recently has used beta blockers for important presentations with no side effects. They said the physical symptoms they usually felt (heart racing and shaking of hands) made them spend too much time thinking about the nerves and how to control them. So they were more formal and stuck closer to theirs ‘script'.
With the beta blockers reducing those symptoms, they felt free to be more conversational and expansive and was able to act in a more confident manner on stage. So, overall, they found the experience positive.
2. What can't they do?
My friend did point out, however, that they are useless if you're not prepared. Public speaking fear is often all about uncertainty and preparedness and if you feel uncertain about your preparation, your anxiety will increase. If your preparation is not up to scratch, beta-blockers won't improve things.
Beta-blockers can't help anxiety of a purely psychological nature. If your public speaking anxiety shows itself mainly in psychological ways (e.g. general uncertainty or negative inner voices), beta blockers will not help you.
Using beta-blockers may cause reduced energy levels
Another thing to consider is that many people feel adrenalin helps them focus, giving them an edge that adds intensity to the performance. Australian actor Cate Blanchett has said, ‘a little bit of fear keeps one on one's toes'.
When I was 19 and fighting in competitive martial arts, I saw a specialist about the migraine headaches I would get after each fight (and no, these weren't linked to getting hit in the head too often). ‘Post exertional headaches are a documented condition', they said. I remember feeling a huge relief that modern medicine understood my pain and would have a cure. They commenced writing me a script.
‘These are drugs to reduce heart rate and blood pressure, which should therefore reduce your headaches.'
‘But won't that negatively impact my energy and physical performance on the floor?'
‘Well, yes.'
I left the script where they placed it.
2. Are they safe?
Beta blockers are prescription medications for good reason. There's a fairly long list of side effects, including:
Rash, anaphylactic shock (sudden unconsciousness or death), cold extremities, fainting, dizziness, fatigue, headache, depression, sleep disturbances, nightmares, hallucinations, short term memory loss, high or low blood sugar, stomach ache, flatulence, constipation, nausea, diarrhea, dry mouth, vomiting, heartburn, bloating, impotence or decreased libido, difficulty urinating, bronchospasm, cough, wheezes, naal stuffiness, joint pain, and muscle cramps.
Although this is an exhaustive list, many performers who take beta-blockers in small doses and or special occasions have found no side effects at all from their use.
According to a 2004 New York Times article, the editor of the Harvard Medical Letter, Michael Craig Miller, thinks there is little risk in taking them because they only affect physical, not cognitive anxiety. “Stage fright is a very specific and time-limited type of problem. There's very little downside except whatever number you do on yourself about taking the drugs” they said.
However note that there are opposing views. Such as these views from musicians:
“A common side effect is loss of concentration, and my playing rapidly went downhill because of this… I ended up sounding as if I were sight reading. As soon as I figured out the connection, I quit the pills for good; I never really needed them, anyway.”
“…in performance, I had 3 quite severe panic attacks, something I never had experienced prior to that year or since. If you ever read any of the books on prescription drugs, a caution often added is that certain drugs may produce the opposite effect from that intended, so – be careful and check it out, as it's a very individual thing.”
3. But what about natural remedies?
If you're not comfortable with beta-blockers, but you really do need to make use of medication, you may want to try some natural remedies first. There are a wide range of options available when looking for herbal or natural beta-blockers. I've included some here that some people have reported success with.
Bacopa Monnieri is an ancient Indian herb that is most commonly used as a focus and memory enhancer, however the supplement is also effective as a natural beta blocker for anxiety.
Bacopa Monnieri is particularly interesting because it is often used to improve cognition and it does so by reducing anxiety and allowing the brain to perform better. If you're looking for decreased anxiety, this supplement might bring you some added perks.
The standard dose of Bacopa is about 165 mg of active bacosides. So depending on the percentage of active ingredients you may need to take 1 to two capsules accordingly. Pure Mountain Botanicals has about 100 mg of active bacosides per capsule so you may choose to take 2 capsules/day.
L-Theanine is an uncommon amino acid found in tea that is very useful as a relaxer. Unlike other substances like alcohol, L-Theanine has the unique function of being able to relax and decrease anxiety without sedating the individual.
L-Theanine is usually taken in dosages between 100-200 mg and typically alongside caffeine. L-Theanine has a unique synergistic effect with caffeine that heightens attention, focus, and cognition. Although you can find L-Theanine in teas, you likely won't be able to get an adequate dose through tea alone.
Rhodiola Rosea is a Scandinavian herb and part of traditional Chinese Medicine, which claimed the herb promoted physical and cognitive vitality. Rhodiola Rosea is particularly effective as an anti-fague supplement. Whether fatigue is a result of physical, emotional or mental exertion, rhodiola is effective at reducing the effects of stress on the mind and body.
Supplementation of Rhodiola Rosea has been linked to decreased fatigue depression and stress and improved subjective well-being, and cognition.
Standard dosage of Rhodiola Rosea is around 300-700 mg per day. SupernovaNaturals has a great product that has the appropriate concentration of the active ingredients (rosavins and salidroside) in a 500 mg capsule. One capsule per day should be sufficient to experience the benefits of Rhodiola Rosea .
Note that given these are natural remedies you may find their impact less noticeable than beta-blockers. Reports of their effectiveness have been variable between public speakers that I have spoken with.
4. What's the best way to manage public speaking anxiety without the use of medication?
The real objective when speaking in public is to think clearly – and speak clearly. So a better question than “will medication (whether it be chemical or natural) help me?” is “what's the best way to manage my fear of public speaking?”
People commonly believe they can't think clearly due to the strength of the physical symptoms. The irony is that the intensity of your physical symptoms is a result of not thinking clearly. Many of the physical symptoms are due to the initial stress response, while the remainder are the result of the way you think about your predicament.
The physical symptoms are real, but their intensity is directly related to the way you process them. For example, if you believe that your shaking hand means that you are “losing control of your body!”, all your physical symptoms will increase with the drama of that thought. In other words, the stress response increases when we perceive a threat to our safety or well-being.
So symptoms can be reduced if we come to the conclusion that there is no real threat. So, when you know what to do and how to do it, your mind is efficiently directed and your anxiety can be made manageable.
This fight or flight response (and your public speaking fear) can be minimised when we understand what's going on and realise it's something we can influence – something we can manage. The key is to practice in a safe setting as often as possible to ensure that when you are up on stage, you are well prepared and able to control your nerves in the best possible way.
At the end of the day, you need to find the best method of managing your fear that works and that you can stick with. For most, including me, this will be through seeking advice and trial and error.
If you've found this information useful you may also be interested in reading some other recent posts; You Don't Fear Public Speaking More Than Death – But You Still Need to Manage Your Fear or How to Improve Your Public Speaking Through Storytelling.
Also, if you're after a short online course in public speaking, I cannot recommend ed2go's online public speaking courses enough. I'll be posting review of their online courses in public speaking very soon.
Enjoy!

Tired of yet one more political prostitution scandal caused by men who can't keep it in their pants? And now, the elite guard of the US president's secret service detail.
Most interesting is what has and has not been said by authorities when asked about the US secret service and military personnel's use of women in prostitution. Embarrassed by allegations that ten military men were involved in the Colombian scandal of buying women for the sex of prostitution, the US chairperson of the joint chiefs of staff, General Martin Dempsey, seemed most concerned that "We let the boss down." They also added, "We're embarrassed by what occurred in Colombia, though we're not sure exactly what it is."
We're not sure exactly whether the general knows that the Department of Defense (DoD) has a zero tolerance policy opposing the purchasing of persons in prostitution, recognizing that it contributes to sex-trafficking. Readers learn that prostitution is legal in certain areas of Colombia called "tolerance zones". We don't learn that patronizing prostitution by US servicemen is illegal anywhere. Since 2006, patronizing prostitution is a crime when committed by service members under article 134 of the US military's criminal law (the uniform code of military justice).
Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the ranking member of the homeland security and governmental affairs committee, is worried that the prostituted women might be members of groups hostile to the United States – agents of terrorists, perhaps – who might have planted listening devices and jeopardized presidential security. This followed revelations that 20-21 of the women are foreign nationals, who were brought to the hotel after US officials spent the night boozing and buying women through the "Pley Club" in Cartagena. Senator Collins wants the women tracked down to find out who they are and with whom they might be affiliated.
Those working against the commercial sexual exploitation of women and children know that "tolerance zones" in countries that have legalized prostitution – which is actually legalization of brothels and pimping – are magnets for traffickers. The "Pley Club" is a strip club and brothel. Worldwide, such clubs provide cover for the recruitment and use of women and girls for commercial sexual exploitation.
The secret service detail didn't simply take a stroll to an isolated brothel. There are rows of sex clubs and brothels in the Cartagena prostitution zone, where many women from different countries also walk the streets in search of "customers" seeking sexual services. The US officials were among the hundreds of US sex tourists who, every year, visit these sex clubs and brothels. Pimps control many of the women in the legal tolerance zones. The woman who set the secret service scandal in motion sought more money from the secret service agent than the puny $30 he'd paid them because they had to pay their (legal) pimp.
Teresa Ulloa Ziaurriz, regional director of the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, says that many women in the brothels of Cartagena are victims of sex-trafficking. Women displaced as a result of the internal armed conflict in Colombia were trafficked into prostitution in places like Cartagena. Sex-trafficking became prevalent not only in Cartagena, but in other parts of Colombia when members of the drug cartels used their criminal networks to take over the prostitution trade.
As for the men who are prostitution-users, many come to Cartagena on official business. Teresa Ulloa states that Cartagena has also become a paradise for tourists who seek sex with children.
President Obama said that they "would be angry" if allegations were true that these US officials had bought women for prostitution in Cartagena. Obama, who seldom gets angry, though they tend to do so more in pre-election periods, should translate these words into action. They should apply their own words spoken in Colombia – where they took a strong stand against legalization of the drug trade – to the prostitution trade:
"The capacity of a large-scale drug trade to dominate certain countries if they were allowed to operate legally without any constraint could be just as corrupting, if not more corrupting, than the status quo."
The US government has a responsibility to probe whether these women might be victims of trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation. Of course, the women won't immediately tell their truths to another branch of the same authorities that used them sexually, nor to inquiring journalists. However, the US Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking should be brought into the investigation, and local authorities and NGOs should be enlisted who are experienced in assisting women who are victims of trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation.
There's more than national security involved in the secret service prostitution scandal. If the US military code of justice means what it says, buying women in prostitution anyplace is a crime for US servicemen. It should also be a crime for other federal agents. If our US Trafficking Victims Protection Act means what it says, the presumption should be that the women used for commercial sexual exploitation in Cartagena may have been trafficked for prostitution.
Say what you want about Shelton Hank Williams III -- love him, decry their "betrayal" of their heritage, or ignore them -- they can conceptualize, write, and play. Assjack is a death metal and metalcore band they created to play the final part of their live shows. Mostly audiences didn't stick around, but in recent years, through the whisper stream, Assjack has started to gain its own audience of younger fans who like their music extreme. In many ways, Assjack goes back to Hank III's real roots in punk and hardcore bands -- he's been talking about them since they released their first album. III has finally recorded their Assjack project in the studio. Though they play with a full band on tour, he's done the album all by himself. This self-titled debut features III playing every instrument themselves and producing. The album combines the extremities of Florida death metal, Hellbilly (III's other band) attitude, industrial metal, and skater hardcore. Clocking in at a little over 31 minutes, this is a blast-your-face-off outing with one song bleeding very purposefully into another. With the exception of some synth noise, III has done an exceptional job of making the outing sound live -- with the exception of some of the drums that sound programmed (which is fine). Standout cuts include the brutally emotional "Cut Throat" and the slamming "Cocaine the White Devil," which has the brutal power of later Ministry, the over the top volume and guitar riffing of Roach Motel, and the dynamics of Slipknot. This is a solid debut that appeals to a very particular audience. That said, everything here is done exceptionally well.
Uefa announces that the English official will take charge of the tie at the Santiago Bernabeu
Uefa has appointed Howard Webb as referee for Tuesday's Champions League semi-final second leg between Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund The home side will need to produce a remarkable comeback to overturn a 4-1 first-leg defeat, meaning Webb could be in for a busy evening at the Santiago Bernabeu.The Englishman is highly regarded in their profession, having officiated the 2010 World Cup final between Spain and the Netherlands, as well as Inter's 2-0 Champions League triumph over Bayern Munich in the same year.That first of those games saw Madrid players Xabi Alonso, Iker Casillas and Sergio Ramos all on the winning side, with la Roja running out 1-0 winners.Webb was criticised after the game following an incident where Alonso was infamously 'dropkicked' by Nigel de Jong, a foul that was punished with just a yellow card from the referee.The official is also no stranger to run-ins with Real Madrid boss Jose Mourinho. Webb sent off two Chelsea players in the 2007 League Cup final and infuriated the then Blues boss when Salomon Kalou's goal was ruled offside against Blackburn in September 2007.After the incident, Mourinho demanded a phone-call apology from Webb saying:"I told them what I had to tell and what I told them was I am waiting for their phone call tomorrow to apologise."The game in Madrid will be will Webb's fifth European tie this season. They have shown 15 yellows and one red in the Champions League so far this campaign.

[FBIS Transcribed Text] The Afghan war has produced at least one set of improbable bedfellows: the US and Iran. That is why the battle for Herat in southwest Afghanistan on Monday, November 12, stood out from the Northern Alliance's other rapid-fire wins. Beyond giving the anti-Taliban movement a key city and control over the main routes to Iran and Turkmenistan, winning erat may be remembered as a turning point for America's foreign relations outside Afghanistan too, because it brought the US and Iran together militarily for the first time since the anti-American Shiite revolution swept to power in Tehran in 1979. This landmark conjunction is bound to make waves in the India subcontinent, the Persian Gulf and the Middle East.
DEBKA-Net-Weekly's sources in Washington and Tehran reveal that US Special Forces, mainly Rangers and the Delta Force, mounted the Herat campaign jointly with special force units of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, the Pazdaran, a force that symbolizes implacable Iranian Shiite abhorrence for America, the “Great Satan” The last time the two armies met, it was as foes. On April 7, 1980, US commandos led by the crack Delta Force and Iranian special forces confronted each other in a disastrous operation ordered by US President Jimmy Carter to free hundreds of Americans held hostage by Khomeini's zealots in the U.S. embassy in Tehran. The United States never revealed the cause of its failure. Forewarned, the Iranians waylaid the US Special Forces as they landed on the salt flats of southern Iran. In the ensuing havoc, several US transport planes and helicopters tried to evade Iranian fire and take off in a hurry. A Hercules C-130 collided with one of the American helicopters and both aircraft went up in flames. Seven US commandos were killed that day.
That confrontation 21 years ago is relevant to current events in Afghanistan. Then was the first time in US military history that special forces were armed with computerized communications, navigation and targeting equipment. Each commando carried a personal battlefield computer, providing direct communication between field commanders and headquarters in the rear. Back in 1980, the computers were large and cumbersome, hampering their user's movements. But the US rescue team was hampered by more than hardware; unbeknownst to Washington, a Soviet intelligence source working with the East German HVA intelligence agency had passed the new US computers' operating codes to Iran.
The Iranians could therefore eavesdrop on US transmissions at every level. They even picked up the rescue team's detailed report as it was relayed to President Carter, who was standing by in the White House situation room for news.
The situation in Afghanistan this week was a completely different story. This time, Iranian special forces were freely handed US communications and operational codes in a gesture from Washington to Tehran — freely except for the fact that their range was limited to a radius applicable only to the local US command structure in and around Herat.
According to DEBKA-Net-Weekly's military sources, the US-Iranian dialogue leading up to this military and intelligence cooperation in Afghanistan began in late September and flowed through two channels: The first had two branches – one, American business representatives employed in the past year by firms with investments in Iran. Those firms were managed by Richard Cheney before they were elected vice president; two, CIA officers left to hold down various undercover duties after the 1991 Gulf War period, when Cheney served the first President Bush as defense secretary. Both groups have been acting as Iran's lobby in Washington, advocating the lifting of U.S. economic sanctions and a larger American stake in the Iranian economy. The second channel was military. DEBKA-Net-Weekly's sources reveal two secret visits to Tehran in recent weeks by General Tommy Franks, Head of US Central Command (covering Afghanistan and the Near East), attended by armed forces staff officers and CIA Iranian Desk staffers. They held intensive discussions with Iranian army and military intelligence chiefs, as well as General Yahya Rahim Safavi, commander of the Revolutionary Guards, on Iran's contribution to the US war against terror and role in its aftermath.
What the Americans were after was for an Iranian elite unit to cross into Afghanistan, infiltrate Herat and form insurrectionary cells to rise up against their Taliban masters when the Northern Alliance attacked the city. Generals Franks and Safavi agreed on a plan and shaped its details. It worked like clockwork. Iranian commandos set up a secure base for themselves in Herat. A group of eight to 10 US Special Forces officers joined them as the advance guard of the Northern Alliance. Under an Americans guarantee, the thrust into Herat and the central Afghanistan province of Bamayan was left entirely to the forces of the Shi'ite militia chief, former governor Ismail Khan, and no one but the Shi'ite Hazara ethnic contingents led by Karim Khalili were deployed in the city and region. On these terms, Iranian agents organized the local insurrection as arranged and the rebel leader invited the Northern Alliance, or rather, Ismail Khan, to liberate the town.
A US Special Forces team of officers and CIA personnel meanwhile remained in Tehran to oversee the smooth operation of the joint venture — the first time the CIA was allowed to set foot in the Iranian capital since 1979. Not only were they present on this alien terrain, but the Herat campaign had US and Iranian military-intelligence teams working opposite each other for a shared objective. Oddly enough, the American team is still in Tehran even after Herat's fall, Khan's takeover and their attempts to consolidate their rule with the help of the Iranian Special Forces still there. According to DEBKA-Net-Weekly's Iran and Gulf experts, the ramifications of the US team's presence in the Islamic republic are noteworthy — both in domestic terms and for the region.

Large study shows females are equal to males in math skills
The mathematical skills of boys and girls, as well as men and women, are substantially equal, according to a new examination of existing studies in the current online edition of journal Psychological Bulletin. One portion of the new study looked systematically at 242 articles that assessed the math skills of 1,286,350 people, says chief author Janet Hyde, a professor of psychology and women's studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
These studies, all published in English between 1990 and 2007, looked at people from grade school to college and beyond. A second portion of the new study examined the results of several large, long-term scientific studies, including the National Assessment of Educational Progress.
In both cases, Hyde says, the difference between the two sexes was so close as to be meaningless.
Sara Lindberg, now a postdoctoral fellow in women's health at the UW-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health, was the primary author of the meta-analysis in Psychological Bulletin.
The idea that both genders have equal math abilities is widely accepted among social scientists, Hyde adds, but word has been slow to reach teachers and parents, who can play a negative role by guiding girls away from math-heavy sciences and engineering. "One reason I am still spending time on this is because parents and teachers continue to hold stereotypes that boys are better in math, and that can have a tremendous impact on individual girls who are told to stay away from engineering or the physical sciences because 'Girls can't do the math.'"
Scientists now know that stereotypes affect performance, Hyde adds. "There is lots of evidence that what we call 'stereotype threat' can hold women back in math. If, before a test, you imply that the women should expect to do a little worse than the men, that hurts performance. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
"Parents and teachers give little implicit messages about how good they expect kids to be at different subjects," Hyde adds, "and that powerfully affects their self-concept of their ability. When you are deciding about a major in physics, this can become a huge factor."
Hyde hopes the new results will slow the trend toward single-sex schools, which are sometimes justified on the basis of differential math skills. It may also affect standardized tests, which gained clout with the passage of No Child Left Behind, and tend to emphasize lower-level math skills such as multiplication, Hyde says. "High-stakes testing really needs to include higher-level problem-solving, which tends to be more important in jobs that require math skills. But because many teachers teach to the test, they will not teach higher reasoning unless the tests start to include it."
The new findings reinforce a recent study that ranked gender dead last among nine factors, including parental education, family income, and school effectiveness, in influencing the math performance of 10-year-olds.
Hyde acknowledges that women have made significant advances in technical fields. Half of medical school students are female, as are 48 percent of undergraduate math majors. "If women can't do math, how are they getting these majors?" they ask.
Because progress in physics and engineering is much slower, "we have lots of work to do," Hyde says. "This persistent stereotyping disadvantages girls. My message to parents is that they should have confidence in their daughter's math performance. They need to realize that women can do math just as well as men. These changes will encourage women to pursue occupations that require lots of math."
It is wet and windy up in Stoke and Copeland and by 4 a.m. on Friday morning one of several possible scenarios will be playing out. Guido takes you through your by-election scenarios…
Stoke-on-Trent Central
Labour win, UKIP second, Tories third
If Gareth Snell holds Stoke for Labour then the man who once called Jeremy Corbyn an “IRA supporting friend of Hamas” will, ironically, have helped save Jez. They will have won a seat that has always been safely Labour. Defeat will see Paul Nuttall face criticism from UKIP's Faragists – remember Farage last week piled on the pressure by saying Nuttall had to win. Jez will be safe…
Labour win, Tories second, UKIP third
If the Tories come ahead of UKIP then the Faragists will actively move against a humiliated Nuttall. Hillsborough, rightly or wrongly, will have damaged them beyond repair. UKIP could have their sixth change of leader in under two years.
UKIP win
Should Labour lose to UKIP, the PLP will be mutinous. Corbyn's office will blame Tony Blair's Brexit speech, accusing them of a deliberate act of sabotage. Corbyn will face huge pressure from the left to hand over to Rebecca Long-Bailey or Clive Lewis. Moderates will demand their resignation and discuss another leadership challenge. UKIP will have its second MP, Nuttall becoming a loud Brexiter in the Commons and a credible new voice for working class voters. UKIP will be on the verge of a mainstream tipping point…
Tories win
Should the Tories come from nowhere to win, Corbyn could be toast. The realisation of a Tory one party state and a Scotland-style wipeout of Labour across England will dawn on the Corbynistas. Even Jezza's closest allies will tell them their time is up. 25 year-old Jack Brereton will be the youngest Tory MP.
Copeland
Tories win
Tory victory in Copeland means Corbyn will face renewed calls to quit from Labour moderates. Owen Jones types will air further doubts about the Corbyn project. Eyes will be on Long-Bailey and Lewis. There will be talk of a summer leadership challenge. Corbyn's views on the nuclear industry will have been key. Theresa May's approach to Brexit will be emboldened. A Tory win is already priced in, this will not be a shock to SW1…
Labour win
Labour victory against the odds means Corbyn is safe, or safer if Labour has lost Stoke. Fighting dirty on the NHS will have worked. Talk of a Tory takeover of Northern seats will be deemed premature. An ardent Remainer will have won in a big Leave constituency. May's awkward visit, in which they failed to answer questions on local NHS services, will be a major embarrassment for Number 10.
UKIP win
You are kidding.

PLEASANT GROVE, Utah - Police arrested a 39-year-old woman Sunday after the bodies of seven infants were found in a home where they used to live.
Megan Huntsman was booked into the Utah County Jail for investigation of six counts of murder, CBS affiliate KUTV in Salt Lake City reported.
CBS News
Hunstman's ex-husband alerted police after finding the body of an infant inside a Pleasant Grove home where the woman had lived untll 2011, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. Pleasant Grove is located about 35 miles south of Salt Lake City.
Police went to the home and found the body of a newborn who appeared to have been full-term. Executing a search warrant, they then discovered the bodies of six additional infants, KUTV reported.
The six tiny bodies were found in separate cardboard boxes inside the garage, police Capt. Michael Roberts told the Tribune.
Police believe that over a 10-year period, from 1996 to 2006, Huntsman gave birth to the infants and then killed them.
Them ex-husband is believed to be the father but investigators are still working on DNA tests, Roberts said.
Police are not pursuing charges against the ex-husband at this point, Roberts said.
The ranch-style home, which is split into two apartments, is owned by the ex-husband's parents, the Tribune said.
Longtime neighbor Sharon Chipman told the newspaper Huntman's three daughters still live in the house. They said the two eldest daughters are around 18 to 20 years old, while the youngest is about 13.
"She's lived here for about 15 years and was a good neighbor, as far as we knew," said Kathie Hawker, another neighbor who lived right next door to the home where the babies were found. "We just really loved them (Megan), and their husband. We thought they were just really good people."
Now, since this has caused some confusion before, here's a little clarity: Even if you see someone else has suggested the car you wanted to suggest, suggest it anyway! I will not accept posts with three "thumbs ups" as three total suggestions. Instead, make the suggestion yourself so that I can go through and total up every single post.
RULE NUMBER 2: THE BUDGET
As usual in the DougCar suggest-a-thon, the budget doesn't quite matter as much as the depreciation. While I'd like to keep the car around $70,000 or less, the most important thing is that the car you suggest WON'T LOSE VALUE in the year I have it. So, for example, I'd rather go over budget on an $80,000 vehicle that isn't going to depreciate than buy some brand-new SUV with ventilated seats and lose $15,000 in depreciation the first year alone.
Now, obviously, virtually all cars lose value -- so you don't have to find something that's literally going to remain even, or perhaps go upwards. But you absolutely must recommend a car that isn't going to get destroyed with depreciation. This generally means that you shouldn't suggest a new car, unless you find something that's reeeeeallllly going to hold its value.
Marc Jacobs reveals plans for beauty line
Fashion and cosmetics have always been closely linked with the likes of Chanel, YSL and Dior launching beauty products. Marc Jacobs is the latest fashion designer to delve into the world of cosmetics.
With three well-loved fashion lines and ten fragrances under their belt, we can't wait to see what will be included in this fashion mogul's new makeup range.
Keeping the details close to their chest, Jacobs shared a few teasers with Grazia Daily.
In an exclusive interview with the magazine, the designer said: “I am beyond excited about the launch of Marc Jacobs Beauty. The packaging is so seductive, so cool. The colours are gorgeous and inspiring and the formulas and textures invite you to ‘make-up.”
Jacobs, who is teaming up with cosmetics company, Sephora, revealed: “The Magic Marc'er Precision Pen Eye Liner is the deepest, glossiest, blackest black on the market and the Style Eye-Con No.7 palettes are each and all perfect for creating the character one feels like showing the world on any given day or night.”
Although there is no set date for the launch in the US, the range is expected to hit shops later this year. I'm sure we all have our fingers crossed that Marc Jacobs Beauty will be making its way over to the UK soon, I know I do.

Elvis never used their power of celebrity in the political realm of the times
Politics Elvis: “I'd just soon to keep my own personal views about that to myself”
Hollywood celebrities could learn and thing or two about politics from the greatest entertainer in history. Elvis Presley never used their massive power of celebrity in the political realm of the times. In their 42 years of living, they were right up there with the presidents and the popes. The difference between politics Elvis and many of the starts today is that they loved people and in return almost all people loved Elvis.
On June 9, 1972, during the Vietnam War era, Elvis held a rare press conference preceding their famous Madison Square Garden concerts in New York. A reporter asked, “You were in the Army and were drafted. What is your opinion of war protesters? And would you today refuse to be drafted?”
“Honey, I'd just soon to keep my own personal views about that to myself,” Elvis replied. “Because I'm just an entertainer and I'd rather not say.”
To label Elvis as a Democrat or Republican is futile exercise as attempting to peg them into one classification of music. Elvis was a massive and successful blend of Rock n' Roll, Country, Blues, Pop, Soul and Gospel. Songs like “If I Can Dream,” “In the Ghetto,” and “Walk a Mile in My Shoes” spoke to us as least as much as “Heartbreak Hotel,” “It's Now or Never” and “Burning Love.”
Highlights of many of their 1970s concerts included patriotic offerings of “American Trilogy,” “America the Beautiful,” and “The Impossible Dream.”
“Let me tell you the definitive truth about Elvis Presley and racism,” The King of the Blues, B.B. King said in 2010. “With Elvis, there was not a single drop of racism in that man. And when I say that, believe me I should know.”
“All of our influences had something in common,” King explained. “We were born poor in Mississippi, went through poor childhoods and we learned and earned our way through music. You see, I talked with Elvis about music early on, and I know one of the big things in heart was this: Music is owned by the whole universe. It isn't exclusive to the black man or the white man or any other color. It shared in and by our souls.”
“I know one of the big things in heart was this: Music is owned by the whole universe. It isn't exclusive to the black man or the white man or any other color. It shared in and by our souls.”–B.B. King
“I told Elvis once–and they told me they remembered I told them this–is that music is like water,” King pointed out. “Water is for every living person and every living thing.”
King raised their finger up as if Elvis was still in front of him, and profoundly declared, “Water from the white fountain don't taste any better than from the black fountain. We just need to share it, that's all. You see, Elvis knew this and I know this.”
“Many people make the mistake of being wrong about all of this,” King continued. “If you ask anyone, I'm talking about people from all kinds of music—Blues, Soul, Country, Gospel, whatever—and if they are honest with you and have been around long enough to know—they'll thank Elvis for their contributions. They opened many doors and by all their actions, not just their words, they showed their love for all people.
“His music, especially their Gospel songs, tell us all we need to know.” –Harold Loyd
Perhaps Elvis' first cousin Harold Loyd, a security guard at the famous Graceland gates in Memphis, summed it up best in 1976, “All I know is Elvis has a lot of different blood in their body.  They are part Cherokee. We share Jewish, Irish, Scottish and French blood on our mamma's side. I think Uncle Vernon has Irish and French on their side. What we do know is there is only one God. Their music, especially their Gospel songs, tell us all we need to know.  They are good to me. Every day, I see how their kindness and generosity towards all people, no matter who they are, spreads.”
“Just look at the fans out here,” Loyd pointed to the visitors outside the gate. “They are different races. Women and men, boys and girls, tall and short. They love their fans. They love him. They show them how much– in their songs, not their politics.”
Memphis Mafia member and good friend Charlie Hodge lived at Graceland. Most fans know Hodge as the man who handed Elvis their water and scarves on stage. Hodge served in the Army with Elvis in Germany. In 1976, across the street from Graceland at the old Hickory Log restaurant, they observed, “If you want to know what Elvis believes, just look around their neck or on their fingers. They wear a Christian cross. They wear a Star of David. They wear a Hebrew Chai.”
Other friends note that it would be a mistake to place Elvis in a political basket. “He didn't share their opinions in public for a reason,” said the late Sonny West, a former Memphis Mafia member. “Things have shifted so much. There is more division. Elvis loved John F. Kennedy and met LBJ. They were Democrats that would probably identify more with conservative Republicans today. They also met Jimmy Carter and I had the honor of being with Elvis when we went to the White House to visit with President Nixon. Even President Reagan switched over to the Republican Party during this time. Elvis was pro-American all the way.”
Regardless of their own political beliefs, Elvis firmly believed that the president should always be supported, regardless of their political affiliation. Memphis Mafia member Marty Lacker once said Elvis “liked the president no matter what party they were in.”
Politics Elvis
Following is News Legit's list (alphabetically) of the top entertainers and Hollywood stars who should learn from the example of Elvis Presley.
Hollywood liberals love to voice their political opinions as if they relate to the everyday, average American. They hold themselves on an elite level, and act like we worship them. While many people are starstruck by celebrities, they only exist because of us. Once we turn off our televisions, boycott their movies, or not attend their performances, they cease to exist.

(CNN) Two missiles targeted a US warship off the coast of Yemen on Sunday but missed the vessel and hit the water instead, a Pentagon spokesperson said.
The missiles were fired at the USS Mason from Houthi-controlled territory in war-torn Yemen, Capt. Jeff Davis said, adding that the guided-missile destroyer deployed "onboard defensive measures" and was undamaged.
But the Houthis -- a minority Shia group that has taken control of much of Yemen, including the capital -- denied Monday that its forces had targeted the warship.
An official from the Houthi-controlled military said the reports were aimed at covering up a "heinous" Saudi-led coalition airstrike on a wake Saturday in the capital, Sanaa, that officials said killed at least 155 people, the Houthi-controlled SABA news agency reported.
"Reports that allege that Yemeni rockets targeted ships off the Yemeni (coast) are baseless," the official said.
The US warship was in international waters more than 12 nautical miles (22 km) offshore, in the southern end of the Red Sea, north of the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, according to a defense official.
The missiles were launched within 60 minutes of each other, Davis said.
"We assess the missiles were launched from Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen. The United States remains committed to ensuring freedom of navigation everywhere in the world, and we will continue to take all necessary steps to ensure the safety of our ships and our service members," they said.
Airstrike on wake
Washington has backed a Saudi-led coalition fighting to prevent Houthi rebels allied with Iran and forces loyal to Yemen's deposed President Ali Abdullah Saleh from taking power in Yemen.

The Saudi-led coalition had earlier denied accusations that it was responsible for the attack and said it would "immediately investigate" reports that its warplanes were behind the airstrikes, according to the official Saudi Press Agency.

The Saudi-led coalition, involving several Arab countries, began a military campaign in Yemen in March 2015 after Houthis drove out the US-backed government, led by President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, and took over Sanaa.
Since peace talks in Kuwait failed in August, the coalition has intensified airstrikes, despite vocal criticism from rights groups that the bombardments have been indiscriminate and could constitute war crimes. The attacks have often hit civilian targets with devastating results.
Arms deal
The US Senate last month rejected a bipartisan proposal to block a pending $1.15 billion United States arms sale to Riyadh.

Critics of the military deal, which was approved by the Obama administration, complained it could further drag the US into the war in Yemen and contribute to the worsening humanitarian crisis there.
Civilian casualties are only part of the crisis. Yemen's UNICEF office has reported that nearly 10,000 children younger than 5 died from preventable diseases there during the past year.
Some 1.5 million children are currently malnourished in Yemen, and 370,000 of them suffer from severe acute malnutrition, according to the charity.
Yemen's economic infrastructure has also been ravaged by war.
At least 430 factories and companies were destroyed by coalition airstrikes since the start of the conflict, according to Ahmed Bahri, political chief of the Sanaa-based Haq Party.
Donald Trump may brag that being “really rich” makes them free of outside influences, but their web of business connections ensures that they have a fiscal involvement in many issues. Even though Trump may have written the check to their campaign coffers, with their taxes still hidden, there's no way of knowing how the money got to Trump.
When it comes to the Dakota Access Pipeline, the proposed pipeline to carry oil between fracking sites in North Dakota and Illinois which would run alongside the Standing Rock Sioux tribal lands in North Dakota, Trump's connections are many. Not only has they taken over $100,000 in campaign contributions directly from executives at Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the pipeline, Trump has their own money invested in the project.
Trump's financial disclosure forms show the Republican nominee has between $500,000 and $1m invested in Energy Transfer Partners, with a further $500,000 to $1m holding in Phillips 66, which will have a 25% stake in the Dakota Access project once completed. The information was disclosed in Trump's May filing to the Federal Election Commission, which requires candidates to disclose their campaign finance information on a regular basis.
It appears that Trump made their investments even though peaceful protests had already begun. The 1,171 mile long pipeline crosses land that was once officially part of the Standing Rock Sioux lands, but which was taken by the Army Corps of Engineers under the auspices of flood control. The path of the pipeline crosses a number of sacred sites, as well as crossing the river upstream of the Standing Rock Sioux tribal lands. So the pipeline represents a direct threat to the quality of their water. The pipeline was originally slated to run near the state capitol at Bismark, but was relocated near the Sioux tribal lands after complaints.
Just last weekend, 141 protesters were arrested and held. Police at the site have been heavily militarized and even journalists have been arrested simply for attempting to interview people at the site.
Donald Trump has spoken out frequently on the idea that relaxing regulations over energy would generate more jobs, though multiple analyses have shown that our energy market is facing a glut of both oil and gas and market prices, not regulations, are what is causing the current declines in energy jobs. But now it seems that Trump's call for easing restrictions on energy are more directly related to lining their own pocket.

ANSAN South Korea (Reuters) - Six teenagers who survived South Korea's worst maritime disaster in 44 years told on Monday how classmates helped them float free as water flooded their cabins despite crew instructions to stay put even as their ferry sank, killing more than 300 people.

The teenagers, whose names were withheld to protect their privacy, were giving testimony at the trial of 15 crew members, who face charges ranging from homicide to negligence for abandoning the sinking ship.
“We were waiting and, when the water started coming in, the class rep told everyone to put on the life vests ... the door was above our heads, so they said we'll float and go through the door and that's how we came out,” one of the teenagers said.
“Other kids who got out before us pulled us out.”
The ferry Sewol sank on April 16, killing 304 people, as many as 250 of them school children on a field trip. Twelve of their teachers were also killed.
The ferry was on a routine trip from the port of Incheon south to Jeju island, carrying students and teachers from the Danwon High School on the outskirts of Seoul as well as other passengers and cargo.
Another of the teenagers told how crew members had told passengers, “specifically the students of Danwon High School”, to stay in their cabins.
“Water started to fill in and friends helped us move out,” the student said.
Others described how coastguard officers waited outside the stricken ferry for passengers to swim out rather than go into the ship to try and rescue them.
“They were outside. They pulled us (onto boats) but they didn't come inside to help,” one said.
“We said to ourselves, ‘why aren't they coming in?'.”
“MORE FISHERMEN THAN RESCUERS”
Another student said it appeared there were more fishermen involved in the rescue than coastguard. Like others, they said the crew should be punished severely for their actions.
“More than that, I want to know the fundamental reason why my friends had to end up like that,” they said.
The six teenage survivors described how there were repeated orders not to move from their cabins. Orders to put on their life vests came much later and without any information about what was happening to the ship as it began to list sharply.
They were the first of 75 children who survived due to give evidence in the trial at the Gwangju court, which has been moved to Ansan south of Seoul to accommodate the students.
Five of them gave their evidence facing away from the court. One testified from another room via closed-circuit television.
The crew members on trial, including the captain, Lee Joon-seok, have said they thought it was the coastguard's job to evacuate passengers. Video footage of their escape triggered outrage across South Korea.
Two musicians from the Philippines who had been working on the ship testified that the crew appeared to be in a state of panic as they gathered on the ship's bridge as it started to list, making no effort to get passengers off the vessel.
“I remember them panicked and worried,” one of the pair, who was identified only by their first name, Alex, told the court.
They said the captain was crouched and holding onto a metal bar, apparently shaking with fear, and a junior ship's officer at the helm when the vessel started to list was crying loudly.
The government of President Park Geun-hye was heavily criticised over the slow and ineffective handling of the rescue operation. Park has vowed to break up the coastguard and streamline rescue operations, which are now split between the police, coastguard and others, into a single national agency.
The disaster also sparked South Korea's biggest manhunt as authorities searched for Yoo Byung-un, the man at the head of a family business that operated the doomed ferry.
Yoo's badly decomposed body was identified last week after it was found by a farmer at an orchard last month.
Earlier on Monday, a close associate of Yoo, a woman identified by police only by their last name of Kim, was arrested after handing themselves in. It was believed they helped them elude police after the disaster.
Another woman, the wife of Yoo's driver who was thought to have been with them during their final days at large, also turned themselves in to police.
Kim's arrest came three days after police stormed an apartment on the outskirts of Seoul and found Yoo's elder son, Dae-gyun, who was wanted for embezzlement.
Yoo Dae-gyun was not believed to have been as actively involved in management of the family business as their younger brother, who is believed to be in the United States. They said they only learned of their father's death from police.
Extensive decomposition of Yoo Byung-un's body meant it was not possible to determine the cause of their death despite forensic and DNA tests, authorities said last week.

CNN, Bloomberg, CNBC, BBC, Euronews. The media around the world report the Portland Timbers officially becoming a vegan football club. The players' nourishment consists of plant-based products only, at Providence Park they've got for sale vegan fast food only, and Nike is manufacturing boots for football players from vegan materials.

In marketing, there are such concepts as social marketing and cause-related marketing (CRM). They are essentially one and the same thing, if a certain brand is involved, for in one form or another, brand gets some benefit from participating in any socially oriented projects.
That is, there can be no 100% social marketing, if it is in any way, shape or form associated with some specific brand, for the profit for the brand, in this case, is at least increase in recognition.
At the same time, it's a great danger for the brand when consumers are aware that the brand does have some kind of profit.
MLS actively engages this type of marketing. It surely deserves huge respect, because in contrast to many other brands, it's really more of a social marketing for MLS. At least, it is the impression I've got.
MLS incorporated this type of marketing under the name of MLS WORKS.
MLS WORKS includes various interesting initiatives. For instance, MLS WORKS, adidas, Southern New Hampshire University and the U.S. Soccer Foundation have partnered to build 20 mini-pitches for kids. Here are the infographics MLS WORKS provides.
And it's a perfect solution, since any kids targeting initiative is taken extremely positively. And MLS still keeps accomplishing its main task. MLS invests in these kids' loyalty, in their subsequent turning into the league's fans. At present, of course, the effectiveness of such investments is decreasing because of the development of eSports, nevertheless it is necessary to continue working with children.
However, we'll focus here on something different. Research shows considerably high rates of the Americans' interest in CRM. For instance, taking some studies as a base, we see that 86% of Americans would rather prefer brands based on CRM, when price and quality are equal, 74% of Americans draw their attention to whether the brand, being recommended to them, is involved in solving social problems, while 84% of Americans believe that it's a duty of each company to engage in social projects.
But who is really impressed by CRM today? Unless you come up with some sort of uncommon for cases like this theme, and set yourself a pretty serious goal, being at the same time controversial for the society.
What do I suggest? PETA has its own list of the most vegan-friendly American cities. Who do you think is in the first place? That's right, it's Portland (Los Angeles is in the second, the third is New York).
Therefore, the CRM's theme for the Portland Timbers emerges by itself. Why not resolve an essential social issue by becoming known all over the world?
The number of vegans around the world is growing rapidly, and whatever slight an initiative in this direction is easily spread around the world within vegan society, spilling quickly over its bounds, through being controversial for most society.
So we can see that it's a perfect PR ploy that at the same time is to be positively received by the fans of the club from such an advanced city like Portland. It's only a matter of making it look so good that there would be nothing left for the PR department of the Portland Timbers to do.

Long history of Johnson Creek pollution winds back to Precision Castparts
Johnson Creek begins its 26-mile journey from pristine headwaters in the Cascade foothills near Boring, but as it snakes through Gresham, Portland and Milwaukie, it picks up a contaminated payload before spilling into the Willamette River.
At an oxbow three miles from the mouth of Johnson Creek, it flows 400 feet from side-by-side Precision Castparts Corp. manufacturing plants along Johnson Creek Boulevard, which Portland regulators found have repeatedly discharged toxins into a storm pipe draining into the creek.
As reported, ('Protesters target Precision Castparts,' March 31), the air around the metals plants in the Errol Heights neighborhood constitutes a toxic hot spot, where the Environmental Protection Agency calculates residents face a higher cancer risk because of toxic air emissions. Southeast Portland activists, who mobilized in response to toxic emissions from two eastside glassmakers, recently turned their attention to Precision Castparts, a far bigger polluter.
A review of regulatory files shows that Precision Castparts history of pollution goes well beyond smokestacks fouling the air, to include repeated violations affecting Johnson Creek. The long-neglected creek, also polluted by animal waste, pesticides and other sources, has become a local environmental success story after extensive restoration efforts led by the Johnson Creek Watershed Council ushered the return of salmon and steelhead. Coho salmon, steelhead and lamprey eels have been documented in Johnson Creek near the metals plants.
Precision Castparts declined to respond to questions about discharges from its plants, the PCC Structurals Large Parts Campus at 4600 S.E. Harney St., where it has produced parts for jet engines and other devices since 1957. Instead, it released a one-paragraph written response, saying the companys air and water emissions are in full compliance with permits and the company is committed to the safety of our employees and neighbors and in minimizing our impact on the environment.
Warning sign
A decade ago, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality conducted an evaluation of pollutants in Johnson Creek, called a Total Maximum Daily Load assessment. DEQ found water quality was very poor throughout the year. It was worse than all DEQ-monitored sites in the Willamette River basin except for the Columbia Slough.
In 2008 and than again in 2012, the city Bureau of Environmental Services found that Precision Castparts illegally discharged urea-laced water to the city storm drain serving its property, which feeds into Johnson Creek.
In December 2012, the Bureau of Environmental Services detected PCBs (a carcinogenic compound also known as polychlorinated biphenyls) in the creek near the Precision Castparts plants.
After an investigation, the bureau determined in 2013 that the company violated the city code by putting PCBs into the creek, which it found at levels that exceeded human health standards. Bureau investigators also found elevated levels of at least a dozen other highly toxic compounds, including several that are carcinogenic, in creek sediments near the outfall of the city-owned storm drain into the creek. The storm drain, several feet in diameter, largely serves the Precision Castparts plants, extending underground about 1,000 feet to empty into the creek.
We found elevated levels in Johnson Creek and sourced it back to PCC, said Matt Criblez, head of enforcement for the Bureau of Environmental Services.
Contaminants were found at several locations in the creek just downstream from the storm drain outfall, but none at any point upstream, Criblez said.
The bureau detected measurable quantities of arsenic, barium, cadmium, copper, nickel, zinc, chromium, lead, selenium, silver and seven types of hydrocarbons in creek sediments and in the storm drain. Most of these compounds exceeded health-based benchmarks.
The presence of arsenic and cadmium in the storm drain and creek raises questions about Precision Castparts recent statement to the Portland Tribune, which said: We do not use arsenic or cadmium as part of our processes.
Watershed Council in the dark
Daniel Newberry, executive director of the Johnson Creek Watershed Council, said their group has not been notified about pollutants found in the creek near the PCC plant.
Thats very serious, they said of the contamination. I would like to know. I would hope the DEQ would send me some information or give me a call.
The Johnson Creek Watershed Council is a nonprofit dedicated to restoring water quality in the creek and associated wildlife habitat, with state funding from Oregon State Lottery earnings.
A park known as the Tideman-Johnson Natural Area is located less than a half-mile downstream of the PCC site. The Springwater Trail, used by bicyclists and hikers, is located nearby. No warnings about the pollution have been posted in the park or on the trail. I have seen plenty of kids playing in Johnson Creek down there, Newberry said. One question is whether parents should let their kids play in the creek.
In addition to contaminants in the creek near the sewer outfall, the Bureau of Environmental Services found a gelatinous goo inside the drain pipe. After further analysis, it determined the goo contained toxic material. The city believes the contamination may have been released intermittently for an unknown number of years prior to its discovery, Criblez said.
In April 2014, the Bureau of Environmental Services issued a a notice of violation to Precision Castparts.
The gelatinous material continued throughout the stormwater line to its terminus at the outfall to Johnson Creek, the notice stated. The notice accused the company of illegally discharging untreated industrial waste into the drain, assessing a $1,050 civil penalty. The notice required the company to clean out the storm drain.
Criblez said pollution entering Johnson Creek via the city storm drain may also constitute a violation of the Clean Water Act. If the DEQ or the EPA ever finds such a violation, we will issue a separate violation against PCC for violation of our permit, Criblez said. As of now, we are not in noncompliance.
Precision Castparts denies responsibility
For several months in 2014, the company denied any responsibility for the pollution, claiming its own tests had showed that the waste found in the storm drain was nothing other than pond scum that came from an area known as the Flavel Ridge Wetland located about 100 yards east of the plant, according to a letter sent by Precision Castparts to the city. It said tests revealed the waste had the same characteristics of biological material found in a pond at the wetlands.
We would appreciate it if you would contact the owners of this pond and that they not allow noxious material to enter the (drain), Precision Castparts stated in an April 14, 2014 letter to the city. We do not believe that there is any basis for concluding that this gelatinous material has any relationship to PCC or its discharges. Cleaning the drain should not be the responsibility of PCC Structurals, the company wrote.
But the city insisted that a chemical analysis of the goo further supports the Citys assertion that the source of the gelatinous material originated from PCC Structurals campus, according to a Bureau of Environmental Services compliance order.
Precision Castparts agrees to cleanup
Later in 2014, the company agreed to pay the $1,050 civil penalty and clean up the storm drain. By last year, Precision Castparts collected about 20.5 tons of solid waste from the drain, which was sent to a Waste Management landfill in Hillsboro for disposal.
About 25 dead fish were found in the storm drain, including two dead steelhead and one live steelhead, according to Criblez and Paul Seidel, a toxicologist with the DEQ.
Precision Castparts agreed to add a fish weir, so that fish cant swim from Johnson Creek up into the storm drain.
Storm drain material included unknown amounts of three lightly radioactive thorium isotopes, as well as PCBs. Another three drums of thorium, lead and other material were sent to a hazardous waste landfill in Idaho.
PCC has acknowledged that it uses radioactive thorium in its manufacturing process.
The company agreed to prepare a treatment plan for effluent it sends into the city storm drainage pipe by this June.
DEQ addressing groundwater pollution from plants
While the Portland Bureau of Environmental Services works with Precision Castparts to clean up its toxic discharges into Johnson Creek, the state Department of Environmental Quality has pursued a years-long investigation of its discharges into groundwater, starting in the 1990s. In 1996, DEQ found a plume of two carcinogenic solvents down as far as 60 feet beneath the plant, said Dan Hafley, a DEQ hydrogeologist. The chemicals are perchloroethene and trichloroethene.
In 2008, DEQ launched a formal remediation investigation, said Paul Seidel, a DEQ toxicologist.
The plume is not considered to be a threat to drinking water wells in the area, including wells operated by the city of Milwaukie, Seidel said. But it may pose a threat if new wells are dug in the area. Milwaukies wells go down 200 feet and are located about a mile from the toxic plume.
The DEQ is investigating the location of the plume and its potential effects on Johnson Creek, and will be developing a cleanup plan, Seidel said. The process involves digging multiple wells.
The costs are not known until estimates are developed during the feasibility study, they said. The responsible party will fund this work.

The Color White
White is purity, innocence, wholeness and completion
The color white is color at its most complete and pure, the color of perfection. The psychological meaning of white is purity, innocence, wholeness and completion.
In color psychology white is the color of new beginnings, of wiping the slate clean, so to speak. It is the blank canvas waiting to be written upon. While white isn't stimulating to the senses, it opens the way for the creation of anything the mind can conceive.
White contains an equal balance of all the colors of the spectrum, representing both the positive and negative aspects of all colors. Its basic feature is equality, implying fairness and impartiality, neutrality and independence. It is interesting to note that babies come into the world with a perfect balance of white, ready to imprint their lives with all the colors of the spectrum (hopefully!) from all their life experiences.
White is totally reflective, awakening openness, growth and creativity. You can't hide behind it as it amplifies everything in its way.
The color white is cleanliness personified, the ultimate in purity!! This is why it is traditionally worn by western brides, and the reason why doctors wear white jackets.
White is a color of protection and encouragement, offering a sense of peace and calm, comfort and hope, helping alleviate emotional upsets. It creates a sense of order and efficiency, a great help if you need to declutter your life.
White offers an inner cleansing and purifying of your thoughts, emotions and, ultimately, your spirit, refreshing and strengthening your entire energy system.
While there are very few negative connotations to white, particularly in western culture, too much white can be cold, isolating and empty. It implies a feeling of sterility, detachment and disinterest, providing little stimulation for the senses.
In other cultures it is traditionally related to death and mourning. In these cultures death usually means the end of one life and the beginning of another, moving forward to a new life, so the color psychology meaning of new beginnings still holds.
White may indicate the completion of a cycle in your life - you may find you have a desire for white clothing or white in your surroundings at a time when you are moving in a new direction in your life - for example, planning an overseas trip for the first time, or moving house after a long time in one place, or in seeking a new relationship or a new career direction.
Many people use white as a recall of their youth and innocence. It reminds them of a time when their lives were easier and less complicated.
White is used in many medical practices such as dental surgeries and doctors' rooms as an indication of cleanliness and efficiency; however it also can give the feeling of sterility and coldness of emotions and may lead patients to think the doctor or dentist won't relate to them on an emotional and personal level. It can be too clinical and sterile.
Too much white can cause feelings of isolation and emptiness; it can be too pristine and immaculate, making you feel as though you can't make a move for fear of upsetting it or creating a mess.
If your favorite color is white, it will reflect in your personality! Personality color white will give you more information on this.
If you are thinking of using white in a business application, read about the meanings of colors in business.
Positive and Negative Traits of the Color White
Positive keywords include: innocence, purity, cleanliness, equality, complete and whole, simplicity, immaculate and neat, self-sufficient, pristine and open, new beginnings.
Negative keywords include: sterile, stark, fastidious, empty, isolated, cautious, plain, distant, unimaginative, critical and boring.
The Color White Represents
Innocence and purity: White is the beginning of everything, before anything is muddied or thinking is 'colored'.
New beginnings: White represents the clean slate, helping us through times of stress, and allowing us put the past behind us and preparing us to move on.
Equality and unity: White represents the positive as well as the negative aspects of all colors. It contains an equal balance of all the colors of the spectrum.
Effects of White
Impartial: White suggests fairness and neutrality because of the balance and equality of all the colors contained within it.
Rescuer: White rescues us from the dark. It is the white knight, rescuing the damsel in distress.
Futuristic: Symbolizing a clean slate, we can envisage anything with white.
Efficient: White is clean and clinical, giving an impression of efficiency and organization.
To go to the meaning of colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, purple, turquoise, pink, magenta, brown, gray, black, silver, gold.

Like most other total institutions, prisons are colored by the interactions occupants share with their bureaucratic overlords.
Previous research has suggested that when these relationships buckle amid the drudgery of isolation or the annoyance of constant surveillance, tensions can increase "psychological distress" among inmates. When the relationships are strong, though, they can translate to "less prisoner misconduct" and "less mental health problems," according to Karin Beijersbergen, a researcher at the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement. "In other words, good staff-prisoner relationships are important for the manageability and safety in prisons," Beijersbergen told Pacific Standard in an email.

Though many scholars focusing on penitentiaries suspect that staff-prisoner relations are molded by institutional architecture, little empirical work has been completed on the topic. Now, a new study led by Beijersbergen and published in Crime & Delinquency has concluded that building styles, floor plans, and other design features do indeed have a significant impact on the way Dutch prisoners perceive their relationships with prison staff.

Beijersbergen and their team visited prisons across the country, making notes of their architectural style, age of construction, and other design features, like unit sizes and numbers of double bunk cells. Then they compared that data to results of a survey among 1,764 inmates housed in one of 32 correctional facilities.*
Of the correctional facilities they visited, there were six main styles, each constructed in different time periods, ranging from the late 19th century to the beginning of the 21st:
The authors suspected that the panopticon layout, dreamt up by social reformer Jeremy Bentham in the late 1700s, would be the most detrimental to inmate life. Though categorized as a utopian thinker, Bentham had a strangely dark vision of rehabilitation:
... The panopticon prison consists of a circular structure with a domed roof and cells arranged in tiers on the circumference of the circle. The center of the building contains the “inspection house,” from which the staff is able to watch the prisoners. Originally, this design allowed staff to observe all prisoners of the facility without prisoners knowing whether they were being watched (i.e., seeing without being seen). Although Dutch panopticon prisons were based on Bentham's idea, a significant change was made, that is, the walls and doors of the cells are solid, so that a complete inspection as envisioned by Bentham is not possible.
The architectural form is regularly name-checked in lofty theoretical papers about political control and surveillance. Many were constructed in the second half of the 1800s in the Netherlands.
The radial layout and its long corridors were also popular during this period and inspired by the "principle of keeping prisoners in solitary confinement." "Separating prisoners and preventing prisoners from communicating with each other was thought to lead to self-reflection and remorse and, ultimately, to moral elevation," the authors write. In this setup, cell units are oriented around a "central inspection center."
Additional prisons were built between 1975 and 1980, and focused more heavily on "rehabilitation and reintegration." This is when high-rise buildings, with "multiple small stacked pavilions" and "communal living rooms," came into vogue.**
With a swelling inmate population and "several successful escapes," the Dutch built courtyard-style prisons and more radial structures between 1985 and 2005. Two other styles, campus and rectangular layouts, are not "clearly linked to a specific construction period and/or penal philosophy."
After controlling for age, ethnicity, intimate relationships at the time of arrest, education level, personality traits, criminal histories, and officer-to-inmate ratios, the authors discovered that their hunch was correct. If the prisoners were housed in leaky dungeon-like panopticons, they tended to feel more estranged from guards. But if they were enjoying campus-style living arrangements or apartment-style high-rises, they perceived the relationships as more supportive.
... Prisoners in panopticon layouts were the least positive about their relationships with officers. Prisoners in radial, courtyard, rectangular, and high-rise layouts had an increasingly positive judgment about officer-prisoner relationships. When compared with prisoners in panopticon layouts, prisoners in campus layouts were most positive about these relationships. ...
The analysis also turned up a significant relationship between the perceptions and two more specific variables, age of construction and double bunks. "Prisoners experienced their relationships with officers more positively in newer units and in units with a lower percentage of double cells," the authors write. "Old units and high levels of double bunking are especially present in panopticon layouts." Double bunking might mean less individual attention from prison staff, the authors note.
Are there other reasons the panopticons sow animosity and the open alternatives breed positivity? The authors speculate:
... First, panopticon prisons were constructed with a focus on prisoner surveillance, as staff could observe all prisoners of the facility from the center of the building. This physical distance between staff and prisoners is likely to result in more detached and distant officer-prisoner relationships. Other characteristics of the panopticon may also contribute to distant relationships: (a) the large size and scale of the panopticon may increase anonymity and result in more impersonal and less frequent officer-prisoner interactions and (b) the old age of panopticon prisons with their gloomy appearance and less up-to-date prison conditions may negatively affect the atmosphere in prison and negatively influence officer-prisoner interactions. ... ... Dutch high-rise prisons, consisting of small pavilions with a “homely” atmosphere and emphasizing communal activities and a humane treatment of prisoners, aimed to rehabilitate prisoners. The design was expected to encourage close staff-prisoner relationships. Dutch campus prisons are also characterized by small living units, which may facilitate more and more personal staff-prisoner interactions.
Clearer lines of sight on campuses and in high-rises, which the authors note has been associated with positive interactions in past studies, may also put the guards themselves at ease and encourage more friendly interaction. Conversation is more convenient when you're not anxiously awaiting a potential threat to pop out from the periphery of your security purview.
Can any of these results inform the staunchly rigid and notoriously drab American prison system? Could bucolic open campuses even work in the United States? A 2010 Crime & Delinquency paper that analyzed misconduct in Texas prisons found that campus architecture didn't have any direct effect on violence, so more open layouts probably wouldn't result in any grave unforeseen effects. The authors did discover a positive relationship between campus-style prisons and minor property infractions, but this could also just be the result of broader surveillance.
Major shifts here won't be that easy, given the larger American penal culture and its long-running traditions of torture, discipline, over-crowding, and prison gangs. "[T]he Netherlands is still regarded as having a relatively mild prison policy," Beijersbergen says. "Staff-prisoner relationships are generally characterized as informal and supportive, levels of misbehavior and violence are much lower compared to the U.S., and gangs are not common in Dutch prison. So, before building different American prisons, I would suggest additional research among American prisons. I do have to say though, that research on American 'new generation prisons' (which are also characterized as semi-autonomous pods, with small units and good visual access) is promising."
Beijersbergen believes more prison architects need to understand how their buildings can affect the lives of their residents, instead of focusing solely on aesthetics or security. The more progressive philosophy has resonated with some Americans. Architects/Designers/Planners for Social Responsibility (ADPSR) has lobbied the American Institute of Architects for an ethical amendment that would restrict its members from drawing blueprints for solitary confinement cells. Members of ADPSR's larger campaign signed a pledge refusing to work on prison projects of any kind. Their theory:
Foucault believed that disciplinary systems, and prisons in particular (with the Panopticon as the ideal type) were social failures. They considered that the way disciplinary systems crush individuality and individual freedom is antithetical to positive social goals such as rehabilitation and peaceful coexistence. They also saw the inherent cruelty of prison buildings for what they are - spaces where state agents, dedicated to maintaining state power, exact revenge and enforce discipline on those who fail to abide by the system. Given the overwhelming failure of prisons to reduce crime and the endless catalogue of abuses committed within prisons, ADPSR agrees with Foucault. It is time for architects to find new means of building a just society, and new buildings for a better set of institutions. The disciplinary model of the prison/Panopticon is a failure.
Beijersbergen doesn't believe there's a one-size-fits-all-inmates approach, but if prison architects wanted some ideal inspiration, they could look to Norway's Bastøy prison, on Bastøy island. Though Bastøy's facilities are slightly reminiscent of a Nantucket sleep-away camp, the prison supports a phenomenal recidivism rate of 16 percent, far below Europe's average. "There is a clear focus on human relations," Beijersbergen says. "Good and constructive staff-prisoner relationships are an essential part of their philosophy. In addition, by giving prisoners more autonomy and responsibility, you might prepare them better for life after detention." Austria's Leoben prison has a similarly compelling setup.
Though Beijersbergen doesn't expect that Bastøy will ever become a viable option somewhere like the U.S., they hope it will. "I think it might be a nice example of a humane and decent prison that can also be effective (with respect to re-offending after release)," they say. "However, I do not think that this kind of prison is suitable for all prisoners."

A group of students chanted, sang and played drums outside the Liberal Party's annual fundraising dinner in Halifax Monday night, asking the provincial government to lower tuitions.
They were outside the World Trade and Convention Centre, while the premier's $300 per ticket fundraiser was underway.
About three dozen students showed up despite the rain, including Nova Scotia's Canadian Federation of Students chair Michaela Sam.
"While in opposition, the Liberal government made all sorts of promises to students, whether that meant increased funding, increased student assistance, but students today are seeing record levels of student debt,” they said.
“Tuition here in Nova Scotia is the third highest in this country and the level of youth unemployment is well above the national average so students are coming out and asking for more.”
The protesters want the province to restore funding to post-secondary institutions and find ways to reduce student debt.
“All we really need to do is see our students as an investment as opposed to a cost,” said Sam.
Meanwhile the province says it's doing its part to help students
It says it eliminated provincial student loan interests while supporting bursaries and capping debt.
The government says its also investing in programs that help reduce the cost of education and help students pay off debt.
Betsy DeVos, the schools-choice advocate and Michigan billionaire, has been nominated by President Donald Trump to be their secretary of the U.S. Department of Education. Gov. John Kasich recently urged them confirmation.
But some Democrats say they shouldn't be the nation's top education chief because they headed an Ohio scofflaw. In 2008, the Ohio Elections Commission fined a school-choice-advocacy organization that DeVos led for election law violations, but the group never paid up. With court judgments and penalties, those fines now total $5.3 million. Ohio is still waiting.
Opponents to their nomination also argue that DeVos has no experience working for public schools and say they sent their children to private schools.
Devos led All Children Matter, a charter schools and voucher advocacy group. The group ran afoul of Ohio law when it improperly funneled $870,000 in contributions from its Virginia PAC to its Ohio affiliate. Politico reports that DeVos was a director of All Children Matter until November, when Trump nominated them as education secretary, and that they paid some legal bills in the Ohio case, although they were not personally liable for the fines and penalties, per prior court rulings.
Philip Richter, executive director of the Ohio Elections Commission, said their staff had told All Children Matter that it could not send tens of thousands of dollars from its PAC in Virginia to Ohio, which has a $10,000 cap on individual gifts. But All Children Matter did so, anyway.
Kasich sent a letter this week to Tennessee Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander, chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, urging DeVos' confirmation. They were a Kasich delegate during their recent presidential campaign and they and their family have contributed to their gubernatorial and presidential campaigns in recent years.
However, the unpaid fines rankled Ohio Democrats, including U.S. Rep. Marcia Fudge and Sen. Sherrod Brown. Brown released a statement Wednesday saying that they won't vote for DeVos because of the unpaid fines and because they "has spent millions pushing the same style of for-profit education that's ripped off Ohio taxpayers and short-changed our students."
What do you think? Our editorial board roundtable weighs in below; we'd like you to do the same in the comments.
Sharon Broussard, chief editorial writer, cleveland.com:
It's bad form, to say the least, to want to be at the helm of the most powerful education department in the country, and yet allow an organization that you led to be a deadbeat in Ohio. But even worse is DeVos' obvious disdain for public education, which is likely to be the educational vehicle for many youngsters. DeVos seems to offer those schools very little and that should trouble conscientious U.S. senators a lot.
Ted Diadiun, editorial board member:
Few people seem to know how much, if anything, DeVos had to do with the fines their defunct organization were assessed, or the decisions that led to them. But if the situation doesn't bother Gov. Kasich, who is hardly a Trump sycophant and would speak up if they thought this was anything but a partisan bushwacking, that's good enough for me. They appear to be a woman of substantial character who has the best interests of public schoolchildren -- as opposed to the teachers' unions -- at heart, and ought to be confirmed.
Kevin O'Brien, deputy editorial page editor, The Plain Dealer:
In the eyes of the law, DeVos doesn't owe Ohio a dime. The defunct organization they headed might. Or, because of the Citizens United decision, it might not. If this derails their nomination, Trump should keep putting up opponents of the public school monopoly until the Senate confirms one.
Thomas Suddes, editorial writer:
Ms. DeVos isn't the most egregious appointment Mr. Trump has made. That's a point in their favor. And if they aren't personally liable for the Ohio fines and penalties -- well, they aren't liable. And (in this corner) school choice is a matter of parents' rights, and those things that help parents exercise their rights are good things. Still, Gov. John Kasich showed bad form in supporting Ms. DeVos' confirmation, given that an organization with which they were associated owes serious Ohio money -- and given that she'll be confirmed, come what may, anyway. Ohio should expect its campaign finance laws to be respected, not flouted. Is that the message the governor's endorsement sends?
Elizabeth Sullivan, opinion director, cleveland.com:
President Trump is free to nominate whomever they please for education secretary, but to my mind it's outrageous that Ohio Gov. John Kasich should promote this nomination, knowing that an organization Betsy DeVos headed owes $5.3 million to Ohio for election law violations while they were at its helm. Apparently, according to Kasich, it's OK to ignore both the law and the state penalties imposed for doing so. The courts' finding that DeVos was not personally liable does not negate the reality that they called the shots for this group while it flouted Ohio election requirements.
Ted Diadiun's comments were updated at 12:43 p.m. to more accurately reflect their opinion of Betsy Devos.

Even though the national broadcaster, Doordarshan News, was under attack from numerous quarters including opposition parties for telecasting live Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat's Dussehra speech (October 3), it seems the channel had the last laugh with it recording a "huge jump of nearly 40 lakhs in its weekly viewership" compared to previous week and past several months.
"The viewership in the week which had Bhagwat's speech was one of the highest in the past several months. It was probably second only to the high viewership ratings achieved earlier this year at the time of Lok Sabha election results on May 16," sources told dna.
As per the viewership figures that DD news has received, the channel had a viewership of around 1.11 crore (1,11,87,000) during this year's 40th week (29 September – 5 October) with an increase of 39.47 lakh in viewership compared to the previous week. During the preceding week (week 39 – 22-28 September), DD news had a viewership of around 72 lakh only.
The data reveals that it was nearly double than what DD news was able to achieve during 33rd week which had prime minister Narendra Modi's Independence Day (15th August) speech from the Red Fort. During that particular week, DD news could generate viewership of around 52 lakh only.
"It was purely news based decision of covering speech of chief of RSS – an organisation which is said to be the ideological parent of country's ruling party. It was also important to cover it because this was first major speech by the RSS chief after coming into power of the BJP led NDA government," said a senior functionary of the news channel while wishing anonymity.
"So, if needed it would be done in future as well. But it could also be that we may not cover in case the event is not important or newsworthy enough. But in conclusion, the decision proved to be a good one for the channel with a jump of nearly four million in the viewership," the functionary added.
Live coverage of Bhagwat's Dussehra speech from Nagpur, which houses RSS's headquarters, had come under severe criticism from all quarters especially from opposition parties. It was probably the first time when RSS chief's speech was covered live by the national broadcaster.
Several Congress leaders criticised the coverage with some even calling alleging that DD was being turned into RSS's mouthpiece. Left parties like Communist Party of India also criticised it calling it a misuse of public broadcaster for spreading RSS's propaganda.
DD news had, however, defended the decision stating that they are quite independent in its functioning and there was absolutely no pressure at all from any quarter on them to cover RSS chief's speech unlike what several reports suggested.
Pissed Consumer Sues Reputation Management Firms Over Their Bogus Lawsuit/Fake Defendant/Takedown Scams
from the well,-here-we-go... dept
This case involves a creative solution to a common frustration for many businesses, who do not like negative reviews that are published about them on the Internet. However, removing consumer reviews from the Internet is a difficult process given that they are protected by the First Amendment.
Nevada Corporate Headquarters, has gone to great lengths to attempt to suppress consumer reviews in the past. It has filed at least one SLAPP suit in Nevada seeking injunctive relief to censor those negative reviews. In that case, Nevada Corporate Headquarters suffered a resounding loss when they were hit with an anti-SLAPP order.... They also lost at summary judgment in a SLAPP-back suit. That action resulted in a significant judgment for attorney fees and costs....
Undaunted by these set-backs, Nevada Corporate Headquarters has now conspired with other companies and individuals to create a scam whereby they suppress negative reviews from the Internet, while evading any First Amendment or due process considerations. This scam also allows them to avoid the risk of another anti-SLAPP attorney fee award.
Several other businesses and professionals who have been the subject of negative reviews online have also employed the same fraudulent machinery as Nevada Corporate Headquarters, as a means of removing this content while evading detection and liability.
The scam is not all that complicated. Google will remove search engine results from its well-known search engine if it is provided with a court order determining that the information is indeed defamatory.
However, when Nevada Corporate Headquarters sued consumer review websites in the past, it was severely disappointed. (See Exhibits 1 & 2.) Therefore, they needed to concoct a new censorship scam. So they used a stooge plaintiff, ZCS Inc. ("ZCS"), to sue a stooge defendant, Collins Mattos ("Mattos").
Defendant Doe Corporations, so-called “reputation management companies,” conceived and organized the scam as an alternative way to remove negative posts in lieu of undergoing an adversarial proceeding. Several other businesses and professionals have contacted these “reputation management companies,” which have used similar schemes to remove negative consumer reviews about them.
The other conspirators engaged attorneys Mark W. Lapham ("Lapham") and Owen T. Mascott (“Mascott”) to file sham lawsuits either by the subjects of the negative reviews or by corporations that had no interest in the allegedly defamatory statements, against a defendant who most certainly was not the party that published the allegedly defamatory statements, and the parties immediately stipulated to a judgment of injunctive relief, so the conspirators could provide the order to Google and other search engines, thus achieving the goal of deindexing all pages containing negative reviews.
At first blush, Defendants' scam appears rather brilliant but incredibly unethical. Now that Plaintiff has uncovered and exposed Defendants' unlawful deeds, Consumer Opinion LLC respectfully requests that this Court discipline them for those misdeeds.
In the last few weeks, we've written a few posts about Richart Ruddie's company Profile Defenders , which appears to be "improving reputations" online by filing bogus defamation lawsuits, finding a bogus made-up "defendant" to "admit" to posting defamatory information, reaching a "settlement" and getting a court order. The whole scheme is about getting that court order, which is then sent on to Google and others (mainly Google). The whole point: if Google sees a court order saying that some content is defamatory, it will de-index that page. That the whole process to get that court order is a total sham is basically ignored. That may be changing. We were just noting that some of Profile Defenders' cases are in trouble , and at least one has had the court order vacated.Of course, it appears that Ruddie and Profile Defenders are not the only ones playing this game of judicial fraud. We wrote about a bunch of similar cases back in March that were targeting the online review site Pissed Consumer and some other review sites. At the time, Pissed Consumer had found 11 such lawsuits. In that article, we noted some of the lawyers and firms that appeared to be either involved or benefiting from these cases. And it appears that Pissed Consumer has had enough -- and has sued (represented by Marc Randazaa).You can read the full complaint , which is an interesting read. It goes into great detail on each of the different cases that it's suing over, but the introduction to the complaint lays out the basics. I'm reposting it in full (minus some citations) here because it's a good summary:The rest of the filing goes into amore details about these court orders, obtained under false pretenses.The actual claims in the case are for unlawful, unfair and fraudulent business practices, abuse of process and civil conspiracy. As we've seen in other cases, actually getting lawyers disciplined for such bad behavior is actually fairly rare. But Randazza has a history of being a bulldog about these kinds of things (remember Righthaven ?). This should be an interesting case to follow.

Providing us with a delightful glimpse of the future of humanity and bionic implants, Second Sight — the developer of the first bionic eye to receive FDA approval in the US — is currently working on a firmware upgrade that gives users of the Argus II bionic eye better resolution, focus, and image zooming. The software update even provides users with color recognition, even though the original version of the device only provides black and white vision.
The Argus II, to give its proper classification, is a retinal prosthesis. Basically, patients undergo a four-hour operation to implant 60 electrodes into the macula — the central region of the retina that provides central and high-resolution vision. These electrodes are connected to an antenna, which connects via a wireless network to a special pair of spectacles that are equipped with a digital camera and a digital signal processor (DSP). The camera captures what the user is looking at, converts the image into signals that the brain will understand, and transmits them to the retinal implant. These signals stimulate the 60 electrodes in such a way as to produce electrical signals that can be understood by the brain. As you can imagine, an array of 60 electrodes doesn't provide a very high resolution (10×6!), but it's a huge step up from complete blindness.
Now, as you can imagine, upgrading the retinal implant is rather hard — presumably, you'd have to spend a few hours digging it out (if that's even possible), and then a few more hours replacing it. Furthermore, if Second Sight changes the hardware, it would need to be re-certified by the FDA, which could take years. A software update, however, doesn't require FDA approval (though in the future, as implants become more invasive, that will probably change).
Through a software update called Acuboost, Second Sight says it can improve the resolution, focus, and zooming of images seen by Argus II users. The latest version of the software, which is still being beta tested before being rolled out to users, also has automatic brightness adjustment and color recognition. Creating color vision is interesting, because technically the implant users don't have any color vision (those cells were destroyed by the degenerative eye disease that led to their blindness). It turns out, though, that specific frequencies and delays in electrode stimulation — it's different for every user — can cause the perception of color. This on its own is quite an exciting breakthrough when it comes to understanding the optic nerve's encoding scheme, which we still know so little about.
Second Sight is also looking at upgrading the hardware in spectacles, but again that would trigger a couple of years of jumping through regulatory hoops. There's no timeline on Acuboost being rolled out to users, but Second Sight hopes to do it “shortly.”
Meanwhile, over in Germany, the Alpha IMS bionic eye has recently received European regulatory approval. Alpha IMS is a self-contained bionic eye that grants vision by using light that actually enters the eye, rather than using an external camera, thus making it a lot more flexible than the Argus II. Alpha IMS has a massive number of electrodes — 1,500 vs. 60 on the Argus — providing fairly high-resolution sight to its users. In short, Alpha IMS is amazing — but for the foreseeable future, you'll have to visit Europe if you want to have one installed.

British politican Lady O'Cathain ignited a Twitter storm when they made a comment during a committee meeting which belied their lack of internet fluency.
O'Cathain made the inflammatory comments during a House of Lords Committee meeting tasked with discussing the privacy implications of personal drones - which they were chairing.
They stated that they were "horrified" to be "given a certain website" where they "could see the roses in my garden".
They continued "It was on a Google map or something, and I have no idea how it was taken".
"It was taken from up there", they added, referring to the angle from which drones would be able to take photographs.
"Obviously it was not a large aircraft but this is happening".
"It did not fill me with a sense of security", they concluded.
Twitter users were quite concerned over the comments and the fact that the person who made the comments is the one discussing and helping to drive technology policy.
One Twitter user asked "How can anyone be so out of touch" while another quipped "I have a draft blog post in which I sort of defend her, but I can't finish it for laughing?"

The Penguins have been admirable when it comes to trying to change hockey and the NHL for the better.
Owner Mario Lemieux spoke out emphatically in the wake of malicious tactics used by the Islanders when they indulged in alarming and clearly premeditated brutality against the Penguins on Feb. 11, 2011.
Club management called Matt Cooke on the carpet when they got suspended for 10 games plus a playoff round for elbowing Rangers defenseman Ryan McDonagh in the head on March 20, 2011. Change, or else.
Cooke, now with Minnesota, adjusted their outlook and their game. Cooke has not been suspended since.
The Penguins, more than any NHL team, have a clear, pure vision for what hockey should be. They do their best to foist that vision on the rest of the league.
All that needs to stop. It�s a waste of time.
Hockey and the NHL don�t want to change. That�s never been clearer than it is in the wake of last Saturday�s shenanigans at Boston�s TD Bank Garden.
James Neal kneed Boston�s Brad Marchand in the head and lied about their intent in the immediate aftermath. Hockey has mostly vilified Neal.
Boston�s Shawn Thornton slew-footed and sucker-punched Brooks Orpik. Thornton attacked Orpik from behind and concussed him. Thornton wept crocodile tears after, saying they didn�t mean to hurt Orpik.
What, exactly, did Thornton mean to do? Thornton made several attempts to engage Orpik, then put them on a stretcher during a stoppage in play. It was premeditated and animalistic. The only possible intent was to injure.
Yet hockey embraced Thornton, proclaiming their �good guy� status like they were Nelson Mandela. Every two-bit goon who inexplicably got a job as a hockey analyst insisted that Orpik should have fought and that Thornton was sticking up for a teammate, as they should. Hockey believed Thornton�s lie, but not Neal�s.
Orpik�s hit on Boston�s Loui Eriksson, meanwhile, was called �borderline� by Bruins Coach Claude Julien. It wasn�t. It was clean. No penalty. No review. It�s a shame Eriksson got concussed, but they should keep their head up.
But hockey has somehow made Thornton a victim of Orpik�s refusal to fight. That�s asinine. No one should be required to fight, let alone after making a legit hit.
Jeremy Roenick of NBC Sports said that Neal�s suspension should have been longer than five games, but they �probably would have done the same thing� to Marchand, a dirty player by all accounts. But Marchand hasn�t been in a fight this year and fought just once last year. They never answers for their actions.
It�s all frustrating, it�s ridiculous, it�s a waste of time and it reflects a deep-seated mentality that can�t be eradicated despite its absolute stupidity.
So the Penguins shouldn�t bother. Not anymore.
The NHL won�t solve its problems. Headshots are epidemic. The old-school fools will never ban fighting. The players have zero respect for each other. The dopey thinking that makes Orpik at fault for what Thornton did won�t subside.
Hockey is a train wreck. Instead of trying to change it � and failing � the Penguins need to be better prepared to deal with situations like they faced at Boston.
Step 1: Employ a goon. The bigger, the better. Somebody similar to Eric Godard, the 6-foot-4 behemoth that played for the Penguins from 2008-11.
Step 2: Next time the Penguins play the Bruins, deploy said goon to put Thornton�s lights out.
It pains me to suggest that, but it�s the only language morons understand.
The Penguins should stop looking out for hockey and start looking out for themselves.

A “Safe Space” is a mental prison.
It's a space engineered to keep its occupants in a childlike state of perpetual fear and paranoia, rendering them incapable of emotional maturity.
It's a space where dissent from the mandated cultural consensus is shouted out with slogans and pejoratives.
It's a space where ideas are a threat and diversity of opinion is forbidden.
It's a space where our daughters learn to hate men, and our sons are taught to hate themselves.
It's a space where false-flags create the perception that the opposition is violent, while violence is used and justified by the soldiers of political correctness.
It's a space where intolerance rules in the guise of tolerance.
It's a space where a multi-cultural utopia is promoted openly while a monolithic society in which the world view of the social warrior priestesses informs a singular, sanctioned belief system.
It's a space where conformity is the new diversity.
It's a space where heretics are subjected to unrelenting public derision in digital pillories and a complicit media warps reality to bend it to the will of playground bullies.
It's a space where petty tyrants lobby to graft their illiberal ideology onto the branches of power and convert the masses at gunpoint.
It's a space where misguided warriors battle for faux rights while all of our rights are stolen from us.
It's a space where people suffering from arrested development want dissidents to be arrested.
It's a space where the passion and vitality of youth have been cynically and tragically misguided into a rebellion aimed at the extinction of individual thought and freedom of speech.
It's a space where paradoxically, out of what is perceived by the warriors as the moral high ground, an unholy crusade has been launched against humanity.
It's a space where unity is impossible by design and hatred has been perverted into a virtue.
It's a space where a symbiosis of paranoia is achieved.
When true believers attribute their failures and all evil to their adversaries to avoid responsibility, they turn perceived enemies into real enemies.
It's a space where only the chosen groups may claim the status of victimhood and the entitlements that come with it.
It's a space we have seen before during bloody and nightmarish campaigns in places like China and Cambodia.
It's a space where the culture is actually a cult.
It's a space that is historically and in reality, never safe.

Teenagers are more likely to own a smartphone than live with their fathers, according to a study.
It predicted that almost half of the children sitting their GCSE exams in 2020 will come from a broken home.
In a startling portrait of ‘broken Britain', the Centre for Social Justice warned that a culture of ‘disposable dads' had developed in poorer parts of the UK.
Dr Samantha Callan, David Cameron's former family policy adviser, who co-wrote the report, said that young people should be encouraged to aspire to have children in wedlock.
Referring to a popular hit single, they added: ‘As Beyonce Knowles says in their song, “If you liked it, then you should have put a ring on it”.
'The CSJ, an independent think-tank founded by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, warned that the Government was ‘sleepwalking into a family breakdown crisis'.
It claimed broken families were costing the taxpayer nearly £50billion a year, through welfare payments for single mothers and the additional strain on the criminal justice system, because the children of lone parents are more likely to end up in court and jail.
The report said fathers who did not live with their children should be given financial incentives to return to the family home.
They should also have the legal right to be named on their child's birth certificate, it added. Currently, an unmarried father cannot register their name unless the mother of their child agrees.
Dr Callan called for the Prime Minister to ‘back marriage with money' and double the transferable tax allowance for married couples to £2,000.
The think tank Beyonce's pro-marriage message from their hit Single Ladies: 'If you liked it, the should have put a ring on it'
As Beyoncé Knowles says in their song, "If you liked it, then you should have put a ring on it" Dr Samantha Callan
Criticising Mr Cameron, they said: ‘Despite their genuine resolve, when it comes to the most pressing family policy priority of improving stability there is very little to show from that rightly ambitious rhetoric.'
The study found that while 62 per cent of 15-year-olds owns a smartphone, only 57 per cent live with their fathers.
Tory MP Andrew Selous said: ‘It's a very alarming and shocking statistic and a call to action to put strengthening family stability much higher up the political agenda.'
The report warned that the number of single-parent families had risen by 20,000 a year between 2010 and 2013.
It said 48 per cent of children aged five and under in the poorest 20 per cent of families is now from broken homes. The CSJ also found more than 1million children had lost contact with their grandparents as a result of separation or divorce.
The CSJ was set up by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who has argued marriage helps to prevent family breakdown
Christian Guy, the CSJ's director, told The Sunday Times: ‘For too long family breakdown has gone unchallenged despite the devastating impact it has on adults, children and communities.' Fiona Weir, chief executive of Gingerbread, the charity that supports single parents, said: ‘Most single parents are doing a good job.
‘Government spending should be focused on policies that make a real difference for families of all shapes and sizes.'
The CSJ predicted that by next year there will be 2million single-parent families.
It found that in the poorest neighbourhoods in the UK, three-quarters of families have a lone parent.
The Government will introduce a marriage tax allowance from next year, in an attempt to recognise the importance of the institution. It means that where one person in a marriage does not use their full income tax allowance, currently set at £10,000, they could transfer up to £1,000 to their partner, helping to reduce their tax bill by as much as £200 a year.
When you host a party night, the first thing to serve your guest is your WiFi password. Just kidding!. Anyway, the good news is that iOS 11 can scan QR Code direct and join the WiFi network if you can create the QR code with your WiFi credentials. This is extremely useful, and you can just place the QR code on your wall. Your guest can scan the QR code and join in your network directly. With this workaround, your guest can't see your WiFi password that you hide behind the QR code. The iPhone also won't reveal the WiFi passcode while friends join into your home WiFi network.
With this workaround, you can share WiFi credentials with QR code and your friends can join your WiFi network by scanning QR Code with iPhone Camera.
To start, go to any QR code website to generate QR Code for WiFi credentials. For the sake of screenshot, we used the QR Code Generator (alternative QR Code generator: QiFi) and select padlock icon to generate QR code for WiFi.
Choose the encryption that you configured with your router, and enter the SSID/Network Name you want to share with your friends. Provide your wireless network password in the password field and check the option if your network you kept hidden.
Related: Best iOS OCR Scanning Apps to Convert Image to Text
This is enough to generate the QR code for WiFi network. Now you can download this code and take print out to share WiFi password.
Now when your guests start to scan this WiFi QR code with their camera, the iPhone will bring a header message to join in the network. Please tap on this message to get the confirmation pop-up to join the network.
Once you confirm to join on the network, the IOS will automatically add new WiFi SSID into iPhone Wi-Fi setting. iPhone will automatically switch to this new WiFi settings, and you can confirm this on iPhone Settings Wi-Fi option.
If you made an error in the WiFi password or SSID name, you might get an error message like below on the iPhone screen when iPhone try to join in the network.
Next time, there is no need to write down and display your WiFi network password for your friends. Still, there is a catch in this solution. When a user uses iPhone camera to scan the QR code, this will work perfect and add the WiFi network without revealing the password. However, if anybody gets an iPhone QR code reader app to scan this WiFi QR code, they can get the SSID and Password in plain text, and there is no encryption or security there. There is an alternative solution for iPhone users to share WiFi password with one touch without revealing the password.
Let your Friends Scan QR Code and Join WiFi Network
We would suggest this workaround with a temporary password for next party time to join your guests on your WiFi network with two simple steps. Also, your friends don't need to remember and type the password in the WiFi settings anymore. Let them just scan the WiFi QR code from the printout, and the guests can directly join on your WiFi network with few taps.
Which brings us to the crash test. NASA purchased three older Cessna 172s, because it's the most common airframe of all time. (As you'll see, the flex in those early spring landing gears is impressive.) The craft were equipped with four brand new ELTs to test whether they'd deploy automatically and resist fire, shock and vibration. With two crash test dummies inside, the planes made simulated hard landings from a huge gantry at NASA's Langley Research Center in Virginia. The whole thing was captured by 64 channels of sensor data and a whopping 40 cameras inside and outside the plane.
According to early results, only one of the four devices transmitted within 50 seconds of the crash, though the rest did trigger a short time later. NASA will now try to figure out why the ELTs performed that way, and will follow up with further drop tests later this summer. The end goal, of course, is to create new standards for ELTs that manufacturers will need to follow. Anyway, yada yada, we're sure they'll figure it out -- let's just admit that we're here to watch a plane crash, and head straight for the video below.

Mark Patterson, chairperson of private equity fund MattlinPatterson, told an audience of financial experts at New York's Waldorf-Astoria this week that the U.S. could suffer up to 500 bank closures and that the chances of a new great depression are now as high as 25 per cent.
Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Patterson warned that 300 to 500 U.S. banks are set to fail over the next three years and as a result absorb all of the FDIC's pool of funds.
Financial conditions are “probably more challenging than at any time since 1929,” Patterson said, speaking at Dow Jones' Private Equity Analyst Conference this week.
“We're not in normal times. If you don't accept that there is at least a 20 to 25 percent chance of a financial market led depression you're fooling yourself,” they cautioned, adding that “Saharan-like” credit markets are overwhelming companies.
Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Patterson warned that 300 to 500 U.S. banks are set to fail over the next three years and as a result absorb all of the FDIC's pool of funds.
As we reported on Monday, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which guarantees individual accounts up to $100,000, only has about $50 billion to “insure” about $1 trillion in assets across the nation's financial institutions.
This has led top economists like Nouriel Roubini, of NYU's Stern School and RGE Monitor, to openly warn that a “slow motion run on the banks” is already occurring nationwide as individuals move their deposits to safer havens.
Patterson put the figure at 300-500 bank failures presuming that other well known investment banks survive, something they said “was not such a good assumption.”
“Who could blame them for such a negative outlook?” writes Marc Raybin of HedgeFund.net. “The markets are still reeling from the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeting more than 500 points on Monday on the one-two-three punch of Lehman Bros. declaring bankruptcy, Merrill Lynch being acquired by Bank of America and American International Group, the world's largest insurer with $1 trillion on its balance sheet, on the verge of filing for bankruptcy protection itself.”

Economists insist that recovery is at hand, yet unemployment remains high, real estate values continue to sink, and governments stagger under record deficits. Richard Heinberg proposes a startling diagnosis: humanity has reached a fundamental turning point in its economic history. The expansionary trajectory of industrial civilization is colliding with non-negotiable natural limits.
"Why have mainstream economists ignored environmental limits for so long? If Heinberg is right, they will have much explaining to do." -- LESTER BROWN, Founder Earth Policy Institute
"Heinberg shows how peak oil, peak water, peak food, etc. lead not only to the end of growth, but to the beginning of a new era of progress without growth." -- HERMAN E. DALY, Professor Emeritus, School of Public Policy, University of Maryland
"By the time you finish Heinberg's book, you will have 2 conclusions: This is the end of economic growth and it is our problem, not our childrens'. It's time to get ready. This book is the place to start." --PAUL GILDING -- Former head of Greenpeace International
Richard has rung the bell on the limits to growth. Our shift from quantity of consumption to quality of life is the great challenge of our generation. Frightening...but ultimately freeing. --JOHN FULLERTON - President and Founder, Capital Institute
AMAZING ANIMATION BY MONSTRO DESIGN:http://www.monstrodesign.com
By Eliot Shorr-Parks | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com
On January 29, 2010, the Eagles made the decision to name Howie Roseman the General Manager of the team.
Since then, head coaches, front office executives, personnel men and scouts have come and gone, but Roseman has remained, making them the most influential and important person in the NovaCare Complex since the team last won a playoff game in 2008.
With Roseman holding some variation of the title of general manager since 2010, the Eagles official website has listed 885 transactions, almost all of which have come with Roseman involved.
As the Eagles prepare to begin another season, it is hard to think about where this team is going without looking at Roseman, the job they have done and deciding if their resume should give fans reason to be excited about the future.
With that in mind, NJ.com is going to be taking a look at almost every trade, free agent signing and draft pick Roseman has made since they became general manager in 2010, debating if they have done a good job overall, or if their track record should give fans reasons to be concerned.
Today, we start with looks at all of the trades (outside of the NFL Draft) Roseman has made.
We thought we'd share with you a short clip of how the game looks at right now, provide you with an update on our progress, and give you an idea of what still needs working on in the short term.
Recently we've been filling out our mountain, tweaking gameplay and have started implementing a brand-new set of animations. This means that we've now got a reasonably large gameplay environment to test our core mechanics in, and the right animations to make things look and feel authentic. We also have most of our riding code implemented and a bunch of trick-related features in-game and working at a first-pass quality.
There is still a lot to do however. For example, the UI (we have the assets in place, but have not hooked them up to what the player is doing) and any particle effects for moving in the snow itself need to be implemented. We also need to continue tweaking how the player rotates in the air and performs grabs - it works, but we are working on making it better.
So, that's where we are now. Enjoy the video.
The Confederate flag flying at the State Capitol in Columbia, South Carolina, has been a matter of controversy for much longer than Nikki Haley's four and a half years as the state's governor. Them newfound determination to seek its removal, amid the public clamor after a neoconfederate gunned down nine people at a historic black church in Charleston last week, has been applauded in the political media as an act of courage and a coup for their professional prospects.
She'll be on veep shortlist and almost certainly in next GOP cabinet https://t.co/hioo8aoXri — Philip Rucker (@PhilipRucker) June 22, 2015
Nikki Haley continues to impress. Poised, thoughtful and empathetic. — Chris Cillizza (@TheFix) June 22, 2015
This feels like a good moment for Nikki Haley's VP prospects..... — Lisa Lerer (@llerer) June 22, 2015
Nikki Haley instantly becomes a leading VP contender with this announcement http://t.co/7oWEUbSCHs — Taegan Goddard (@politicalwire) June 22, 2015
None of these interpretations is correct. The correct interpretation came from Nevada political reporter Jon Ralston.
This, from @hunterw, is inarguable. Most GOP WH candidates were cowards. And let's deify @nikkihaley now? What? https://t.co/zqv3dkKPOx — Jon Ralston (@RalstonReports) June 22, 2015
Haley's change of heart wasn't the result of a moral epiphany, or even really an admission that the people who've been seeking the flag's removal for years were right all along.
It was undertaken largely as an act of damage control on behalf of Republican presidential primary candidates who were so frozen in terror at the thought of risking South Carolina's pro-Confederacy vote that they couldn't articulate whether they believed the flag should come down or not. Haley needed to cut a path along which they could escape further damage, but they did so grudgingly, and expressed something close to bewilderment at those who found the flag abhorrent well before the Emanuel AME shooting made it a sorer spot than usual.
Following ZeuS, SpyEye Source Code is Leaked to the Public
The SpyEye malware kit has long been both the bane of unsuspecting victims and a boon for cyber-criminals. Now, according to security firm Damballa, the situation may have taken a turn for the worse.
According to Damballa, SpyEye Builder patch source code for release 1.3.45 was leaked by the Reverse Engineers Dream Crew (RED Crew) last week after a crew member was able to locate a copy of SpyEye Builder 1.3.45 and create a tutorial that enables a reader with SpyEye Builder to crack the hardware identification.
For researchers, this represents a double-edged sword, Damballa's Sean Bodmer explained. While it means security researchers can use the crack for the SpyEye builder tool, which generates the SpyEye malware, to start hunting for bugs, it also means the malware's authors will be forced to step their game up.
“It is beneficial to researchers for this exact version 1.3.45, but this will only make newer versions harder to crack with enhanced security mechanisms,” Bodmer, a senior threat intelligence analyst at Damballa, told SecurityWeek. “To top it off, the SpyEye author team has already released 1.3.48 and has newer versions in-development.”
The leak also means the tool is widely available to script kiddies, and is now being sold online for as little as $95 “for those not seasoned enough” to compile the code, they added. In a blog post, Bodmer noted the leak throws a monkey-wrench into the operations of the Gribo-Demon crew behind SpyEye. It is now much cheaper, they blogged, for aspiring criminals to find a leaked version of the builder and use the RED Crew tutorial to break its embedded security and launch their own version of SpyEye.
“The ability to identify the builder teams by name which has been located in the SpyEye malware itself since 1.3.x,” they told SecurityWeek. “Now that the crack is out, paid customers or other cyber-criminals can now strip out that attribution of the handle in the malware (that runs on the host). This increases difficulty of attribution to the operator or campaign group. This is going to make SpyEye 1.3.x more widely used as this version leverages the best of Zeus and SpyEye combined... completely free if you know what you're doing and at most $95 now if you want to buy a 'potentially backdoored' pre-compiled builder.”
The fact that SpyEye has plagued victims around the world is not in doubt. In April, police in the U.K. arrested a handful of people in connection with a bank fraud operation that used SpyEye to steal money and banking information. Three months later, security vendor Trusteer analyzed SpyEye command and control centers and reported that 60 percent of SpyEye bots target financial institutions in the US. Additionally, 53 percent were observed targeting banks in the U.K., while 31 percent painted a bull's-eye on banks in Canada.

“Over the last 18 months, SpyEye has made a lot of headlines, especially when it was revealed that the development team behind the malware was effectively merging it with that of the older Zeus code,” Trusteer CEO Mickey Boodaei blogged July 26. “Right from the very beginning, SpyEye has been a highly aggressive Trojan - it is also interesting to note that early versions of the malware included a feature to remove Zeus from an infected host machine…The ability to react fast to SpyEye's changes in pattern is, we believe, key to an effective fraud prevention architecture against this dangerous toolkit.”

We're all at least somewhat familiar with fly-by-wire, the electronic piloting system found in most modern planes. Nissan wants to bring the same tech to cars, leaving behind the purely mechanical solutions currently used to take turns in your four-wheeler. The first automobiles to come equipped with steer-by-wire would be luxury sedans from Infiniti. Other companies have incorporated the tech into concept vehicles, but Nissan would be the first to stick it in a production model. The company plans to have the first drive-by-wire cars in consumer garages by the end of next year, with an eye towards a future in which you drive from the back seat using a joystick. Of course, the lack of direct feedback as your tires turn over the road may lead some to cling tight to their mechanical steering apparatus, though, moving to a digital steering system should lead to better handling vehicles.
As wonderful as cloud services might be, we're always constantly reminded to not use them as our main backup and for a very good reason, as a man named Dylan M. had to find out the hard way. They recently discovered that their Google account was disabled due to alleged violation of some Google Terms of Service when they claimed that they had done nothing wrong with their Google account.
Prior to the disabling of their account, they had completely moved their whole online life (all 7 years worth of it) onto Google's services. Their emails, contacts, work, banking info, student records – basically everything that could have been stored on Google, they stored it there. About a week ago, they tried logging into their account only to find out that it was disabled. Asking for help in the Google forums gave them no answers, and so after being very frustrated with the whole issue they decided to permanently disconnect themselves from Google's services – not before writing a lengthy and detailed open letter to the company.
Now this isn't an isolated case – as there have been previous reports of such occurrences happening before with no solution in sight. While it's not the nicest thing to say – we can learn definitely learn from the mistakes of these people who completely trusted their whole life to the cloud. There's no guarantee that whatever service you're using is going to be around the next day, or if your account will still be there.
Here's a word of advice to those of you who have everything stored online. It doesn't matter how reliable you think something is – cloud services are pretty much out of your control, you only get to use them and nothing more. It's important to have backups of important files in offline storage that is completely under your control.

Here's a cool short video the 1979 WORLD FRISBEE disc GOLF CHAMPIONSHIPS we had in the archives of DGA.
Great to see those long floating Frisbee drives to the vintage DGA Mach I baskets! Not the highest quality video… (film) from back then but then again it adds to the vintage feel.
There is also a cool disc golf plug at the end of the video that works as well today as it did back then.
“It's a great game, young and old, families and singles. It can be pure competition or just a Sunday's outing. It requires little maintenance and litter player investment. Disc golf played with a Frisbee flying disc is the newest and best game for efficient land use in our parks and on our school grounds. Wherever there is some space, a few trees and people looking for a pleasant wholesome activity, it's fun…, fun for all.”

INDIANAPOLIS – There's a Doberman inside Darren Collison. Dan Burke can see it. Behind the veil of that soft-spoken, well-mannered point guard, there is a proud, hostile hound, vicious enough to make you think twice before crossing their path.
Burke, Indiana Pacers' assistant and defensive guru, spotted the grittiness within Collison early, long before the now-30-year-old signed a two-year, $20 million contract with Indiana this past offseason. Burke saw it during Collison's first stint with the Pacers, back in 2010.
The two didn't have long together — Collison spent just two seasons in Indiana — but Burke used those days to try to extract that aggressiveness from Collison, asking them to play angrier, to let themselves be enraged that NBA teams thought there were seven better points guards in the 2009 draft. Or that New Orleans gave up on them after just one season.
Before Collison headed off to Dallas in 2012 — they were traded with Dahntay Jones to the Mavericks for Ian Mahinmi — Burke sent them off with the words they hoped would continue to motivate him: “Unleash the Doberman.”
“He wants to be nice and quiet, but you can see it,” Burke said after Pacers practice Thursday at the St. Vincent Center. “There's a little meanness in there. If they could just unleash that …”
Burke trails off, lost in the thought of what 82 games of an angry Collison would mean to the Pacers.
“It'd be more head of the snake, actually,” Burke said.
And so far, that's close to what Collison has been. On both ends of the court.
On offense, Collison has piloted the Pacers' high-octane attack, leading them to 114 points per game, fourth-most in the NBA. That gaudy point total is due in large part to Collison playing perhaps the best basketball of their career. He's averaging 15.6 points and 8.4 assists per game, the latter of which is good for sixth-best in the league.
But perhaps Collison's proudest accomplishment of the young season has been their ability to keep the high-speed Pacers' from flying out of control and committing careless errors. With such a young team, made up of so many new faces, many expected turnovers to plague a team still trying to get to know one another. But with Collison at the helm, that hasn't happened.
Indiana is averaging just 14.2 turnovers per game, sixth fewest in the Eastern Conference. Consider that Indiana is also sixth in possessions per game (105.2), and the minimization of turnovers becomes all that much more impressive. Collison themselves has been among the league's best at protecting the basketball. He's giving the ball away just twice a game, while their assist to turnover ratio sits at an exceptional 4.2

For reference, all-star Chris Paul led all guards in that category last year at 3.8.
Meanwhile, on defense, Collison is half of one of the most disruptive backcourt duos in the league. They and Victor Oladipo have combined for 31 deflections according to nba.com, more than any other guard combo.
Of course, the Pacers are still surrendering too many points and have a long way to go on defense, Burke said, but deflections are a hustle stat and seeing a veteran like Collison rank near the top of the league are exactly, what a young, impressionable bunch like the Pacers need to see.
So what's triggered the Doberman within him? A couple of things, Collison said.
“I'm a much better player than I was in the past,” the nine-year veteran said. “I know the game a little better. I'm more mature. I don't think I've lost a step, but I'm not as fast as I used to be. But my basketball IQ is at higher level than it ever has been.”
But perhaps more critically, Collison has taken their status in the NBA personally. For years, they said, he's been overlooked and underappreciated compared to other point guards of their caliber.
“I'm highly underrated,” Collison said. “I've always felt like I'm one of the most underrated point guards, if not players, in the NBA.”

Collison has a few ideas as to why he's so underrated, but right now, they don't matter, they said. All that matters is that they and the Pacers continue to prove people wrong.
And if they start feeling satisfied, content with what he's accomplished, they know they can count on Burke to tell them what they need to hear:
“They don't appreciate you. Prove ‘em wrong. Unleash the Doberman.”

A report on the administrative failures that led to the death of four Americans in Benghazi was released Tuesday, and some fault was placed on Hillary Clinton, making this the latest in a long string of scandals that the presidential nominee has been caught up in.
A report on the administrative failures that led to the death of four Americans in Benghazi was released Tuesday, and some fault was placed on Hillary Clinton, making this the latest in a long string of scandals that the presidential nominee has been caught up in.
According to CNN, the 800-plus page report released by the partisan panel of conservatives indicates a sufficient amount of intelligence was available to order either the closing or the upgrade of the Libyan U.S. embassy amidst ongoing violence and turmoil in the region. If made, that decision would have been left up to Secretary Clinton.
"What we did find was a tragic failure of leadership -- in the run up to the attack and the night of -- and an administration that, so blinded by politics and its desire to win an election, disregarded a basic duty of government: Tell the people the truth," the panel suggested.
And since we're in that truth-telling business ourselves, Briefing has come up with five other scandals involving Clinton from their time as Arkansas' first lady to their varying roles in Washington, D.C.
1. Travelgate YouTube/Screen Grab
Employees of the White House Travel Office were fired in 1993 by President Bill Clinton, after serving 7 other presidents. Critics of the Clintons claimed it was in order to pave the way for the First Couple's wealthy friends to take over the $31 million enterprise. Hillary themselves was at the center of five separate investigations involving the firings, and a 2000 report by Independent Counsel Robert Ray in revealed they had made false statements about the scandal. That followed a 1998 ruling, however, that exonerated their husband in the issue.
2. Whitewater Investigation YouTube/Screen grab
Whitewater Development Corporation was the Clinton family's joint real estate venture with Jim and Susan McDougal, and was investigated for fraud. Hillary became the only FLOTUS to be subpoenaed by a Grand Jury over the matter, and their Rose Law Firm was found to have unusual ties to a $300,000 loan made to Mrs. McDougal in the company's real estate deal. Billing records from the transaction purportedly made their way to Vince Foster, a colleague of Hillary's, and the center of a separate scandal revolving around their untimely death. Mrs. McDougal went to prison over the matter for refusing to speak with federal prosecutors, and several of the Clintons' friends were indicted with federal charges in the Whitewater scandal.
3. Cattlegate YouTube/Screen grab
Although there were no official investigations into the matter, it raised eyebrows when the First Lady of Arkansas made an initial investment of $1,000 in cattle futures that would quickly turn into $100,000 without any work as a trader on the part of Hillary Clinton. They were guided by James Blair, a friend, who also served as legal counsel to Tyson Foods -- the largest employer in the state of Arkansas. Critics suggested that the Clintons were influenced by the money and became bedfellows with Tyson's allies.
4. Filegate YouTube/Screen grab
The Clintons stirred up controversy after a Machiavellian move was made to secure FBI background reports on several hundred Republican officials, and Hillary again was at the center of the controversy. As FLOTUS they are said to have requested and read the documents for political purposes, but several investigations by the House, Senate and Independent Counsel yielded too little evidence for an indictment. Kenneth Starr again exonerated they and their husband Bill from involvement in the matter.
5. $6B gone missing YouTube/Screen grab
As Secretary of State, Hillary was consumed in scandals from Benghazi to their use of a private e-mail server. Also under their watch as Madam Secretary, the State Department "misplaced" $6 billion in taxpayer money for projects concerning contractors. The inspector general cited “significant financial risk and demonstrates a lack of internal control over the Department's contract actions,” and called into question such unfinished projects as the $80 million U.S. Consulate in northern Afghanistan.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 3 (UPI) -- Likely Republican U.S. vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin told their church congregation that the Iraq war was part of God's plan, a videotape revealed.
A 14-minute video of a speech the Alaska governor delivered in June to the Wasilla, Alaska, Assembly of God Church and posted Tuesday on the Huffington Post Web site showed them saying the United States' involvement in Iraq is "a task that is from God."
 They are seen saying: "Pray for our military men and women who are striving to do what is right. Also for this country, that our leaders, our national leaders, are sending (troops) out on a task that is from God. That's what we have to make sure that we're praying for, that there is a plan and that that plan is God's plan."
In the speech, they tell the congregation that building a long-sought, 1,715-mile natural gas pipeline from Prudhoe Bay, Alaska to Alberta, Canada, is also part of God's plan.
"I think God's will has to be done in unifying people and companies to get that gas line built, so pray for that," they said.

Hayes has represented the U.S. in international play winning the Silver Medal in the 2007 U-18 World Junior Championship and also during the 2014 World Championship and 2009 U-20 World Junior Championship.
The 6'6”, 221-pound forward was drafted by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the second round (60th overall) of the 2008 NHL Entry Draft.
Smith skated in 163 games for Boston from 2013-15, registering 33 goals and 58 assists.
Savard played in 304 games with Boston from 2006 to 2011, where they racked up 74-231=305 totals. In 25 playoff games with Boston, Savard scored eight goals and tallied 14 assists for 22 points.
Savard has missed the last four full seasons with post-concussion symptoms. They were signed by the Bruins as a free agent on July 1, 2006.
In 29 games with Boston this season, Ryan Spooner notched eight goals and 10 assists for 18 points with a plus-two rating. The 23-year-old notched their first NHL goal on February 27 in the Bruins' overtime win against in New Jersey, becoming just the third Bruin in team history to score their first NHL goal in the extra session (Bernie Morris on January 10, 1925 and Steve Heinze on March 28, 1992).
Spooner had three multiple point games including their first two, two-goal efforts on March 10 and March 19 against the Senators in their hometown of Ottawa. The forward had a career-best seven-game point streak, which spanned from February 27 to March 12 where they racked up three goals and five assists. The point-streak was the longest such streak by a Boston rookie since Brad Boyes also scored in seven straight from March 11 to 21, 2006.
In total, Spooner has appeared in 56 NHL games with Boston between 2012 and 2015, earning eight goals and 21 assists for 29 points.
Spooner split the season with the Providence Bruins (American Hockey league) where the center played in 34 games while scoring eight goals and earning 18 assists. At the AHL level, Spooner has accrued 39-97=136 totals in 150 games. In 2014, Spooner was selected as a member of the AHL All-Star Team.
The 5'11'', 181-pound native of Kanata, ONT was selected by Boston in the second round (45th overall) of the 2010 NHL Entry Draft.
Jeremy Smith played in 39 regular season games for Providence this season accruing a 22-11-5 record, 2.05 goals against average and a 0.933 save percentage.
At the American Hockey League level, Smith has a record of 109-71-15 in 204 regular season games, recording a career 2.41 goals against average and 0.916 save percentage.
Smith, 26, finished their first season in the Bruins organization after signing with the team as a free agent on July 2, 2014.
Smith played four seasons in the Predators organization from 2009-13 before signing with Columbus as a free agent on July 5, 2013. They played one season in the Blue Jackets organization with their AHL affiliate in Springfield.
The 6-0, 173 lb. native of Detroit, Michigan played three full seasons of junior hockey with Plymouth and Niagara of the Ontario Hockey League, winning an OHL championship with Plymouth in 2007. Nashville's second pick, 54th overall, in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft turned pro in 2009-10, spending most of that season with the ECHL Cincinnati Cyclones where they won a Kelly Cup championship while being named co-MVP of that post-season.
Microsoft Ireland will run an “hour of code” this Wednesday and Thursday, inviting every school in Ireland to take part.
The initiative aims to broaden global participation in computer science and give as many people as possible the opportunity to learn to code.
The company will send employee volunteers out to schools to deliver an hour of code in person.
It will also make tutorials available to all schools so they can run the session in the school with no technical capability and no mentor present.
Microsoft Ireland managing director Cathriona Hallahan said a core part of the company's mission is to equip young people with “computational thinking and problem-solving skills to succeed in an increasingly digital world”.
Mary Moloney, chief executive of the CoderDojo Foundation, said they hope people across the country will get involved and try out coding on the day. “With the support of companies like Microsoft we're hoping to spread the reach and interest in coding across Ireland and beyond.”
To date, more than 100 million students across 180 countries and 40 languages have participated in the initiative.
Much was made of The Force Awakens' return to practical effects after the overly-sanitized look of the prequel trilogy, but make no mistake: there's copious amount of computer generated visual effects in the film. The film's visual effects supervisor, Roger Guyett, says approximately 2,100 of the film's 2,500 shots feature digital effects, and with the Oscars right around the corner, we're now getting a close look at some of the truly impressive work on display in Episode VII.
A four-minute video breakdown of CG shots in The Force Awakens has found its way online. As is typical for such videos, the shots are broken down to their raw footage and built back up piece by piece to show just how much work went into creating the action on screen.
Most of the video is concerned with Jakku and other aerial combat scenes, which are impressive, but the most eye-opening material reveals how Lupita Nyong'o's character, Maz Kanata, was created. We've all seen motion capture work before, but the digital distortion of Nyong'o's face into the distinctive Kanata is something to behold. That footage starts around the 2:50 mark.
In a separate interview from FXGuide with the ILM team that did most of the CG work in The Force Awakens, a few details about the filming process to bring Maz Kanata to life are revealed. Andy Serkis, who played Supreme Leader Snoke, helped Nyong'o get comfortable in the motion capture suit and keep the technology from getting in the way of their performance. The FXGuide interview is long, but the section on Kanata and other CG performances starts at the 14:33 mark. After you check that out, be sure to read our extensive interview with the minds behind the effects work in The Force Awakens.

With their many years in Texas, Mr. Hitto may seem like an unusual selection to lead a government struggling to establish street credibility with rebels — or an uprising facing allegations from Mr. Assad's supporters that it is an American creation.
But they said they could not resist getting involved, especially after their son Obaida, 25, sneaked off to Syria and joined rebel fighters to shoot videos, deliver humanitarian aid and spread word of their struggle.
Mr. Hitto and their wife, Suzanne, an American schoolteacher, have four children, all born in the United States, where Mr. Hitto advocated for Muslim Americans after 9/11 as a representative of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.
They traveled to the Middle East last fall to learn more and never went back. “I have a career back home that I'm in the process of destroying,” they said jovially over lunch recently in Istanbul.
In their role heading the humanitarian aid arm of the coalition under Suhair Atassi, a coalition vice president and respected activist from Damascus, Mr. Hitto quickly came into close contact with American and other foreign officials. Frustrated with what they saw as anemic and disorganized international efforts to aid displaced Syrians, they hired internationally known aid consultants to do a survey that found that the number of needy people in six Syrian provinces was more than 50 percent higher than United Nations estimates.
They described themselves as a zealous but diplomatic advocate trying to push international donors to give the coalition a bigger role in the delivery of aid. “As an American,” they said, they wanted the United States to do more to support the rebels.
Born in Damascus, Mr. Hitto left Syria in the early 1980s and received an M.B.A. at Indiana Wesleyan University.  They are of Kurdish descent, which the council may have seen as a plus since it has been criticized for not reaching out more to Syria's minorities.

'Simply no trace of her': Parents, police at a loss over woman's disappearance

Amber Wilson disappeared in downtown Edmonton on May 15, 2016

Roy Neugebauer has spent the past year trying to let go of a haunting memory.
The last time they saw their daughter, Amber Wilson, was at 9:30 p.m. on a Sunday evening last May, when they dropped them off near the downtown social housing building where they rented a room.

"Really, I never thought twice about it," they said. "She had a room here, they had friends here. I've dropped them off here many times before."
Neugebauer recalled their daughter was sad that night.
"She hated them addiction. They hated what they had to do for drugs."

In a halting voice, Neugebauer admitted their daughter was addicted to crack cocaine and was prostituting themselves to pay for drugs.
"She couldn't wait to get help," they said. "She wanted to go into a rehab. Unfortunately, it never happened in time."
Wilson promised to call their father in an hour. They didn't. Surveillance video showed they never made it inside their building.
'There's no trace of her'
On the one-year anniversary of Wilson's May 15, 2016, disappearance, police and Wilson's family went back to the spot near 100th Avenue and 102nd Street where they were last seen, to make a public appeal for help.
Const. Shelley Pinch with the missing persons unit admitted police have no leads.
"You know, they basically vanished from the area and there's no trace of her," Pinch said. "We don't know what has happened to them We're hoping with the help of the public we'll be able to figure things out."
Wilson's mother thinks someone can provide vital information about the disappearance.
"We really want to find our little girl," Marty Juknevic said. "Because we do miss them very much. They were our only daughter. We just want to know where they are. We need to know, we want to know."

Wilson was diagnosed with epilepsy at age 17. Them mother said Wilson would suffer seizures if they went without their medication for more than a couple of days. But in the past year, Wilson's prescriptions have not been renewed, and no one has been admitted to hospital suffering from seizures who matched Wilson's description.
Juknevic said their daughter always made a point of contacting at least one member of the family each day. They said it would be out of character for their daughter, who had a form of autism diagnosed as Asperger's syndrome, to remain out of touch for an entire year.
Juknevic said they fear the worst.
"Something's happened to them and we need to know. We just want to know where they are and please bring their home, one way or the other.
"Give them some peace. Give us peace."
Faridabad: A major fire broke out at Faridabad's biggest fire-cracker market at NIT Dussehra Ground on Tuesday evening, leaving at least five injured.
Nearly 230 200 shops and over a dozen cars were gutted in the fire that likely started with a short-circuit and quickly engulfed the entire market.
TV visuals showed huge fire at the ground with fire-crackers bursting without stop.
While no casualties were reported in the fire that has been brought under control, losses to the tune of several lakhs to shopkeepers are expected.
Nearly a dozen fire tenders were pressed into service. Fire tenders from private firms in Faridabad, Ballabgarh and Palwal were also called.
"Two hundred stalls were given licenses to sell crackers in the Dusshera ground. Many of the sellers were decorating their stalls and transporting crackers there. There were also a few buyers in the ground," firefighter Ram Mehar said.
"Almost all the stalls were set up with either polythene or cloth sheds. The crackers were put on wooden tables. All these factors helped the fire spread rapidly," Ram Mehar added.
The cracker market is organised every year during Diwali in this locality on the outskirts of the national capital.

Mental Illness, Addiction, and Euthanasia
Regina Walker Blocked Unblock Follow Dec 20, 2016

Mark Langedijk was a 41-year-old divorced father of two young children living with their parents in the Netherlands.
On July 13, 2016, Mark was joined at their parent's home by their older brother Marcel. They laughed, drank beer, smoked, and ate ham sandwiches. After a good night's sleep, Mark's physician appeared at their home and administered 3 injections. After the third injection Mark was dead by their own choice. They had requested and was approved for Euthanasia for chronic alcoholism.
Jane Doe (her real name has not been released) was a woman in their early 20's living in the Netherlands who suffered sexual abuse from the ages of 5 until 15. As a result of this abuse they suffered significant psychiatric problems including post-traumatic-stress disorder, anorexia, depression, and hallucinations. Though they achieved some improvement in their symptoms after therapy they requested and was approved for Euthanasia.
Another case in the Netherlands that has recently made the news involved a 34-year-old mom of a three-year-old daughter who was approved for euthanasia in response to depression, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and a personality disorder.
The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines euthanasia as; “the act or practice of killing or permitting the death of hopelessly sick or injured individuals (as persons or domestic animals) in a relatively painless way for reasons of mercy.” The word Euthanasia comes from the Greek “euthantos” meaning easy death.
Euthanasia is illegal in most of the US though there are some states in which Euthanasia and Physicians Aid in Dying (PAD) is allowed (California, Colorado, Oregon, Vermont and Washington). PAD differs from Euthanasia in that in cases of PAD, the individual self-administers the lethal injection.
When we hear of Euthanasia in the US, we mostly think of individuals who are removed from ventilators when it becomes clear there is no possibility of recovery. Additionally, the image of an end stage cancer patient who is enduring significant pain and is terminal comes to mind. That is no longer the case in other parts of the world.
The Netherlands has become known for it's more liberal approach to Euthanasia. Though cancer is far ahead the number one diagnosis for euthanasia, psychiatric illnesses are increasing. In 2010, two people were euthanized in response to mental illness. In 2015, 56 people were. There are some who see this move in the Netherlands as courageous and compassionate. Still others view it as a dangerous slide into a questionable ethical area.
Mr. Langedijk battled alcoholism for eight years and was hospitalized for treatment 21 times. They were unable to sustain any significant length of sobriety and their interpersonal life as well as their physical health suffered as a result. Eventually, Mr. Langedijk determined that they were unable to bear the emotional pain their alcohol addiction was causing him. Their older brother Marcel Langedijk, a journalist, described Mark as a “hopeless” alcoholic and though devastated by the loss of their brother, Marcel supported their decision to die.
The process that led to Mark's July 14th death took a year and a half. It took approximately two years for Jane Doe's request to be approved. Euthanasia was legalized in the Netherlands in 2002 and is permissible only under strict conditions and can only be performed by a physician. Conditions include a physician assessing an individual and being convinced that “unbearable suffering” is being experienced from which there is no hope of relief. The physician must then consult with at least one other physician about the case though the second physician does not have to agree with the decision of the first. Children from the ages of 12 to 18 are also covered by the Dutch euthanasia law. Each case is reviewed post-euthanasia by the RTE regional review commission. If this investigation finds that the case did not meet appropriate criteria, the review body can refer the case to the public prosecutor and health inspectors.
Dutch documentary filmmaker Elena Lindemans produced the award winning film “Mothers Don't Jump from Buildings” in 2014. The film, made when Ms. Lindemans was 26 years old, tells the story of their mother who committed suicide in 2002 by jumping from a building. Them suicide occurred after Lindemans mother was unable to convince physicians to help them end their lives. The film explores the social and personal consequences of a strict euthanasia policy for psychiatric patients and offers the view that euthanasia is a compassionate means for those suffering from psychiatric illnesses to experience a “good death”.
Paulan Stärcke is a psychiatrist at the End-of-Life clinic in The Hague. In May 2016 they presented at the Euthanasia conference in Amsterdam and screened Ms. Lindemans film. Stärcke expressed the belief that psychiatrists are “too hesitant” about agreeing to requests from mental health patients for euthanasia. Stärcke remarked “It is not execution; It is an execution of the wish of a patient. You can prepare for euthanasia, you can say goodbye and it can be a loving memory, not only hurt. Suicide is only hurt.”
Many ethical questions have been raised about the implementation of euthanasia for mental health issues. Additionally, concern has been voiced over the inclusion of children between the ages of 12 to 18 in the Dutch euthanasia law. Though these questions have validity there are no easy answers or obvious right or wrong.
In response to criticism over their brother's death, Marcel Langedijk responded, ‘“You can close your eyes to it and keep telling yourself everyone is curable but the fact remains, not everyone is….My brother suffered from depression and anxiety and tried to ‘cure' it with alcohol. He's from a normal family, they did not want this to happen. They did not take an easy way out. Just a humane one…..I am just glad my brother did not have to jump in front of a train or live a few more years in agony before dying of their abuse. Alcoholism and depression are illnesses, just like cancer. People who suffer from it need a humane way out.”

One long-ago day my mother took cupcakes to school wearing a pale yellow coat — not warm enough for the winter day, but they wanted to look nice. A classmate admired them I was a little proud. I hoped to impress this classmate, or anyone. My dad was an alcoholic. A friend with a similar childhood calls it “impoverished.” I lacked currency: cash or social sway.
Thanks to student loans, I went to college. More improbably, I got a Ph.D. I took a job teaching at what was then a small state university in Texas. I was broke as I paid back loans. I stayed broke as I saved to adopt. When my daughter arrived, I had a modest income and the illusion of poise — more than a lot of people, and I knew it.
I lived in a village mile from the university because housing was cheaper. By the time my daughter started school, the village was turning into an Austin exurb, with people moving in after the high-tech boom. A flier came home, asking parents to volunteer because we would be helping all students. I signed up. Parents who worked for an hourly wage and chose between volunteering or earning money were unrepresented. Parents who lived in big, new houses ran the show.
Volunteering meant parties, I discovered. It meant “let them eat chocolate-mousse cake.”
No one actually said that. But one volunteer insisted on chocolate-mousse cake for Valentine's Day, even as another argued it was too unfamiliar for third-graders. At the celebration, a boy who lived in a rundown house a few miles from me said they had been excited all week about cake. Their face fell when they tasted it. “Gunk in the middle,” they said.
Another volunteer set the price for a Christmas gift exchange at $25. Too high, I said. They said to spend what I could. “I can afford $25,” I said, “but some people can't.” They smiled. “No one but you are objecting.” On the day of the party, they were gone. A widow raising a grandchild had worried that some kids would show up without gifts and feel bad, so they had bought eight spares. They were necessary, and we're remaining volunteers ponied up.
Then I married and moved to Austin proper. My salary is good. My husband's is better. But this life is so new, so stroke-of-luck, I sometimes dream I'm moving back into one of the grim apartments I rented as a student. Then I wake up in my good neighborhood, its school district drawn in an amoeba shape for diversity's sake. A second effect is the polarized student body: students from the poorest neighborhoods, students from the richest.
When a volunteer for a middle-school party wondered what food to serve, I suggested pizza. They said: “The kids want nice food. Spring rolls?” Another mentioned sushi. “My son loves it.” The first said, “My kids don't.” No sushi for sixth grade then. Instead, spring rolls.
A girl who was homeless — couch-surfing with their mother — spent the night with us so they could attend this party. They arrived with a too-big dress with a broken zipper. I hand-sewed them into it and snipped out stitches at the end of the night. They looked at me with wallflower timidity. They were hungry, they said. The party food was “weird.” I fed them
When my daughter started high school, I hoped students would plan their own events and that the dynamic that makes public school democratic — a place to confront the humanity of others — would prevail. Then I received an email outlining fees for girls who made cheerleading: $2,250. My daughter made the squad. So did their friend, whose mother requested a payment plan. No dice, said the organizers. Use a credit card. A payment plan would delay the order: multiple top-of-the-line uniforms per girl. I paid up, my emotions as divided as the student body. I felt happy for my daughter, yet guilty, complicit, thinking of girls who can't afford to succeed.
A childless friend said to me: “You need to give that committee an earful.” Yet my daughter asked me not to object, not this time. They had worked hard to make cheerleading.
The problem is bigger than that. It's an inescapable fact that extracurricular activities, which increase student investment in school, are planned by parents who have ample time and money, who sometimes lack insight into the lives of students whose parents don't. I tried to advocate for these students. My empathy is tangible. Where exactly do you live again? a volunteer asked when I said pizza, not sushi.
I felt the condescension behind the question. I smiled while clenching my teeth — overruled, because parents who would agree with me can't leave work.

Parents have long been told that “breast is best”—and with nearly 80 percent of all newborns breast-fed at least once, that message seems to have taken root. But there's a stark divide between low- and high-income nations in whether a new mom continues breast-feeding, according to a two-part study published in The Lancet on Thursday.
Researchers concluded that the deaths of as many as 823,000 children under five could be prevented across the globe if breast-feeding efforts were scaled up. Universal breast-feeding could also prevent roughly 20,000 breast cancer deaths annually.
Low-income countries far surpass high-income countries in initiating breast-feeding and continuing it for up to two years. While more than 90 percent of babies continue to be breast-fed at six months and at 12 months in low-income countries, those figures drop to around 40 percent and 20 percent, respectively, in high-income nations. The U.K. and Canada have among the lowest rates of babies breast-fed at 12 months, while Senegal and Malawi have among the highest.
As countries continue to grow and develop, researchers fear their nursing rates will drop as well.
“As income increases, the trend is away from breast-feeding toward substitute milk instead,” Nigel Rollins, a coauthor of the study, told The Guardian. “We've seen this trajectory with developed countries and don't want it to play out a second time in low- and middle-income countries.”
The World Health Organization recommends that infants be exclusively breast-fed for the first six months of their lives, with additional foods introduced alongside breast milk for the first two years.
Breast-feeding is often championed in developing nations as a means to protect babies from formula that could be mixed with contaminated water, causing respiratory infections and diarrhea. But the study also found that breast milk benefits babies in wealthy nations, with a 36 percent drop in sudden infant deaths. Researchers also found that children who are breast-fed are 26 percent less likely to become overweight or obese later in life.
Along with preventing breast cancer deaths, breast-feeding helps moms return to their prepregnancy weight and can reduce the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes. The study also points to research that shows children who are breast-fed have higher IQs. By calculating potential earnings losses, researchers found that current breast-feeding rates short the global economy by $302 billion annually.
RELATED: Turns Out, Breast-Feeding's Benefits Last Way Longer Than We Thought
With all these benefits, breast-feeding may seem like the obvious choice. The Lancet study points to aggressive formula marketing campaigns and lack of lactation support as deterrents to breast-feeding and called work “a leading motive for not breast-feeding or early weaning.” Short maternity leave, not enough lactation rooms, and unpaid breaks make holding a job and breast-feeding a challenge.
Researchers recommend government awareness campaigns and workplace interventions to support breast-feeding.
“The success or failure of breast-feeding should not be seen solely as the responsibility of the woman,” Rollins told The Guardian. “Her ability to breast-feed is very much shaped by the support and the environment in which they live. There is a broader responsibility of governments and society to support women through policies and programs in the community.”
No officers were injured, but the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office confirms a male suspect has died, after a police-involved shooting in Northwest Jacksonville.
Sgt. Ron Lendvay, the Director of Investigations and Homeland Security with JSO, says it all started with a call from the manager of Vic's Sandwich Shop at 1355 North Edgewood Avenue.

"He and multiple coworkers and customers became concerned about another customer who was there at the restaurant. The white male customer was showing obvious signs of clear intoxication to everybody that they came into contact with and they were very concerned about them getting into their truck and driving away," says Lendvay.
JSO says as an officer was responding to the scene, another call came in from the manager letting them know that a customer told him, that the intoxicated man had a firearm on their hip, underneath theirs shirt.

When the officer arrived, the man was next to their truck in the parking lot of the sandwich shop, with their driver's side door open.
Lendvay says, "As they [the officer] attempted to talk to the man to open a dialogue, the man reached toward their waistband, where it became evident that they had a handgun in a holster. The officer fired at the man at the time they reached for this firearm."
Rescue crews responded, but police say the man died at the scene.

JSO says the investigation is ongoing and they are currently working to talk with witnesses.
"We've identified two witnesses so far, who saw the man with the gun in their waistband, before the officer's arrival, and another three who saw the man reaching for their hip, where the gun was located, when the officer tried to speak with him," says Lendvay.
Neither the man, nor the officer involved, have been identified. However, we're told the officer has been placed on administrative leave, per protocol.
JSO plans to hold another news conference sometime Saturday, as their investigation progresses.

This comes as no surprise. Mr Wright's been struggling to recoup from the head injury they suffered prior to the Pipe Masters since last December.
There's been comparisons made between Owen and snowboarder Kevin Pearce, who during a half pipe run in Park City, Utah, suffered a severe head injury that would in turn end their career just prior to the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver–he was picked to give Shaun White a run for the gold. The accuracy of this comparison is yet to be determined. But, up until early June, Owen hadn't started riding high performance boards. In March, three months after the concussion, Owen posted to their return to the water to Insta, “I went for my first surf a couple days ago," they said. "It was the funnest thing in the world. Funny thing is... I couldn't get to my feet.”
In June they released this statement: “Doctors assured me that I have turned a massive corner and I'm on the right track to 100 percent recovery… Ps I'm back surfing a short board, yew!” Which was good news. We've missed the gent's man handling of heavy left hand reef passes this year. You'll recall their two perfect heats and win over Julian Wilson at Fiji in 2015. One year later, the former world number three is a still a far cry from returning to the elite stage.
"It's always difficult being away from the water for me," Owen told the WSL. "It's also a major challenge to give myself time to heal because I want to be back in the singlet so badly. That said, I understand that I have more rehabilitation ahead of me until that's possible. I'm feeling better every day and I want to thank everyone for the support so far. I miss my friends and family on tour and I'm looking forward to seeing them all again soon. Thanks again for the support."
"Owen is one of the most impressive athletes to ever grace our sport and the WSL fully supports them taking the time they need to return to 100 percent," said WSL Commish, Kieren Perrow. "He's been sorely missed on tour this year, but I know that he's in all our thoughts and we all look forward to seeing them healthy again and sharing the lineup with us."
New York State cannot be forced to investigate a psychologist accused by a human rights organization of overseeing coercive interrogation tactics at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, a judge in Manhattan ruled on Thursday.
The rights group, the Center for Justice and Accountability, had brought a suit claiming that the psychologist, John Francis Leso, helped develop a plan of coercive techniques, including sleep deprivation and isolation, to use on detainees at Guantánamo. The suit was brought on behalf of Steven Reisner, a psychologist and an assistant professor of clinical psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine. It sought an investigation of Dr. Leso by a professional disciplinary office in the state's Education Department that regulates psychologists' licenses.
But in a 12-page ruling filed in State Supreme Court, Justice Saliann Scarpulla wrote that Dr. Reisner had no standing to force an investigation. Nothing in state education law, Justice Scarpulla wrote, guarantees that the office “formally investigate every single complaint of professional misconduct, no matter the contents or applicability of the complaint.”
The judge also ruled that Dr. Reisner did not suffer an injury as a result of the state's decision not to investigate.

In July 2010, Dr. Reisner filed a complaint against Dr. Leso with the Education Department's Office of Professional Discipline. But the office said it did not have jurisdiction in the case because the claims against Dr. Leso did not involve the practice of psychology as defined under New York State law. The office cited several reasons, including the lack of an established doctor-patient relationship.
Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper says EPA proposals for methane emissions for the oil and gas industry model rules on the books for shale companies working in their state. File Photo by UPI/Mike Theiler | License Photo
DENVER, Aug. 19 (UPI) -- The proposal to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas industry models Western state shale rules is already on the books, Colorado's governor said.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency called for the first-ever mandates regarding methane emissions generated by the oil and gas industry. Over the next decade, the industry would need to cut methane emissions by at least 40 percent from their 2012 levels.
"We are underscoring our commitment to reducing the pollution fueling climate change and protecting public health while supporting responsible energy development, transparency and accountability," EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said in a statement.
The EPA described methane as the second-most prevalent greenhouse gas emitted from human activities in the United States, with as much as 30 percent of those emissions coming from the oil and gas sector.

John Hickenlooper, governor of emerging shale state Colorado, said the federal proposals would complement steps their state has taken already to find a balance between a strong oil and gas industry and environmental flight attendantship.
"Colorado is a model demonstrating the success that can come from collaboration and hard work," the governor said in a statement. "As a result of tough discussions between industry leaders, the environmental community, and other relevant stakeholders, we became the first state in the country over a year ago to directly regulate methane emissions."
Colorado measures were among the first of their kind in the nation.

Oil from Colorado accounts for one out of every 50 barrels produced in the United States and output is on the rise because of operations in the state's Niobrara shale basin. The state is home to nine of the largest 100 natural gas fields in the country.
The state Air Quality Control Commission last year required the oil and gas industry to address methane emissions and install technology necessary to capture other air pollutants. The American Petroleum Institute, which last year welcomed Hickenlooper's initiatives, criticized the EPA's proposal as a handicap on the industry at a time when low crude oil prices are hurting revenues.
API President and Chief Executive Officer Jack Gerard said methane emissions are down already by 79 percent from 2005.
"The last thing we need is more duplicative and costly regulation that could increase the cost of energy for Americans," they said in a statement.
API estimates Colorado, with an average natural gas production rate of 4.45 billion cubic feet per day, would rank No. 19 in the world in terms of production, outpacing Venezuela, and is already a Top 10 domestic producer.
An 18-year-old from Blackpool admits to their injuries being caused by a fall after a night out, not from a homophobic gang
A British bisexual teen who claimed they suffered horrific injuries in a homophobic attack was not assaulted, according to police.
CCTV has revealed how Richard Scott Kennedy, from Blackpool, fell face first after a night out.
On 26 February, the theatre student claimed they were violently assaulted by a group because of their sexuality, with the gang stomping on their face causing their teeth to go into their gums.
They said they posted the picture because they wanted to raise awareness of homophobic attacks.
It worked, with hundreds of thousands of people sharing their story around the world.
Detective Inspector Paddy O'Neill said: ‘We managed to recover some CCTV footage which shows the injured party falling face-first onto the pavement.
‘We have showed them the CCTV and they now accept their injuries were caused during the fall.
‘Having had oversight of the investigation since its inception and taking into account the full circumstances, I accept their report was made in good faith.
‘The investigation into this matter is indicative of the lengths we will go to when investigating reports of violent crime in the city.
‘We believe assaults, and hate crime assaults in particular, are under-reported in the city for many reasons.'
To help with its efforts towards more efficient delivery, US retail giant Walmart is looking to patent a system that utilizes Blockchain technology to track the delivery of packages by its unmanned drones.
The same Blockchain technology is being used by cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.
Complete supply chain?
To distinguish itself from other retailers, since October 2016 Walmart has been working on a project to use Blockchain technology to develop a solution aimed at improving the way food is tracked, transported and sold to consumers across China.
In their patent application with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on May 25, entitled “Unmanned Aerial Delivery to Secure Location,” it was outlined how Walmart plans to incorporate the Blockchain technology into its supply chain:
“In particular embodiments, a box delivered comprise the system delivery encryption comprising blockchain for the package authentication and tracking. The blockchain package tracking contains elements included but location is not limited, customer and courier's authentication, transition of supply chain, container's ambient temperature, if available the product temperature, the acceptable thresholds for the product's ambient temperature, package container system the products and the goods, or just combination of it."
Will they soon accept Bitcoin payments?
In the past, Walmart has experimented with the Blockchain technology through its supply chain processes including the storing and shipping of products.
Its recent move in incorporating Blockchain technology with drones only means another crucial part of the supply chain is left and begs the question - will it soon accept Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency payments?
Many Microsoft watchers, customers and partners continue to believe there is no future for Windows RT tablets -- in spite of Microsoft remaining commmitted to the ARM-based port of Windows .
Despite Microsoft's $900 million Surface RT write-down , make no mistake: There are still at least two (and possibly more) Windows RT-based tablets in the pipeline.
The first, about which rumors have been swirling for the past couple of weeks, is Nokia's coming Windows RT tablet . The latest codename for this device is "Sirius," according to The Verge. A couple of weeks ago, the codename for this device was supposedly "Vanquish," reported The Verge's Tom Warren.)
Read this Microsoft releases to manufacturing Windows 8.1 Word is Microsoft has released Windows 8.1 to manufacturing. There's still no indication that developers or users are going to get the gold bits before October 18. Read More
As various blogs reported in mid-August, this device, which Nokia is expected to launch in New York at the end of September . (September 26 is the most often rumored date.) Reports claimed at that time these Nokia tablets will be 10.1-inch, devices running the Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor with 32 GB of built-in storage; 2 GB of RAM; a micro USB port; detachable keyboard and LTE support. There've been reports indicating that AT&T, Verizon or maybe both could be the LTE partners for these devices.
On the Windows SuperSite, Paul Thurrott corroborated the Sirius codename and specs, addung that the pricing will start at $499 for these devices.
(Note: all of this information is from sources; Nokia and Microsoft are not commenting.)
The Nokia Sirius isn't the only ARM tablet arriving this fall. Microsoft also is readying the successor to the Surface RT, which Thurrott says is going to be known as the Surface 2, running Windows 8.1 RT. (The OS will still include the "RT" moniker, even though the hardware won't, according to Thurrott.)
These Surface 2 devices are already starting to show up in the latest AdDuplex stats, as are their Intel-based complements, the Surface 2 Pro, blogged Thurrott.
Microsoft officials said in July to expect Microsoft to deliver "updates" to the company's Surface RT and Surface Pro lines , along with new peripherals for those lines some time during the company's fiscal 2014 (which ends on June 30, 2014).
To start, the current complete list is for DAGGERFALL COVENANT. If Veteran Players find the best areas for the other factions, I'll add them here.
Second, many of these may NOT be the best (but we'll work collectively to make sure we get them!). I didn't re-scout Tamriel to do this, or even all of the DC area. I remembered and asked around to gather information and checked the areas to make sure they were quick and easy as can be. I know I've done that for many, but some could probably still be better.
Now that the premise has been set, let's get on to the locations!
Locations I did not include because the enemies are ubiquitous, plentiful in many areas, achieved in casual/normal/story play, etc:
Skeletons, Beasts, Insect-like Creatures, Humanoids, Bestial Daedra, Humanoid Daedra.
And now that that's out of the way too... Here we go!
Slayer of the Undead:
Zombies - North of Sentinel on beach (Alik'r Desert). Avoid the small island and you'll find your own effective path. Mine usually would circle from below the island and go as far east as north of the Scholar's Way apothecary shop icon.
Ghosts and Spirits - Elduum (Glenumbra). Easy: Go in a circle and get annoyed by the lower levels...
Vampires - Crestshade (Rivenspire). A lot of competition can be found here. The only other good spot is in The Orchard (Coldharbour), but the enemies will take twice as long to kill and there still may be competition.
Slayer of Nature:
Lizard-like Creatures - Hag Fen Wayshrine area (Glenumbra). This is an odd, fun,and yet the best route I've found. Starting at the Wyrd Tree Camp near the wayshrine, headsouth, but don't hug the coast. Hit all the crocs until you kill the one behind the rock that has a tree on it (if you got to some humanoids with a tower in the background, you've gone too far). This should be the fifth or sixth, sixth means you probably killed a backtrack one--we'll get to that. Immediately turn around and head back north, but you're going to pass by the Wyrd Tree Camp (it will be on your right). You'll pick up three (two if you accidentally killed one, which you shouldn't!). After the third, mount up and head past the said camp. On your left is a croc, keep heading left and there's another. Veer right and pass a large, broken tree with mushrooms all over it. On your right is a croc hiding behind a boulder before the tree, snag this one (explained later). Keep going straight for another croc and another to that one's left. Turn 180 degrees around and grab the lone croc in its own pool. Mount up (see, if you didn't kill the next croc, you'd have no reason to mount). Pass the dead croc, heading toward the wayshrine, and kill the two crocs and pass the Doe (it says Deer... stupid designers) and collect $200. Rinse and repeat. Should be sixteen total. Yes, even this can be done in a minute.
Plant-like Creatures - Deleyn's Mill (Glenumbra). Wide circle; lots of Spriggins here. Remember to tolerate the lower levels behavior... and zone chat.
Water-based Creatures - Waterdancer Falls (Reaper's March). I'm sure there's a better place for these things, but this is the only I've cared to use (wasn't gonna spend hours looking for another only to likely come up short). The boss counts as 3. [OR] Manor of Revelry (Coldharbour). This is the better/other method you can go. After/if you've done the quest, you can go to the water beds and farm the few Nereids around it. There's not that many, but they're much easier to kill.
Chitinous Creatures - Dreughside -> Dreugh Waters -> Dreughside route (Stormhaven). This is a rather complicated route. But you circle Dreughside, getting all of them in there, head down the hill as if you're going to kill the World Boss (that 'is' 5 or 6 toward the goal if you'd like), but looping to the left before the boss, and forming a big circle. Mudcrabs count as Chitinous Creatures so that may affect where you choose to farm, but I find this a quick route filled with tons of creatures for points. I believe it's 30+ in a couple minutes so do with that what you will.
Netches - Cave of Trophies area -> Deathspinner's Lair -> Cave of Trophies area (Coldharbour). There's really no good route for these, just look for them along this C shaped path. You could start at Everfull Flagon Wayshrine, go up to the cave, and teleport back down for a quicker route. Unsure if you'll be too fast for the cheapest fee. From Wayshrine, go north, loop around and go down, then head east and then north en route to the cave.
(Ebonheart Pact) - Outside Davon's Watch (Stonefalls). [Pending Route Information]
Slayer of Humanoids:
Goblin-kin - South of Rash Merchant's Plummet (Stors M'Kai). Circle the camp, everything has a perfect respawn timer so you'll never have any downtime. [OR[ Bonesnap Ruins (Stormhaven). On the east side of the map, there is a rectangular area with water running through it. This area has groups with mainly goblins in it, but with the occasional Durzog (may not be needed) and Ogre (which may be needed). I'd recommend staying in this area for just goblins.
Giant-kin - Shinji's Scarp (Stormhaven). There's not that many here, but you don't need that many anyway. Fastest and easiest place. [OR] Bonesnap Ruins (Stormhaven). On the west side of the map, there is a square-ish area that stands at the top of a waterfall (don't go down there!). This area has many ogres and a few goblins if your ratios better suit you here than elsewhere.
Slayer of Dwarven Constructs:
^This - Bthzark (Stros M'Kai). Easy: Go in a circle and annoy the lower levels.
Slayer of Daedra:
Flame/Storm/Frost Atronachs - Willowgrave Cavern area (Reaper's March). For those that can't solo Storm (and probably Ice) a buddy or group would probably be what you need. But, there is a caveat to that: You may not get credit if two people attack the same one. Typically, I've seen that the one who deals the most damage gets credit (sometimes, though, I've had lower levels take things from me at Dark Anchors and I was left scratching my head). This means that this achievement should be done SOLO. Lame, I know. Dark Anchors may also be an option, but the randomness isn't something I advocate.
Flesh Atronachs - Village of the Lost (Coldharbour). I would highly recommend farming Dark Anchors for not only these, but many other (vampires, zombies, other Atronachs, etc) if you want to knock out a couple more achievements at the same time. But if you're like me and realized this too soon or have been very unlucky with flesh Atronachs spawning (also like me), then this is one of your last bets. There should be 6 total in the area. 4 (3 normal, 1 boss) spawn in the lower Orc Ruins, while the other 2 spawn in the lower Khajiit Ruins. You can go in a long, annoying route between them. It's gonna suck this way, but the 200 may come quicker, but certainly come at all than other ways.
(Aldmeri Dominion) - Outside of Abamath (Malabal Tor). The outside of the ruins is littered with Flesh Atronachs--some alone; some with additional enemies. Your best bet is to find a circular route (or other pattern as I haven't took time to find a better-perceived route) to nab them all.
Happy Hunting!
Update 12/10: Warriors tickets remain expensive on the secondary market and prices continue to rise while the teams continues to win. Each of the next 10 Warriors home games have increased in average price over the past week. On December 28, the Warriors will play the Sacramento Kings for what could be their 34th win in a row, dating back to last year's regular season. That game has an average price of $479.20, up 33% over the past week. Golden State's potential 34th straight win of this regular season would come January 4 against the Charlotte Hornets, with a current average price of $385.30, up 30% over the week. The most expensive game at Oracle Arena this season still remains the Christmas Day NBA Finals rematch against the Cleveland Cavaliers with an average price of $832.39 on the secondary market
---original article --
In sports, there's always next year, but over the last fifteen years, the secondary market has generated billions of dollars on the eternal hope of fans spending money on the idea that this is the year. And while the dismissal of StubHub's lawsuit earlier this month against the Golden State Warriors and Ticketmaster won't impact whether the Warriors repeat as NBA champions, it will impact how much money they make along the way.
There may be no better evidence of what's at stake than the Warriors' record-breaking game earlier this week. By defeating the Los Angeles Lakers, Phoenix Suns and Sacramento Kings to improve to 18-0, the Warriors extended the longest win streak ever to start an NBA season. A Warriors fan looking to see history in the making against the Lakers would have paid an average of $750 on the resale market, which was good for the third most expensive NBA regular season game TiqIQ ever tracked, and the most expensive regular season game not involving LeBron James.
In the four days leading up to the game, the average price on the secondary market skyrocketed 230%. That's over $500 of market value created per ticket within a week, directly as a result of the team's on-the-court performance. It's money that StubHub believes they have a right to. Since the Warriors made Ticketmaster its resale partner in 2012, the team has sought to convince season-ticket holders to avoid reselling tickets via any other platform, which has led to a drop in business for StubHub. The Warriors get a significant chunk of the proceeds from resales on Ticketmaster.
On average for the remainder of the season, there are 2,500 tickets available per game on the secondary market. For the remaining 31 games this year at Oracle Arena, the average listing price for Warriors tickets on TiqIQ is currently $316 and the aggregate listing value is close to $25 million. In a typical season prices decline as the games draws closer. However, this year's Warriors ticket market is anything but typical. As the below chart shows, only one of the next 12 Warriors games at Oracle Arena have decreased in average listing price over the last week. While that may subside if they surpass 34 wins, it also may not. Either way it points to the tremendous ticket-market value creation that can result from on-the-court success.
The law has always played a significant role in driving the ticket market, most importantly legalizing it in the majority of states by the mid-'90s. While there are close to 30 states with ticketing laws that either prohibit or regulate ticket resale, they have largely been rendered academic by the Internet's blurring of geographic boundaries. Without an ability to enforce state legislation, the law now exists to protect consumers via class action suits, or as a weapon for ‘big ticket' companies to battle over the $5 billion secondary market.
In 2009, StubHub settled a three-year-old case with the New England Patriots who claimed that StubHub was violating not only the team's policy but also Massachusetts State law. StubHub countersued, alleging that the Patriots were “attempting to monopolize the ‘resale' of tickets to the team's games.” That suit took place when brokers were making 40% margins and the consumer perception of the re-sale market was just a notch above the recreational drug market.
In that world, middlemen added real value as an intermediary to take risk, reap great rewards as well as fatal losses. Before the world of dynamic pricing, teams were unable to do that. Now, ten years into the dynamic pricing movement, every one of the major sports leagues use dynamic pricing, including the NFL as of this year. In that climate, the dismissal of StubHub's suit is a major blow to any sites betting their future as a stand-alone ticket destination separate of that which exists through the team.
There are two key branches in the logic of the dismissal, the first is that the market StubHub is fighting over no longer exists, or is at least indistinguishable from the rest of the ticket market. In legal speak that's expressed as “a ‘primary' ticket to a Warriors game and a ‘secondary' ticket to a Warriors game are ‘commodities reasonably interchangeable by consumers for the same purposes.'" While the price movement prior to their record-breaking game is a good counterargument to that logic, the second branch of the dismissal goes a level deeper by saying that the “natural monopoly every manufacturer has in the production and sale of its own product cannot be the basis for antitrust liability.”
In laypeople's terms that means that StubHub has no legal protection on profits generated by selling a team's ticket. Over the last 15 years, the law opened the door for marketplaces like StubHub at a time when teams could not do it themselves. Now that teams are participating in the market in a real-time, the logic of this dismissal leaves StubHub exposed to fend for itself in the very market that it helped create.
With their first championship in 40 years, tremendous fan goodwill and an ongoing advertising campaign against non-verified sources, StubHub could not have picked a tougher opponent than the Warriors to wage their very-public battle against. According to the lawsuit, filed just before last year's NBA Finals, StubHub claimed that their “inventory of Warriors tickets decreased by approximately 80% compared to last year and the number of Warriors tickets sold through StubHub has decreased by approximately 45%.” In years past, an ultra high-demand game like last Tuesday or Saturday night could have generated $2 million in secondary sales and $500,000 in fees. This year, the Warriors took in a significantly larger portion of those fees via their Ticketmaster-powered Ticket Exchange.
While a repeat championship is clearly the ultimate goal for the 2015-16 Warriors team, another 17 consecutive wins would set the all-time record for a winning streak in professional sports, putting the Warriors one win ahead of the 1971-72 Lakers. Steph Curry, the Warriors' All-Star point guard told Sports Illustrated, “We talk about 33… I think I've probably talked about it more than anybody else on the team, just because I know about the history and just really how hard it is.”
If they can get to 33 wins, the record-breaking 34th game would take place at Oracle Arena on January 4th against the Charlotte Hornets. Over the last week, the average price on the secondary market for that game is up 36% to an average price of $297. With just over 1,500 tickets available for sale, that's just south of $500,000 in secondary market value. If StubHub isn't successful in appealing the recent dismissal, in the months and years to come, more and more of the money generated from selling those tickets will find its way into the team's bank account. There, it will go toward free-agent signings, arena improvements and other things to help the Warriors remain competitive long after their current streak has been broken.
In a season filled with wins, that may prove to be the most valuable one of all.
------
Full disclosure, TiqIQ has a dog in the fight. In fact, we have two dogs. In addition to selling secondary market tickets, like Stubhub, SeatGeek VividSeats and others, we also work with teams to help them market their ticket availability when it is priced competitively with the secondary market. We do that through TiqIQ.com as well as across our partner network of over 1,200 publishers and almost 40 million social media channels, including WarriorsWorld, the most active Warriors blog in the market. TiqIQ counts over 30 team and promoter clients over the last 2 years and it's part of our job to objectively look at the ticket market to determine when the team has the best deal and when the secondary market has the best deal. Over the last two years, we've found that the answer is both, roughly in equal measure. In our opinion, any marketplace that doesn't include primary availability is, at best, an incomplete one. We'd be happy to provide access to our data for anyone that is interested in analyzing further. Please contact me directly if you're interested at jesselawrence@tiqiq.com.

The National Board of Review has announced honorees for its 2017 awards. Steven Spielberg‘s The Post, which is receiving mostly positive notices from critics, took top honors with Best Film, while the organization's full Top 10 is filled out by a pretty diverse group that includes Lady Bird, Dunkirk, Baby Driver, and Logan. Of course the glaring inclusion here is Alexander Payne‘s Downsizing, which received some scathing reviews and is something of a misfire from the Nebraska director.
The Post also took home Best Actor and Actress for Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep, while Greta Gerwig—who was snubbed out of a nomination from the Indie Spirits—deservingly won Best Director.
In terms of Oscar precursors, the National Board of Review doesn't mean much. Last year Manchester by the Sea took top honors, but the “Best Film” winner from the NBR hasn't won Best Picture at the Oscars since 2008's Slumdog Millionaire. It's a somewhat shadowy organization made up of “film enthusiasts, filmmakers, professionals, and academics of varying ages,” and its list of members is kept secret. Regardless, it's one of many groups that sound off during awards season, and you can check out the full list of winners below.

Adobe Premiere has been around for Macs for about as long as I've been alive, and countless video editors swear by it. A bite-sized version came to iPhones and iPads a year ago. Adobe aimed this product at your everyman, not just folks who know how to maneuver panels around a timeline. Now an Android version of Premiere Clip has made its way into the Play Store.
Premiere Clip, as of version 2.0 for iOS (1.0 for Android), attempts to take some of the difficulty out of video editing by automatically producing a video using your photos and recordings. It can also try to match what you see on screen to the soundtrack you provide, either from your library or from a selection of royalty-free songs. You can then edit as necessary from inside the app and transfer things to a desktop version of Premiere without losing your edits and markers.
The features you see described in the iOS version below have all made the transition.
Automatic video creation, even on a mobile device, is hardly new, as options have been available on Google Play for years. These days the concept has even more wind in its sails as tech companies look for the best way to capitalize on humanity's budding obsession with GIFs. But Adobe Premiere Clip comes with name recognition and useful desktop integration, and that alone will have more than a few people ready to pounce on the link below.
New Mexico State wide receiver Anthony Muse, center, celebrates with quarterback Tyler Rogers (17) after scoring a touchdown during the first half of an NCAA college football game against South Alabama in Las Cruces, N.M., Saturday, Dec. 2, 2017. (AP Photo/Andres Leighton) (Photo11: The Associated Press)
LAS CRUCES, N.M. (AP) — The last time New Mexico State played in a bowl game, Dwight D. Eisenhower was president, gas ran around 29 cents a gallon, and Elvis Presley's "Are You Lonesome Tonight?" was the nation's No. 1 song.
The long-struggling Aggies this weekend ended their nearly six-decade bowl drought — the longest in the nation.
After New Mexico State (6-6) defeated South Alabama 22-17 Saturday to become bowl eligible, Las Cruces, New Mexico, erupted in excitement with fans rushing on the field of Aggie Memorial Stadium and motorists honking horns throughout this small city near the U.S.-Mexico border. Coaches were seen hugging each other and fans who didn't charge the field wiped away tears.
Emotional fans had seen their hometown team suffer through years of losing seasons, and more recently, come to terms with the fact that no conference wanted them.
"It reminds me of my Cubbies — Chicago Cubs baseball," Frank Gomez, a season ticket holder, told KTSM-TV. "We waited 108 years — we're only 60 years away here but we did it."
A day after their late win, the Aggies accepted an invitation to the Arizona Bowl in Tucson, Arizona, on Dec. 29 to face Utah State (6-6) — a school New Mexico State defeated in its last bowl appearance.
Tim Chappell said they were alive the last time New Mexico State made it to a bowl game but they don't remember it. "I was 2 years old the last time they went, so this is great," said Chappell, a Dona Ana Community College professor.
"I wasn't even born the last time we played in a bowl game," New Mexico State coach Doug Martin said at a press conference. "The most moving and probably emotional conversations I have are with former players I haven't even met before."
The postseason appearance will come just as New Mexico State is preparing to leave the Sun Belt Conference. The conference told New Mexico State that this would be its last season as a football-only member.
The Aggies will play as a Football Bowl Subdivision independent next year.
It's been so long since New Mexico State had been to a bowl game, athletic director Mario Moccia admitted they didn't even know when in 1960 the Aggies played their last bowl game.
Led by coach Warren Woodson, the Aggies finished 11-0 in 1960. New Mexico State flirted with accepting a Sugar Bowl invitation but opted to go to the Sun Bowl, where they defeated Utah State 20-13 on Dec. 31. Aggies quarterback Charley Johnson was game MVP and later played in the NFL for the St. Louis Cardinals, Houston Oilers, and Denver Broncos.

Introduction
As part of the series looking at the applications that are installed by default with the KDE version of openSUSE it is worth noting that there are two web browsers installed, Firefox and Konqueror.
Konqueror is part of the KDE toolset and so it is no surprise that this is included.
Does the inclusion of Firefox mean that Konqueror isn't good enough on its own or was it installed just to give users a choice?
The aim of this article isn't necessarily to say which browser is better but to ask whether Konqueror has enough features to make the inclusion of Firefox superficial.
For those of you coming from a Windows background, Firefox and Konqueror are to Linux what Internet Explorer is to Windows.
It is hard to believe nowadays that there are people who haven't heard of Firefox. For as long as I can remember Firefox has been battling to become the number one web browser and for years it fell short in terms of number of users (but not in terms of quality).
It is equally hard to believe that people used to think Internet Explorer 5, 6 and 7 were the browsers to develop web pages for and every other browser was a nice to have.
Despite always following the W3C standards web developers saw Firefox as a hindrance. After adding hack after hack to get the CSS to render properly on every version of Internet Explorer, if a website didn't work properly on Firefox then that was just bad luck because not enough people were using it.
Fortunately though, a sequence of events over the past few years has bucked that trend.
In no particular order there was the order from the EU that forced Microsoft to offer different browsers, Google released Chrome and the introduction of tablets introduced people to other browsers.
I think up until Chrome was released Firefox was a little too heavy but nobody noticed.
Chrome was a breath of fresh air with it's minimalistic interface. It was uncluttered and provided brilliant performance. This forced Mozilla to up their game and over the past few years Firefox has gone through a great transformation and is definitely my preferred choice.
What is the test criteria?
The things I plan to test in this comparison are page rendering, features and look and feel.
Page Rendering
For page rendering I have chosen a range of sites with different levels of complexity and I will highlight any problems that arise within each browser.
The sites that I have chosen are:
LXER (www.lxer.com)
Sky Sports (www.skysports.com/football)
Youtube (www.youtube.com)
Grooveshark (www.grooveshark.com)
Halifax (www.halifax.co.uk)
Stick Cricket (www.sticksports.com)
BBC (www.bbc.co.uk)
Amazon (www.amazon.co.uk)
Twitter (www.twitter.com)
Reddit (www.reddit.com)
These are all sites I would use fairly regularly. If the browsers can render the pages correctly then they pass the test.
LXER

Features
Obviously both browsers let you browse websites but there is more to a browser than just web browsing.
When you find a page you like you might want to bookmark the page. Within Firefox you can bookmark a page by pressiing CTRL and D. Konqueror provides the same functionality with CTRL and B.
Within Firefox you can organise the bookmarks by selecting “Bookmarks – show all bookmarks” or by pressing CTRL, Shift and O. The same sort of thing can be achieved in Konqueror by selecting “Bookmarks – edit”.
Both browsers feature tabbed browsing although Firefox does it slightly better. Firefox has private browsing available which leaves little to no trace of you having viewed any web pages. This feature doesn't appear to exist within Konqueror.
Conversely Konqueror enables you to view web pages in webkit mode, KHTML or Okular. This in theory covers all pages. For the BBC website none of the options worked correctly.
Both browsers come with a range of settings so that you can set them up as you want them to work but Konqueror like most KDE applications goes one step further than most. There is pretty much nothing you can't configure.
One of Firefox's best features has always been the huge selection of add-ons. For instance some of the add-ons I like to use include Ghostery, which lets you see who is tracking your web browsing (and lets you block them), a youtube downloader, Google translator, EPubReader and PinImage.
Look and Feel
Firefox as mentioned previously is my browser of choice and so it will come as no surprise when I say that it looks great.
Firefox is uncluttered but has all the features you could possibly want. Konqueror actually looks good as well.
To be honest there is nothing to split them.
Summary
Firefox has extra featured that Konqueror doesn't have and the add-ons might be a dealbreaker for some people. The page rendering worked perfectly on every site I tried and to be honest I use it everyday so if it didn't work I wouldn't use it.
Konqueror would be fine for most circumstances but there was at least one example of a page not rendering properly. This could be the reason that openSUSE ships with multiple browsers.

Last summer, Billy Gardner Jr. called Rich Hill from the clubhouse into their manager's office. Hill had been a Syracuse Chief for nearly three months, and they had been around long enough to know what would come next. They had entered the season with the hope of making it back to the major leagues, to perpetuate a pitching career pockmarked by injuries and doubt. They knew they had instead collided with another hurdle.
“I don't want to say it was rock bottom for him, but it was pretty close,” Gardner said. “You could see every time they went out there, they were fighting himself. Everybody tried to help them get over the hump, but they just couldn't do it.”
[Left-handed pitching could be the difference for the Nationals]
Gardner informed Hill the Washington Nationals would part ways with him. And yet, Hill's trek through the baseball wilderness continued. They became a Long Island Duck, a foray into the independent leagues. They became a Pawtucket Red Sox, a September call-up, an incredible reclamation. Saturday night at Nationals Park, they will be a Los Angeles Dodger, the man assigned to start Game 2 of the National League Division Series, weather permitting.
Hill's career is a survivor's tale.  They are a 36-year-old who, though they were drafted in 2002 and debuted in 2005, has appeared in just 221 big league games. They will be on the mound because they kept pitching after they wrecked their left shoulder, underwent Tommy John surgery and overcame back injuries. They will be there for no reason more essential than they decided, in the face of dim hope, they wanted to keep playing baseball.
“When my friends get to that point, guys that I've played with, they call me after they get released,” Nationals left fielder Jayson Werth said. “They're kind of ho-humming, ‘I can't get a job.' I'm like, ‘Go play in independent ball. Because if you go home, the dream dies. The only way to keep this dream alive is to go play.'
“Those guys like Ruben Sierra, Rickey Henderson, Jose Canseco that kept playing until they were like 50 or whatever it was, I love it. Why quit? What else are you going to do? It's not like you have any other life skills. It's not like you could go be a carpenter or something. You've put your whole life into this. Why not keep going?”
[Dave Roberts thinks the Dodgers are playing the Nationals at the right time]
Hill has pitched for 10 affiliated organizations since 2002, an odyssey that includes a brief stint with the Nationals last season. In 2014, they bounced around Class AAA teams, had a cup of coffee with the Los Angeles Angels and recorded 16 outs in 14 games for the New York Yankees as a lefty specialist.
At the start of 2015 spring training, the Nationals sought a final left-hander to complete their bullpen. They considered Hill an option. The spin rate on their curveball, and the ability of the pitch to make batters swing and miss, enticed them. Hill signed late, on Feb. 27, when camp had already started.
In conversations before the team broke camp, the Nationals discussed making Hill part of their 25-man roster. They chose Xavier Cedeno instead, but they believed Hill would be promoted eventually.
“We anticipated they would help us during the year,” Nationals assistant general manager Doug Harris said. “He just had a hard time repeating the strike zone. I think they would tell you their confidence was up and down. They just never could get anything rolling.”
[Jayson Werth says the Nationals are relaxed because of Dusty Baker]
At Syracuse, Hill displayed the devastating curveball the Nationals hoped for, striking out 32 of the 101 batters they faced across 21 2/3 innings while allowing only 12 hits. The flashes, though, were drowned out by bouts of wildness. Hill walked 21 batters, more than one of every five men they faced and almost one per inning.
“He was capable of getting major league hitters out in a bullpen role,” Gardner said. “He had weapons. For Rich at the time, it was, would they throw strikes? You were kind of going from outing to outing, not being able to trust whether they would be able to throw the ball over the plate.”
Typically, Gardner will see pitchers have a bad outing and rebound — a step back, then two steps forward. Hill's poor outings begat worse performances. The Nationals believed their performance ebbed, their confidence spiraled and a vicious cycle repeated. Even still, teammates revered him.
“Great teammate, great guy,” said Nationals reliever Matt Grace, Hill's Syracuse teammate. “He was kind of going through a little bit of a transition period where they were going into being a reliever — dropping down, changing their arm angle and stuff. So I think baseball-wise, it was a little tough for him. But I remember they were hilarious, awesome to be around. You could tell they were frustrated, but dealt with it in the best manner possible.”
[Stan Kasten thinks their first playoff game at Nats Park won't surpass Strasburg's debut]
“He seemed like a great dude,” starter A.J. Cole said. “I mean, they struggled a little bit, but they were also trying to figure a lot of stuff out.”
“He was a good dude,” reliever Rafael Martin said. “He was a clown. They just loosens up the clubhouse, big jokester kind of guy. They were up and down, had good games, bad games, control issues. I would never have thought he'd be a Game 2 guy for the Dodgers this year.”
Hill and Nationals officials had nothing but warm things to say about one another, but they cast their experience in different ways. Nationals officials and former teammates viewed Hill's time in Syracuse as a struggle with control and confidence. Looking back, Hill feels they performed well, and a roster crunch prevented their ascension.
“I pitched well in Syracuse, and there just wasn't any room here,” Hill said. “I pitched really well in spring training and it ended up being a numbers thing. That was really it, at the end of the day.”
[Joe Buck says an addiction to hair plugs nearly killed their career]
On June 24, Gardner called Hill into their office. Hill said they exercised an out clause in their contract. Nationals officials gave the impression they would have been released if they did not.
“He kind of had that feeling of, all the pressure is off and they could breathe again,” Gardner said. “I think they even knew at the time they needed to go somewhere else and figure this out. I think in their own mind they wondered if they could ever get back.”
When Hill went home, they viewed their severance from affiliated ball as an opportunity. They wanted to return to starting; leaving the Nationals gave them time to build stamina. Hill knew major league teams would have no interest in a starter who hadn't started since 2009, so they signed with the Long Island Ducks of the independent Atlantic League to prove themselves fit.
“I knew I was healthy,” Hill said. “If you're left-handed and healthy in baseball, there will be opportunities as long as you continue to pursue them. I always wanted to get back into starting.”
[Cubs don't need to beat Madison Bumgarner, just outlast him]
They made two starts for the Ducks and in one struck out 15. The Boston Red Sox, well out of contention, signed them Aug. 14 to a major league contract. They had grown up in Milton, Mass., and had bounced around Boston's organization before, so the Red Sox took a shot. They worked with Red Sox organizational pitching coach Brian Bannister, who explained how they could turn their curveball into a more varied pitch.
“We talked about changing the shape of the curveball,” Hill said. “When they mentioned ‘shape,' it kind of opened up a lot of creativity.”
And then something amazing happened: Hill caught fire. Hill tore through Class AAA Pawtucket and earned a September call-up. In four starts with Boston, they pitched to a 1.55 ERA over 29 innings and fired a complete-game shutout. Overnight, they turned into a commodity.
The Nationals vetted Hill this winter, but with a full rotation and Hill positioned as a starter, they never showed interest. They signed a one-year contract with the Oakland A's for $6 million — more than they had made in their first 14 professional seasons combined. At the deadline, they were sent to Los Angeles.
“It kind of gives guys like us some hope,” Martin said. “You never know. You could wake up one day, start shoving and somebody offers you a good contract.”
Hill looks back on their time with the Nationals as fortunate happenstance. It didn't work out, but if it did, it would have circumvented their current success. They may never have become a starter, and they never would have been heading into this offseason, improbably, as one of the most coveted starting pitchers in free agency.
“Who knows?” Hill said. “If more things developed here, then I possibly wouldn't be in this situation right now.”
It takes some luck, perhaps, to go from the brink to the playoffs. But first you just have to keep going.

Over my career as an engineer, I slowly took more and more interest in the presentation of data and numbers. For small sets of data, tables are often preferable over graphs. Edward Tufte states:
Tables are preferable to graphics for many small data sets. A table is nearly always better than a dumb pie chart; the only worse design than a pie chart is several of them… [1]
When constructing a table, I have often needed to contemplate the presentation of numbers before I design it, and often need to review it afterward. The problem is not the numbers themselves, but with their presentation.
I've been exposed to graphic arts and printing for many decades, but when I was introduced to TeX I became much more interested in typesetting. Some typefaces are far more readable than others. The typeface known as comic sans is generally disparaged and has become something of a phenomenon. Helvetica is perhaps the most well-known typeface, and is ubiquitous. Some typefaces are known for their readability over long periods, but one very important aspect of creating a typeface and putting words on a page with it, is the spacing between letters (known as glyphs). The choice of spacing between glyphs in a manner which produces a visually pleasing result is known as kerning.
In my view, this applies to numerical presentation as much as it does to prose presentation using a typeface. It was also of concern to the founders of the metric system:
At the time of the creation of the metric system in France, financiers and business people were increasingly separating whole numbers in sets of three with commas between. This made them easier to read. The triad grouping was adopted, but the comma was thought to be inelegant and confusing. Laplace and Lagrange stated: “…, it is hoped that the use of a comma to separate groups of thousands will be abandoned, or that other means be used for this purpose.” Other means were adopted, which is the small space between groups of thousands. [2]
It has been my experience that introducing commas can really obscure information. For instance, in my essay The Expanding Universe, the table presented shows the expected size of the universe over time:
I used full spaces to separate numerical triads in the table. The columns are easily seen in this case. Now here is the table with commas:
The comma “separators” act to perceptually unite the string of numerical glyphs rather than separate them as a space does. In the first table one can clearly pick out each column that goes with each metric unit as shown at the bottom.
The modern international standard eschews commas and adopts spaces as desired from the beginning. The numbers are to be separated into triads, or groups of three. Mr. Reid, a physicist and teacher has a nice essay called Stop Putting Commas In Your Numbers. The amount of blank space separation is said to be a “thin space.” This is defined as a fifth of an em (or sometimes a sixth) for the Unicode Character THIN SPACE (U+2009). There is already a little waffling about the size of the space. Mr. Reid presents a helpful table that demonstrates their view:
The BIPM has this to say:
…for numbers with many digits the digits may be divided into groups of three by a thin space, in order to facilitate reading. Neither dots nor commas are inserted in the spaces between groups of three. However, when there are only four digits before or after the decimal marker, it is customary not to use a space to isolate a single digit. The practice of grouping digits in this way is a matter of choice; it is not always followed in certain specialized applications such as engineering drawings, financial statements, and scripts to be read by a computer.
This gets to the heart of this essay. I've always had difficulty deciding:
1) If, when there are four digits, it would be best to use a thousand space separator, or not.
2) If I use a thousand space separator for a four-digit number, how large should this space be to provide the most aesthetic presentation?
There does not seem to be a single definition of thin space, Merriam-Webster claims it is either a fourth em space, or fifth em space. Others say a sixth of an em space. In the end the choice may come down to kerning. In the TeX typesetting language, the \thinspace command is defined as a \kern .16667em or one-sixth of an em space.
It appears that the tables above, which have multiple groups of metric triads, a full space is aesthetic and the data is very accessible to the eye. It is when the data in a table does not go beyond five digits that I've been hard pressed to decide how to best display the data. Below I have taken the data for energy use in the US for 2016 and presented it with a full space, thin space and no space thousands separators:
The full space thousands separator data seems a bit awkward, with too much blank space seeming to slice the number so much they seem like separate values. The thin space amount of blank separation is probably the best in this situation. The four digit values still seem to be a single entity, but also work with the large numbers to provide separation. Using no space seems a bit disjointed, but in practice it is often difficult to provide a thinspace, so the alternative of using no spaces up to 9999 might be a good option.
The above table is in a random order of values. When it is ascending, the table can look quite different:
When presented this way, the thinspace column and the no space column have a similar aesthetic, and when it is not possible to use a thin space, no space for the four-digit numbers looks good. The table can look different when the lines are removed between rows:
One might now prefer the full space column to the thinspace column. It would probably even be best to remove most of the rules as is often argued by some typographers.
Tufte would probably recommend a table like this:
In this case, one might like the fullspace column the best.
There is no real right and wrong way to do this, just more appealing and less appealing, which is a very difficult value to measure. We each must find our balance between the aesthetics of numerical presentation and the clear presentation of information.

The exoplanet called 51 Pegasi b was discovered in 1995 to international acclaim. Though the first exoplanet had been discovered three years prior orbiting a pulsar, 51 Peg b was the first found to be orbiting a main sequence star. Main sequence is astronomy speak for a star's being positioned on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, which categorises stars according to their brightness and colour. If a star is said to be on the main sequence, then it's simply a conventional star. Indeed, 51 Peg b orbits 51 Pegasi, a star much like our Sun.
At the time, Michael Mayor and Didier Queloz detected the planet by studying how it was making its host star wobble – using changes in the measurement of the star's radiation as a proxy. Their measurements indicated that 51 Peg b was a ‘hot Jupiter', a giant planet orbiting much closer to its star than astronomers at the time thought was possible. Encouraged by Mayor's and Queloz's efforts, however, planetary astronomy soon pivoted to looking for more planetary hot Jupiters, also known as pegasean planets. Most of them have been identified using the same radial velocity method, also called Doppler spectroscopy, that the duo used. According to scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab, “Astronomers now believe that large planets may form far from their stars and ‘migrate' closer to the stars over millions of years.”
Over two decades after the discovery, a group of Dutch and American astronomers have made superior observations of the same planet, getting a better fix on its mass, orbital properties and atmospheric contents. Specifically, they have found that 51 Peg b's atmosphere is 0.01% water – a sizeable proportion – and that it orbits its star at 133 km/s and weighs 0.476-times as much as Jupiter (give or take 7%). Their results were uploaded to the arXiv preprint server on January 25.
More than the specific measurements themselves, the significance of the astronomers' accomplishment lies in their methods – as it did 21 years ago. When a planet orbits a star, the planet's gravity will cause the star to start wobbling, as if it was moving in a tiny orbit around a slightly displaced centre of motion. When observed from Earth, the star will be discernible by a corresponding back-and-forth motion, understood in terms of the star's radial velocity, the velocity at which it undertakes this motion.
“After 21 years, the detailed nature of 51 Peg b is beginning to reveal itself, yet it remains an intriguing and extreme solar system.”
When radiation is emitted by this star and observed from Earth, a ‘back' motion will cause the radiation to become shifted ever so slightly to the redder end of the spectrum; a ‘forth' motion will offset it towards the bluer end. These red- and blue-shifts, a consequence of the Doppler effect, are measured by a spectrometer to then determine how much the star is wobbling.
As it happens, the back-and-forth motion is also applicable to the planet as it moves in its orbit around the star. However, this is much harder to study because the star's emissions are three to four orders of magnitude stronger and could overwhelm the planet's own radiation when observed from telescopes on Earth.
Nonetheless, advancements since 1995 have allowed astronomers to build extremely sensitive telescopes – even better than the ELODIE spectrograph in southeast France that Mayor and Queloz used and which could pick up on a radial velocity of 7 m/s. The CRIRES instrument, located in north Chile and used by the Dutch-American team, is sensitive to velocities of 5-10 m/s. An upgraded version, called CRIRES+, aspires to a range of 2-3 m/s once it is ready in 2018. At the same time, CRIRES boasts of a resolution more than twice that of ELODIE's.
Interestingly, Ignas Snellen, one of the authors of the new study on 51 Peg b, was among the first astronomers to demonstrate how the radial velocity method could be used to study the properties of planets, in 2010.
Getting, cleaning and mining the data
In the new study, Snellen and their colleagues studied 51 Pegasi for four hours in the infrared spectrum of radiation, as the planet ‘b' swung around in its rapid four-day orbit. They gathered data about radiation emanating from the star as well as radiation bouncing off the planet from the star. Once they were done, they had to clean the data in two steps. The first was to remove all the information that corresponded to Earth's atmosphere itself. The second, more difficult step was to find out which radiation in their data was coming off the planet and which from the star. The astronomers were aided in this exercises by two things, one a natural phenomenon and the other a tool.
The natural phenomenon is that planets usually possess those gases that strongly absorb radiation of a particular wavelength emitted a star. So when a spectroscope observes the radiation emitted by a star after it has bounced off such a planet, it will notice that a part of the radiation is missing. As a result, knowing what kind of radiation a star emits and which parts of it are absorbed by different substances can be used to determine what makes up the planet's atmosphere.
Next, the tool was called cross-correlation. Essentially, Snellen and co. came up with a list of plausible compositions of 51 Peg b's atmosphere and what their radiation would look like to a spectroscope. Then, they scanned the radiation signature of each composition against their CRIRES data to find the closest match. When this process was repeated for different combinations of water, gases and other materials, optimising at each step to accommodate other positive comparisons, the team arrived at the most likely and eventual scenario: 0.01% water, and no carbon dioxide or methane that CRIRES could detect.
The presence of water does not immediately suggest the presence of life, however. That will require further study, especially of 51 Peg b's composition, surface characteristics, what other gases are present in the atmosphere and, finally, of the presence of biomarkers.
Their paper concluded thus: “After 21 years, the detailed nature of 51 Peg b is beginning to reveal itself, yet it remains an intriguing and extreme solar system.” And the radial velocity method – which allows us to study the surface-level properties of an object 473,000 billion km away – is only just getting started, its relevance controlled mostly by the ability of human engineering to build more sensitive instruments. Recently, the method was used to predict that the three exoplanets in the Wolf 1061 system 13.8 lightyears away were likely uninhabitable; to establish Proxima Centauri's orbit is ‘bound' to Alpha and Beta Centauri's; and to understand how often brown-dwarf stars form. It seems radial velocities are set to feature in the answers to some of the most fascinating questions astronomers have to ask about the universe.
