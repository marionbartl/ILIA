Rodgers & Hammerstein's epic musical romance South Pacific makes its La Mirada Theatre debut! Although well-known for its extraordinary score – “Some Enchanted Evening,” “Younger Than Springtime,” “Bali Ha'i,” “There is Nothin' Like A Dame,” and “A Wonderful Guy” – SOUTH PACIFIC is also a deeply felt drama. Its portrayal of Americans stationed in a foreign culture in wartime is as relevant today as when it first thrilled audiences in 1949. Don't miss it here, in all its melodic glory!

America's unique burger styles, and where to try them The lamb burger at Park in in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has a Greek spin, topped with lamb bacon and Kalamata olive relish, while underneath the patty is feta cheese. 01 / 45 The lamb burger at Park in in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has a Greek spin, topped with lamb bacon and Kalamata olive relish, while underneath the patty is feta cheese. 01 / 45
The scene: One thing Great American Bites has learned traveling the backroads of the nation is that there are far more ways to cook burgers than you might think. If you want to try some of America's variety of regional preparations, these are the places to visit:
Gas
Burgers are a uniquely American invention, and the place that has the best claim to having actually birthed our favorite food is Louis' Lunch in New Haven, Connecticut, which gets the support of the Library of Congress for its historical significance. Little has changed here in over a century, and they still cook on the original custom-made upright cast iron gas grills, sort of vertical waffle irons for burgers. The result is a little bit of a crunchier exterior char than many of us get at home, with a still perfectly medium center, and the burgers or cheeseburgers (using spreadable cheese, not slices) are still served on toasted white bread — also cooked with gas — since the burgers themselves predate buns.
Fire-grilled
Because live fire inside the kitchen is tricky, this is much less common in restaurants than backyards, and two places we've visited over the years really stand out. The Weber Grill mini-chain uses the company's iconic kettle grills in the kitchen to provide a finer dining take on the home cookout and does a great job. It has five Midwest locations including Chicago, St. Louis and Indianapolis. They cook over charcoal, and offer several options including a rarity usually found only at the highest end steakhouses, the Prime Burger, with USDA Prime Ground Chuck, bourbon grilled onions, and cheddar.
In Las Vegas we loved the burgers (and amazing pudding shakes!) at multiple Michelin Star holder and celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay's BurGR. Located in the Planet Hollywood casino hotel, it features a live-fire grill burning a mix of apple and alderwood. Patties are made from a mixture of ground brisket, chuck and short rib, and Ramsay forgoes spices or sauces and instead brushes the burgers with imported English Devonshire butter. Standout brioche buns are baked fresh daily and dotted with white and black sesame seeds, and the burgers are perfectly cooked to order, with fantastic specialty options. One favorite is the stacked Farm Burger, with English sharp cheddar, a fried egg and duck breast bacon, while the Brittania burger makes novel — and delicious — use of mango chutney, along with sharp cheddar and arugula.
Steamed
Food historians are quick to point out that despite their mass market bastardization, authentic “sliders” are not just miniature burgers, they are steamed so the bun, cheese and patty become integrated. Serious Eats editor J. Kenji Lopez-Alt notes that, “Invented in Wichita, Kansas, in 1916 by Walter Anderson (who five years later founded White Castle), sliders were at one time the predominant form of burger on the planet. Weighing in at under two ounces, the diminutive sandwiches are made by slowly steam-griddling thin, all-beef patties on a bed of onions.” Anderson's invention is served at a handful of mom-and-pop spots, mostly in New Jersey and the Northeast, but is best associated with their still-thriving national chain, White Castle — the world's oldest fast food burger brand. The preformed square patties have five holes in them to let steam pass through, and they are cooked on a bed of chopped onions and their liquid so they steam without ever touching the griddle, with the rolls placed over the meat before being fully constructed. As a result, the buns are steamy and moist and stuck to the meat (and optional cheese). You either love or hate the steamed burger, and if you love it — I do — White Castle is awesome.
For non-chain spot, Ted's, in Meriden, Connecticut, is a one-off steamed burger specialist that uses a custom-made machine, a metal cabinet with little drawers, not unlike a workshop parts cabinet. A square slab of ground beef or cheddar cheese is inserted in each drawer, which are then shut, and steam cooks everything. If you get a cheeseburger, the oozy cheese is scooped onto the finished burger. It's a unique style of cooking that drains off the fat, and it produced the juiciest well-done burger I have ever had.
Griddled
This is the most common restaurant preparation for burgers, at both fast food and sit-down eateries, and for the former, our national favorites are Five Guys and Whataburger, both of which roll out a far more satisfying and more homemade tasting burger than the big three. Five Guys specializes in doubles with two thin cooked-to-order patties, with juicy results, and showcases a vast array of free optional toppings. Whataburger is a Southern chain that debuted in 1950 as the fourth fast food burger chain in the nation (before McDonald's and Burger King). Two of its three predecessors were tiny burger specialists, White Castle and Krystal, so Whataburger carved out the big burger niche in fast food and has kept it ever since, serving tasty two-hands-required sandwiches. The patties are made freshly and taste better, the chain has its own line of quality condiments and also offers another fantastic take burger rarely seen in fast food, the patty melt.
A smaller chain that does a fantastic job with griddled burgers is Hopdoddy Burger Bar, which started in Austin, Texas, and is now found across the Southwest. Hopdoddy's uses only naturally raised drug-free beef from partner ranchers in Texas and Colorado, and all proteins are ground fresh daily at each location. In addition to great beef they offer a wide variety of patty options including lamb, turkey, bison and even tuna steaks. Often overlooked buns are stars here, brioche versions baked daily, with options for multi-grain and gluten free.
Griddle-smashed
This style is the current rage, with a ball of meat crushed by spatula over a bed of chopped onions on a flat top. It is the longtime signature of national chain Smashburger, and as the frequent winner of various best fast food burger competitions, that's a great place to try it. It's a cut above most competitors in both taste and atmosphere, with all food cooked to order. The chain uses only 100% Certified Angus Beef (CAB), a specialty brand which requires 10 extra tests beyond normal USDA grading. They do only fresh, never frozen, and each burger starts as a ball of ground beef on a well-buttered griddle and is then pressed with a metal plate until it begins to form a seared crust.
For a one-off take on the style, we loved Off-Site Kitchen in Dallas, a kitschy throwback concept full of pop culture décor run by a highly trained fine dining chef who pulls out all the stops to perfect the seemingly simple burger. Extensive taste testing led them to use only one ranch in Nebraska for the meat, and it is ground daily in-house, using a very particular technique. Shoulder meat only is put in a freezer until almost frozen, then ground on machines that are also kept in the freezer because friction generates heat, and the owner believes this breaks down the fat and meat in a way that causes burgers to taste stringy. The cold-ground burgers are perfect, the topping selection is great, and the buns, stylistically in-between traditional and brioche style, complete a simply fantastic burger experience.
Patty melt
I am a huge fan of this unique style where a burger patty is served on sliced bread, usually rye, done grilled cheese-style. In fact, the more burgers I try the more convinced I become that if there is a single best burger style, this is it. While you can get them at many diners, or previously mentioned fast food chain Whataburger, the best I've had is at Park, a modern gastropub in Cambridge, Massachusetts (which also won a reader voting competition held by popular BostonBurgerBlog as the city's finest). Co-owner Patrick Lee told me the sandwiches never “were things we thought would ever become the iconic dishes of the restaurant. But our chef's thing is to put a twist on everything, and there are so many burgers around here they did the patty melt.” It is an elevated take on the genre, cut diagonally into two eye-catching triangles. Park uses square organic rye loaves from Boston's beloved Iggy's artisanal bakery and had custom metal dies fabricated to shape square patties that fit the bread perfectly. They use a custom meat blend from New York's famed butcher Pat LaFrieda, add American cheese, Cholula onions and optional bacon. It is stunning.
Jucy Lucy
It would be wrong to conclude this take on American regional burger styles without Minnesota's unique contribution to the canon, the Jucy Lucy. Now a citywide signature, it is two patties formed around American cheese and sealed along the perimeter, so the melted cheese becomes an oozy volcanic core to a single thick patty. It was invented at Matt's Bar, and this humble, but charming, neighborhood tavern remains the place to make a burger pilgrimage in the Twin Cities. I've seen such burgers attempted by home chefs, but never with this success — it appears to be a normal, single contiguous patty until bitten into, whereupon the cross-section clearly reveals the top and bottom halves, and the cheese is well distributed in every bite but never breaks through prematurely. It is one tasty burger, but be careful — the wait staff will warn you — if you bite into it too quickly or aggressively you will burn your mouth. My friends and I liked it so much we immediately ordered another round.

The Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday for the second time in three months, citing continued US economic growth and job market strength, and announced it would begin cutting its holdings of bonds and other securities this year.
The decision lifted the US central bank's benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point to a target range of 1.00 percent to 1.25 percent as it proceeds with its first tightening cycle in more than a decade.
In its statement following a two-day meeting, the Fed's policy-setting committee indicated the economy had been expanding moderately, the labor market continued to strengthen and a recent softening in inflation was seen as transitory.
The Fed gave a clear outline on its plan to reduce its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, most of which were purchased in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession.
"The committee currently expects to begin implementing a balance sheet normalization program this year, provided that the economy evolves broadly as anticipated," the Fed said in its statement.
According to an addendum released with the policy statement, the Fed anticipates that the balance sheet reduction plan would feature halting reinvestments of ever-larger amounts of maturing securities.
The Fed sees the cap for Treasury securities to be $6 billion per month initially, increasing in $6 billion increments at three-month intervals over 12 months until it reaches $30 billion per month.
For agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, the cap will be $4 billion per month initially, increasing by $4 billion at quarterly intervals over a year until it reaches $20 billion per month.Fed Chair Janet Yellen is due to hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m.
Eyes on inflation
The Fed has now raised rates four times as part of a normalization of monetary policy that began in December 2015. The central bank had pushed rates to near zero in response to the financial crisis.
Policymakers also released their latest set of quarterly economic forecasts which showed temporary concern about inflation and continued confidence about economic growth in the coming years. They forecast US economic growth of 2.2 percent in 2017, an increase from the previous projection in March.
Inflation was expected to be at 1.7 percent by the end of this year, down from the 1.9 percent previously forecast.A retreat in inflation over the past two months has caused jitters among some Fed officials who fear that the shortfall, if sustained, could alter the pace of future rate hikes. Earlier on Wednesday, the Labor Department reported consumer prices unexpectedly fell in May, the second drop in three months.
The Fed's preferred measure of underlying inflation has retreated to 1.5 percent, from 1.8 percent earlier this year, and has run below the central bank's 2 percent target for more than five years.
Expectations of any fiscal stimulus in the near term from the Trump administration have also waned with campaign promises on tax cuts, regulation rollbacks and infrastructure spending either still on the drawing board or facing hurdles in Congress.
Interest rates are seen rising one more time by the end of this year, according to the median projection of the forecasts released with the Fed's policy statement, in keeping with the previous forecast.
Estimates for the unemployment rate by the end of this year moved down to 4.3 percent, the current level, and to 4.2 percent in 2018, indicating the Fed believes the labor market will continue to tighten.
The median estimate of the long-run neutral rate, which is seen as the level of monetary policy that neither boosts nor slows the economy, was unchanged at 3.0 percent. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari dissented in Wednesday's decision.
Iniesta agrees first 'lifetime' contract at Barça
BARCELONA - Barcelona tied down captain Andres Iniesta for the rest of their career as the club announced on Friday the 33-year-old midfielder has agreed the first "lifetime contract" in Barça's history. "It is a way of rewarding an exceptional player," said Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu. Iniesta insisted, though, that they have not planned any future role with the club beyond their playing career. "The lifetime title doesn't mean that I will remain here just for the sake of it. It isn't my way of doing things," said Iniesta. "When I don't have the same force or importance I have always had things can always change. Today I am hugely grateful for the confidence the club has shown in me." Along with five-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi, Iniesta is Barça's most decorated player.–AFP
Heynckes to coach Bayern Munich
BERLIN - Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich Friday said veteran German coach Jupp Heynckes will take over as manager until the end of the season. Heynckes, 72, will come out of retirement to take charge of the squad from Monday, the fourth time they have coached Bayern. "There is a strong relationship of trust between Jupp Heynckes and FC Bayern," said club chairperson Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. "He is at the moment the ideal coach for Bayern." Heynckes will be assisted by the current co-trainer of Fortuna Duesseldorf, Peter Hermann and the current sports director of Bayern's youth team, Hermann Gerland. It was along with Hermann and Gerland that Heynckes led Bayern to win the 2013 treble, the first -- and only time -- a German club won the Bundesliga, Champions League and German Cup titles in a season.–AFP
FA chief plays down England chances
LONDON - Football Association chief Martin Glenn was cautious about England's chances at next year's World Cup on Friday after the team qualified for Russia 2018 with a lacklustre performance against Slovenia. Thursday's 1-0 win at an under-capacity Wembley, thanks to a last-gasp Harry Kane goal, sealed their place in the finals as group winners but the laboured manner of the victory drew widespread criticism. Glenn admitted the performance lacked fluidity but pleaded for realism in Russia, saying the team was still young. "To me, success is to see the team continue to develop," they told BBC Radio. "Some of the bright young stars will get a fantastic experience upon which they can build for future tournaments. I think you've got to be realistic looking at our historical performance," they added.–AFP

With NCAA conference championship season approaching, many swimmer's focus is on swimming a time fast enough to get them invited to the national championship meet. Making their lives complicated is the fact that no one knows what time will be required to qualify for the meet. If you want the full details on the NCAA qualifying system (or a reminder), you can check out our detailed explanation.
There is good news for aspiring nationals swimmers. While the cut lines aren't set in stone, they are more consistent from one year to the next than you might expect from the NCAA's arcane qualifying system. Here is where the cut line has fallen each of the past 5 years:

The goal is to try and figure out where those times will fall this year. The times generally get faster from one year to the next (about .17% per event, standard deviation .2%). Generally the majority of qualifying times get faster each year. The main exception was the men in 2016 when 8 of 13 times were slower than the year before. Before we blame that on an Olympic year, it's worth noting that the women's qualifying times were slower in only 2 of 13 events that year. More likely, this minor slow down can be explained by simple random noise in the data.
The consistency of the year-to-year change in the data is enough to provide a decent estimate of what the qualifying times will be this year. However, we can do better because we know more information than just last year's qualifying times. We also know how swimmers have been performing so far this year. A comparison of the current year's results as of January 31st to the previous year's results as of January 31st has some correlation with how qualifying times change one year to the next.
To model qualifying time change, I only looked at swimmers currently ranked 25th-70th. For the most part, this represents the swimmers on the bubble to make the meet. A typical men's cut line is around 30 and the women's cut line typically is around 40. I tried different ranges for the men and women because of the different cap numbers, but this range seemed to work best for both. I also tried adding in variables for stroke and distance but they did not improve the estimate at all. This historic data reduces the error of our estimates by 17% for the women and 35% for the men. The trend lines are below. Negative is faster, positive is slower. The red lines represent a 95% confidence interval of estimation.

With that model in place, we can now use it to guess the cut times this year. The best guess of the model is reported as the ‘Estimated Cut' below. However, it's unlikely that the cut will fall exactly on any of the estimates. Instead, it's likely to fall within a range of times around the estimate. The model believes there is a 95% chance the real cut line will fall between the ‘Estimate Lower Bound' and the ‘Estimate Upper Bound' listed below.
For the most part the model is pretty conservative predicting small time changes in each event. The main exception is the men's 1650. In that event it predicts the qualifying time will by 4.6 seconds faster than last year and last year's qualifying mark is only .04 inside the estimated range for qualifying times this year.
That is no guarantee that the qualifying time will be faster in the mile. Even if every assumption of this model is correct, I would expect at least 1 time to fall outside the predicted ranges. That being said, I also expect the majority of the times will fall within the estimate ranges and will fall closer to the center of the estimate range than the outer bounds.

For the first time in as many months, Kento Momota looked startled on the court. The wondrous netplay, retrieves, and even the steely defence of the Japanese ace were not enough to tame their opponent.
As they gasped at the net after failing to read a deceiving crosscourt jump-smash from the other side of the court, Momota's coaches — sitting behind them — sensed danger.
There was fear in Momota's eyes. Fear of losing the final of one of the first tournaments on the South East Asian circuit. Fear that their 21-match winning streak would end at the hands of crowd-favourite Lee Chong Wei.
Meanwhile, Momota wasn't just playing against Lee. The ‘Lee Chong Wei Boleh (can do it)' chant echoed the Axiata Arena as the vociferous fans cheered every point won by their countryman. And rightly so, as the Malaysian legend was looking to clinch their 14th Malaysia Open medal in 16 years.
Lee showed no signs of fatigue despite a slew of smashes and delicate net shots thrown at him. They even gave the Japanese a taste of their own medicine by dominating 50-plus-shot rallies. To top it off, the Axiata Arena saw outrageous shots from Lee to which their younger opponent, who floats across the court like old foe Lin Dan, failed to find a counter.
However, Lee got carried away during the dying stages of the second game to take the short route. They trailed 19-18 but then came another jaw-dropping deceptive stroke from deep forehand baseline corner which left Momota startled, yet again. The Japanese took their foot off the pedal and Lee romped to a record 12th Malaysia Open title in 16 years. They fell to the ground in jubilation.
Lee is a gift that keeps on giving.
Ever since Lee Chong Wei graced the court on the international circuit, their discipline and dedication are admired by many, and it all boils down to just one unique trait: hunger.
“I've been with Lee for more than 10 years. Since the age of 19, we saw the spark, the hunger, the approach in them and how they challenge themselves in training sessions. It is important for sportspersons to know what they want. They knew that right from the beginning,” Malaysia national team coach Misbun Sidek told Firstpost during the India Open in New Delhi in February.
Lee will be 36 in November, but the way they have been delivering booming smashes, they look far from finished. At the end of the match and during the prize-distribution ceremony, Lee would celebrate by hugging their two sons, which more or less indicates that there is life beyond badminton.
“He is getting soft in the heart, whereby people ask them 'Why play for so long when you have achieved so much? You have a family now'. It's natural to absorb others' opinion. But they have a vision of winning and they feel that they don't want to leave playing badminton, because the day they get off the court, they are going to miss it badly,” said Misbun, who coached World No 1 Viktor Axelsen for six months ahead of the Rio Olympics in 2016.
Lee has achieved everything there, apart from gold medal at the Olympics and World Championships — sport's two biggest events. And it's not the first time that Misbun was asked about Lee's timid outings and the mental block in the final of marquee events.
It was Lin Dan first, who had stood in the way of the Malaysian's attempts for gold at the Olympic finals in 2008 and 2012, and at the Worlds in 2011 and 2013. Then came another formidable Chinese shuttler in Chen Long, who denied Lee from finally winning gold in 2016 Olympics and at the Worlds in 2015.
“This is all about their career. So many players don't win more than 50 Superseries. They didn't manage to win an Olympic or World Championship gold and their three losses in the final is to me is just unfortunate. It was near and I think it's not for him.  They are the 'King of Superseries'. Maybe they cannot become an Olympic champion but they will always rule the Superseries section. You cannot win everything, can you?” smiled Misbun.
Looking at the pace at which their ward is still delivering, Misbun felt that Lee could embarrass their younger counterparts for another 4-5 years with ease. Albeit, they have to follow the training program and find the "right balance" between sport and their young family.
But the question is: for how long, Lee?
"It's like when you give a horse to drink water, they will drink when they want to. You can't force them to drink. The same is the case with sportspersons. When you are hungry to become a champion, no one can stop you. That's why they are so successful," the 58-year-old said.
Lee played their 104th career final at the Malaysia Open. Don't just rub your eyes in disbelief. There have been multiple occasions where the staff, including Misbun, fans and media have asked them time and again about their future. The 35-year-old had a short, crisp answer ready for their coach. “He said that it's the pleasure of winning, the pleasure of representing the national team,” recalled Misbun.
ROANOKE, Va.- - There are literally signs of hope in Salem. A unique partnership to cut down on panhandling in the city is getting some attention.
The signs are located at Apperson Drive and route 419 as well as Wildwood Road and West Main Street in Salem. The signs are asking people not to solicit in the medians.
If you need help, the city wants you to call a number linking you to Arch in Roanoke. Arch provides safe recovery after addiction and homelessness through Bethany Hall and the Trust House.
"We provide food we provide hygiene products. We get them to any services that they need out of the community whether it be substance-abuse treatment mental health medical," Jeanne McCormack, executive director.
Although the sign doesn't say panhandling, Salem has a ordinance prohibiting solicitations on highways, which is listed in the city code:
Sec. 86-17. - Distribution of handbills, etc., solicitation of contributions, and sale of merchandise, services, etc., on highways prohibited.
new
It shall be unlawful for any person to: (a) Distribute handbills, leaflets, bulletins, literature, advertisements, or similar material to occupants of motor vehicles on highways located within the boundaries of the city or on public roadways and medians, or (b) Solicit contributions of any nature from the occupants of motor vehicles on highways within the boundaries of the city or on public roadways and medians, or (c) Sell merchandise or services or attempt to sell merchandise or services to occupants of motor vehicles on highways located within the boundaries of the city or on public roadways and medians.
"People who were stopping to help would get injured or the people asking for money. They kind of wanted to stop that distraction," said McCormack.
Since the signs went up, they've been getting several calls and emails a day from people asking their services. And it's not always from people with addictions.
"A lot of the times it's been people that are stuck here that are trying to get back home because they have family somewhere else and they don't know how to get back to Idaho or Montana. We do have organizations in the community that can help with bus passes to get them back to those family members," said McCormack.
Arch believes this signs goes along with their mission of giving people second chances and new beginnings.

ISLAMABAD, Aug 14 (APP): State Minister for Capital
Administration and Development Division (CADD) Tariq Fazal Chaudhry
on Monday reiterated the government's resolve to introduce
model education system to tackle the needs of modern era.
Addressing the national flag hoisting ceremony at National
Institution of Special Education on the eve of 70th Independence Day
of the motherland here Monday, they said there was no dearth of talent in
the country.
The minister informed that five busses worth Rs.35 million
were granted to the special children and under the prime minister
educational reforms programme, upgradation work worth of Rs. 100
had also been initiated for such institutions.
Educational system of the capital would be the model system for
provinces and I hope that the provinces would follow it, Tariq Fazal
Chuadhry added.
They expressed determination that the incumbent government would
eliminate illiteracy, poverty, load shedding and terrorism from the
country.
The minister said from last seventeen years Pakistan had
gained a prominent position in Islamic countries as it was the only
nuclear power Islamic country.
Later, the Special Children performed on national anthem and
national songs in Dactylogi along with other children who had come from
different intuitions.
In a "View from The Top Talk", addressing students at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, CEO of Social Capital and Ex Facebook Vice President of User Growth Chamath Palihapitiya painted a scary picture of the social network and its consequences on human behavior. Facebook, according to Palihapitiya is built on psychology that creates a feedback loop of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with reward-motivated behavior. This creates a kind of feeding frenzy for social media reactions, that drive people to indulge in a series of tasks in the pursuit of Likes on Facebook, and having only short term, empty achievements to show at the end of it.
"I think we all knew," Palihapitiya said, "in the back of our minds, even though we feigned this whole line of 'there probably aren't any really bad unintended consequences,' I think in the deep, deep recesses of our minds, we kind of knew something bad could happen. But I think the way we defined it was not like this. It literally is a point now, where I think we have created tools now that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works. That is truly where we are."
Palihapitiya went on to add, "If you feed the beast, that beast will destroy you. If you push back on it, you have a chance to control and reign it in. And it is a point in time where people need to hard break from some of these tools, and the things that you rely on. The short term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created, are destroying how society works. No civil discourse, no cooperation, misinformation, mistruth, and its not an American problem, it's not about Russian ads, this is a global problem. So, we are in a really bad state of affairs right now, in my opinion. It is eroding the core foundations of how people behave, by and between each other. And I don't have a good solution. My solution is that I just don't use these tools anymore. I haven't for years."
According to a report in The Verge, Palihapitiya's comments are the latest in a series of similar observations made by other people associated with Facebook, including Sean Parker, an early investor, and Antonio Garcia-Martinez, a former project manager at Facebook. Palihapitiya joined Facebook in 2007 and went on to become the CEO of Social Capital, a VC firm founded by them in 2011, according to Quartz.
Palihapitaya expressed guilt at playing a part in developing the tools that allowed Facebook to exploit human behavior and advocated for a more responsible process of funding startups, where capital was allocated to businesses that used technological interventions to improve human life. They noted that consumer internet businesses are built around exploiting psychology, and that an approach of rapidly prototyping different approaches to see what works and what does not is something that has proven to work for social media platforms including Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat.
Recent tests from Facebook include additional filtering options in the News Feed based on the type of content, a Resume feature borrowed from LinkedIn, subscriptions for news publications, comments with coloured backgrounds, autoplaying videos with the sound on, a Snooze feature to temporarily hide certain people or pages from your timeline and a Collections feature to organise liked posts in the News Feed. WhatsApp is piloting WhatsApp for Business as well as group voice calls. Instagram is evaluating a stop-motion tool for its stories feature and a standalone messaging service spun out of Instagram called Direct.
This approach of trying a bunch of different features to see what sticks, and what does not works for social networks, are a requirement for exploiting the fickle human psychology. However, a more consistent method is required for tackling hard problems, or addressing the most basic human needs. The approach does not work for tackling problems such as diabetes, delivering of precision medication to treat cancer, or educating significant portions of the world's population. Palihapitaya expressed support for new ventures that try to tackle the problems of climate change and shortage of critical resources such as food, water and energy, which is the kind of work they are currently doing as CEO of Social Capital.
The entire talk is embedded below and is worth a watch. Scrub to 21:20 for the bit where Palihapitaya slams Facebook.
Thirty-nine Indians kidnapped by the Islamic State in Mosul three years ago have died, Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj said in Parliament on Tuesday.
"Deep penetration radar confirmed that all Indians were dead after all bodies were exhumed," Swaraj said, adding that the mortal remains of the persons were sent to Baghdad. "For verification of the bodies, DNA samples of their relatives were sent there. Four state government — Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, West Bengal and Bihar were involved in the process," they said.
Yesterday we got information that DNA samples of 38 people have matched and DNA of the 39th person has matched 70 per cent: EAM Sushma Swaraj in #RajyaSabha on 39 Indians kidnapped in Iraq's Mosul pic.twitter.com/almEfDANlz — ANI (@ANI) March 20, 2018
General VK Singh will travel to Iraq to bring back the mortal remains of the Indians killed, the foreign minister said. "The plane carrying mortal remains will first go to Amritsar, then to Patna and then to Kolkata."
The search for the missing persons carried on for most of 2017, with the external affairs ministry claiming no knowledge of their location.
In July 2017, after ruckus in the Lok Sabha over the issue of the 39 Indians missing in Mosul, Swaraj said that there is no evidence to substantiate the claim that they have died. "And declaring anyone dead without proof is a sin that I won't commit," they had said.
Earlier, the Punjab Congress had accused the external affairs minister of "misleading" the country on the fate of missing Indians abducted in Iraq, and asked them to provide "credible information" on the issue.
The group of Indian labourers, mostly from Punjab, was taken hostage by the Islamic State when it overran Iraq's second largest city, Mosul, in 2014. The workers were reportedly trying to leave Mosul when they were intercepted.

Sweet news for chocoholics, Nutella have announced the launch of a new chocolate, biscuit snack bar set to launch in stores this September.
Nutella's B-ready bar, which has all the delicious flavours of the popular hazelnut spread, will cost just 56p, and a £1.99 for a pack of six.
Created by Italian chocolate giants Pietro Ferrero, it's been described as Nutella topped with puffed wheat crispies, sealed in a crispy wafer shell.
And if it's market test is anything to go by it's set to be another top selling product for the Ferrero group.
Contains fewer than 120 calories
Levi Boorer, customer development director at Ferrero told talkingretail.com, “Nutella B-ready is a complementary addition to the Ferrero range, offering shoppers more ‘sweet snacking' solutions throughout the day.
“We see B-ready as the ideal mid-morning snack, containing fewer than 120 calories, while other products – like Kinder Bueno – are much more suited to post lunch snacking.
“Our initial UK trial has proved incredibly successful. We ranged at the till in a selection of convenience stores and Nutella B-ready ranked as the fourth best performing sweet snacking line during the period.
“We also found that merchandising the single serve product separately to the multi-pack drove incremental sales. We would recommend that the single serve features alongside popular confectionery lines like Kinder Bueno and the multipack format within the biscuits aisle.”
As part of Independence Day celebrations on July 6 this Friday, Moyale Barracks Football Club will be hosting TNM Super League defending champions in a friendly which Moyale Coach Charles Kamanga says is important for both sides.
Kamanga said that it was an honour to be part of these Independence Day celebrations and looks forward to a good game against the nomads on Friday.
“It feels good to play against Be Forward Wanderers before the head of state and many Malawians. As Moyale Barracks, we are preparing very well for this game and we are not taking it lightly. We would like to entertain soccer fans with beautiful football and eventually win the game,” explained Kamanga.
They added that the game is a good strength testing match before the two sides can meet in the country's top flight league.
The Nomads are on position four on the log table with 18 points from ten games while the soldiers are on position ten with 14 points from twelve games.
Silver Strikers, who have so far played 11 games, are at the top with 26 points followed by Nyasa Big Bullets and Civil Sporting Club with 22 points and 19 points, respectively.
MIAMI (AP)  Two Cuban baseball players told a federal jury Tuesday that they paid tens of thousands of dollars from signing bonuses with Major League Baseball teams to a smuggling network that prosecutors say was overseen by a Florida sports agent and their trainer associate.
The players, Jorge Padron and Reinier Roibal, described how they were spirited off the communist-run island on speedboats bound for Cancun, Mexico, where they trained while awaiting documents necessary to go to the U.S. to sign lucrative free-agent contracts.
They told jurors about payments the smugglers made to a Mexican criminal organization, which prosecutors have identified as the Zetas drug cartel, and the violent disappearance of one of the smuggling ring's leaders, Joan (YO-ahn) "Nacho" Garcia. The testimony came in the trial of agent Bartolo Hernandez and trainer Julio Estrada, who face lengthy prison sentences if convicted of conspiracy and alien- smuggling charges.
Roibal is a pitcher who signed with the San Francisco Giants for $425,000 in 2010 but is now with the Los Angeles Dodgers. They said Garcia met them in Cancun in late 2009 and took them to meet with Hernandez. In Cuba, they were making about $20 a month playing baseball.

"He was going to help me obtain that opportunity I was looking for," Roibal, speaking through an interpreter, said of the man they knew as "Nacho." Asked what that opportunity was, they added: "Well, play baseball and give my family a better financial situation."
Roibal said they paid about $170,000 to the smuggling operation, including 5 percent for Hernandez, out of their Giants contract. They said they were surprised the organization, which operated out of the Baseball Stars academy in Mexico, would get such a big cut.
"I didn't have any idea what was happening," they testified. "I was also very young and I really didn't realize it was such a large amount of money."
Roibal also said they were present, sitting in the front seat of a car, when unknown men approached "Nacho" at a boatyard in Cancun.
"Did you see these men assault Nacho?" asked Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael "Pat" Sullivan.
"After hearing the gunshots ... I turned around and could see what was happening," Roibal said, without elaborating.
Padron, who was also brought to Mexico by boat from Cuba, said they signed with the Boston Red Sox for $350,000 in March 2010. Of that, they said about $140,000 went to the smuggling operation, including percentages for Hernandez and Estrada. Padron, an outfielder and first baseman, never made it out of the minor leagues and was later released by the Red Sox.
Much of the players' testimony focused on third-country residency documents they needed in order to sign with an American baseball team, which prosecutors say contained numerous falsehoods. They had to show they no longer lived in Cuba  where they were restricted by the U.S. economic embargo  and that they were eligible to sign as free agents rather than going into the MLB draft for less money.
On Mexican residency papers, for example, Padron's occupation was listed as "independent tinsmith," a job they testified in the trial that they never held. For Roibal, it was "independent welder."
Padron said the Cuban players frequently laughed about the jobs that appeared on papers bearing their names.
"It was like a joke among us," Padron said.
"Did you have any job at all while you were in Cancun?" Sullivan asked.
"No," Padron replied.
Roibal said they were simply handed various papers, many of them in English only, and asked for their signature.
"They told me to sign, and I would sign," they said.
Lawyers for Hernandez and Estrada earlier told jurors they both ran legitimate baseball businesses and were not engaged in Cuban player smuggling or falsifying of official documents. It's unclear if either will testify.
Several other Cuban-born players are expected to take the witness stand, possibly including Jose Abreu of the Chicago White Sox, Adeiny Hechevarria of the Miami Marlins and Yoenis Cespedes of the New York Mets. The trial is scheduled to last several more weeks.

Rogue One was victorious for a third straight weekend at the box office. According to Variety, the Star Wars spinoff pulled in $50 million for the three-day period and a projected $64 million for the four-day holiday. That pushes the movie over the $400 million mark, and makes it the second-highest grossing domestic release of 2016 netting $425 million thus far. Currently, Finding Dory has the record for 2016 with a domestic gross of $486 million. However, with January being a slow month and Rogue One proving to be immensely popular, there's a possibility that the new Star Wars movie could end up as 2016's biggest movie.
Meanwhile, Illumination Entertainment had another good weekend as Sing, a film that seems designed to print money, made $41.4 million during its second weekend in theaters. The film is projected to earn $53.7 million for the four-day holiday weekend and has made $177.3 million stateside. It will be interesting to see how close Sing can get to Illumination's other big hit of 2016, The Secret Life of Pets, which is currently the fourth-highest grossing film of the year with $368 million domestic.
Passenger continues to struggle at the box office. The film came in third, but only earned $16.1 million over the three-day weekend and $20.7 million over the four day. That brings its total to $61.4 million, but when you consider the $110 million budget plus the cost of advertising, the sci-fi romance is going to bank its hopes on the international audience turning out.
Assassin's Creed also isn't doing too hot. The $125 million video game adaptation took in $8 million for the weekend and a projected $10 million for the holiday. The film has only earned $41 million since opening on December 21st, so don't expect this to be the start of a film franchise.
However, indies found a lot of success over the holiday weekend. Awards buzz is powering La La Land to big success at the box office. The film earned “$9.5 million over the weekend and is projected to make $12.3 million over the four-day holiday, which would bring its gross to an estimated $37 million,” which puts it past Hell or High Water as the highest-grossing limited release of 2016.
Hidden Figures also did well in limited release. The Oscar-hopeful earned $815,000 for the three days and $1.1 million for the four days from just 25 theaters. Other limited releases, Paterson and 20th Century Women, made $70,760 and $112,705, respectively. And Denzel Washington's Fences made “$10.2 million over the three-day weekend and an estimated $13 million for the holiday. It has made $32.7 million since debuting three weeks ago in limited release.”
It wasn't all good for indies. Ben Affleck‘s Live by Night looks like a major flop. The film earned $32,000 from four locations for only a $7,995 per-screen average. With a disappointing total like that, the film's Oscar chances are pretty much shot.
MEXICO CITY, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Mexican miner Grupo Mexico, one of the world's largest copper producers, reported a fourth-quarter net profit of $131 million on Friday.

EDWARDSVILLE — A Cahokia man was charged Monday with two felonies and one misdemeanor for their role in the death of Madison man who died in a hospital after police found them lying unconscious on a road in Madison.
Madison County Sheriff's Capt. T. Mike Dixon, deputy commander of the Major Case Squad of Greater St. Louis, said in a press release Terrance J. Smith, 24, was charged with with one felony charge of reckless homicide, one felony charge of aggravated fleeing and attempting to elude a police officer, and one misdemeanor charge of driving while license revoked. Associate Judge Jennifer Hightower signed and issued the arrest warrant, setting Smith's bond at $200,000.
The Madison Police Department responded at approximately 5:15 a.m. April 9 to a 911 call of a man lying in the roadway on Big Bend Road, just east of Illinois Route 203. The man was identified as Nicholas L. Roberts, 27, of Madison.
Roberts was unconscious at the time of their discovery and showed obvious signs of head trauma. They were transported to a St. Louis area hospital for treatment. Medical officials pronounced them dead April 12, but they were placed on life support for organ donation purposes. Roberts was taken off life support on the morning of April 14.
The Major Case Squad investigation revealed Roberts was with Smith during the early morning hours of April 9 at a nightclub in Brooklyn. Video surveillance seized by investigators show the two men leaving the club at approximately 4:25 a.m. The investigation revealed the two entered the vehicle Smith was driving after leaving the club, with plans to go home for the night.
Shortly after leaving the club, a Brooklyn police officer stopped the vehicle for traffic-related offenses. The traffic stop took place at approximately 4:27 a.m. on Canal Street, between Eighth and Cornell streets. As the officer exited their vehicle and approached the stopped vehicle, Smith accelerated and fled from the officer at a high rate of speed, east on Canal Street toward Eagle Park Road. The Brooklyn officer re-entered their vehicle and initiated a brief pursuit but terminated the pursuit within approximately 400 yards because of hazardous conditions and safety concerns. The officer's in-car camera shows they terminated the pursuit by turning off their squad car's emergency lights, and doing a u-turn. Smith kept driving east on Eagle Park Road toward Illinois 203 at a high rate of speed after the officer terminated the pursuit. Additional surveillance located by investigators shows that the Brooklyn officer, as well as their backup officers, returned to normal patrols in Brooklyn after ending the pursuit.
The investigation and evidence supports the fact that Roberts exited, or was extracted from, Smith's vehicle shortly after it crossed over Illinois 203 onto Big Bend Road in Madison. The information and evidence collected during the investigation suggests Roberts fell to the road after leaving Smith's vehicle, likely striking their head on the road and causing the trauma that ultimately resulted in their death. The location where Roberts is found lying in the road is approximately a mile and a half from the location that the police pursuit was terminated.
Anyone having additional information related to the death of Nicholas Roberts is asked to contact the Madison Police Department at (618) 876-4300.

Days after Chief Justice of India (CJI) Dipak Misra lashed out at senior lawyers for attempting to browbeat judges during high-profile hearings, senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan on Monday decided to quit court practice citing ''humiliating end to Delhi case''.
Senior Advocate Rajeev Dhavan quits legal practice after "humiliating end to Delhi case". pic.twitter.com/LNEyzdbZWo — Bar & Bench (@barandbench) December 11, 2017
Dhavan, in a letter to the CJI, wrote: "After the humiliating end to the Delhi case, I have decided to give up court practice. You are entitled to take back the Senior gown conferred on me, though I would like to keep it for memory and services rendered."
On Thursday, some recent incidents of senior lawyers trying to outshout each other during high-profile hearings had irked the Supreme Court, which had said shouting will "not be tolerated at any cost".
On Tuesday, several senior lawyers including Kapil Sibal, Rajeev Dhavan and Dushyant Dave had made high-pitched arguments in the Ayodhya case seeking an adjournment of the hearing till July 2019 and some of them had even threatened to walk out.
A five-judge Constitution Bench headed by Misra, which was hearing a legal question on Thursday whether a Parsi woman loses their religious identity after marrying a man of different religion, was upset over the growing incidents of senior lawyers arguing on a high pitch in cases like the Babri Masjid title suit and the Delhi-Centre disputes.
"What happened on Wednesday (in Delhi-Centre case) was atrocious and what happened a day before (in the Ayodhya case) was more atrocious," the bench, which also comprised Justices AK Sikri, AM Khanwilkar, DY Chandrachud and Ashok Bhushan, had said.
In the Delhi-Centre dispute hearing, Dhavan had on Wednesday made some submissions which were not appreciated by the bench.
"Come what may, shouting in the courtroom will not be tolerated at any cost," the CJI observed on Thursday.
"Lawyers are traditionally called ministers of justice. Unfortunately, a small group of lawyers thinks they can raise their voice... argue with authority and conviction. Raising your voice just shows inadequacy and incompetence," the CJI had said, adding that some senior members of the Bar had been indulging in high pitch arguments.
The court said, "When lawyers argue in a manner not in tune with the constitutional language, we will tolerate it but for how long? If the Bar does not regulate itself, we will be compelled to regulate".

PanARMENIAN.Net - Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev on Monday, March 19 once again made territorial claims against Armenia.
Addressing the Azerbaijanis on the beginning of Novruz, Aliyev said a big part of the territory of present-day Armenia “is the historical Azerbaijani land.”
According to him, numerous books, maps confirm the aforesaid, while historical books allegedly reveal that at the beginning of the 19th century, the absolute majority of the Yerevan Khanate's population, 80% in particular, were Azerbaijanis.
Aliyev had on February 8 delivered threats against Armenia, claiming that "Yerevan Khanate and Zangezur are Azerbaijan's historic lands."
Kazakhstan-Russia on Wednesday launched an unmanned Progress cargo ship carrying supplies to the International Space Station (ISS) from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.
“The Soyuz-2.1A booster rocket with the Progress MS-06 cargo ship launched successfully from Baikonur cosmodrome at 12:20 Moscow time (0920 GMT),” Russian space agency Roscosmos said in a statement on its website. The cargo ship, carrying more than two tonnes of essential supplies including fuel, air and equipment and parcels for astronauts, is due to dock with the ISS on Friday at 1142 GMT. The last successful launch of a Progress ship was in February, coming after a similar craft crashed back to Earth in December last year.
A commission appointed to investigate the malfunction concluded in January that it was caused by the break-up of the Soyuz third-stage rocket engine, either due to “foreign materials” getting inside or an “assembly fault”.

MONTEVIDEO-Lionel Messi and Argentina's hopes of reaching the 2018 World Cup were left hanging in the balance on Thursday after another stalemate on a nail-biting day of South American qualifying action.
Argentina were held to a 0-0 draw in Buenos Aires by Peru, leaving the two-time world champions outside the automatic qualification places as they head into the final round of fixtures next Tuesday.
It was another desperately disappointing display by Argentina, who once again struggled to turn a wealth of possession into goals. Barcelona star Messi hit the post in the second half but could only watch in frustration after serving up a stream of chances for team-mates who failed to convert.
The result left Argentina in sixth place in the standings. The first four teams qualify automatically, with the fifth-placed team advancing to a playoff against New Zealand in November. But with only two points separating third-placed Chile and seventh-placed Paraguay, the final standings could change dramatically depending on results on Tuesday. The margin for error for Argentina, however, has narrowed after their latest setback, their third consecutive draw of a faltering qualification campaign.
Argentina's final qualifier is a challenging away trip to Ecuador in the thin air of Quito. Argentina has a poor record in the Ecuadoran capital, losing two out of three of their last World Cup qualifiers there and drawing the other. The Argentines' last World Cup qualifying win in Quito came in 2001.
However a victory on Tuesday would guarantee Argentina at least fifth place in the standings, with Peru and Colombia guaranteed to drop points against each other in their final game.
URUGUAY ON BRINK, COLOMBIA CRASH: Brazil, who have already qualified in first place, were held to a 0-0 draw by eliminated Bolivia in La Paz earlier Thursday. That left the focus on the teams jostling behind the five time champions for the three remaining automatic spots. Uruguay, who are second with 28 points from 17 games, missed the chance to book their place in Russia after being frustrated 0-0 away at Venezuela. Uruguay's Paris Saint-Germain striker Edinson Cavani squandered a golden chance to win the game but shot wide in the 83rd minute. The Uruguayans are all but assured of qualification however, needing only a draw or a win against lowly Bolivia in Montevideo next week to book their place.
South American champions Chile, meanwhile, resurrected their qualification hopes with a thrilling 2-1 win over Ecuador in Santiago. Striker Eduardo Vargas drilled in a low shot on 22 minutes to put the 2015 & 2016 Copa America champions 1-0 up.
But Alex Ibarra equalised in the 82nd minute for Ecuador to silence the home crowd. But with Chile's fans still struggling to digest Ibarra's strike, the hosts went back up the other end and Arsenal star rammed home a close-range finish after Arturo Vidal's shot was only partially saved.
The win saw Chile climb from sixth to third in the standings. Chile will qualify automatically if they are able to beat Brazil in their final game next week. In Barranquilla, Colombia threw away what looked to be a certain victory that would have put them within touching distance of qualification as they crashed to a 2-1 defeat to Paraguay.
Radamel Falcao scored with a deft lob to put Colombia 1-0 ahead in the 79th minute. But the Colombians inexplicably continued to press forward and were twice caught on the break by Paraguay.
Oscar Cardozo bundled in the equaliser for Paraguay in the 89th minute and then Tony Sanabria punished poor goalkeeping by David Ospina to poke in a second in injury time to clinch the win.

Disney's proposed acquisition of Fox, and Comcast's counter-bid, isn't the only corporate drama on James Murdoch's mind these days. The 21st Century Fox CEO also has to worry about their seat on the board of electric carmaker Tesla, with multiple proxy adviser groups pushing against their re-election.
Murdoch has been on Tesla's board since July of last year, and is up for reelection at the company's shareholder meeting next Tuesday. Resistance against their re-election started to build when CtW Investment Group, a proxy advisory group that works with union-affiliated pension funds, told investors to vote against the reelection of Murdoch and two other Tesla board members.
In its letter to investors released earlier this month, CtW argued that Murdoch didn't have any manufacturing experience, and also noted past News Corp. scandals like the 2011 News of the World phone hacking scandal, and the more recent fallout over sexual harassment at Fox News.
It's worth noting that CtW often acts as an activist investor group, frequently pushing for board and policy changes at companies like Amazon, Equifax, and Bank of America. In most cases, these efforts are ignored by the majority of shareholders of those companies.

However, in this case, CtW isn't alone with its recommendation to vote out Murdoch. Investment advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services also came out against having Murdoch on Tesla's board this month, telling investors that the chief Fox exec was too busy with their own company, and already “overboarded” with too many seats on other companies' boards, according to a recent Reuters report. Also pushing against Murdoch's reelection is proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis.
For its part, Tesla is backing the reelection of Murdoch. The company told stockholders in a proxy filing last month that their executive and board experience as well as their “extensive knowledge of international markets and strategies, and experience with the adoption of new technologies” made them a great candidate.
Murdoch was briefly quizzed about Tesla during their appearance at Recode's Code conference in Southern California this week, where an attendee wanted to know their thoughts about Tesla CEO Elon Musk's recent anti-media outbursts, which were prompted by critical stories about the company's labor practices as well as autopilot-related accidents.
Without specifically commenting on any of those subjects, Murdoch argued that media isn't perfect, and that it was ultimately Musk's call how to respond to critical coverage.
Karachi - Sindh Assembly on Monday passed a censure motion against Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf lawmaker Khurram Sher Zaman for calling the provincial assembly as ‘do number' in their media talk outside provincial assembly on Friday.
The motion was tabled by Senior Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Nisar Ahmed Khuhro and was adopted unanimously by the House.
Speaker Sindh Assembly Agha Siraj Durrani asked the PTI lawmaker to either tender apology on their statement or otherwise a censure motion will be brought against him.
Khurram said that the would tender the apology but first of all the Sindh government should apologize from the House over its failure to deliver to masses and looting public money.
The speaker refused to listen to the PTI member and asked them that they could either tender apology or otherwise a censure motion would be brought against him.
Later, the minister for parliamentary affairs presented the censure motion, which condemned the PTI lawmaker for using derogatory remarks against the provincial assembly and was adopted by the House unanimously.
The assembly's session on Monday started around 40 minutes late, with Speaker Sindh Assembly Agha Siraj Durrani in the chair.
After the censure motion, Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) lawmakers also staged a token walkout from the assembly in protest against non-issuance of official results of union council elections in Sukkur. The MQM lawmakers expressed the apprehension that attempts were being made to tamper with the initial results according to which their candidate had been declared winner.
Meanwhile after the call attention notices, the House initiated debate on budget execution report 1st and 2nd quarter, 2016-17. Speaking on it, MQM lawmaker Naheed Begum mentioned several provincial government departments to which the amounts had been released by the finance department, but no expenditure was incurred.
“Information department is one of the important government departments, but funds to the majority of the ongoing information department schemes were released funds but have been not utilised as yet,” they said, and added that similar condition existed in women development departments where expenditure on schemes were yet to begin. They said that there was no role of the members of the provincial assembly in the budget as neither their schemes were approved nor were they given their due funds for the development of their areas. “The education department is in tatters as it looks that the government lacks the vision for this important sector,” they said, adding that no effort had been made to improve the syllabus and curriculum.
MQM member Sabir Husasain Qaim Khani said it seemed the government wanted to tread the same old path, and if the government did not have the capacity to spend on improving education standards, human development and provision of safe drinking water, then all of these projects are in vain.
“There is no change in the attitude of the rulers for the past nine years and instead sufferings of the people have increased due to their presence,” they argued. Qaimkhani expressed surprise that how could the rulers talk on budget when there was no agriculture policy in the province, and milk was more expensive than petrol, which is imported from abroad.
“Education is the only way to fight terrorism in the country, but there seems to be no policy in this regard as out of 47 percent funds released for the education department, only 15 percent are spent,” they lamented. They said that the provincial government raised hue and cry over the unjust energy policies of the federal government, but on the other hand the provincial government itself had not spent a single penny on energy.
They further said that the provincial government had turned the province into a pile of garbage and is neither giving powers to the elected representatives of local government nor spending funds from the provincial budget.
Another MQM lawmaker Saleem Bandhani lashed out the provincial government for not giving to the residents of Sukkur due share from the budget despite the fact they had voted for the PPP.
“Opposition leader in National Assembly, MPAs, and a PPP Senator belong to Sukkur, but unfortunately people of the Sukkur have no share in the budget as they had once voted for MQM,” they said.
They said that the assembly had passed resolutions for a university, Sukkur Development Authority and an engineering college in Sukkur, but unfortunately none of them had seen light of the day.
“We are talking about entire budget but the situation in the province is so worse that the government even could not point out a model union council or a school in the province,” they added.
They said that they had the same privilege as that of other lawmakers, but the government had nothing to spend in the constituencies of opposition parties. Another MQM lawmaker Dewan Chand Chawla said that PPP called for empowering minorities, but all of these announcements were in the air and they had not spent single money in the last six months. “The government spending has no effect on improvement of life of the common man of the province and they even did not carry out development in the district where Benazir Bhutto is buried,” they said.
Meanwhile, MQM MPA Kamran Akhter in their call attention notice asked the provincial minister for law Zia ul Hassan Lanjhar regarding the fees paid to the legal advisors or advocates hired by the provincial government. Responding to it, the minister informed that they had given Rs 231.2 million to the private lawyers hired to fight provincial government cases from 2013-2017. They informed that these lawyers include Farooq H Naek, Anwar Mansoor, Agha Faisal,
Hafeez Pirzada and others. “The services of these lawyers were hired in order to represent the provincial government in important cases,' they said adding that the provincial government was also committed to improve the capacity of its own team of prosecutors and lawyers.
Responding to a call attention from Muhammad Qamar Abbas Rizvi regarding lack of basic facilities at a Government Boys Irfan Secondary School Soldier Bazar No 2, the Minister for Health said that they had given amount to WAPDA and K-Electric for ensuring electricity at schools but unfortunately they did not provide it.

New York (TADIAS) — The talented Kiriku Brothers from Ethiopia were featured on NBC's hit series “Little Big Shots” on Sunday, March 18th, with host Steve Harvey declaring: “This is the greatest act I've ever seen on Little Big Shots!”
Little Big Shots is an American variety television show that highlights children demonstrating talents and participating in conversation with Harvey.
“Steve Harvey couldn't believe what was happening on the Little Big Shots stage when Ethiopian duo, The Kiriku Brothers, brought their high-flying act to the show,” Yahoo News enthused. “The kids, apparently, met at circus camp, as kids do, and practice their routine for four hours every day. Which is necessary if you're going to be pulling off the crazy stunts these kids were performing.”
The culture editor of the 2Paragraphs website added: “One of the most memorable and unique performances on Season 3 of Little Big Shots is delivered by the Kiriku Brothers. The foot juggling Kiriku Brothers have all kinds of tricks, including where one of the older ones uses their bare feet to juggle a younger brother with nothing else but their feet. (Note: the Kiriku Brothers aren't all related.) The Kiriku Brothers troupe hails from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. This isn't the Kiriku Brothers first time on television. Two of the brothers were just on Spain's Got Talent in February. Spanish singer/actor and Spain's Got Talent judge Edurne Garcia hit their Golden Buzzer for the Kiriku Brothers.”

Hyderabad: CPM politburo member Brinda Karat on Monday said a nationwide ban on alcohol will lead to illegal trade, even as they supported a regulated policy with people's participation to curb the abuse.
Bihar chief minister and JD(U) president Nitish Kumar on Sunday pitched for a nationwide ban on alcohol and asked party activists to raise awareness among people about the ill-effects of liquor consumption.
Karat said that the ban and total prohibition lead to illegal trade while free supply of liquor causes "social havoc". "So, a more regulated policy with people's participation is what we support," they told PTI, when asked about their party's view on Kumar's statement.
Karat said their party believes that the present liquor policies of most state governments actually promote its consumption as a revenue spinner. "We fight against such policies and support and build social movements against alcohol abuse," they added.
Kumar had on Sunday hit out at the Congress and Left parties, asking why they could not support a ban on liquor and campaign against its consumption. "When Gujarat could implement liquor ban, Bihar could show that it could also be banned in the state, why it cannot be banned in the entire country?" they had said while addressing a party event in New Delhi.
Stressing that all religions, including Hinduism, Islam, Sikhism, Buddhism and Jainism, criticise liquor consumption, they had said a ban in the entire country would be the biggest sign of communal harmony and respect to all the religions.
Pupils at Brackenfield School in Harrogate were treated to a fascinating presentation on The Battle of Towton
Share Share +1 Stumble Shares 0
Pupils at Brackenfield School in Harrogate were treated to a fascinating presentation on The Battle of Towton by three generations of the Atkin family, Howard Atkin, their son Robert Atkin and their son, Jacob who is a pupil at the school.
The children enjoyed a superb display of drumming, weaponry and armour during the presentation. They learnt about how important battle was in The War of the Roses and how the battle ultimately led to King Edward IV coming to the throne.
The Battle of Towton on 29th March 1461 was possibly the largest and bloodiest battle ever fought on English soil. The two huge armies, estimated at 65,000 men, confronted each other in the middle of a snowstorm on an open field between the villages of Towton and Saxton, near Tadcaster on Palm Sunday.
Although the Lancastrian King Henry VI had transferred the right of succession to the English throne to Richard, Duke of York, their wife Queen Margaret was not prepared to accept this without a fight. After Richard was killed, their son, the 18 year-old Yorkist Edward, led their followers to depose Henry through force.
The fierce fighting continued through the day but eventually the fleeing Lancastrians were cut down from behind as they fled the battlefield. Towton proved to be a decisive victory for the Yorkists although it took a further 25 years for this political clash to end.
Headteacher, Mrs. Sowa was delighted that the Atkin family were able to teach the children about this key battle: It was fascinating to hear about this important battle which is right on our doorstep. To have three generations of Brackenfield family present this to the school was a really unique way of teaching the children about the battle. I would like to thank them for their enthusiasm and their time.

MITCHELL, Man. — A couple in Mitchell, Manitoba is working to safely restore electricity in their home after it was struck by lightning on Good Friday.
Doug and Brucette Waterston were sound asleep Friday morning when a bolt of lightning struck a TV tower on top of the house.
“It felt like an airplane just landed on the roof,” Brucette said.

After smelling smoke, Brucette said they got out of bed to see what was going on. When they opened the door to the spare room next to their bedroom, they couldn't believe what they saw.
“It looked like an explosion went off.”
The electrical surge made its way from the tower down some electric wiring, and through the garage attached to the home.

A wireless internet router, and a number of outlets were destroyed. The strike also left a large black line on a wall inside the house.

“I never thought this would ever happen to me,” Waterston said.
Fire officials said smoke filled the spare room when crews arrived, but no fire broke out.
Waterston said there is no estimate on how much fixing the damage will cost.
They said she's just thankful no one was hurt.
The first time Kendrick Lamar appeared at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, in 2012, they were months away from releasing their major-label debut, “good kid, m.A.A.d city.”
Nobody was yet calling them the most important rapper alive, as he's regularly described these days, but their impressive early work had lifted them to an enviable spot: They played an afternoon solo set on the prestigious festival's main stage, then dropped in with two of their benefactors, Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg, during their cameo-packed headlining gig.
Five years later, Lamar was the one bringing out guests — Future, Travis Scott and Schoolboy Q — when they closed Coachella's first weekend on Sunday night. And this time the young Compton native wasn't leading up to an album but was celebrating the release of one in “Damn,” which after weeks of feverish anticipation came out Friday and instantly dominated sales and streaming charts on iTunes and Spotify.
But if Lamar's star turn in Indio cemented their status as hip-hop royalty, their performance also demonstrated how uniquely they wear that crown. More than a symbol of accumulated power (like Dr. Dre) or an embodiment of untouchable cool (à la Future), Lamar presents themselves as an ordinary guy whose extraordinary talent has left them no choice but to be great.
“House on the hill/ House on the beach,” they rap in “The Heart Part 4,” a fierce yet proudly relatable boast track they released last month, shortly before “Damn” appeared. “A condo in Compton/ I'm still in reach.”
Standing in the crowd at Coachella during Lamar's show (in which they combined tunes from “good kid” and 2015's “To Pimp a Butterfly” with material from “Damn” that they were performing for the first time), you didn't sense a kind of collective awe so much as you felt a connection between the MC and their audience. It was as though the success he's attained — with densely worded songs about black pride and social injustice and the determination to look past temptation — was something to share.
One way they gave that impression was to make themselves look small.
Now more than ever, given this year's expansion that boosted the festival's footprint and capacity, Coachella encourages the supersize gesture, be it the full-on orchestra that film composer Hans Zimmer brought with them or the glowing box in which Lorde had a crew of dancers acting out their descriptions of twentysomething anxiety.
Yet Lamar, who's not a tall man, spent most of their set roaming across a gigantic stage swept clear of distractions (including a live band, which may or may not have been accompanying them behind a video screen). The effect, even in songs declaring how unmatchable their skills are, was to keep the legend in check.
At several points, Lamar was joined by a handful of dancers: men wearing masks and hoodies during “m.A.A.d city,” about gang violence that leads to “bodies on top of bodies,” and a woman in a flowing white garment for “XXX,” a new song from “Damn” with dark thoughts of the American war machine. They also showed a short film, designed to look like an old kung fu movie, in which they portray a fighter called the Black Turtle.
And then there were those cameos, beginning with Scott, who joined Lamar to perform their recent duet, “Goosebumps.” But for the other surprise appearances, Lamar actually gave the stage over to their guests: Future did their hit “Mask Off,” while Schoolboy Q (a fellow member of Lamar's Top Dawg crew) ran through “That Part.”
The display suggested that what Lamar wants, more than individual glory, is to be seen in context — an idea they communicated further with an exuberant rendition of their 2015 anthem “Alright,” which developed an association with the Black Lives Matter movement.
Not that he's immune to exceptionalism. A vivid throughline on “Damn” is Lamar's sense of being under attack, their stardom having made them a specific target for the media — early on the album they sample a bit of critical punditry from Fox News — and even for friends and family, as they observe in the anguished “Feel.”
“Ain't nobody prayin' for me,” they mutter in a line that played multiple times between songs over the speakers at Coachella.
There's more of that in “Humble,” the album's hard-knocking lead single, in which he's battling the various competitors looking to dethrone him.
Yet when Lamar performed the track on Sunday — their fans rapping along with every recently released word — it didn't sound like a weapon; it bounced like the world's most inviting party song.
After “Humble,” Lamar disappeared for a few minutes, leaving the audience unsure if he'd return for an encore. They did come back, though, for one final message: “Love,” a deeply tender number from “Damn” in which they sketch the daily reality of a committed relationship in terms any Southern Californian could recognize.
“Told you that I'm on the way,” the song goes, “I'm like an exit away.”
It was a beautifully understated moment precisely when many would have reached for grandeur.

Lewisburg City Recorder Shannon Beatty was stunned to see their childhood church demolished on Tuesday.
Caldwell Pentecostal Holiness Church, located on Howards Creek in Caldwell, bore extensive damage in the June flooding and could not be salvaged. Church services have moved nearby to the former Presbyterian church, and now the brick church has been demolished.
Beatty took several pictures of the flood-damaged church last June – the waterline is evident above the doorway in one photograph – and the tear-down, posting them on Facebook. With the photos, they added the caption: “Stunned and saddened to hear the Church in Caldwell had to be demolished. Another heartbreaking loss for my cherished childhood neighborhood … My heart goes out to all the families including my father who still lives in Caldwell.”
Beatty's father's home, also located on Howards Creek, was severely damaged in the flooding, but they were able to remain in their house.
Many other families, and the Pentecostal Holiness Churchgoers in Caldwell, were not so lucky.
Sports Minister, Justina Charles, has reported that about $6-million is needed to repair the Windsor Park Sports Stadium due to damages caused by Hurricane Maria.
At a press conference on Monday morning, Charles described the stadium as Dominica's “greatest accomplishment” in sports.
“Thanks to the People's Republic of China for giving us this wonderful gift and we know it was severely affected and we know the effect of the stadium being affected on our economy and sports by extension,” they stated.
The Minister said most of the facility's roof and the perimeter walls were affected. They noted that two towers fell and the electrical cabinet that controls the towers were damaged.
Additionally, a $3-million scoreboard which was recently installed was damaged.
“And so we now have to look to see how we can repair some of those things,” Charles noted.
At this time, they said, an assessment has been done on the damages.
“I must say we have received an assessment of the extent of damage and the cost to repair it and you won't believe it is in excess of $6-million to restore everything at the stadium, the VIP booths, the towers, our perimeter fence and everything that was affected by the storm to do it in a more climate resilient manner,” Charles said. “So we definitely have to look at our way forward in terms of the stadium.”
They vowed to have the roof repaired by the first quarter of 2018.
The Windsor Park Sports Stadium was officially open on October 24, 2007, and the $33-million facility was viewed as a gift from the People's Republic of China.
The title A24 might be a little cryptic, I know. If you're wondering what it is, let me tell you. A24 is a distribution company that buys and releases films. What does that mean and why should I care? First off, that means, A24 either screens the film and purchases it from the filmmaker/production company directly or A24 finances the production from the beginning and the finished product is theirs to release in theaters/DVD. Sundance Film Festival used to be huge for independent filmmakers, they would set up private screenings for distributors and if the companies wanted the film they would have the opportunity to buy. I'm not sure if Sundance is still as big as it was during the “Blair Witch Project era” but I'm confident there's still lots of wheeling and dealing.
Now, let me tell you why you should care.
It hit me while watching Swiss Army Man the other night. I saw the “A24” logo and thought, “damn this company puts out some hits.” That thought's not always a reflection of their box office charts, but if you're looking for a solid movie to watch, A24's library doesn't disappoint.
Let me tell some of the films I've watched from their catalog and I'll give you the grade I've given to each one.
The VVitch – A
This is one of the best scary movies I've ever seen. I'm not talking about a horror film. The VVitch doesn't have gore, violence or anything else you'd typically associate with a scary movie. This film is authentically terrifying. What you see in this film is apart of American history. This stuff happened. Whether it's fact, fiction, lore or a little of everything. People during this time (17th Century) believed in witch craft and it was a community shattering affliction that plagued multiple settlements across New England. Check this one out.
The VVitch premiered at Sundance Film Festive on January 27, 2015 and was widely released by A24 in February 2016.
Green Room – B+
A neo-nazi punk show gone wrong. This film delivers. It's about a band of struggling musicians traveling around the USA playing local dive bars, parties, etc. A young group of dreamers just doing what they've got to do to get their music heard. They get offered a gig in Portland and find out it's a nazi punk club. After the show they accidentally see something that can't be unseen and the story begins. This is a thrill ride from the get go. It's has shock, gore, violence and real terror. The Green Room doesn't veer off into dead end storylines or overcomplicate it's premise. It's about getting out alive…period.
The Green Room was screened at Cannes Film Festival in 2015 and released wide by A24 in May of 2015
Room – A
This movie was so good. Brie Larson was amazing. After watching you'll see why they won the Academy Award. I don't think this movie could've been as good with any other female lead playing this role. The story is about Larson who's character was kidnapped and forced to be prisoner inside a small room. Them captor gets them pregnant and they have a son who's young life is spent growing up inside this tiny space. This is a story about escape, survival and love. It's one of the best movies I watched last year.
Also, I've always thought Brie Larson looks like a young Maura Tierney. Anyone else thinks that? Both ladies are exceptionally hot…so, that's good.
Room premiered at Telluride Film Festival in September 2015 and was released wide a month later.
Ex-Machina – B+
If you haven't seen this film yet put it on your list to watch asap. It's about a CEO of a huge programming company that has one of their employees, selected out of hundreds, visit their home and spend time with Ava. Ava is a robot that is more self-aware then anyone expected. The movie is a glimpse into the future. I feel this plot will happen in real life, it's only a matter of time. It's a great story with amazing sfx and the reality of it is completely frightening.
Unknown
Tusk – B-/C+
I can tell you right off the bat, I'm not really a Kevin Smith fan. Mallrats is great, Clerks is cool too but after that everything starts getting a little fuzzy. With that being said, I didn't like Tusk. I actually thought it was kind of clever and fun. The execution wasn't that great but it was good enough. Tusk is about a guy (Justin Long) who runs a podcast and is looking for a cool story to tell to their listeners. They hear about a guy in Canada who has an amazing story of survival and ventures up to meet him. It turns out the guy is insane and drugs the interviewer and gruesomely transforms them into a human walrus.
I think if a different filmmaker made this film it would have been more successful. It could've been a cult hit like Human Centipede. Kevin Smith should just stay retired.
Premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and was released by A24 in September 2014.
Spring Breakers – A
This is another film you need to watch asap, if you haven't seen it already. Spring Breakers is so good. I was actually a bit hesitant before watching because I know some of Harmony Korine's films can be very weird. This however, was not. Spring Breakers is the tale of 4 broke college girls looking to party in Florida during Spring Break. It's a story of good, bad, sex, drugs, violence and friendship. Spring break forever. It's fact and fantasy rolled into one. A tale that is both outrageous and real. You feel for these girls and really do care for them. James Franco is also exceptional in this movie. Eat your heart out Riff Raff.

OSLS The Open Source Leadership Summit began on Tuesday amid roads closed by a landslide: held in The Resort at Squaw Creek near Lake Tahoe, California, it was not easily accessible to attendees traveling Highway 80 from the San Francisco Bay Area.
During their opening keynote, Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation, made light of the mudslides that brought traffic to a crawl near Donner Pass on Monday evening. The trip at least was less arduous than it was last year, they said.
Zemlin's remarks amounted to an open-source victory lap. Some 99.4 per cent of the world's high performance computing systems, 90 per cent of the world's stock exchanges, and 64 per cent of mobile devices run on Linux, they said, adding that the foundation's projects have created $14.5 billion worth of value, as measured in cost per line of code.
The foundation's mission, to create the largest shared technology resource in the world, is accomplished, more or less. Open source has won.
But the road ahead for open source, and for software development in general, looks much like it was for conference attendees: if not closed then littered with obstacles.
Security expert and doomsayer Bruce Schneier – speaking by video owing to RSA Conference commitments in San Francisco and perhaps prescience with regard to seasonal travel challenges – predicted that the government is coming to handcuff coders.
"We all had this special right to code the world as we saw fit," said Schneier. "My guess is we're going to lose that right, because it's too dangerous to give to a bunch of techies."
'What we're going to see is increased government involvement'
Schneier's argument follows from accepting Marc Andreessen's observation in 2011 that software is eating the world. "As everything turns into a computer, computer security becomes everything security," said Schneier.
Schneier likened the internet to a giant robot, one capable of affecting not just the virtual world but the physical world, too. "As our internet affects the world, the threats become much more real," they said.
Software flaws that may once have been capable of crashing applications have the potential to crash cars, planes, medical devices, appliances, and other connected infrastructure. As a result, Schneier contends, the restrictions and regulations that attempt to defend against real world risks will be placed on the tech world.
"What we're going to see is increased government involvement," Schneier said. "Because that's what happens in the world of dangerous things."
The physical threats arising from connected things will spur regulators to act, not to mention actual robots walking down the street, Schneier said. "Nothing motivates the US government like fear," they added, pointing to 9/11 and creation of the Department of Homeland Security.
Schneier said at the RSA Conference they plan to call for the creation of a new US government agency to sort through the issues arising from putting software in everything. It's not good enough to leave these decisions to the Federal Trade Commission, or those regulating cars or medicine, they said.
The choice is between smart and stupid government involvement, Schneier insisted, warning that it would be easy to imagine a liability regime that would kill open source software.
"We're in the process of screwing a lot of this up," said Schneier, who urged technologists to get involved in government and the legislative process in order to shape the debate. "We need to start making more ethical and political decisions about how technology should work." ®

There is no question the Edmonton Oilers are in the midst of playing their best hockey of the season. Unfortunately for them, said run has resulted in them posting a 4-3 record over the last two weeks and not surprisingly, they have made up almost no ground in the Western Conference standings. While they may still have 52 games left on their schedule, the reality of their situation remains unchanged.
The gap between the Oilers and the last place Arizona Coyotes may be widening, now a seven-point bulge with and three games in hand, the likelihood of chasing down a playoff spot remains as unlikely as ever. A quick glance at the standings shows us Edmonton still sitting second from the bottom, seven points out of the final playoff spot and nine points shy of third place in the Pacific Division.
Oilers Remain Well Back in Playoff Race
In other words, despite playing as well as they have, the Oilers are essentially in the same spot they were fourteen days ago and though some would suggest their improved play is a great sign, reality tells us nothing could be further from the truth. Like it or not folks but the task this group has staring them in the face is as daunting as ever and they could have little to no say in how it ultimately plays out.
As impressive as Connor McDavid and company looked in running the Auston Matthews-less Toronto Maple Leafs show on Sunday night, the fact of the matter is they came away from it empty-handed. Yes, they dominated the Leafs over the final forty minutes for the second time in just over of week but in their current predicament, it matters little in the grand scheme of things.
It's worth every penny to witness Connor McDavid put on a pointless, dominant clinic for one of the NHL's worst clubs and lose. (@lukefoxjukebox)https://t.co/lFrjG3dEXl pic.twitter.com/X45AFCUeCh — Sportsnet (@Sportsnet) December 11, 2017
In fact, when you look at it from a standings standpoint, those two games had the same exact impact as their underwhelming showing against the Philadelphia Flyers earlier in the week. At the end of the day, a regulation loss is a loss and when the season comes to its conclusion, they all end up in the same pile. In order to have any shot of taking a run at the post-season, a game like last night simply cannot happen.
Loser Points a Must for Edmonton
Problem is, over the course of an 82-game schedule, every single team is going to have those nights. Be it the likes of a Curtis McElhinney standing on their head in the opposing teams net or an unlucky break that cost the team points in the standings, hello Kris Russell, it's part of the deal. Just like the two points, the Oilers stole from the Coyotes at the end of last month are part of the equation.
The issue this group now faces is rather obvious. After allowing points to slip through their fingers on multiple occasions over the first thirty games of the season, Edmonton has absolutely no wiggle room. So while last night's loss to the Maple Leafs should be viewed as nothing other than a positive, their current lot in life makes it next to impossible. That is of course if the goal is to still try to make the playoffs.
Though fans and players alike continue to suggest the fact the Oilers have the vast majority of their games against the Pacific Division still on their schedule gives them a reasonable shot at doing exactly that, reality tells us that is not the case. It is true, they are 4-1 against the Pacific this season but unless the plan is to go out and come close to running the table, I just don't see it having the impact some think it will.
Pacific Division Games Are Great But…
Let's not forget, they have yet to play the Anaheim Ducks, Los Angeles Kings or San Jose Sharks and their wins have come against the Coyotes, Calgary Flames (x 2) and Vegas Golden Knights, who were downright awful in their first visit to the Rogers Place. In my mind, expecting the Oilers to go out and win most of those games in regulation, is about as unreasonable an ask as one could put on this group.
Pretty damn disappointed Oilers season ticket holder right here. They aren't consistent, they aren't entertaining & they'll need a miracle to make the playoffs this season let alone win anything. What a tremendous letdown. — Dan Tencer (@dantencer) December 7, 2017
Remember if we go on the 2016-17 playoff cut line in the Western Conference, it will take 94 points to qualify for the playoffs. In order for the Edmonton Oilers to reach that point total, they are going to have to go 32-16-4 and there has been no evidence to suggest posting such a mark is even remotely possible. Is there a chance? Sure but it is about as slim as it gets and that won't change anytime soon.

Connor McDavid: Hockey's Next Great One
Kolkata: A foot injury had almost derailed their U-19 World Cup campaign but pacer Ishan Porel was desperate to contribute in Indian team's success so they chose to play through pain, their coach Bibhash Das revealed on Saturday.
Having ruptured their out-step tissue on their landing leg (left), Porel made a comeback in 12 days from an injury that usually takes three weeks to heal and their 6-2-17-4 skittled Pakistan out for 69 in the semi-final.
In the final on Saturday, Porel (2/30) dismissed both the Australia openers — Jack Edwards (28) and Max Bryant (14) — inside the powerplay before India bundled them out for 216, en route to a commanding eight-wicket win with 67 balls to spare.
"He's not fully recovered, and bowled with pain on their foot. Such a kind of injury would take a minimum three weeks to recover," Das, who had a word with Porel after the injury, told PTI.
"It's not actually an ankle injury. They have a tear on their out step of the left leg. They bowled with a heavily taped leg with insole in their shoe, so that they do not aggravate their injury.
"It's only because of the advanced treatment in New Zealand that they could play in the three knockout matches," added the coach.
Das feels their ward should skip at least the first two matches of the Vijay Hazare domestic one-day tournament to let the injury heal completely.
"I would say they should give up at least a couple of matches in the upcoming Vijay Hazare Trophy. It will help them recover," they said.
Hailing from a family with strong roots in sports, Porel was a former table tennis player before their good height made them a natural choice for a fast bowler.
With a six feet and three inches frame, almost same as India pacer Ishant Sharma, Porel is now struggling to cope with fitness.
"In fact, he's struggling with their height, finding it difficult to cope up the sudden growth in a few years," Das said.
The coach is aware of the tough road ahead and said their ward should aim to be in India's team for the World Cup 2019.
"The biggest challenge for him, and me, is to keep them physically fit so that they could bowl with full strength. We will do our best. Porel should target the World Cup 2019 now," Das said.
Having made their Ranji debut for Bengal this season, Porel has impressed with their pace and bounce.
"He was consistently clocking 138 kmph. Their forte has been speed and bounce. He's not a swing bowler per se, but they have a natural ability to generate off the seam movement and more bounce," said Das.
"Under-19 World Cup is definitely a great exposure. one looks up to the future, from there. Not everyone gets an opportunity to play in the World Cup, even the likes of VVS Laxman, Irfan Pathan did not get a chance.
"But the journey begins now. You have to keep working hard. You cannot stop now. You should know that you won't be 19 again!"
It was a festive atmosphere in their locality in Chandannagar, about 50 kilometres away from Kolkata in Hooghly district as thousands gathered with tricolours and Ishan's posters to celebrate the World Cup win.
"You won't understand unless you come here. Thousands from our locality have gathered here and celebrating the win with drum beats and dancing in India Tricolours. We have sweets for all. This success belongs to all of you," their father Chandranath Porel told PTI.
Senior Porel revealed that their son was disappointed after not being picked by any of the franchises in the Indian Premier League (IPL) auctions but it was Rahul Dravid's advice that worked wonders for him.
"Dravid Sir told them don't worry it happens every year, but a World Cup comes once in a lifetime. So give your best. The mantra has worked wonders for him," they said about Porel who grabbed a four-wicket haul two days after the auctions.
"I'm sure their time will come. The target for them to make the cut for the seniors. We all know it's tough but Ishan will keep putting in the hard yards.
"It's been a fairy-tale comeback for Ishan from their (foot) injury. The way they bowled and single-handedly won the match for India against Pakistan in the semi-final is highly commendable," they concluded before getting busy distributing sweets in their locality.
It's a bet large swaths of gamblers would have made with confidence as this NBA season began. And as last season began. And probably the season before that, too. It's Warriors-Cavaliers in their record fourth straight final — a modern inevitability on the order of death, taxes and multiple burner accounts. So much for the romantic notion that these NBA playoffs would be, um, unpredictable.
The notoriously fragile health of Steph Curry is always a concern. One roll of an ankle, one tweak of a knee, and the NBA final gets a lot more interesting. ( Marcio Jose Sanchez / The Associated Press )
“It may not be as suspenseful as a lot of people want it to be or as drama-filled,” Kevin Durant, the Warriors all-star, was telling reporters in Oakland on Wednesday. “But that's what you've got movies and music for.” In other words: If you're looking for plot twists and surprise endings, odds are you could probably make better use of your screen time than watching the best-of-seven series to decide the NBA champion. To some eyes, it seems awfully obvious what's about to happen beginning Thursday night at Oracle Arena. The Warriors, with their all-star-stacked lineup, are heavy favourites to win their third ring in four years (and their second straight since Durant's free-agent arrival made them a court-tilting superteam). The Cavaliers, meanwhile, are 13-to-2 underdogs to be the surprise winner — the second-biggest long shot in the past 30-some finals, surpassed only by Allen Iverson's Philadelphia 76ers in 2001. So the common-sense, stick-to-the-facts prediction — Warriors in five — cribs from that 2001 series. Those Shaq-Kobe Lakers, like these Warriors, came into that series as the defending champion and undisputed juggernaut. It took a 48-point night by Iverson to secure Philly its only win and avoid the sweep. Surely LeBron James will be good enough for one of those guns-blazing masterpieces.

So yeah, Warriors in five would be the safe selection. Pure logic suggests the Cavaliers can't possible hang here, not with a supporting cast led by a still-possibly concussed Kevin Love and a gaggle of laughably inconsistent misfits. Then again, maybe that's why they're more dangerous than the oddsmakers would have you believe. James, who's been playing under a massive burden of expectation since teenagehood, finds themselves in a rare no-lose moment. They can fail to carry their team to a title and still come out a hero; carrying their barren team to the final has already been widely viewed as one of the great accomplishments of their career. And as for the rest of the Cavaliers — nobody's expecting much. Any significant contribution will be seen as a pleasant surprise. So the pressure, on Cleveland's end, is as insignificant as it gets on such a big stage. The Warriors, for their part, can't say the same. And for all their obvious firepower, they've looked vulnerable in recent days. They trailed by double digits at halftime of both Games 6 and 7 of the Western final. If not for Houston's historic Game 7 brickfest, it'd be easy enough to imagine Golden State currently on vacation. The Warriors can't expect Cleveland's James to wilt like Houston's James (Harden). And as much as Love's availability is a question mark, the status of Warriors forward Andre Iguodala injury is a bigger concern. It was announced Wednesday Iguodala will miss Game 1 with the bone bruise on their left knee that kept them out of the final four games in the Western final. That's significant because Iguodala would likely be Kerr's primary option to guard James, a role the swingman rode to a championship-series MVP in 2015.
And while the Warriors clearly have other options to defend Cleveland's No. 23 — Draymond Green could do it, as could Durant, to name two — neither rings perfect. Green, after all, is at their best when he's emboldened as a roving help defender. Durant, if he's devoting that kind of energy to the defensive end, might not be as lethal with the ball in their hands. If Durant's off, then it's often down to the state of Steph Curry's jump shot, which is directly tied to Curry's notoriously fragile health. One roll of an ankle, one tweak of a knee, and the series gets a lot more interesting. When you think back to how discombobulated the Warriors looked at times against the Rockets — “splintered,” is the word Kerr used to describe their team at its worst moments of the Western final — it's not impossible to imagine James finding a way to keep their team in closer contact with the Warriors than Game 1's 13-point Vegas spread would suggest is possible.

He's done it before, albeit before Durant was in the picture. The Cavaliers were underdogs to the Warriors in 2015, when Love missed the entire series to an injury and Kyrie Irving was lost for the duration after a Game 1 knee tweak. Cleveland's second-leading scorer after James in that series was Timofey Mozgov. Amazingly, James still made it a six-game affair. And Kerr spent part of Wednesday making the case that James is even better now, particularly as a jump shooter. “He's shooting fadeaway threes from 30 feet to close games out,” Kerr told reporters. “The shooting is what has really gotten better in the last few years.” The shooting will need to be dead-eye, the Warriors will need to be splintered to the point of disintegration. But if you're inclined to back historic underdogs, there's something to be said for having the NBA's alpha dog on your side. As the old hounds say, mind you: Don't bet more than you want to win.
Redding police have released the names of six teenagers who were occupants in a car that crashed on Route 107 near Umpawaug Road on Friday, April 14.
The six people “critically and seriously injured” are:
• Ryan Capozziello, 18 of Fairfield
• Allison Loder, 17, of Easton
• Ryan Gombos, 16, of Easton
• Janelle Pompea, 16 of Redding
• Thomas Bull, 18 of Fairfield, and
• Grant Ciccarello, 16 of Redding.
The specific dynamics of the crash (who was driving, where the occupants were seated, etc.) have not been released by police as the accident investigation is ongoing.
Redding Police Chief Doug Fuchs said their investigators are going to look at the accident and attempt to “back up a day,” and understand all of the factors leading up to the crash. They added that such an investigation could take months.
In terms of a narrative, Fuchs says the vehicle, a black Jeep Liberty, was traveling northeast on Route 107 near Umpawaug Road when it left the road and struck a tree. One passenger is known to have been ejected during the crash.
Sometime after the crash, the vehicle caught fire. A group of passersby stopped when they came upon the crash and pulled the remaining occupants out of the vehicle before first responders arrived.
The current medical status of the occupants will not be released by police, except to say that when they were initially transported all involved had “serious and critical” injuries.
The occupants were brought to three different area hospitals after the crash, and some were airlifted to other locations afterwards, Fuchs said.
All three Redding EMS companies, and a Ridgefield EMS company responded to the crash, along with police officers and firefighters.
Emergency officials say a portion of Main Road on Johns Island is closed following an accident involving a garbage truck.
The St. Johns Fire Department says Main Road is closed between Patton Avenue and Humbert Road due to the accident which involves injuries.
The fire department is asking motorists to use alternative routes.
"We expect this to be an extended closure," fire officials said.

Crowds of people swarmed Lonzo Ball and their family wherever they went, the first time Ball had experienced that kind of thing.
That happened in June when Ball visited New York City for the first time. They were there to attend the NBA draft.
This trip to New York isn't about them in the way that one was, but it has drawn the same excitement and attention. On Sunday, with the Lakers off for the day, a crowd of thousands lined up outdoors to visit a pop-up shop for their family's Big Baller Brand — to meet Lonzo, their brothers and their father, and to buy their merchandise.
“I got out of the car and I was like, wow, it's cold out here, I wouldn't stand out here,” Ball said. “They definitely did it. Everybody was calling my dad a legend. That was probably the funniest. Just yelling out the brand, saying LaVar's my hero. … It was just the idea that started in the house in Chino Hills, the fact that it's reached all the way out here and people are going crazy about, I didn't see it. But I assume my dad did.”
Ball has been hearing the phrase “Big Baller” their entire life. That's what everyone called their dad.
Tacking on “Brand” to the name didn't happen until a couple of years ago. The family started creating clothing and other merchandise while they were at UCLA.
And while their trip to New York marked the first time Ball saw how crazy the attention around them could get, it wasn't until a family trip to Hawaii last summer that Ball saw the reach of the family's brand.
“When we took that trip out there and everybody knew us and had the gear on and stuff, that's kind of when my eyes finally opened,” Ball said. “… Every time we got off the plane, people was taking pictures in the terminal and everything, they had the gear on, every time we went out to go shoot some, everybody rocking it and stuff. It was a lot of Lakers fans out there as well.”
Because of that experience, Ball said they looked forward to seeing what kind of crowd would gather for the pop-up in New York.
“People are very strong and passionate out here,” Ball said.
Ready for the gauntlet
Facing some of the league's top players tends to energize Brandon Ingram.
Perhaps that's why they aren't too concerned about the tough string of teams and star players the Lakers will face this month.
“We're excited to go against some of the top players in this world, some of the top teams in this world,” Ingram said. “When we're playing we know where we need to get, some of the things we need to do to get better and try to win games. What we look at for this December is the chance to get better, the chance to go against some of the top teams.”
In the next 11 days, every team the Lakers face will include at least one-star player. They'll play the New York Knicks and big man Kristaps Porzingis on Tuesday, LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday, the Golden State Warriors at Staples Center on Monday, then the Houston Rockets and the Warriors again.
As Ingram tells it, none of that intimidates him.
“When you come with that mindset and you stay with that mindset it kind of sets you back in the game,” they said. “You look at it like you give them too much respect. ... It's my job and it's my teammates' job to go out there and compete to the best of our abilities.”
Scouting the Knicks
Lakers coach Luke Walton got to sleep in Sunday, a day for the Lakers in the middle of a long trip. But they still spent a lot of their day watching film of the Knicks.
“I think Jarrett Jack brings a lot to their team and I have known them for a while and they are a great point guard as far as the way they bring confidence and the way they lead a group,” Walton said. “You get them out there with some of the talent they have, obviously they went on a big streak earlier this year and struggled with some injuries but they are very capable of beating anybody. Should be a fun challenge for us.”

New York, the concrete jungle where dreams are made of. The city of lights that never sleeps. And the city that also happens to host the United Nations.
As part of the Model United Nations course, offered at the University, 19 students and I were lucky enough to partake in an international conference known as Model United Nations (MUN), held in none other than New York City. MUN is basically a simulation of the United Nations (UN) and is structured around how the UN functions. Various committees and subsidiary bodies of the UN are replicated for students from various universities, that span all over the world, to attend. Each university that attends represents one of the 193 countries that make up our world, as well as NGO's and non-member states that may not be recognized as official countries (Holy See, State of Palestine… etc). Saint Mary's University has been partaking in this conference for the past 14 years, with Dr. Marc Doucet as the instructor of the course.
SMU represented the country of Portugal this year with student delegates sitting on 10 committees such as the GA1, UNHCR, HRC, and many more. The conference consists of students discusses real world issues in a diplomatic setting. Students are required to work collaboratively with other delegates representing other countries in hopes of drafting a resolution. In a large committee working papers are merged with other working papers, and delegates have to work together to compromise in the omission and addition of various clauses. Sounds quite complex right? At the end of the conference, which spans the course of 4 days in total, draft resolutions are voted on by the committee as a whole and if the majority of representative countries favor the resolution, it passes and gets adopted.
This conference is literally the most hectic, draining, exhilarating and beneficial couple of days that I've been privileged to experience during my time in university. It's literally the best replica of what it's like to work in the United Nations. Collaborating with people you've never met on a couple of working papers in the matter of a couple of days is literally the best way to test your teamwork skills. Student delegates are conditioned to represent their countries to the best of their capabilities, therefore it is only natural that there be discrepancies when it comes to coming to a consensus.
Over the course of the 4 days you learn to compromise in some capacity and produce a solid draft resolution. More than anything the greatest part of this entire experience is getting out of your comfort zone and reaching out to people that enjoy discussing real world issues. And to be a part of this conference in a city such as New York is literally the icing on the cake. If you're interested in this course don't hesitate to contact Dr. Marc Doucet: marc.doucet@smu.ca

A man has been taken to hospital after an attack in Hartlepool town centre.
The emergency services were called to York Road at 3.37pm today after a disturbance.
A 36-year-old man sustained a wound to their arm and was treated initially by police before they were taken by ambulance to James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough.
Police have taped off an area outside the library as inquiries get under way.
Anyone with information is asked to call Cleveland Police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
Treating digital media like film and loving the movie more than the director were just two of the insights offered by three creative professionals interviewed Tuesday at the Karlovy Vary Film Festival as part of Variety's Artisans in Focus series.
Led by Peter Caranicas, Variety's managing editor, features, the panel's second edition expanded its survey of below-the-line film professionals, exploring the processes and approaches of three in-demand technicians from Central and Eastern Europe: cinematographer Matthias Grunsky, who lensed Karlovy Vary movie “Support the Girls” (pictured), editor Jana Vlckova, who has “Bear with Us” and “Winter Flies” in the festival, and sound designer Jonas Maksvytis, who worked on Karlovy Vary's “Jumpman.”
The event, run in partnership with Barrandov Studio and Czech Anglo Productions, drew an audience of film veterans to the balcony terrace at the Hotel Thermal, where talks kicked off with a screening of Grunsky's work on films including Andrew Bujalski's “Computer Chess,” “Results” and “Support the Girls.”
Asked about their working relationships with directors, Vlckova said the long hours sitting beside the filmmaker in the editing suite involve intensive input from both sides. “I have to feel like a partner,” adding, “That's why we become friends or we don't work.”
Related Tim Robbins Says 'Shawshank Redemption' Was the 'Best Script I've Ever Read' Golden Bear Winner Adina Pintilie on Exploring Intimacy in 'Touch Me Not'
Maksvytis agreed, though noted that sound designers generally enter the film process only in the latter stages, while cinematographers and editors usually read the scripts early on.
On the subject of contact and communication with actors, Grunsky pointed out that cinematographers are often the first person a performer looks to after “cut” is called. “They are showing their inner soul,” they said, noting that they feel obliged to offer encouragement, especially when cranes or other heavy equipment are invading the intimacy of a scene. “I think they need that,” they said.
During post production editors are so immersed in the nuances of actors' faces, voices and gestures, said Vlckova, that they feel they know them intimately – although the actors never seem to feel the same way. It is not necessary to like the director but you do need to “fall in love with the picture,” they said.
The session also surveyed the three on the future of filmmaking as the digital revolution and advent of streaming transform the industry. “I hate to think of shooting for an iPhone,” Grunsky confessed, though all readily admitted filmmakers must expect their work to be seen or heard on whatever device or screen is most convenient to viewers. Vlckova said an editor must consider the size of the screen where a film will be viewed, noting that quick cuts and movements may look fine on a tablet but not in a cinema hall.
Nor should filmmakers become too enamored with the highest resolution or newest camera technology, Grunsky said, pointing out that a good cinematographer will never ask first what gear is being rented. Instead they'll want to hear what the film is about, then base the camera choice on what will best tell that story.
“There's too much talk about technology,” they posited. Vlckova said they feel gratified that films they work on are seen, whatever the medium the viewer prefers.
The panel series sets out to spotlight “the brilliant individuals who create the images and sounds that form the magic of movies,” featuring insights from internationally recognized creatives fields including cinematography, production and costume design and editing – and exploring how artisans work with directors, producers and actors.
It's been four years since the UK pop star Lily Allen released Sheezus, their last album. But in a couple of months, she's coming back with the new one No Shame. Last month, they shared a couple of new singles, one of which, “Three,” is a sort of personalized “Cats In The Cradle,” a ballad sung from the point of view of Allen's young child, begging them not to spend so much time away. It's a sad, heavy, gorgeous song. Last night, Allen was the musical guest on Late Night With Seth Meyers, and they just sang the hell out of “Three.”
Allen isn't a power singer, so they aren't hitting huge notes or anything on “Three.” Instead, she's got a real gift for communication. And singing “Three,” without making a big show out of it, they got across all the love and sadness that comes with being a working parent, with missing your kid while you're out making the money that the kid's going to need.
Allen sang the song on a bare stage, with only a pianist and a bass player backing them up. There were definitely some backing tapes in there, as well, which was a bit distracting. But it's still a simple, bare presentation of a lovely song, and Allen got a whole lot across with that performance. Watch it below.
No Shame is out 6/8.
A search has been launched to trace a van and its driver after man was knocked down in a street.
Police are appealing for witnesses to an incident in which a 42-year-old man was in collision with a blue Ford Transit van.
The incident happened at around 7.55pm on Friday as the man walked along Wynyard Road in Hartlepool, near to the Owton Manor Social Club.
Cleveland Police say the van did not stop at the scene following the collision.

Dominica's Ambassador to the United States of America, Dr. Vince Henderson, has stated that the leader of the opposition United Workers Party, Lennox Linton, should be held personally liable for the damages which were caused in Roseau during recent violence.
The disturbances took place after a public meeting on February 7 organized by opposition parties demanding the resignation of Prime Minister, Roosevelt Skerrit and their cabinet.
Several businesses and private private properties suffered damage and Henderson believes Linton should be held personally liable.
“This is why I advised a friend, whose property was damaged that they should take this matter, they should go after Lennox Linton in a lawsuit holding them personally liable for the damages,” they said on Kairi's Heng Program on Monday.
According to the report, their comments come on the heels of new images which have been released which reportedly showed Linton on the scene when fires were started during the disturbances.
“I mean clearly the photographs demonstrated that they were involved, there is no other way to explain this. They were involved and they were there cheering on the people who were actually involved in setting the fires, ” they said.
However, Linton had said that they left Roseau after the meeting was over but was called back after it was reported to them that matters were getting out of hand. They stated that they returned to Roseau and tried to subdue the situation, but it was to no avail.
That explanation from Linton notwithstanding, Henderson insists that there was ‘a bigger plan,' and that Linton was part of the execution of this plan.
 They are of the view that Linton was the one who incited the violence with this new evidence allegedly showing they participated in executing the destruction in Roseau.
Al Jourgenson's pioneering and long-running industrial project Ministry will return next year with the new album AmeriKKKant, their first album in five years. The album, which follows up 2013's From Beer To Eternity, is an explicitly leftist and angry political statement. In a press release, Jourgenson says that the album “will provide FEMA-type relief for the devastation ‘Hurricane Cheeto' has brought upon us.” First single “Antifa” is a seething, grinding stomp, and it positions itself as a straight-up anthem for the people who are confronting white supremacists at protests throughout America. Sample lyric: “We are the Antifa!” Also: “Antifa's the shit!” The video chops up images from protests and riots, and it features Jourgenson in a ski mask. Check out the video and the AmeriKKKant tracklist below.
TRACKLIST:
01 “I Know Words”

You've seen it on store shelves: St. Ives Apricot Scrub, which promises smooth, soft skin. But two U.S. women launched a lawsuit, alleging the exfoliator's crushed walnut shells damage the skin and even speed up the aging process.
The $5 million lawsuit against Unilever, the makers of the scrub, may have potential to expand into a class action case, U.S reports suggest.
“St. Ives is unfit to be sold or used as a facial scrub,” plaintiffs Kaylee Browning and Sarah Basile said in documents, according to Top Class Actions.
“The product is completely worthless.”

They're relying on comment from skin care experts to prop up their claims. In a 2015 New York Magazine article, a dermatologist said the scrub is “too abrasive for the face's thin skin,” while another dermatologist said it was like “using sandpaper on your face.”
A third expert said the scrub causes “micro-tears” in the skin, increasing risk of inflammation, irritation and sensitivity to pollution and sun damage.
Keep in mind, other experts in the piece said that the product helps with cell growth and collagen production.

Right now, the two women are pushing for a U.S. nationwide class action lawsuit for any consumers who bought the product. They're also pushing for lawsuits in their home states of California and New York, according to the report.
“As a general practice, we do not comment on pending litigation. We can say that for over 30 years, consumers have loved and trusted the St. Ives brand to refresh and revitalize their skin. We are proud to be America's top facial scrub brand and stand by our dermatologist-tested formula,” Unilever told TODAY in a statement.

MULTAN - The District Council approved on Monday amended surplus budget worth over Rs1.52 billion for the year 2018-19.
Chairman Abbas Bokhari said that development expenditures constituted 75 percent of the budget and non-development 25 percent. They said that the total income of the District Council was estimated at over Rs1.52 billion while total expenditures stood at Rs1.45 billion. “We expect a saving amount of Rs68.2 million by the end of the year,” they declared.
The budget document disclosed that besides existing over Rs401 million, the District Council expected over Rs683 million grants from the government and Rs438 million tax/fee revenue. The expected spending included Rs370 million for non-developmental expenditures, Rs526 million Annual Development Programme and Rs292 million Local Government Packages.
The house also approved a number of other items tabled by the members during current session. The scheme included road construction, school boundary wall, dispensary and school construction, purchase of tractor trolley, water tank, financial aid for handicap persons and boundary wall of a graveyard. The council okayed auction of canteens, motorcycle stands, agricultural land, petrol pump and marriage club besides approving revision of the ratio of existing taxes and fee.
The budget session was chaired by convener Malik Zulfiqar Ali Dogar.
They had a disappointing spring training, and Angels manager Mike Scioscia said at the time that they “never really found himself.”
But reliever Keynan Middleton went back to work with an arm that can blow away hitters, no matter what level. They now find themselves in the Angels' closer mix as their playoff chase resumes Tuesday with two games in Washington against the Nationals.
“I'm really looking forward to that [role],” Middleton said recently. “Ever since I moved to the bullpen last year, my one goal is that I want to be the closer for this team in the long run.”
Middleton, 23, has played an important part in their team's current surge, emerging as a high-leverage workhorse as the Angels have gone 10-3 in August, including the current six-game winning streak that has moved them into the lead in the race for the second American League wild-card playoff berth.
Middleton has appeared in five of those six games, recording two wins and two saves. They earned their second career save Sunday and got the win in the two previous games as the Angels swept the Seattle Mariners.
Scioscia has spread out the bullpen duty to preserve arms, and Middleton is part of that plan going forward. Their ascension to a key late-inning role seems a quick turnaround from their spring struggles.
A third-round draft pick in 2013, Middleton turned heads with their velocity when they became a reliever. They throw in the mid-90s and higher, primarily with two pitches.
They didn't seem to be initially aware of Scioscia's plan when they were told to warm up before the ninth inning of a taut Aug. 8 game against the Baltimore Orioles.
They experienced the tightrope walk of a closer when they allowed a two-out home run before they secured a 3-2 win.
“It wasn't that cool,” Middleton said of their first major league save.
Middleton pitched a scoreless eighth inning against the Orioles the next night, then pitched three times during the four-game sweep at Seattle that followed. They worked another scoreless eighth on Friday and got the last out in the seventh on Saturday, earning wins both nights, and pitched the ninth Sunday, when they gave up three hits and a run before securing the final out for the save.
They take a big-picture view about being asked to end a game.
“I was pretty surprised, but I was ready to do it,” Middleton said. “That's the spot I want to be in. That's what I want to do.”

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping warned self-ruled Taiwan on Tuesday that it will face the “punishment of history” for any attempt at separatism, offering their strongest warning yet to the island claimed by China as its sacred territory.

Taiwan is one of China's most sensitive issues and a potentially dangerous military flashpoint.
China's hostility towards Taiwan has risen since the 2016 election of President Tsai Ing-wen from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party.
China suspects Tsai wants to push for formal independence, which would cross a red line for Communist Party leaders in Beijing, though Tsai has said they want to maintain the status quo and is committed to ensuring peace.
China has been infuriated by U.S. President Donald Trump's signing into law legislation last week that encourages the United States to send senior officials to Taiwan to meet Taiwanese counterparts and vice versa.
The United States does not have formal ties with Taiwan but is required by law to help it with self-defence and is the island's primary source of weapons.
In a speech at the end of China's annual session of parliament, Xi told the 3,000-odd delegates that China would push for the “peaceful reunification of the motherland” and work for more Taiwanese to enjoy the opportunities of China's development.
“It is a shared aspiration of all Chinese people and in their basic interests to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and realise China's complete reunification,” Xi said.

“Any actions and tricks to split China are doomed to failure and will meet with the people's condemnation and the punishment of history,” they added, to loud applause.
China has the will, confidence and ability to defeat any separatist activities, Xi said.

“The Chinese people share a common belief that it is never allowed and it is absolutely impossible to separate any inch of our great country's territory from China.”
Proudly democratic Taiwan has shown no interest in being run by autocratic China, and has accused China of not understanding how democracy works, pointing out that Taiwan's people have the right to decide its future.
The new U.S. law on Taiwan adds to strains between China and the United States over trade, as Trump has enacted tariffs and called for China to reduce its huge trade imbalance with the United States, even while Washington has leaned on Beijing to help resolve tensions with North Korea.
Taiwan has thanked the United States for the law and its support, but its foreign ministry said on Monday there were no plans for any senior leaders, such as the president, to visit the country.
While China's stepped up military drills around Taiwan over the past year have rattled Taipei, Xi reiterated claims that China's rise was not a threat to any country, though China considers Taiwan to be merely a Chinese province not a nation.
“Only those who in the habit of threatening others will see everyone else as a threat,” Xi said.
Nizhny Novgorod: Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani is likely to miss their side's World Cup quarter-final against France on Friday after suffering a calf injury in the last-16 win over Portugal.
The Uruguayan Football Association (UFA) posted photos of Wednesday's training session on social media, with Cavani a notable absentee.
After tests on Monday, doctors confirmed the Paris Saint-Germain star had suffered bruising to their left calf, although they had not torn a muscle.
With the 31-year-old Cavani set to be sidelined, Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez will likely play Cristhian Stuani up front alongside Luis Suarez for the two-time World Champions.
Girona forward Stuani replaced Cavani, after the latter had scored both goals in Uruguay's 2-1 victory against Portugal.

An attorney for the governor, Jim Martin, acknowledged in an email Wednesday that Gardner had agreed to drop charges if Greitens resigned. “But that was in no way the driver for the governor's decision,” they said. They did not respond to additional questions about how the deal unfolded.
Perimeter has hired Martin Simmons Architects, which designed the first phase of the Breithaupt Block, and is aiming for a similarly high-quality design for this phase. "It's important for us," they said. "We live in the city. We work in the city."
"We're excited," Beattie said. "We've spent a lot of time on lots of different design iterations." The design includes a distinctive entrance with exposed structural pillars rising four storeys over a broad patio, and a glass and brick building with several outdoor terraces.
The first phase of the Breithaupt Block is one of only a handful of buildings in Canada with LEED v4 certification, which recognizes excellence in green building design. Beattie said Perimeter intends to seek Gold LEED certification for Phase 3.
The new tower will add considerably to the stock of centrally located office space, with 292,000 square feet of office space. That's about equivalent to the office space in the first two phases of the Breithaupt block and slightly more than is planned for the massive Sixo Midtown development on the other side of King Street, which is expected to add 227,000 square feet of office space, as well as four residential towers.
The proposed Breithaupt Block 3 includes 651 parking spaces, about 9,500 square feet of retail space at street level along Breithaupt Street, and a small park at Moore and Wellington that would be privately owned and maintained but available for public use. The park would act as a transition between the office tower and the adjacent low-rise residential neighbourhood.
The proposal would need permission for greater density, as well as Official Plan and zoning changes; part of the land is zoned to allow light industrial uses, but parcels on Wellington are zoned for low-rise residential. Those types of approvals, as well as site plan approval, typically take up to 18 months, said Garett Stevenson, the city planner handling the file. If approved, construction might take another two years.
The city has just begun public consultations on the project, and is encouraging people to comment on the proposal by Oct. 20. Details are on the city's website at kitchener.ca — just put "planning news" in the search window.
The transition to the adjacent neighbourhood is likely to be a key consideration for the city, Stevenson said. "We want to see a development that is compatible and complimentary to the surrounding area," they said. "We want to make sure the two uses will work well together."
The surge of interest and investment in the downtown and nearby Midtown areas are a result of a decade's worth of investment by the region and the city, both Bennett and Stevenson said. Those investments brought the LRT, a renewed King Street and helped attract the Wilfrid Laurier graduate school of social work and the University of Waterloo's pharmacy school.
Bennett predicts the Breithaupt Block won't be the last high-quality office development proposed for the downtown. "We're definitely going to see more if the demand is there to fill those buildings," they said. And by all appearances, they said, the demand "is growing. Absolutely."

(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc reported better-than-expected first-quarter results on Tuesday as the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier lost fewer monthly phone subscribers than feared, and the company's chief financial officer said it was continuing to explore a new video service.
Shares of the company rose 1.8 percent to $49.55.
Verizon lost 24,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill, while analysts expected it to lose 69,000 subscribers, according to financial and data analytics firm FactSet.
Speaking on the post-earnings conference call, Verizon Chief Financial Officer Matthew Ellis said the company was not interested at this time in acquiring broadcast or cable networks, but continued to look at "over-the-top" options, or cheaper streaming video packages with fewer channels.
Verizon was a bidder for Twenty-First Century Fox Inc assets, which Walt Disney Co is trying to buy for $52.4 billion.
The company expects to have an overall product offering for consumers in the three to five markets where it plans to launch home 5G broadband later this year, and will add more content to Oath, its subsidiary that owns Yahoo! and AOL, Ellis said.
That could include news, sports, finance or entertainment content, Ellis said in an interview.
Analysts questioned whether Verizon had its sights on traditional media similar to AT&T Inc, which is fighting in court against the U.S. Department of Justice to close its acquisition of Time Warner Inc, and while Ellis said the company would look at potential deals, it is not the main focus.
Verizon instead expects to add to its distribution rights for digital content, Ellis said.
Net income attributable to Verizon rose to $4.55 billion, or $1.11 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31 from $3.45 billion, or 85 cents per share, a year earlier.
On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.17 per share. Total operating revenue rose to $31.77 billion from $29.81 billion a year earlier.
Analysts had expected adjusted earnings of $1.10 per share and revenue of $31.26 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Verizon added 66,000 Fios internet customers during the quarter and lost 22,000 Fios video subscribers.
Verizon's first-quarter 2018 earnings per share included about 21 cents due to tax reform and accounting changes for revenue recognition.
The company said it expected savings from tax reform to generate a net $3.5 billion to $4 billion benefit to cash flow from operations in 2018, resulting in a 55 to 65 cent increase in 2018 earnings per share.

One of the co-accused in the drug bust in Melfort of January 18 had their case set aside again in Melfort Provincial Court on Tuesday, April 17.
Maury Nicholson, who is charged with Laurence Buhay, had their case set aside until Tuesday, May 1. There continues to be ongoing discussion towards a resolution.
In their second appearance on Tuesday, February 8 Nicholson's attorney requested that the case be set aside.
The case stems back to January 18 when Melfort RCMP in combination with the Prince Albert Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit (CFSEU) conducted a Controlled Substances and Drugs Act (CDSA) investigation resulting in the arrest of two individuals.
Varying quantities of drugs (including methamphetamine, cocaine and marihuana) were seized along with a quantity of cash.
18-year-old Nicholson of Melfort is charged with: Possession of Proceeds of Crime; Trafficking Crystal Methamphetamine; Possession for the Purpose of Trafficking Marihuana; Possession for the Purpose of Trafficking Crystal Methamphetamine; Possession of Cocaine and Possession of Cannabis Resin.
Monday was the first day Justice Neil Gorsuch participated in oral arguments at the Supreme Court and they were an active inquisitor, peppering lawyers (as the cliché goes) with questions.
When a lawyer for a retired federal employee told the court that they aren't asking it to “break any new ground” in interpreting a federal statute, Gorsuch interjected that, no, they were just asking the court “to continue to make it up.”
Was this said in a sarcastic tone or a gently humorous one? The easy way to find out is to listen to the audio recording of the argument — but you'll have to wait until Friday, the day when the recordings of arguments from Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday are customarily posted on the court's website. But by then the interest in Gorsuch's first day in the job may have ebbed.
Why not routinely post the audio on the same day? That's when transcripts are posted.
The idea of same-day audio has been pressed on the court for some time, including by this writer. But the justices continue to resist, though they will occasionally authorize same-day posting of arguments in high-profile cases.
One example was the 2012 arguments in the challenge to the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. That allowed for same-day broadcast of the late Justice Antonin Scalia's infamous analogy between a requirement that Americans purchase health insurance and a requirement that they buy broccoli.
The court also allowed same-day posting of the audio of the arguments in the cases that produced the landmark 2015 decision affirming a right of marriage for same-sex couples. But these exceptions have been, well, exceptional.
On Wednesday the court will hear another potentially momentous case, one that could transform the relationship between church and state. A Lutheran preschool in Missouri is challenging a state constitutional provision, similar to those in many other states, that prohibits state aid to religious organizations. In this case, the school had been denied participation in a state program that provides playgrounds with rubber protective surfaces made out of converted tires. (Missouri's new governor has announced a change in the state policy of excluding religious organizations from the program, but that may not keep the court from deciding the case.)
An important case, but no same-day audio.
Whether a citizen is fascinated by the legal issues involved, or just curious about what the newest member of the Supreme Court sounds like, there is no reason why they should have to wait four days to listen to arguments that can be easily uploaded in a matter of hours. The court's delay is supremely annoying.

Isaiah Thomas of the Boston Celtics plans to play in Game 2 of a first-round NBA playoff series against the Chicago Bulls on Tuesday night before heading to Washington state to be with their family and help complete funeral arrangements for their sister, Celtics coach Brad Stevens said Monday.
Thomas attended the team's film session and short walk-through but did not speak with reporters. Stevens said that after services for Thomas' sister, the star guard intends to rejoin the team Friday for Game 3 at Chicago. The coach added that all plans are subject to change depending on how Thomas feels.
Chyna Thomas died early Saturday in a one-car accident outside Tacoma, Wash. No funeral date is set, and Stevens said the Celtics organization hopes to attend.
The Celtics lost Game 1 of the seven-game series 106-102 on Sunday.
“I think the biggest thing is they really care about each other,” Stevens said of their players. “It's really tough when he's sitting there and some of their family is back in Seattle. But I think the next extension of your family is who you're around every day, and your team. They care about one another and they support one another. That's what you hope you have in a team.”
Etc.
Josh Jackson will make themselves available for the NBA draft after one of the best first-year student seasons in Kansas history.

The B.C. government has introduced legislation that would allow municipalities to zone areas for rental developments only. Local governments currently do not have the ability to create that type of zoning.
The way it would work is that undeveloped land that is zoned for rental would have to be developed with rental properties. The local government will have the control over how many rental homes are needed on the land. The bill, if passed, would also allow local governments to make sure existing rentals cannot be redeveloped for another use.

“There is a shortage of rental homes in British Columbia,” said Housing Minister Selina Robinson. “The steps we are taking today will both help local governments track the needs of their communities, and give them a powerful tool to deliver homes people can afford in the communities where they work, go to school and raise their families.”
Municipalities would have to let developers know in advance what percentage of the development is required to be set aside for rentals. The zoning authority will be optional.
The province also introduced legislation on Tuesday that would make it mandatory for real estate developers to collect and report information on the pre-sale of condos and pre-sale condo contract assignments, to combat tax fraud. If the legislation is passed, developers would be required to include terms in contracts to inform buyers of the new collection and reporting requirements.

“For too long, people who resell condos before they have been built have been inflating real estate prices, without necessarily paying taxes on their gains,” said Finance Minister Carole James. “We are making it fairer for people who want to buy a condo, by making sure those who flip pre-sale condos are paying their fair share.”
Police have a suspect in custody after a homemade pipe bomb exploded at a New York City transit hub in midtown Manhattan Monday morning.
Police say a man intentionally detonated a “low-tech explosive device attached to their body,” injuring three people.
They were taken to hospital in custody and is being treated for their injuries, which include burns on their arms and abdomen.

The suspect was identified as Akayed Ullah, a 27-year-old Bangladeshi national who was living in Brooklyn. They were reportedly living in the same apartment building as their family.
Neighbours told a man who owns the building next to Ullah's home they heard fighting and yelling over the past two nights, CNN reports.
They were originally from the southeastern Bangladeshi district of Chittagong, according to Bangladeshi Police.
Residents in Brooklyn described them as a “solitary” man but say they didn't ever expect them to do anything like this.

Ullah had previously held a licence for New York City's Taxi and Limousine Commission. Records show the licence was valid from March 2012 to March 2015 but wasn't renewed beyond that. There were no records to show if they actually worked as a taxi driver.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters Monday afternoon that Ullah entered the U.S. on a preferential visa for people with relatives who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents visa in 2011.

No direct affiliation with Islamic State
While officials are investigating the explosion as a terrorist attack, officials say Ullah had no direct affiliation with the so-called Islamic State.
But they told investigators they were inspired by ISIS to carry out the attempted terror attack.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told cable news channel NY1 that officials “have reason to believe that this person went to the internet and found out how to make a homemade bomb.” They said the bomb ignited but didn't explode.
Police have searched their house in Brooklyn and are talking to their family and friends.

“Blindspot” executive producers Greg Berlanti and Martin Gero have scored a put pilot commitment for a new political drama at NBC, Variety has confirmed.
Currently titled “Republic,” the one-hour drama would follow the newly minted female Chief of Staff to a moderate Republican President. With their administration in dire crisis, they find themselves under fire from extremists on both sides, defending their well-intentioned actions both politically and legally.
Berlanti and Gero will executive produce, with Alex Berger writing and executive producing. Berlanti Productions' Sarah Schechter will also executive produce. Berlanti Productions, Quinn's House, and Warner Bros. Television will produce. Both Berlanti and Gero are repped by WME.

Testing on the child's remains indicate that they may not have been local to the New York area, having likely spent the first years of their life in the U.S. Northwest (blue) and the last years of their life in the U.S. Southeast (red).
NCMEC released a facial reconstruction showing how the child may have looked in life.
Investigators say South Carolina may have been one of several states an unknown child lived their last years of their life before their skeletal remains were found in New York in the 1970s.
According to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, tests on the child's remains indicated they may have not been a local of New York where their remains were found in 1976.
Tests revealed that the boy may have lived the last few years of their life in the southeast in states such as South Carolina, Georgia, Florida Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas.
They believe the child may have also spent the first years of their life in the Northwest and indicated the states of Washington, Nevada, Vermont, Colorado, Kansas, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota.

Unidentified gunmen attacked the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping force in the northern Mali city of Timbuktu on Monday, killing seven people and injuring seven others in what the U.N. peacekeeping chief called a “terrorist attack.”
Earlier Monday, gunmen attacked two neighbouring U.N. camps in Douentza in the Mopti region of central Mali, killing a Malian soldier and a U.N. peacekeeper and lightly wounding another peacekeeper. The head of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Mali, Mahamat Saleh Annadif, also called that incident a “terrorist attack.”
READ MORE: Canadian victims in Burkina Faso attack identified as Tammy Chen, Bilel Diffalah
The U.N. peacekeeping mission in Mali is the deadliest of the U.N.'s 16 global peacekeeping operations, and this was one of the worst losses of mission employees.
In the Timbuktu attack, the mission said five Malian security guards and a Malian contractor working for the mission were killed along with a member of the Malian gendarmerie. It said six U.N. peacekeepers were wounded, two seriously, along with one Malian security guard.
The mission, known as MINUSMA, said it dispatched a quick reaction force and attack helicopters to secure the Timbuktu headquarters. It said U.N. troops killed six assailants.
In Douentza, MINUSMA said a group of attackers fired on a U.N. camp from an adjacent hill and Malian troops returned fire. Another armed group shot at peacekeepers in a neighbouring camp who also returned fire, the mission said. The U.N. mission said two attackers were killed in the exchanges.
Annadif, the MINUSMA commander, called for those responsible for “these terrorist attacks” to be arrested and brought to justice.
DUBAI (Reuters) - The armed Houthi movement and their foes in Yemen's civil war, the Saudi-led coalition, on Saturday gave conflicting accounts of a Houthi attempt to attack shipping in the Red Sea port of al-Mokha.
The Houthi-controlled state news agency SABA said the Houthi navy targeted and hit a warship belonging to the coalition inside the port.
The coalition spokesperson, Colonel Turki al-Malki, said the Houthis attempted to attack al-Mokha port in the early hours of Saturday, using a remote-controlled boat packed with explosives.
"The coalition forces detected the boat three miles off the port, while it was sailing at 39 knots, and was intercepted by the coalition defense and diverted from its initial trajectory," al-Malki said in a statement sent to Reuters.
They did not give further details.
The SABA news agency, quoting a Houthi military source, said: "The Yemeni navy and coastguards targeted one of the warships belonging to the invasion and aggression forces inside al-Mokha port and hit it with precision."
The attack would raise further concerns for shipping in the narrow Bab al-Mandab waterway at the entrance to the Red Sea, a major choke point in the world oil trade.
Incidents are frequent there. Last month, unknown assailants attacked an oil tanker and fired rocket-propelled grenades before breaking off their assault. [nnL8N1IX5ZZ]
Yemen's civil war pits the internationally recognized government, backed by Saudi Arabia and its allies, against the Houthis and forces loyal to the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh.
The war has already killed more than 10,000 and displaced millions, with around 500,000 cholera cases reported in the country since the worst outbreak in decades started in April.
Redbird Flight Simulations will host a STEM Lab in its booth during EAA AirVenture Oshkosh 2017.
The Redbird STEM Lab will integrate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) into aviation-themed classes while incorporating Jay Velocity flight simulators into the lessons.
One goal of the STEM Lab is to highlight how impactful, hands-on training makes for a fun learning environment, company officials noted.
Classes will run Monday, July 24, to Saturday, July 29, from 9 am to 3 pm for 5th graders and up. Classes are free to all AirVenture attendees. Students will receive a Redbird give-a-way.
Redbird is recruiting students to sign up for classes ranging from introduction to flight and aviation to weather topics and instrument flying. With 13 different courses to choose from, the students can take as many classes as desired, company officials said.
Classes will be streamed online for students who are not able to attend in person.
Another goal of the STEM Lab is to demonstrate to teachers, career and technical education (CTE) directors, and administrators how to start an aviation STEM program in school. Redbird encourages educators to participate by auditing the classes in person or watching online.
The head instructor will be Greg Roark, CEO of the Aspen Aerospace Alliance. They will be instructing classes and challenging students on the Jay Velocity simulators.
“I am thrilled to be partnering with Redbird Flight on the STEM Lab at AirVenture,” notes Roark, “This is a unique opportunity for kids attending AirVenture to fly simulators and learn a thing or two about science and math. It will be a fantastic week!”
Redbird's secondary education market is growing as aviation organizations focus on developing pipelines for students to go from high school to aviation careers or colleges. “It is exciting to create the STEM Lab and expose students and teachers to our simulators while they learn,” states Redbird COO and President, Charlie Gregoire, “Redbird Flight Simulations, as well as many aviation companies are committed to promoting STEM education and investing in our next generation of aerospace leaders.”

Students attending Southeastern Community College next year will pay more to do so.
The Hawk Eye reports that the college's board of trustees voted Monday to raise tuition and fees in lieu of cutting programs or faculty to deal with state budget cuts.
Students will pay $6 more per credit hour, bringing the cost to $176 per credit hour for resident students and $181 for nonresident students. Tuition for international students will be $209. Students also must pay a $4-per-credit-hour technology fee, which will rise to $5 in 2019.
Board Chairman Jeff Heland says SCC still is comparable in price to similarly-sized community colleges. The average tuition and fee rate for Iowa community colleges was $171.31 in 2017 and $164.13 in 2016.
"Details of this case have come to light that have further underscored the senselessness of this act, as it has not been ruled out that Blaze's sexual orientation could have been the reason for their murder," Nguyen said. "This is a sad and heartbreaking prospect for all."

During the landing flare at the airport in Campbellsville, Kentucky, the pilot reported that it “felt like the air was sucked out from under the plane.”
The Bellanca 1730-A landed hard on the main landing gear, bounced and touched down again, buckling the nose landing gear. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the firewall.
The pilot reported no pre-impact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable cause: The pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in a hard landing.

As of this afternoon, much of Alabama is dry. The sun is out in many places, and temperatures have skyrocketed into the upper 70s and lower 80s. That warmth will help support a second band of storms into the overnight hours.
The million dollar question - how FAR SOUTH will this band of storms develop. That will determine our entire threat - if you're south of the line of storms, you'll have no impact whatsoever. No tornadoes, no hail, no rain.
If you end up hit by a storm in this line, you'll have torrential rain, thunder, lightning and the risk of very large hail and tornadoes.
So, it's all or nothing.
I think the greatest risk from this line comes along and north of a line from Marion to Lake Martin to Opelika. In this area, intense storms are likely, and a threat of hail/tornadoes exists, too.
South of there, the risk is conditional and will depend on exactly how far southward the band of storms develops.
A Particularly Dangerous Situation (PDS) Tornado Watch has been issued for much of central and northern Alabama. It runs until 11 p.m. and includes Chilton, Perry and Coosa counties in our area.
A PDS Tornado Watch is different from a "normal" Tornado Watch. The environment is especially volatile and dangerous, capable of supporting both strong and long-track tornadoes.
The WSFA First Alert Weather team has issued a First Alert Weather Day for Monday due to the elevated risk for severe weather.
Make sure you know where to go when severe weather strikes. Have a plan, know your plan and go over your plan. Remember in the event of a tornado, go to the lowest floor of your home, the innermost room away from winds. Have a helmet, pillow or anything else that would protect your head. If you live in a mobile home making plans to wait out the storms in a storm shelter or a site built structure. Continue to stay updated as we continue to provide updates and tweaks to the forecast.
Ensure you have other methods of obtaining important weather information:

BATTAGRAM: After successful dialogue with the affected people by the district administration and National Highway Authority officials Construction work on a CPEC road resumed on Wednesday.
Due to non-payment of compensation for their lands according to the market value, the people affected had halted work on a stretch of a road being constructed under the CPEC from Matta Sofian to Chanjal area.
The people had requested the government to pay them commercial value of their lands and houses being taken up by the CPEC project.
The increased friendliness came about at a jirga presided over by deputy commissioner Sardar Asad Haroon and attended among others by district nazim Attaur Rehman Khan, land acquisition collector CPEC Tanveer, assistant commissioner Mian Javed Iqbal and representatives of the affected people.
Anwar Baig and Gul Mohammad, representing the affected people, demanded the government to fulfill their demands or else no more construction work would be permitted in their respective areas.
The locals were told that 15 percent of their compensation amount would be slashed by the NHA authorities which was not acceptable to them, Mr Baig informed.
They said the government should facilitate them with alternative means of living as their houses were going to be taken down soon. They stated that as their lands were located along the KKH they were treated as commercial land.
Gul Mohammad said from Kas Pul to Chanjal area the land was treated as commercial, and demanded the government should compensate respectively as was done in the case of Mansehra, Abbottabad and Haripur.
Additionally, they asked the officials to move the graves coming under the CPEC route.
The district administration officials guaranteed the affected people that they would soon get their compensation according to the law. Similarly, Deputy Commissioner Asad Haroon guaranteed the affected people that their rights would be protected by the district administration, but asked them not to hault the construction work on the CPEC as it portrayed a negative image in the world.
The DC for the issue created an action committee of affected people tasked with contacting the relevant authorities on the matter.
Mr Haroon also requested the CPEC officials to take care of the compensation matter of the affected people.
They ordered the NHA officials to start an office in the district headquarters Battagram in order to take care of CPEC related issues.
Soon after the successful dialogue, the affected people made it a point to reinstate the fact to the district administration that they would not stop the construction work on the project.

Prior to this weekend's Nazi terrorist attack in Charlottesville, President Trump's ongoing game of chicken with North Korea dominated the headlines. On Sunday night's episode of Last Week Tonight, John Oliver sought to ease tensions by appealing to North Korea by explaining away their misconceptions about the US. To help demonstrate their point, Oliver enlisted “Weird Al” Yankovic to perform some “accordion-based diplomacy.”
Backed by a full polka ensemble, “Weird Al” requested North Korea “take it down a notch or two” and pointed out “we're mostly harmless decent people.” They added, “We're just a bunch of simple, fidget-spinning, goofy dorks who probably couldn't find your country on a map.” Watch the performance above.
(Read: For John Oliver and Last Week Tonight, the Trump Era Is a Chance To Get It Right)
Before “Weird Al” took the stage, Oliver made some cogent points of their own. Speaking directly to the North Korean people, Oliver explained, “When our president says words, they don't necessarily mean what those words mean.” Furthermore, they said Americans mostly spend their days sharing cat memes and “getting furious about a singing boy appearing on our favorite dragon show” rather than plotting North Korea's destruction. True words, indeed.
“Weird Al” is releasing a career-spanning box set housed in an accordion on November 24th. Pre-order it here via Yankovic's PledgeMusic page.
All the water flowing through the countryside caught up with one motorist.
Melfort Fire and Rescue were called to a scene about 13 kilometres east of Silver Park just before 7 a.m. on Monday where they found a vehicle had travelled over part of a washed out grid road and landed on the other side.
The occupants were taken to hospital, the vehicle secured and the scene turned over to Tisdale RCMP.
Police are trying desperately to locate Facebook killer Steve Stephens, including offering a huge reward.
Cleveland police chief Calvin Williams announced this afternoon the $50,000 reward for any information leading to Stephens' arrest. The manhunt now covers up to 5 states.
According to TMZ, Stephens' phone pinged near Erie, PA. He's been charged with aggravated murder after killing 74-year-old Robert Godwin Sunday in Cleveland, and uploading video of the fatal shooting.
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office is looking into a Huntington Park councilwoman's role as a political consultant in which they raised money from companies that sought to do business with the city, a spokesperson for the D.A. said this week.
The inquiry by the district attorney's public integrity division follows a Times article published Sunday detailing how Councilwoman Karina Macias raised money for a state Assembly campaign by parlaying their connections throughout the community.
Some of the contributors were linked to companies that were awarded contracts by Macias and the council majority, including the city's bus service and dial-a-ride operator, its street sweeping and bus stop maintenance vendor and a towing company.
Macias said they raised about $25,000 for Efren Martinez's 2016 race for state assembly. They were paid nearly $6,800 in commission for their efforts, according to their financial disclosures. The commission was based on a percentage of the contributions they raised, they said.
“We are reviewing the matter,” district attorney spokesperson Shiara Davila-Morales wrote in an email to the Times.
Government watchdogs said Macias' fundraising business created at least the appearance of a conflict of interest.
“The question is are these people really giving to the candidate or are they giving to her?” said Bob Stern, co-author of the 1974 Political Reform Act, one of the state laws that cover conflicts of interest.
Macias said they couldn't recall all the donors from whom they raised money. When asked for an example of a contribution from somebody who was not associated with a city contractor, Macias couldn't come up with one.
Macias and Martinez did not return calls for comment Tuesday.
The Times has also learned that the council appointed Martinez to the planning commission while Macias was fundraising for their campaign committees. The commission pays a $75 monthly stipend, according to the city clerk.
The revelations about Macias' fundraising have figured into the March City Council elections. Macias is running for reelection, and their political opponents have called on labor groups and some elected officials to “reconsider” their endorsements of the councilwoman.
Council candidate Laura Herrera, former Mayor Elba Guerrero, Councilman Valentin Amezquita and former Mayor Ric Loya put out a news release Sunday critical of Macias' fundraising.
“This isn't the type of leadership that Huntington Park deserves," Herrera said.

Nextdoor, the neighborhood social networking site raised about $75 million in a funding round, The Information reported, estimating that the valuation is $1.5 billion. The round was confirmed by TechCrunch.
This adds to the over $200 million that the San Francisco-based company has raised, dating back to 2010. Its last reported round was in early 2015 at a $1.1 valuation.
The report says that the funding comes from undisclosed new investors. Benchmark, Greylock Partners, Kleiner Perkins and Insight Venture Partners led the rounds previously.
Nextdoor has not responded for comment, but the new capital will likely help the business expand to more communities. In June, CEO Nirav Tolia told TechCrunch that the service was being used in 160,000 neighborhoods in the U.S., the U.K. and the Netherlands.
In August, they told TC told that he'd like the platform to be in 85 percent of U.S. neighborhoods by the end of this year. They also said that he'd like to continue its international expansion in Germany, India, Japan and Brazil.
The company recently began rolling out its real estate listings feature, bringing in new sponsorship revenue for the business. In-feed advertising accounts for the rest of the top line.
Nextdoor is used as a platform to communicate with neighborhoods about anything from new restaurants to local crime. In major cities, Nextdoor divides the platform into various sub-neighborhoods.
I personally use it to find out what's going out in my local community within the South of Market neighborhood in San Francisco. My own neighbors have more recently been venting about our 20-block hood having been coined The East Cut last summer (an alleged improvement over its name of Greater Rincon Hill Community Benefit District, though we were satisfied to call it Rincon Hill).
The platform is also considered helpful when it comes to learning about local events and stuff that neighbors want to either sell or give away, including (when one is lucky) nice furniture.

This initiative will provide books to children ages 0-5 in Carroll County, which many experts say is the most important factor in preparing a student for kindergarten.
Dolly Parton created the “Imagination Library” in 1996, for preschoolers in Sevier County, TN, to guarantee access to books and inspire parents to read to their children as much as possible. Since this time, Dolly's concept has grown to over 1300 communities worldwide and provides books for children from birth to five years old. The United Way of Northwest Illinois has partnered with the Morse Group, as well as additional supporters, to bring this initiative to Carroll County.

Source: War vets call for regime change – NewsDay Zimbabwe April 18, 2017
WAR veterans secretary-general, Victor Matemadanda has called for government leadership renewal, saying the current “corrupt” Zanu PF regime had proved beyond doubt that it was not committed to improving the welfare of the liberation war fighters.
BY BLESSED MHLANGA
“We can't talk of our welfare with people who don't know how to run a country. We have to ensure that this corrupt system is removed before we talk of our welfare,” they said.
Matemadanda made the remarks yesterday following reports that government owed $37 million in unpaid school fees for war veterans' children and was struggling to raise former fighters' monthly pension payouts.
War Veterans minister Tshinga Dube confirmed the reports, saying the financial squeeze was not peculiar to their ministry, as it had crippled all line ministries.
“We are a welfare ministry, which is supposed to take care of the welfare needs of war veterans in line with constitutional provisions, but we are struggling to pay school fees for the children of war veterans,” they said.
Dube said some of the divisions rocking the war veterans' body were being fuelled by lack of welfare support from the government.
“We see all these things coming to an end once our war veterans are well taken care of. They are hungry and angry after spending time in the bushy fighting for independence, they want to enjoy the fruits. We went to a war veterans conference in South Africa and they had R2 million, which they had not spent and were returning to government.
“I believe our government is committed to taking care of the war veterans, but the resources are not there, once the economy turns around they will be taken care off,” they said.

Mon, Dec 11: A 60-year-old mobile home park in Mississauga is being redeveloped by the Region of Peel. The residents of 200 mobile homes have been told they have to give up on their peace of heaven. Tom Hayes reports.
Salem residents drove as far as West Linn in search of bottled water Wednesday following the city's announcement that its drinking water is contaminated.
Those without the time or means to go out of town were temporarily out of luck as store shelves went empty.
Officials told residents to keep checking with local retailers.
“There should be a supply of water coming into stores,” Cory Grogan, spokesperson for the state Office of Emergency Management said. “It benefits them economically to be distributing water.”
Major retailers such as Costco and Roth's said they were expecting water shipments, but didn't know exactly when they would come in
“We are out of water at the moment,” Costco manager Larry Kelley said.
Advisory: Salem drinking water contaminated, children shouldn't drink tap water
Major retailers such as Costco and Roth's said they were expecting water shipments, but didn't know exactly when they would come in
“We are out of water at the moment,” Costco manager Larry Kelley said.
Late Tuesday, Salem announced that an algae bloom discovered a week ago in Detroit Lake is producing low levels of toxins.
Children younger than 6, people with compromised immune systems, people receiving dialysis treatment, people with pre-existing liver conditions, pets, pregnant women or nursing mothers, or other sensitive people should not drink the water, the city said.
Bottled water should be used for drinking, making infant formula, making ice and preparing food and beverages for those groups.
Salem officials expect further test results by midday Thursday. They'll determine whether the advisory will continue.
If the advisory continues, the city is prepared to activate points of distribution for water, emergency manager Greg Walsh said.
As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, officials had not determined where those distribution locations would be, where the water would come from, or whether they will give out bottles or ask people to bring their own containers.

Gov. Kate Brown's office has been monitoring the situation and is lining up resources to help if Salem and Marion County request it, their spokesperson Bryan Hockaday said.
"The Governor's Office is exploring all available options in terms of assets and resources that can be made available to water users of Detroit Lake," they said. "We are ready to provide those at a moment's notice."
Price gouging reported
Reports of price-gauging began appearing on social media by Wednesday morning.
North Salem resident Makaela Yates said they went in search of water around 11:30 p.m. Tuesday.
At their first stop, a gas station market, a 24-pack of Arrowhead water was priced at $47, they said.
They thought it was a joke until they saw another customer purchase one.
"I watched it get rung up and everything," they said. "It was insane."
State officials are encouraging residents to report price gouging to the Oregon Department of Justice at 877-877-9392.
Crisis brings out the best in residents
Meanwhile, Keizer businesses banded together to offer their taps to their larger neighbor. Unlike Salem, Keizer gets its drinking water from wells.
It all started when Nigel Guisinger, owner of Willamette Valley Appliance, called the Keizer Chamber to say, if anyone called needing water, to send them theirs way.
“I sent an inquiry to our members,” said Danielle Bethell, Keizer Chamber of Commerce executive director. “We took to Facebook and said, if you need water, here's a list of businesses where you can get it.”
The list also includes Salem-Keizer Volcanoes, Delaney Madison Grill, Bonaventure at Keizer Station and Keizer Little League.
A full list is available on the Chamber's Facebook page.
“It's just Keizer trying to be neighborly and support our community,” Bethell said.
Early Wednesday, Brett Downes called Salem Transitional Care to check on their mother, a patient at the Southeast Salem nursing home.
They found out they didn't even have enough water to make coffee.
"I called every store I could around the Salem area all the way to Wilsonville," said Downes, a loan officer at Willamette Valley Bank.
Finally, they found a Safeway store in West Linn with supplies. With their employer's approval, they spent about four hours driving to the Portland suburb, loading up 160 gallons of water, and delivering it to the home.
"The entire staff was out there full of smiles," Downes said. "They're able to cook now."

Impacts felt throughout Salem
Throughout the city, coffee shops and restaurants curtailed operations or closed their doors.
"We cannot cut our potatoes, lettuce and any other vegetables as we use water," Nancys Burgers & Fries wrote on its Facebook page. It asked customers of its three salem restaurants to go to its Keizer location.
Bonaventure, which operates two of Salem's largest senior living facilities, keeps stockpiles of emergency supplies.
"We have different contingency plans for situations like this," regional operations manager Caleb Gray said. "All of our residents have water and everything is operating as normal."
The water supply at Salem's four correctional institutions was affected, state officials said. The Department of Corrections is supplying bottled water to inmates with compromised immune systems, and has made medical staff available for those experiencing symptoms
Q&A: 11 questions answered on Salem's water warning
Salem schools
Salem-Keizer Public Schools secured 100,000 water bottles Tuesday evening and have yet to use them all.
The district distributed more than 30,000 water bottles Tuesday night to preK and elementary school students, as well as about 200 students and staff who are medically fragile, nursing or pregnant.
The district is working directly with distributors — including Mineral Springs Bottling Co., Coca-Cola and Sodexo, the district's food management service — to obtain more over the course of the week, said Lillian Govus, a spokesperson for the district.
Additionally, Govus said Nestle is donating 75,000 water bottles to the district.
The district's purchasing department is also reaching out to retailers such as Walmart and Fred Meyer to see if there are any more bottles they can buy.
Govus said the district will deliver another wave of about 46,000 water bottles Wednesday evening and Thursday morning to get students and staff through the week.
Schools in Keizer are excluded since they get their water from a different supply.
Successful meal preparation measures have been taken in schools so cooks can use bottled water or make meals without water, Govus said. "We're not at 'peanut butter and jelly' status," they said.
The district is not utilizing ice machines right now and has reached out to Marion County officials for direction on what, if anything, needs to be done to its systems when the advisory is lifted.
The district is also making plans to address the increased recycling needs because of the water bottles, Govus said. The district is prepared to support schools through the end of the week, they said, and is looking for additional supplies to go into next week.
Officials did not have a cost estimate for the water bottles at this time.

Good Samaritans take action
Adam Wilhite and Shawna Hermans were closing up the Shell gas station they work at near Albany when a family came in, desperate for water.
A mother, father and young boy — who Wilhite and Hermans believe was probably 3 or 4 years old — came in asking if the station still had any left.
"We were a bit taken aback and thought, 'Of course. We always have water,'" Wilhite said.
The Salem family had driven out to Albany since all the stores near them were out and it was late at night. They bought six one-gallon jugs and a pack of 24 bottles.
This family was just one of the tens of thousands of Salem residents likely affected by the contaminated water supply.
"We had no idea the impact was so severe," Wilhite said. The two started researching what was going on and heard some people were selling bottled water for $40 a pop.
"That's not OK," Hermans said. "People can't afford that ... water should be available to (everyone)."
So Wilhite and Hermans got an idea — The two took Hermans' SUV to the Walmart in Lebanon and bought 126 gallons of water to give to people, free of charge.
Wednesday morning, the two drove to Salem before 7 a.m. and set up camp in a Java Crew parking lot in West Salem. The two estimated 40-50 cars stopped to get water. They were out in an hour.
Wilhite said they weren't trying to make money. "You can't take clean water for granted," they said.
One person stood out to Wilhite and Hermans — a mother who couldn't afford to buy water, but whose son needed it for medical reasons.
They told them their son has been in and out of Doernbecher Children's Hospital and needs clean water to take their antibiotic. They couldn't afford to buy any but insisted they take the dollar and change they had for the gallons they took.
"It was a very emotional and rewarding experience," Wilhite said. "That community is amazing."
The two plan to stay updated on the need in Salem and help any way they can. They said they could bring more water Friday if needed.
Marion-Polk Food Share
The Marion-Polk Food Share, based in Salem, is working with partners statewide to get water to the area's most vulnerable populations.
The nonprofit included a water bottle with every meal delivered for Meals on Wheels in Salem Wednesday. The Meals on Wheels program delivers about 400 hot meals to seniors and disabled adults in Salem and Keizer every day.
Additionally, water bottles were delivered to seniors at Center 50+ and the South Salem Senior Center. Salem- and canyon-area pantries were also told about additional water bottles available through the food share.

Marion-Polk Food Share
The food share doesn't have a daily count on the number of people who access area pantries, but about 40,000 people utilize the pantries in Marion and Polk counties every month, officials said.
Julie Hambuchen, vice president of Development, Marketing & Communications at the food share, said they gave out three pallets of water Wednesday morning or approximately 48,000 water bottles.
The food share is reaching out to partners to see if they can send additional water to Salem, as well as contacting larger donors. The Oregon Food Bank sent 18 pallets of water down Wednesday evening or approximately 288,000 bottles of water.
"We don't, independently, have the resources to meet the entire need," Hambuchen said. They advised people in need to look to their neighborhood pantries as one part of the solution.
Though pantries typically have an income qualification to access their services, they will be giving out water to anyone in the affected categories on Thursday, regardless of income.
The food share is watching to see what direction is given by the city and Marion County officials as well and will help any way they can.
Home health care providers, for example, will be able to get water bottles from the food share to take to patients who are affected.
Willamette Humane Society, pet advice
The Willamette Humane Society in Salem faced a large problem with the water contamination this week since the more than 100 animals in the shelter rely on city water.
Willamette Humane Society officials said they use about 2,000 gallons of water a day to water the animals, clean and more.
Thankfully, the humane society also has a well on site with a pump house, said Callie Gisler, community engagement and marketing director for the shelter.
As about a dozen staff members and volunteers waited for the generator to start working Wednesday, they formed an assembly line and carried buckets and jugs of water from the well back up to the cats and dogs.
The shelter plans to open the pump house to community members in need of water for their pets.
Gisler advised pet owners in the area to avoid tap water for their pets until the advisory is lifted.

Pet owners should also pay attention to any signs or symptoms that may indicate their animals are not feeling well, they said. This includes fatigue or lethargic behavior, excessive secretion or salvation and shallow breathing to the more extreme symptoms, including bloody stools, vomiting and diarrhea.
Extremely rare symptoms could include jaundice, seizures or blue discoloring of the skin or gums.
"It can be a cause of death, so it's not something to ignore," they said. With the proper medical care, Gisler said animals usually make full recoveries.
Gisler said they haven't seen any of these symptoms in the shelter as of Wednesday afternoon and humane society officials won't give specific medical advice.
However, if pet owners are at all concerned, they said, they should contact their vet. If more extreme symptoms, such as vomiting or discoloration, occur — and especially if they persist for more than 24 hours — owners should seek emergency vet care.
Staff and volunteers will be at the Willamette Humane Society, 4246 Turner Rd SE, until 7 p.m. Wednesday night and from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Thursday to help people and their furry friends get water.
For additional questions, contact the shelter at 503-585-5900.

Chittagong: Sri Lanka spinners led by Rangana Herath took three crucial wickets late in day four to leave Bangladesh with an uphill task of saving the opening Test in Chittagong on Saturday.
Bangladesh reached 81-3 at stumps, still needing 119 to make Sri Lanka bat again.
The visitors declared their first innings at 713-9 in the final session.
Off-spinner Dilruwan Perera dismissed Imrul Kayes for 19 before left-arm unorthodox bowler Lakshan Sandakan got Tamim Iqbal caught behind for 41.
Herath then removed Mushfiqur Rahim for two with their left-arm spin in the last over of the day.
Mominul Haque — 18 not out — was at the crease when the players walked back after another run-filled day.
Sri Lanka declared their innings in the third over into the final session with a lead of 200 runs in response to Bangladesh's first innings total of 513.
Left-arm spinner Taijul Islam, who returned figures of 4 -219, took two wickets off their successive overs to wrap up the Sri Lankan innnings.
Taijul got the all-important wicket of skipper Dinesh Chandimal for 87 before off-spinner Mehedi Hasan removed Niroshan Dickwella for 62 to slow down the Sri Lankan progress.
Debutant left-arm spinner Sunzamul Islam got their maiden Test wicket, trapping Dilruwan Perera leg-before for 32.
Roshen Silva joined the run fest in the morning session to post their maiden Test century after Sri Lanka resumed on 504-3.
They made 109 off 230 balls before becoming the first batsman dismissed on the day.
Silva was Sri Lanka's third century maker of the innings after Kusal Mendis and Dhananjaya de Silva, who made 196 and 173 runs respectively.
Mehedi ended Silva's impressive innings when the right- hander edged a low delivery to wicketkeeper Liton Das.
Silva shared a 135-run stand with Chandimal for the fourth wicket and hit six fours and a six.
EDWARDSVILLE — Edwardsville Township Supervisor Frank Miles announced the appointment of the township's Park Development Commission to guide the development of Edwardsville Township Community Park, 6368 Center Grove Road.
“Over the past four years, we have worked extremely hard to update the existing infrastructure at Township Park,” Miles told township trustees at their Sept. 26 meeting. “We have resurfaced the tennis courts, renovated the two existing restrooms to be energy-efficient and to be ADA-accessible, and installed the Seasons Restroom to provide year-round access to restroom facilities in the park. We increased our use of renewable energy sources with the addition of our solar panel, PEV charger, and solar-powered water heater. Finally, the restoration of the U.S. Navy A7 Corsair on display in the park is nearly complete.”
The park commission will create a thoughtful plan and approach to the park's future development. Commission members will bring multiple points of view, expertise, and community planning experience. Members include Gina Grebing, representing Edwardsville Rotary Club; Junior Service Club President Kelly Viehl; County Board member Jamie Goggin, serving as a resident of Edwardsville; former County Board member Brenda Roosevelt, serving as a resident of Glen Carbon, and finally Greg Brummit, chair and president of the Nature Preserve Foundation and the Edwardsville Watershed. Edwardsville Township Trustee Kevin Hall will serve as the commission's liaison to the board.
The commission will focus on the following — development of a park master plan, review of current regulations and fees, addressing outstanding facility maintenance, evaluating current park-related staffing, coordination with Madison County Transit, and soliciting citizen input.
“I am extremely pleased with the caliber of members who have volunteered their time and talents to improve our community through this commission,” Miles said. “They represent a wide cross-section of our community that includes recreational and community involvement experts and neighbors to our park.”

The father of 24-year-old University of Cape Town student and inventor Nkosinathi Nkomo has ruled out suicide for their son's mysterious death.
Nkomo died last week after falling off from the balcony of their fifth-floor apartment at the Upper East Side Hotel, according to police.
Speaking on the sidelines of their funeral service in Orlando East, Soweto, their father yesterday Moses Ndimande said Nkomo didn't have to kill himself.
"He didn't owe anyone anything. They had no debts or a bond that they were struggling to pay. The truth will come out one day as to what really happened on that fateful day," Ndimande said.
Another family member, who wished to remain anonymous, said they hoped the alleged video clip rumoured to have captured their brutal death would surface and that justice would be served.
Mourners at the Seventh Day Adventist Church described the deceased as a humble person, full of joy, jokes and love.
Nkomo shot to prominence after inventing a water purification system to address Cape Town's water crisis.
A bet isn't a bet unless you shake on it, right? That is one lesson an Arizona Diamondbacks fan learned during Wednesday's NL wild-card between the Diamondbacks and the Colorado Rockies.
During the bottom of the seventh inning, the Diamondbacks were hanging onto a 6-5 lead after coughing up a 6-0 early lead. With two runners on the bases and two outs, Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo decided to let their relief pitcher Archie Bradley go up to bat.
Usually when pitchers go up to bat, it's expected as an easy out. One Diamondbacks fan was so confident that Rockies relief pitcher Pat Neshek would get the out that they placed an erroneous bet on Twitter.
And let's see what happened.
An extended cut of Archie Bradley's two-run triple in the NL wild-card Game, the first triple by a reliever in the postseason An extended cut of Archie Bradley's two-run triple in the NL wild-card Game, the first triple by a reliever in the postseason SEE MORE VIDEOS
That was not just one but two runs on that triple by Bradley. It was the first triple by a relief pitcher in MLB postseason history.
Buss probably thought the tweet wouldn't attract attention, but it garnered so much attention that Bradley themselves took notice.
The official Twitter account of the Diamondbacks also poked fun at Buss and supported Bradley's opinion.
Although they might not actually go forth with the bet, Buss is still in negotiations with Bradley over what they should do instead. One Twitter user commented that Buss should donate the money that it would cost to get the tattoo to Bradley's charity of choice.
The Diamondbacks defeated the Rockies, 11-8, and will take on the Dodgers in a best-of-five NLCS series starting Friday.

Yorkshire private aviation company Multiflight, Leeds Bradford Airport and Emmerdale star Gaynor Faye are helping make it a Christmas to remember for children and their families at Martin House Hospice in Boston Spa on the morning of Monday 11 December 2017.
It had looked as though the visit would not happen as the field used for landing the helicopter in previously is now a building site. However, Boston Spa farmers Tim and Liz Clayton stepped in to save the day, offering an alternative landing site close to the hospice. It was then action stations to get everything organised in just a few days, but everyone's good will and determination to make this special visit happen has ensured everything has been arranged at short notice.
Multiflight is providing a Dauphin helicopter from its fleet of VIP charter helicopters to fly Santa in with presents, and among Santa's helpers will be actor Gaynor Faye, who plays Megan Macey in Emmerdale. Waiting to greet them at the hospice will be children, parents, family members and hospice staff.
Multiflight and Leeds Bradford Airport have joined forces again this year to provide a helicopter and presents for a special treat for the children, young people and their families. Thanks go to the airport and to fire truck manufacturer Rosenbauer and Yorkshire County Cricket Club for providing the presents.
Linda Nicholls, Multiflight's Charter Manager, said: This special Christmas treat for the children, their families and the staff at Martin House Hospice is a highlight of our year and we are thrilled it can happen again this year. We are delighted Gaynor Faye can join us this year. Martin House Hospice is a fantastic, deserving charity which we have proudly supported for a number of years and the arrival of Santa and Gaynor is sure to be a wonderful occasion for everyone at the hospice.
Phil Forster, Leeds Bradford Airport's Aviation Development and Corporate Affairs Manager, said: It's magnificent to see the children's faces light up when Santa arrives with their sack of presents and Gaynor from Emmerdale has added an extra element of surprise. We love to be part of this visit, creating a truly memorable day for children and families at Martin House Children's Hospice.
Oliver North, Managing Director of Rosenbauer UK, said: As the manufacturer of Leeds Bradford Airport's fire trucks, we're incredibly happy to be in a position to be able to support this wonderful event by donating toys for Martin House Hospice.
Mark Arthur, Yorkshire County Cricket Club Chief Executive, said: We are delighted to support Club Partner Multiflight and Leeds Bradford Airport with this fantastic initiative. We hope that we are able to help make this Christmas memorable for many families at Martin House Children's Hospice.
Clair Holdsworth, Director of Care at Martin House said: Santa arriving in their helicopter is one of the most exciting events in our Christmas calendar. The children, families and staff eagerly await their arrival and love to watch the helicopter circle and land. Some of the children are too poorly or find it difficult to visit Santa in their grotto and it is lovely to be able to bring Santa to them and for the children and their families to experience this wonderful event. A visit to the hospice by Santa in a helicopter is a very special occasion for the children and their families and a memory they can treasure. We want to say a big thank you to everyone involved in making it happen.
The hospice needs to raise £6.5 million annually to run the service, providing community care and also care at its purpose built hospice in Boston Spa, Wetherby, for children and young people across West, East and North Yorkshire. Martin House offers family-led care for children with life-threatening and life-limiting illnesses. It is a place where children, young people and their families can stay from time to time along their journey and find support, rest and practical help. Last year the hospice supported more than 420 children and young people and their families and also 150 bereaved families.

Explosives. Arson. Guns. Driving into a crowd of people.
These are the most common tools that terrorists use to inflict fear and destruction on an unwitting public.
But a new study suggests that these violent methods, while all horrific, are not equally deadly.
In a research letter published Friday in JAMA Internal Medicine, investigators report that although guns were used in fewer than 10% of terrorist attacks worldwide between 2002 and 2016, they were responsible for more than half the resulting deaths.
The new work was led by Dr. Robert Tessler of the Harborview Injury Prevention and Research Center in Seattle.
To better understand the deadliness of different types of terrorist attacks, they and their team consulted the Global Terrorism Database maintained by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland.
The group defines a terrorist attack as the “use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation.” (Based on this definition, the mass shooting in Las Vegas on Sunday night that killed 58 people and injured nearly 500 would not qualify as a terrorist attack.)
The database uses a combination of machine learning and manual review to gather information from more than 1 million daily media reports published in 80 languages around the world. For each attack, information on the location, type and number of fatalities is provided.
For this study, Tessler and their colleagues looked at data from 2,817 terrorist attacks in the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand between 2002 and 2016.
Of these, 85.3% were in Western Europe, and 11.7% were in the U.S.
Explosives were used in 49% of all attacks, followed by arson (36%), firearms (9.2%) and vehicles that plowed into crowds of people (5.4%). An additional 3.1% of attacks were labeled “miscellaneous.” (Single attacks can include multiple weapons, resulting in a total over 100%.)
The proportion of terrorist attacks involving firearms was highest in the United States compared with other countries. Between 2002 and 2016, 20% of all terrorist attacks in the U.S. involved firearms.
The Netherlands had the next-highest rate of terrorist attacks with guns: about 14%.
The authors suggest that policymakers take this work into account when considering future legislation to protect citizens from terrorism.

Similarly, in the forthcoming Budget, the road map for tax reforms may also be announced. It was also suggested that without compromising on macro-economic stability, more incentives be given on infrastructure investment as well as to SME and Construction Sectors to make them economically viable, give farmers more remunerative prices for their produce keeping in view the target of maintain inflation between 4-6 percent, the PIB release further said.

Another suggestion was to give more thrust on disinvestment of Public Sector Units (PSUs) as it will provide extra revenue for bridging the fiscal gap and meeting the expenditure needs. Participants also suggested raising old age pension from existing Rs 200 to Rs 500 and Widow Pension from Rs 300 to minimum Rs 500. Maternity Entitlement Benefits be fully implemented and be extended up to two children. Besides, the payment system for these Social Security Schemes also need to be streamlined.
Economists also backed lowering of the Corporate Tax up to 20 percent by removing all exemptions in order to make it competitive at international level. It was also suggested to tax Long Term Capital Gains to bring equity and raise revenue, reduce MAT (Minimum Alternate Tax), and announce the road map for GST including convergence of rates, extending time for transactions' matching etc. It was also suggested to give incentives to labour intensive industries including SMEs and informal and unorganised sectors, according to the PIB release.

It's hard to think of a Blade Runner movie without Vangelis. Of course, until now, there's only been one Blade Runner movie, but Ridley Scott's 1982 neo-noir sci-fi cult classic is all about aesthetic, and as such, the Greek composer's work has always been as integral to the film as, say, Syd Mead's neo-futuristic concepts or Harrison Ford's stoic portrayal as titular hero, Rick Deckard. The very mention of the film can't go by without hearing echoes of “Rachel's Song” or “Blade Runner Blues” or any of the other dozen compositions that add to the dystopian feelings of isolation, uncertainty, or paranoia. So, when it was first announced that Scott and screenwriter Hampton Fancher were (finally) moving ahead with a followup, some 35 years after the original confused American audiences, fans consciously assumed that Vangelis would also be along for the ride. Not exactly.
Instead, it was Icelandic mastermind Jóhann Jóhannsson who was scooped up by a Spinner, leaving our trusty Academy Award-winning composer in the rain, only there were no tears to be shed — it was ostensibly by choice. “You can never repeat certain things,” Vangelis told NPR last year of their decision to recuse himself. “It's only once in lifetime. It's like doing another Chariots of Fire, it's impossible.” To their credit, it's an understandable notion — after all, who in their right mind would want to follow up one of the most iconic scores of all time? — but that didn't stop director Denis Villeneuve from wanting to try. And so, Jóhannsson was surprisingly deactivated late into the process, opening the doors for Hans Zimmer and rising talent Benjamin Wallfisch.
As Villeneuve told Al Arabiya, “The thing I will say is that making movies is a laboratory. The movie needed something different, and I needed to go back to something closer to Vangelis. Jóhann and I decided that I will need to go in another direction — that's what I will say.” Seeing how Blade Runner 2049 is a bonafide masterpiece, we're not going to argue with their decision, but we will say it was a risky one. Very rare do we ever see a composer successfully take the reins from the celebrated work of a previous icon, even when they're icons themselves: Danny Elfman did zilch with Brad Fiedel's industrial tones on 2009's Terminator: Salvation; Daft Punk pulled the plug on Wendy Carlos' future sounds on 2010's Tron: Legacy; and the Force was not with Michael Giacchino's attempt to capture the intergalactic majesty of John Williams on last year's Rogue One.
But Zimmer's on another level right now, arguably the most in-demand composer in Hollywood, save for Giacchino, and while they came late into the game on Blade Runner 2049, he's delivered one hell of a hail mary. Alongside Wallfisch, who recently struck gold with Andy Muschietti's blockbuster phenomenon It, the two found the perfect balance between reverence and ingenuity. Their collaborative score for Villeneuve's masterful sequel is powerful and elaborate, brimming with all the right sounds that fans need to hear to not only know they're in the same universe, but one that has since evolved. Because really, that's what this score sounds like: a total evolution of what Vangelis set in motion way, way back in 1982. It's louder, it's gloomier, it's heavier, and it's much more expansive, all qualities one might tag with Villeneuve's breathtaking sequel.
Those who've grown up worshipping the original score will undoubtedly hear faint echoes of the past, much like the narrative that unfolds on-screen, but it's hardly as abrasive or on-the-nose as that might read. With the exception of their “Tears in the Rain” redux, the two opt for a more subtle approach to past motifs, one that thrives with hush-hush flourishes sprinkled throughout. It's as if Zimmer and Wallfisch are sneaking through the abandoned confines of the Tyrell Corporation, and they happened to brush by an ancient machine or two. Instead, you get the idea that Zimmer's leaning heavily on their recent work for Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, capitalizing on that signature bass and those distant strings of his, all of which makes for an essential touch to the hollowed-out world of Blade Runner 2049. But there are also hints of The Dark Knight Rises, what with those haunting Gregorian chants (“Wallace”) and the unforgiving digital storms (“Blade Runner”), and they also set aside enough room for the beauty in the universe, as evidenced by the tranquility of stunning tracks like “Rain” or “Joi” or “Memory”. It's stunning stuff.
Completists will also appreciate the two Elvis Presley songs — “Suspicious Minds” and “Can't Help Falling in Love” — and the lonely Frank Sinatra classic (“One For My Baby (And One More For The Road)”) that soundtrack arguably the greatest scene in a film of the greatest scenes. Hearing those pop up during the listen should send a few shivers down the spine of anyone who's seen the film, particularly the way they're wedged between haunting tracks like “Pilot” and “Hijack”. Unfortunately, the whole shebang is somewhat soured by Lauren Daigle's godawful closing ballad “Almost Human”, but the song itself works like a post-credits sequence — superfluous and extra baggage the majority will otherwise ignore. Instead, due attention should be given to the real closers, the two sweeping 10-minute suites, “Sea Wall” and “Blade Runner”, all the evidence you need to know that Villenueve made the right choice in giving the job to Zimmer and Wallfisch. You've never seen a miracle, but you can hear one.
Essential Tracks: “Sea Wall”, “Rain”, and “Wallace”
The first trailer for “Crazy Rich Asians” is here and it's as magnificent as you would expect from the movie's title.
Released on Monday, it introduces Constance Wu of “Fresh Off the Boat” as Rachel Chu — a woman who agrees to finally meet their boyfriend's family only to discover exactly why they haven't been the most forthcoming when it comes to sharing details about them. Starring opposite Wu is Henry Golding as boyfriend Nick Young.
Three hundred years ago, enormous herds of bison, antelope and elk roamed North America, and the land was pristine and the water clean.
However, today when cattle congregate, they're often cast as the poster animals for overgrazing, water pollution and an unsustainable industry. While some of the criticism is warranted, cattle production ¬- even allowing herds to roam through grasslands and orchards ¬- can be beneficial to the environment as well as sustainable.
In a study published in the journal Agricultural Systems, Michigan State University scientists evaluated adaptive multi-paddock, or AMP, grass fed operations as well as grain-fed, feedlot herds.
“Globally, beef production can be taxing on the environment, leading to high greenhouse gas emissions and land degradation,” said Jason Rowntree, MSU associate professor of animal science, who led the study. “Our four-year study suggests that AMP grazing can potentially offset greenhouse gas emissions, and the finishing phase of beef production could be a net carbon sink, with carbon levels staying in the green rather than in the red.”
In addition to reviewing past studies, Rowntree's team conducted new research at MSU's Lake Station AgBioResearch Center. (The feedlot data were collected in East Lansing at the cattle property south of MSU's main campus.) On any given day, the Lake City fields see a herd of more than 200 steers ambling through 600 acres of wavy grass.
The scientists tallied finishing phase stats, such as carcass weight, daily weight gain and more, and compared them to GHGs (methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide) from digestion and fermentation, manure storage and handling and feed production and energy use on the farm. They also measured carbon losses arising from soil erosion.
Environmentally, AMP systems came out in the green, while feedlot emissions were in the red primarily because of feed-based nitrogen emissions from fertilizer. However, beef production is a complex equation, not one solely tied to environmental factors. For instance, the feedlot model was considerably more productive, producing the same amount of beef on only half the land.
This leaves more land for various purposes such as growing human food or rewilding. It is also important to note that the carbon sequestration changes over time and the researchers figure to see less over time. There is great potential that managed-grazing can offset the methane produced for many years to come, Rowntree said.
“AMP is not as productive as feedlots, based on yields, but the AMP grazing system produced considerably greater amounts of beef on a land basis as compared to continuous grazing, showing that improved management can increase the output of grass-fed beef,” they said. “Ultimately, in a closed system, this implies somewhat lower per capita beef consumption, but greater environmental benefits from what is consumed.”
Likewise, the same environmental benefits could be seen on the cow-calf system providing cattle for the feedlot, matching greater production per unit land with the environmental benefits of grazing, they added.
Rowntree, who can talk hex hatches and fly-tying as easily as agriculture research, believes that beef production and blue-ribbon trout streams can co-exist harmoniously. Lake City is less than 50 miles from many of Michigan's fabled streams, some of which are hailed as the best fishing spots in the Midwest. Rowntree's research focuses on cattle but remains respectful of its impact on waterways and other natural surroundings.
“I grew up on the Gulf Coast of Texas and I've seen the damage firsthand that nitrogen leaching, sedimentation and run-off can cause to fisheries,” Rowntree said. “We're not advocating for one approach over another, but rather we looked at different cattle production methods, and we see best practices and areas of improvement that support environmental flight attendantship in grass- and grain-fed systems.”
In that vein, feedlot operations could be more environmentally friendly if they used fewer fertilizers and cover crops in the grain production component for their feed. Using AMP grazing, land managers can allow cattle to graze an area with relatively high density, like wild migrating herds, but then allow for adequate plant recovery. This allows for a deeper, healthier root system and builds organic matter in the soil, which acts as a sponge for available moisture.
Rowntree is fond of saying, “However you need to get there, get there.” Seeing the Lake City herd graze in the bucolic setting and listening to Rowntree's presentation, replete with Texas drawl, it seems like it's quite possible to achieve that sweet spot of sustainable yet optimal production.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin flew into Syria and ordered “a significant part” of Moscow's military contingent there to start withdrawing on Monday, declaring their work largely done. Putin, who polls show will be re-elected comfortably in March, made the announcement during a surprise visit to Russia's Hmeymim air base in Syria - their first since Russia intervened in the conflict. They held talks with President Bashar al-Assad and addressed Russian forces. The first leg in a three-country one-day whirlwind diplomatic visit which sees Putin also meeting their Egyptian and Turkish counterparts, Putin is keen to leverage the heightened Middle East influence that Syria has given them to cast themselves as a leader who can do diplomacy as well as military force. The Kremlin first launched air strikes in Syria in September 2015 in its biggest Middle East intervention in decades, turning the tide of the conflict in Assad's favour. Now that it regards that mission complete, Putin wants to help broker a peace deal. “In just over two years, Russia's armed forces and the Syrian army have defeated the most battle-hardened group of international terrorists,” Putin told Russian servicemen. A “significant part” of the Russian force could now return home. “The conditions for a political solution under the auspices of the United Nations have been created,” said Putin. “The Motherland awaits you.” But they made clear that Russia would retain enough firepower to destroy any possible Islamic State comeback. Syrian state television quoted Assad as thanking Putin for Russia's help, saying the blood of Moscow's “martyrs” had been mixed with the blood of the Syrian army. It also showed the two men watching what it called a victory parade with Russian troops dressed in desert uniforms marching past. Russia's main contribution has been air strikes, and with Iran-backed Shi'ite militias doing much of the fighting on the ground, the partial Russian withdrawal may not make a huge difference when it comes to the military situation. Russia's campaign, which has been extensively covered on state TV at home, has not caught the imagination of most Russians. But nor has it stirred unease of the kind the Soviet Union faced with its calamitous 1980s Afghanistan intervention. The use of private military contractors, something which has been documented by Reuters but denied by the defence ministry, has allowed Moscow to keep the public casualty toll fairly low. Officially, less than 50 Russian service personnel have been killed in the campaign, but the real number, including private contractors, is estimated to be much higher. ELECTORAL BOOST? Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses servicemen as they visit the Hmeymim air base in Latakia Province, Syria December 11, 2017. Sputnik/Mikhail Klimentyev/Sputnik via REUTERS Russia's “mission accomplished” moment in Syria may help Putin increase the turnout at the March presidential election by appealing to the patriotism of voters. Though polls show they will easily win, they also show that some Russians are increasingly apathetic about politics, and Putin's supporters are keen to get them re-elected on a big turnout, which in their eyes confers legitimacy. Putin, who with the help of state TV has dominated Russia's political landscape for the last 17 years, told Russian servicemen they would return home as victors. Speaking in front of a row of servicemen holding Russian flags, Putin said their military had proved its might and that Moscow had succeeded in keeping Syria intact as a “sovereign independent state.” Slideshow (2 Images)“I congratulate you!” Putin told the servicemen. Putin is keen to organise a special event in Russia - the Syrian Congress on National Dialogue - that Moscow hopes will bring together the Syrian government and opposition and try to hammer out a new constitution. Putin made clear however that while Russia might be drawing down much of its forces, its military presence in Syria was a permanent one and that it would retain enough firepower to destroy any Islamic State comeback. Russia will keep its Hmeymim air base in Syria's Latakia Province and its naval facility in the Syrian Mediterranean port of Tartous “on a permanent basis,” said Putin. Both bases are protected by sophisticated air defence missile systems. Putin was told by the military that it had begun withdrawing 25 aircraft, a detachment of Russian military police, a detachment of Russian special forces, a military field hospital and a de-mining centre. However, Russia has announced partial force draw-downs before only to later bring in different capabilities. “We've seen such announcements before, which turn about to be less significant than they might have initially appeared. So the details will be important - if we ever get to see them,” said one European diplomat who declined to be named. “The most significant contribution Russia can make to advancing peace in Syria is to pressure the Assad regime to engage seriously in Geneva (peace talks). Absent that, the suspicion will be that this announcement may have more to do with Russian politics than the Syrian situation.”

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2" will not be James Gunn's Marvel Cinematic Universe swan song. The filmmaker has announced they will be returning to write and direct "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3."
"In the end, my love for Rocket, Groot, Gamora, Star-Lord, Yondu, Mantis, Drax, and Nebula – and some of the other forthcoming heroes – goes deeper than you guys can possibly imagine," Gunn wrote in a Facebook post. "I feel they have more adventures to go on and things to learn about themselves and the wonderful and sometimes terrifying universe we all inhabit."
The filmmaker also explained the role this third "Guardians" film will play in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as it will take place after the events of "Avengers: Infinity War."
In addition to concluding the story of the current Guardians team, the third installment will help set up the adventures of "both old and new Marvel characters" for the next 10 years of the MCU and beyond. Gunn will be working closely with Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige to craft the story.
The announcement comes in advance of the release of "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2." Gunn, who is preparing to set off on the film's U.S. press tour, explained they wanted to share the news directly with fans.
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2" hits theaters May 5.

California Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra on Friday threatened legal action against the Trump administration over its decision to limit an Obama-era rule that requires employers to provide for contraceptives in their health plans.
The Trump decision would give an exemption to employers who object to the rule based on religious or moral grounds.
In a conference call with representatives from the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood, Becerra told reporters that the federal action unlawfully discriminates against women.
"This is just another example of the Trump administration trampling on fundamental rights,” Becerra said.
“We're prepared in California to take all action, including legal action, to defend a woman's rights against this unacceptable attack,” they added.
Massachusetts Atty. Gen. Maura Healey and organizations including the ACLU and the National Women's Law Center have also announced plans to bring legal action against the Trump administration over its decision.
MANCHESTER, England (AP) — The Football Association has started to gather evidence following reports of an incident involving the players and coaching staff of Manchester United and Manchester City near the dressing rooms after the derby match.
The FA has sought observations from both clubs and could also request CCTV footage of the incident, which took place immediately after City's 2-1 win at Old Trafford in the Premier League on Sunday.
A person with knowledge of the situation says about 15 people were involved in a melee around the doorway to the visitors' dressing room, and that City's assistant coach, Mikel Arteta, sustained a cut on their forehead.
The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss dressing-room incidents.

While some research suggests that midlife is a dissatisfying time for women, other studies show that women report feeling less stressed and enjoy a higher quality of life during this period.
So, which is it? A recent University of Michigan study by Elizabeth Hedgeman, a doctoral graduate of the U-M School of Public Health, and colleagues found that perceived stress–a measure of confidence, control and ability to cope with life's stressors–did indeed decrease for most women over a 15-year span.
The study also found that menopausal status wasn't a factor, which challenges the notion that menopause is associated with higher stress and depression.
The results come from data collected from more than 3,000 women who were recruited between the ages of 42-53 for the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation.
Hedgeman's goal was to assess the effects of age, menopausal status and sociodemographics on stress over time. They did the work while in the lab of Sioban Harlow, professor of epidemiology at the U-M School of Public Health.
By the end of the study period, the mean age was 62 and stress declined with age across nearly all sociodemographic categories. Compared to similar black, white and Chinese women, stress decreased in a more attenuated fashion for Japanese women. After adjusting for other sociodemographic variables, race and ethnicity was a significant predictor of increased stress only for Japanese women.
Women with less education and increased financial hardship consistently reported higher levels of stress compared to their peers, but this difference diminished over time.
“The results suggested that even women with less education or more financial hardship reported less perceived stress over the midlife,” Hedgeman said. “And then there's menopause.
“Our perception of stress decreased even through the menopausal transition, which suggests that menopause isn't a great bugaboo, perhaps in relation to the other events or experiences that we're having in the midlife.”
Education, employment and financial hardship were stronger predictors of perceived stress over midlife than the menopause transition, and this may suggest that women experience the menopausal transition as a series of acute stressors (hot flashes, sleep disturbances) that can be muted by chronic, socioeconomic-based life stressors.
The only groups that reported increased perceived stress over the study were Hispanic and white women from New Jersey, but Hedgeman said these are outlier results that needed to be replicated. Additionally, there were extenuating circumstances at the New Jersey site that may have contributed.
Despite reporting decreased levels of stress throughout life, women who reported higher stress at the start of midlife continued to report higher stress levels than their peers as they aged. This is important because stress is a known health risk.
The study did not specifically examine the reasons for this decrease in perceived stress, but Hedgeman said that there could be both circumstantial and neurological causes–children have moved out, professional goals are being met, or women might have hit a sweet spot before the next life challenges arise, such as chronic health conditions or aging parents.
Existing research also suggests that aging helps us regulate our emotions. “Perhaps things just don't bother us as much as we age, whether due to emotional experience or neurochemical changes. It's all worth exploring,” Hedgeman said. Overall, the findings are good news for women transitioning through midlife, they said.
“The neat thing is that for most of us, our perception of stress decreases as we age through the midlife–perhaps life itself is becoming less stressful, or maybe we're finally feeling at the top of our game, or maybe things just don't bother us the way they did,” Hedgeman said. “But whatever the root reason, we're reporting less perceived stress as we age through the midlife and menopause.”
The primary limitation of the study was the inability to understand perceived stress among women reporting the highest levels over time. Also, a disruption of operations at the New Jersey site, limited the number of visits to five, not 13 as with the other sites. Also, New Jersey was the only site that recruited Hispanic women.
If you just celebrated Easter, you might have some stale marshmallow Peeps lying around the house. And if you want to avoid eating those Peeps, they are the perfect material for a science experiment you can do in your own kitchen.
With the help of a ruler and a microwave, you can use leftover Peeps to calculate one of the constants of the universe — the speed of light.
It might sound crazy, but all will be revealed in this video from NPR's science YouTube channel, Skunk Bear. As a bonus, you'll also get to see animated Peeps illustrate the history of the search for the speed of light going back to Galileo.
The search for a stolen vehicle in Oliver containing the owner's dog has ended on a somewhat happy note.
Newspaper carrier, Hazel Ellis, was doing their run Sunday when they made a quick stop at a local gas station to drop off some papers.
An opportunistic thief jumped in Ellis's vehicle and took-off with their small dog Mia inside.
Ellis put out a public appeal through social media to be in the lookout for their stolen vehicle and dog.
An Oliver resident saw the dog Monday morning walking down main street and returned it to Ellis.
Ellis said Mia is in good health.
“It was very stressful. All my friends were calling me, even people I haven't talked to in years,” they said.
Ellis said there's been no sign of their vehicle and said it's been a rough start to the Christmas season.
“I'm so grateful that I have my dog back that's the most important thing. The rest is just stuff. And you never really realize how many friends you have and what a nice community we live in.”
ISLAMABAD, Jul 4 (APP):Secretary ministry of planning, development and reforms, Shoaib Ahmed Siddiqui Wednesday said China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has played a significant role through investment in energy and infrastructure projects, ensuring zero load shedding to industrial sector, raising employment opportunities and encouraging micro entrepreneurship contributed significantly to control unemployment.
Addressing a seminar titled “Accelerating Growth for Employment Generation” here, the secretary said the creation of productive remunerative and decent employment is key mechanism through which benefits of growth can be distributed to different segments of society.
The seminar was organized by the macroeconomic section of Planning Commission to devise strategies to harness economic growth for employment generation.
The secretary planning said employment generation offers critical link between economic growth, reduction in poverty and income inequality.
While speaking about the government's reforms and employment situation, the secretary maintained that it has launched youth development program including Youth Business Loan schemes, interest free loans schemes to vulnerables and poor, youth training schemes, and “Youth Skill Development Program” through NAVTTC (National Vocational & Technical Training Commission).
Former Governor State Bank of Pakistan, Dr Ishrat Hussain said, “we need to look at the best practices in the developing countries to compete with the globalized world and overcome our socio-economic issues”.
This would not only help in acquiring equal competencies but help us in avoiding the mistakes and take precautionary measures.
They said Pakistan has to start with the elasticities at a sub sectoral level which would help in sorting out the required policy interventions and to ensure institutional changes to accelerate the coefficience of the time.
They stated that Pakistan is blessed with a serious, dedicated and intellectual women population but unfortunately many of them either don't join institutions after acquiring education or their skills and talent remains utilized.
Equal female participation would enhance the productivity of the labour force. Secondly government will have to focus on agriculture sector. Water scarcity is also one of the major constraints and therefore the govt needs to pay serious efforts to improve the utilization and productivity of the agricultural land, labour and water; revisiting and enhancing country's agricultural policies.
Dr. Ishrat Hussain observed that inequality and growth can never go together. Government and the policymakers will have to take into account the challenge of considering employment as a part of growth strategy as well as they need to equally focus on inequality reduction strategy.
They further illuminated that besides macro-economic challenges, Pakistan also have sectoral challenges which can only be met by the continuous consultation and joining hands with the experts from private sector as well as taking on board the relevant stakeholders.
They further stated that any employment policy would be meaningless if it lacks linkages between the labour policy, education policy, industrial policy, agricultural policy and the overseas employment policy.
Saud Bangash of Pakistan Business Council, Dr. Sabur Ghayur and Joint Chief economist Rai Nasir Ali Khan also addressed on the occasion.
Senior officials of the Ministry of Planning Development and Reform and around 150 relevant stakeholders from industry and academia attended the session.
Yavatmal: Minister of State for Home Hansraj Ahir on Thursday said Pakistan is like a "chronic disease" which the government is trying to contain.
"Pakistan continues to be a chronic disease for the country (India) despite the government's sustained efforts to contain it", the minister said addressing a press conference.
Ahir said the army has been giving a befitting reply to infiltrators trying to sneak into India through the LoC.
"We have succeeded in creating a global opinion that Pakistan is the land of terrorists and the government there is sheltering the terrorists", the BJP MP said.
They were in the city as part of Narendra Modi government's mass contact programme "Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas".
The minister listed various achievements of the Modi government in the last three years.
"We have enhanced the water resources through 'Jalyukta Shivar', the flagship project of the Maharashtra government, and ensured an increase in land areas under cultivation for Kharif and Rabi crops", they said.
"We have cancelled 208 coal blocks, out of which 40 coal blocks have been re-auctioned to generate the revenue of Rs.3.94 lakh crore", Ahir said.
They said the policies of the erstwhile Congress government were responsible for the attacks by naxals on security forces and common people.

Dyson is expected to go on a rehab stint in the minors once their hand is healthy.
Banister said that right-hander Matt Bush will initially assume the closer duties.
Right-hander Keone Kela was recalled from Triple-A Round Rock.

A total of 3,000 new homes are needed in the next 10 years in Argyll and Bute to meet the demand for affordable housing.
With more than 590 people per year on the homeless list in Argyll and Bute, the council says it needs to build the new homes.
For every house within social housing stock in Argyll there are now three applicants. In order to mitigate this huge demand, Argyll and Bute Council has written its policy, Argyll and Bute's Local Housing Strategy which is now with the Scottish Government to assess.
The report reveals that in the region there are 1,672 households on the housing waiting list, with more than 5,000 houses unable to be used due to disrepair or their status as holiday homes or second homes.
In the past the local authority has tried to bring holiday homes back into use by charging a higher council tax.
The housing strategy is a five-year plan developed in partnership with social landlords Fyne Homes, West Highland Housing Association, Dunbritton Housing Association and Argyll Community Housing Association.
It is hoped that the policy will also encourage any new homes to be built to a strict series of standards – such as each new home delivering a reduction in fuel poverty, an extended life of the home and an increase in homeowners' awareness of responsibilities around their homes.

President Donald Trump (Photo: Andrew Harnik / AP)
Washington — President Donald Trump is disputing a report that they watch hours of television each day, calling it, “Another false story.”
The president is pushing back against a report in The New York Times about their first year in office that mentioned they watch at least four hours of television a day, sometimes twice that amount.
Trump says on Twitter that they “seldom, if ever,” watches CNN or MSNBC, “both of which I consider Fake News.” The president says they also never watches CNN anchor Don Lemon's show, “CNN Tonight.”
The Times said its story was based on interviews with 60 advisers, associates, friends and members of Congress.
Trump has repeatedly lodged complaints about mainstream news outlets that they argue have covered their presidency unfairly and inaccurately.

NEW YORK – A federal judge on Monday said Tiffany & Co may recover at least $19.4 million in damages from Costco Wholesale Corp over the warehouse club chain's illegal sale of counterfeit diamond engagement rings bearing the “Tiffany” name.
U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain said Tiffany deserves $11.1 million, plus interest, representing triple the lost profit from Costco‘s trademark infringement, plus the $8.25 million in punitive damages awarded by a jury last October.
The Manhattan judge also permanently barred Costco from selling anything that Tiffany did not make as “Tiffany” products, unless it uses modifiers suggesting that the products have, for example, a Tiffany “setting,” “set” or “style.”

Costco did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Tiffany had sued Costco on Valentine's Day in 2013.
While the case concerned only about 2,500 rings, Tiffany sued to protect its brand and cachet as one of the world's best-known luxury retailers.
Tiffany last month named industry veteran Alessandro Bogliolo as its new chief executive, to help arrest declines in same-store sales as millennials spend elsewhere on accessories.
Costco had argued that “Tiffany” had become a generic term, excusing its use on a standalone basis.
But the judge found Costco‘s defenses “not credible,” given evidence that displays of fine jewelry were a key part of the Issaquah, Washington-based company's marketing strategy.

Salespeople “described such rings as ‘Tiffany' rings in response to customer inquiries, and were not perturbed when customers who then realized that the rings were not actually manufactured by Tiffany expressed anger or upset,” Swain wrote.
Meanwhile, Costco‘s upper management “displayed at best a cavalier attitude toward Costco‘s use of the Tiffany name in conjunction with ring sales and marketing,” the judge added.
The jury had awarded Tiffany $5.5 million rather than $3.7 million for lost profit. Swain found the lower sum sufficient.
Leigh Harlan, Tiffany's general counsel, in a statement said the decision “sends a clear and powerful message” to anyone seeking to infringe the New York-based company's trademark.
“We brought this case because we felt a responsibility to protect the value of our customers' purchases and to ensure that Costco‘s customers were not misled,” they said.
The case is Tiffany and Co et al v. Costco Wholesale Corp, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 13-01041.

A new support shop aimed at raising awareness and funds to improve care and focus attention on a rare, life-threatening disorder has been officially opened.
The ribbon was cut on the Cure DM CIC Myotonic Dystrophy support shop in Brigg on Saturday, despite the bad weather.
Myotonic Dystrophy is a disorder which affects muscle function, with symptoms including gradually worsening muscle loss and weakness.
As well as raising funds to help research into the disorder, the shop aims to hold a range of information on it and neuromuscular conditions in general.
It has been opened by Emma-Jayne Ashley, whose 18-year-old son Dregan has Myotonic Dystrophy, and comes in addition to the work they and their family have done over the last three years with the Congenital Myotonic Dystrophy Fight Fund to raise awareness of the condition.
Emma-Jayne said: "It was snowing so the first challenge was the weather being against us but our strapline for the day was 'this disease doesn't stop and neither will we'.
"Unfortunately, a lot of people who wanted to travel couldn't make it but we still had a lot of people through the door and supporting us.
"We raised £120 on the day, which is great because it was an awareness day and we weren't expecting to raise anything.
"The Brigg Town Business Partnership also presented us with a cheque for over £400 from the Tree of Light.
"It was really positive and we had a lot of help from the local community."
Emma-Jayne said there were various ways in which the cause would benefit from having the shop, which is based in Chapel Court in the town centre.
They said: "It means we will be able to spend more time helping people and the main thinking behind it is so we have got a base for people to come to and physically see us.
"It also means when we are in the shop, we can spend that time working on what we want to do on raising awareness in the NHS.
"We are fundraising to get our community a meet-up at Butlin's in July for around 10 families so we are helping with funding to let them do that.
"The shop is helping us expand the work that we do with the fight fund. Originally, the fight fund was just for research but over the last three years, we have built a community of people who need support with the day-to-day aspects of the condition.
"We are really pleased and really proud to be trying to make a bit of a difference in raising awareness of the condition."
The shop sells a variety of items, with donations of goods encouraged to help raise more funds.
Emma-Jayne said: "We have lots to buy in the shop and we are taking donations of anything that we can resell for the charity.
"We also have a lot of information not only on Myotonic Dystrophy but the other muscular dystrophies as well.
"Also, if anyone wants to do any fundraising, we can support people with that and we have charity spaces in the Great North Run and events like that.
"That is another reason we have got the shop, to try and promote the fundraising because fundraising is very important for us."

LOS ANGELES/DENVER (Reuters) - Firefighters in Northern California have partially contained a stubborn blaze that has forced hundreds of residents to evacuate areas west of Sacramento, although dry conditions and wind gusts are hampering efforts to stop the spread, authorities said on Wednesday.
The National Weather Service said it expects wind gusts of up to 25 miles per hour (40 kph) in rural Yolo and Napa Counties, west of the state capital, where rough terrain is already complicating efforts to battle the wildfire that broke out last Saturday.
A force of almost 2,900 firefighters widened their containment lines around the so-called County Fire to 25 percent from 15 percent on Tuesday, the California Fire authority said.
Still, the wildfire continued to spread overnight, having consumed 82,700 acres (33,500 hectares) of grass, brush and dense scrub oak by Wednesday morning, up 14 percent from Tuesday, California Fire said.
While the fires have not damaged any structures so far, officials said they have ordered residents of some 1,345 homes to evacuate as a precaution since the fire began.
The United States is experiencing an unusually active fire season, with the risk considered well above normal for many western states, according to federal forecasters.
Temperatures in the area of the California blaze were expected to be in the mid 80s Fahrenheit (around 29 Celsius) on Wednesday, the National Weather Service said.
The smoke reached about 75 miles (120 km) south to San Francisco, leaving a film of ash on cars and windows. No casualties have been reported.
Wildfires have burned through nearly 2.5 million acres in the United States from Jan. 1 through Monday, well above an average of about 2.3 million for the same period over the last 10 years, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.
In Colorado, firefighters faced high temperatures, low humidity and gusty winds on Wednesday as they battled eight major blazes that have torched over 140,000 acres in the drought-stricken state.
The largest wildfire, the Spring Fire, has consumed 85,000 acres in southern Colorado, destroying more than 100 homes, forcing the evacuations of several small communities and closing a mountain-pass road. That fire was just 5 percent contained.
Jesper Joergensen, a 52-year-old Danish national, is suspected of starting the fire and is being held on first-degree arson charges, the Costilla County Sheriff's Office said.  They are in the country illegally and may face deportation, police said.

On Wednesday, jurors in the Douglas Garland triple-murder trial in Calgary will deliberate on a case that has captivated Albertans since young Nathan O'Brien and their grandparents disappeared in June 2014.
Those jurors have seen graphic photos and heard detailed testimony about what the Crown says happened to the three victims leading up to their deaths – and that can take a toll.
READ MORE: Crown asks jury to convict Douglas Garland on 3 counts of 1st-degree murder
Watch below: The Crown and defence had two very different closing statements on Monday in the Douglas Garland triple murder trial. Nancy Hixt has the details.
In 2015, Alberta was the first province to initiate a juror support program.
“As a juror, having to sit and listen to the testimony, listen to the graphic situations that are discussed, maybe even viewing photos and things like that, can be quite challenging and quite disturbing for some folks who have never had that experience,” explained Dora Newcombe, an account executive for Shepell, the organization that helped kick-start the assistance.
Free counselling can be accessed by jurors during a trial, or for up to two months after the conclusion of a case. Counsellors are available over the phone, or in person – whatever best fits the client's needs.
“There are four sessions of counselling,” Newcombe said. “But we also have a clinical process in place so if somebody is experiencing more difficulties or challenges, they definitely can access more sessions.”
“The concern is for jurors' emotional health, and offering help if they need it,” the Government of Alberta said in a statement. “The Juror Assistance and Support Program was created to help ensure that jurors who have been affected by trial evidence and what happens in the jury room can access counselling if they need to.”

Lloydminster resident Charles Sadd was chosen as part of the jury for a week-long murder trial in Peace River in 2011.
At 24-years-old, they were nervous about the entire process, but especially about what they might see.
“What kind of pictures was I going to be looking at? Were the pictures going to be very graphic? Was I going to see a lot of bruises? Was I going to see a lot of blood?” they remembered asking himself.

At one point in the trial, they had to look over pictures of the victim at the crime scene. They said that was the most challenging part.
“I did feel a little bit sick to my stomach at first,” they said.
Even after the trial was over, those images didn't disappear from their memory right away.
“I did think about those pictures, but as time elapsed over the years, I hardly think of it. But I do remember the case since day one.”
Sadd said he's happy to hear free counselling is available, especially for jurors involved in longer cases like the Garland trial.
“That would've been great. I didn't need one at the time but in a case like this – that's going to last three weeks or a month – this would have been perfect,” they said.
Jurors can access four counselling sessions for free – up to two months after a trial is over. If more is needed, can be extended. #yeg #yyc pic.twitter.com/cKkYLbqEsU — Sarah Kraus Global (@SarahNKraus) February 15, 2017
The juror support program was modelled after something similar already in place through Shapelle for Alberta judges.
Newcombe said jurors can experience post-trauma symptoms.
“Having trouble sleeping, sometimes they might have stomach challenges or nausea, it could be even muscle tension,” they said.
Newcombe said other indicators that might mean a juror is having a tough time coping with all the graphic information include forgetting things or having emotional reactions.
Sometimes, they said jurors might even need to talk about their personal situation instead of the case.
“People are hearing the testimony day in and day out while they're serving on the jury. That's the nature of the trial, but that can take a toll. And then also, maybe being separated from your social network, your family.”
Over the last year and a half, a few dozen jurors have taken advantage of the counselling. The numbers have steadily been increasing over time and Newcombe expects that trend to continue with high-profile cases like the Garland trial. Still, they say a stigma exists around asking for help and that's a barrier they want to break down.
Newcombe said counselling can help, just having someone to talk to about how jurors are feeling.
“It is normal, especially with what you've been through.”
All jurors in Alberta are eligible for the supports, regardless of the type of trial they are part of.
Since 2015, Ontario has also set up a helpline for jurors.
The city of San Francisco on Monday filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration that alleges federal threats to withhold grants from “sanctuary cities” aren't allowed by law and violate the rights of city residents.
San Francisco City Atty. Dennis Herrera is seeking a federal injunction to prevent the federal government from imposing new grant-funding conditions on cities. Such conditions would require them to help federal immigration officials in the detention and transfer of people in the country illegally.
“These conditions do not appear in any federal statute, and they do not reflect the will of Congress in appropriating funds…” the lawsuit says. “To the contrary, the new conditions are simply the latest attempt by the Trump Administration to coerce state and local jurisdictions into carrying out the federal government's immigration enforcement priorities."
The suit was filed against U.S. Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions and the U.S. Department of Justice.
Federal grants to the city would be jeopardized under threats from Sessions to withhold federal law enforcement grants from cities if they do not certify their laws comply with federal requirements.
State Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra was expected to attend a news conference announcing the lawsuit with Herrera.
Police in Kenya fired tear gas on Friday at crowds of opposition supporters marching in three main cities ahead of a tense presidential election re-run.
Opposition leader Raila Odinga has called for biweekly protests to pressure the government to overhaul the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) ahead of the vote scheduled for October 26.
Leaders of the opposition National Super Alliance (NASA) coalition say the election commission, in its present form, should be barred from managing the re-run vote after the Supreme Court annulled the original August poll, citing widespread "illegalities and irregularities".
In the opposition stronghold Kisumu in western Kenya, thousands of protesters were dispersed with tear gas after they tried to storm the election body's local offices.
Elsewhere in the city, a supermarket was looted and set on fire.
In the capital Nairobi, protests failed to gather momentum, but small numbers of supporters were tear gassed anyway.
"I will not allow anyone to cause chaos. If people are demonstrating peacefully, they are protected by the law, but the moment they turn chaotic we will deal with them," Nairobi police commander Japheth Koome said.
Odinga has threatened to boycott the re-run if the election body is not overhauled and senior officials sacked, but so far their demands have been ignored.
President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Party, which has a majority in parliament, has ruled out any major shake-up of the IEBC.
Instead, it wants to push through changes to the electoral law that critics say will simply legalise some of the faults cited by the Supreme Court. DM

The largest contingent of Marvel superheroes assembled Monday night in Hollywood for the world premiere of “Avengers: Infinity War,” coming together to celebrate the studio's most ambitious film to date.
Chadwick Boseman, fresh off “Black Panther,” Avengers stalwarts, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson and Mark Ruffalo, and newer Marvel entrants Tom Holland and Evangeline Lilly, who will portray the Wasp in this summer's “Ant-Man and the Wasp,” were among the superheroes in attendance.
The long list of stars who walked the carpet to meet fans, catch up with fellow cast members and answer questions from reporters delayed the start of the screening by nearly an hour, but no one seemed to mind.
The premiere was among Disney's most heavily-guarded and secured event in recent memory, with a large perimeter surrounding Hollywood Boulevard, which was closed in front of the Hollywood and Highland center. Attendees were able to see the film was on three different screens, including one in the Dolby Theater.
The purple carpet stretched almost the entire block and featured costumes and other memorabilia from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Fans also did their best cosplays, coming dressed up like Super-Man, Dr. Strange and Black Widow, among others.

Ten years in the making, the 2-hour-40-minute feature brings together almost all of the characters introduced in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Avengers and their allies team up to try to defeat Thanos (Josh Brolin) from their reign of devastation that threatens the entire universe.
Plot details were kept under tight wraps, with stars and writers careful not to reveal any spoilers. “Avengers: Infinity War” writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely said they only followed the natural progression of the story.
“We do the whatever the story demands and nothing the story demands,” Markus said. “ If something happens to a character you like, it will feel justified because the story will have built to the point – no one gets a get-out-of-jail-free-card so if they get stuck in a position where they can't get out of jail, they won't get out of jail.”
Brolin also failed to divulge who Thanos may have killed. “Maybe them all. Maybe this is it,” they said, adding that Thanos “the biggest, baddest most overwhelming character that they've had yet.”
Monday premiere was as much a celebration of “Infinity War,” as it was for a big milestone for Marvel Studios, which first released “Iron Man” a decade ago. The Downey Jr. starring “Iron Man” kicked off the expansive and ever-growing Marvel Cinematic Universe that now includes a number of new fan favorites, like Black Panther, Dr. Strange and the motley Guardians of the Galaxy crew.
Downey Jr. seemed to be channeling their Marvel character, Tony Stark, during a brief speech before the screening inside the Dolby Theater. As they described how “Iron Man” laid down the foundation for the expanding MCU, they attempted humility before deadpanning, “Screw it, you're welcome.”
“Infinity: War,” they said, was a team effort of all the Avengers and their allies. “We're all competing for each other for you,” they said.
“Avengers: Infinity War” is directed by brothers Anthony and Joe Russo, produced by Kevin Feige. Louis D'Esposito, Victoria Alonso, Michael Grillo, Trinh Tran, Jon Favreau, James Gunn and Stan Lee are executive producers.
The films bow April 27.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders had a contentious exchange with reporters on Monday as they defended President Donald Trump's latest attacks on news outlets that have had to backtrack on several breaking news stories.
Sanders said that there's “a very big difference between making honest mistakes and purposefully misleading the American people, something that happens regularly.”
They were asked for examples of a news outlet that was intentionally spreading false information, and they cited the example of Brian Ross of ABC News.
As news was breaking about former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's indictment, Ross reported that Flynn was ready to cooperate with Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller and testify that Trump, during the campaign, instructed them to speak to the Russians. ABC News then clarified the report, noting that Trump as a candidate asked Flynn to find ways to repair relations with the Russians. That is a far different meaning, and Ross was suspended.
But Trump has railed against the mistake, and even cited it at a campaign rally in Florida on Friday.

Sanders, in accusing media outlets of “purposefully putting out information” they knew to be false, did not cite evidence that it was so in Ross' case.
They also criticized the media for “taking information that hasn't been validated, that hasn't been offered any credibility and that has been continually denied by a number of people, including people with direct knowledge of the incident.”
Over the weekend, Trump criticized Washington Post reporter David Weigel by name and called for the paper to fire them after Weigel tweeted out a picture of an almost empty arena, with the comment “Packed to the rafters.” It was a comment on Trump's Florida speech. In fact, other photos showed the arena filled up.
Weigel apologized and removed the tweet, but Trump has continued to attack him.
Trump wrote on Sunday, “Very little discussion of all the purposely false and defamatory stories put out this week by the Fake News Media. They are out of control – correct reporting means nothing to them. Major lies written, then forced to be withdrawn after they are exposed…a stain on America!”
Trump, though, has been called out for misleading claims and falsehoods and not correcting them when they are made.
SRINAGAR - Hundreds of students clashed with government forces in Indian Held Kashmir during protests Monday against a police raid on a college, as tensions ran high in the restive region.
Around 100 students were injured as police used batons and tear gas to try to quell the protests, which broke out in the main city of Srinagar before spreading to other parts of the Kashmir valley.
Teenagers in school uniform and women students wearing white headscarves were among the protesters, who chanted anti-India slogans and threw stones at government forces.
A student union had called for protests after police on Saturday tried to raid a college in the southern district of Pulwama to round up suspects in recent violent demonstrations, sparking clashes in which at least 60 students were injured.
"Students are protesting in a few colleges. We are dealing with a situation," a senior police office told AFP on condition of anonymity.
Indian-held Kashmir has been tense since April 9, when eight people were killed by police and paramilitary troops during election day violence.
On Saturday a street vendor was shot dead by India's Border Security Force and on Sunday three people were killed by suspected freedom fighters, one a former counter-insurgent.
The Kashmir University Students Union, a banned student body, had called for protests in all colleges and universities following Saturday's incident.
Government forces are not supposed to enter college or university premises without special permission, and on Saturday, the union said the police action was designed to help the state "rule by repression and fear".
Reuters adds: The freedom fighters have stepped up attacks in contested Indian-ruled Kashmir, including raids on the homes of police officers, amid a spike in violence after the army allegedly tied a man to the front of a jeep as a human shield.
Police have filed a case against an army unit after soldiers in the Himalayan region were accused of seizing a 24-year old shawl weaver on April 9, before strapping them to the front of their vehicle and parading them through villages.
A video of the episode widely circulated on social media exemplifies for many viewers the human rights abuses allegedly committed by Indian security forces battling to contain a separatist insurgency now in its 28th year.
Army spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Rajesh Kalia said the video's authenticity was being ascertained, adding, "Action will be taken against those found guilty of misconduct."
Over the weekend two more videos circulated on social media showing workers of the ruling political party in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir renouncing mainstream politics, one of them beside a man wielding a gun.
Another video, allegedly showing the killing of a 17-year old by paramilitary officers during the April 9 by-election, has also stirred anger. Reuters could not confirm the veracity of the videos.
Soldiers picked up the shawl weaver, Farooq Ahmad Dar, near the home of a relative after they voted, they told media. "Look at the fate of the stone-pelter," a soldier is heard saying over a loudspeaker in the video while Dar is tied to the vehicle.
"This is a phenomenon that has been going on for the last 27 years," Khurram Parvez, a leading Kashmiri human rights activist jailed last year, told Reuters.
"This is not the first human shield case. What is different now is that this case has been documented, thanks to social media."
Dar's treatment was "unlawful and unacceptable" rights group Amnesty International said in a statement.
Police have registered a case against the local army unit, state chief minister Mehbooba Mufti said, urging security forces to exercise restraint.
The state's police chief on Sunday told officers to avoid visiting their own homes in South Kashmir, after militants stormed the houses of at least four officers. Freedom fighters also shot dead a lawyer affiliated with an opposition party and a former counter-insurgency commander, police said. A worker of the ruling party was killed late on Saturday.
Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since the end of British rule in 1947. Both claim the territory in its entirety.
Armed encounters between freedom seekers fighting Indian rule and government forces have become more frequent since the killing of a popular rebel leader by security forces last July sparked widespread unrest.
Police and army officials say dozens of local youths have joined the freedom fighters ranks since then.
My America is not perfect.
I'm not perfect either.
But the both of us
Are hardworking,
Willing to learn,
Charitable.
We both have strengths immeasurable
And
Weaknesses we are willing to address.
For all of the good deeds in our histories,
We both have failings as well.
We have both taken chances,
And we have both given chances.
We have forgiven others,
And have asked forgiveness for our own transgressions.
Our worlds are composed of differences and diversity,
There are things that bring us together,
And things that threaten to tear us asunder.
We know both beauty and horror.
We have known great courage in those who have fought for us
And for others.
We have known great loss and sacrifice for us
And for others.
We know voices who have stood up against oppression,
We know silence and fear.
We both desire
To persevere to a higher standard of ourselves.
No matter what I do,
No matter what my country does,
We both know the truth
Of not being able to please everyone.
I am loved
And
I am hated
Me,
And my America.
To all of my friends world wide, whatever your politics, whatever your beliefs, I wish you a safe 4th of July.

Orange County School Board Chairman Bill Sublette says the board is being cautious about entering into a lawsuit over the state's new education law.
“From what I heard from the board table last Tuesday night, I believe pretty clearly that our board supports joining in,” said Sublette. “I think the issue is one of timing, one of risk exposure, and cost.”
The school board will engage in its first in-depth conversation about joining the lawsuit at a workshop Tuesday evening.
A handful of school districts, including Volusia, have pledged to join a legal challenge to the law, saying it violates the state's constitution.
Amongst other things, the law requires sharing tax dollars with charter schools for construction and maintenance. This would put a financial strain on a district that opened six new schools this year and will open 15 more in the coming decade, they said.
The board is also concerned with a provision that takes the authority away from local school boards to negotiate contracts with charter schools.
“Which is important to our board because we have put into our contracts in the last six years minimum performance standards that we expect to all our schools, including our neighborhood schools,” said Sublette.
Supporters of the law say it gives students more access to high-performing charter schools.
The Orange County School Board workshop is Tuesday at 4:30 pm at the Ronald Blocker Educational Leadership Center at 445 W Amelia Street, Orlando.

Before sentencing the notorious pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli to seven years in prison, the federal judge presiding over their criminal trial ordered them to turn over [a music album] of which only a single copy exists. Shkreli paid $2 million for the album, an extravagance they could afford after making a fortune by jacking up the prices of prescription medications.
Seizing the album and other assets worth a total of $7.4 million may seem like karma, but it will do nothing to tame drug costs. Indeed, it is entirely legal to raise generic drug prices (which explains why Shkreli was convicted of securities fraud, not health care fraud).
The problem is that government has made it far too easy for pharma companies to gain a national monopoly on the supply of drugs that no longer are patent-protected. Rather than make an example of Shkreli, the solution to outrageous drug prices is to embrace globalization.
Shkreli first used supply-control tactics at a company called Retrophin, where they raised the price of Thiola, a drug used to treat kidney stones, from $1.50 per pill to $30. They did it again at Turing Pharmaceuticals, where they increased the price of Daraprim, a 62-year-old treatment for a parasitic infection, from $13.50 a pill to $750.
Economic theory says that such behavior should attract competitors to the market, which would keep prices in check. But in practice, that's not what's going on. According to a 2016 report by the Government Accountability Office that studied 1,441 established generic drugs from 2010 to 2015, 315 saw price increases of 100 percent or more, and some prices rose 500 percent or more.
Collusion between drug companies explains some of these price increases. In these cases, it's up to the U.S. antitrust authorities to protect consumers. But leaving collusion aside, Shkreli and their “pharma bro” ilk avoid competitors in part because of the costly and time-consuming process of obtaining approval from the FDA to manufacture and distribute generic drugs. If the market is small enough, potential competitors may not think it worth the effort.
To fix this problem, Congress should allow companies that have been approved to sell drugs in other developed countries to export those same drugs to the U.S. Many first-world countries have strong regulatory structures and are devoted to protecting their citizens from harmful products; the FDA should grant automatic approvals to companies that satisfy the standards in those countries. Competition doesn't always bring drug prices down as much as one might hope, but it is still the best remedy for price gouging.
Consider Deflazacort, a drug treatment for a form of muscular dystrophy. It has long been available as a generic in Europe, where it costs about $1,200 a year. But it wasn't legally available in the U.S. until 2017, when the FDA approved Marathon Pharmaceuticals' application to sell Deflazacort here. Marathon's chief executive, Jeffrey Aronin, announced that it would charge $89,000 for a year's supply. Marathon ultimately backed down after public outcry — but it never could have gouged American patients if the companies that market Deflazacort in Europe were free to sell it here.
Legislation that would grant reciprocal drug and device approvals with other countries has been introduced in Congress repeatedly, with support from both parties. To date, these bills have gone nowhere. But President Donald Trump has pledged to bring drug prices down, and Alex Azar, the new secretary of health and human services, is advocating major changes to make healthcare more affordable. Drug approval reciprocity belongs at the top of the list.
Until that happens, what can consumers do to protect themselves from price gouging? Although U.S. law prohibits importing prescription drugs, tens of millions of Americans have saved billions of dollars by doing so. They bring drugs home from trips to Mexico and Canada, and they order them online from pharmacies abroad. These practices already are too widespread for customs agents to police. As more people follow suit, the likelihood of a federal crackdown will become even more remote. Congress, sensing the futility of trying to stem the tide, finally may move forward with legislation authorizing automatic reciprocal approvals.
Then, instead of having to shop abroad, Americans will find less expensive drugs — from manufacturers that sell in Europe, Australia and other countries with standards like our own — at their local drugstore. And that's when the pharma bros' stranglehold on drug prices will finally be broken.

Apple Inc has asked India to defer a planned increase in import taxes on mobile phone parts so it can expand its iPhone manufacturing in the country, but the government is unlikely to accede, people familiar with the matter said.
The US technology giant has been in talks with Indian officials for months, seeking “pre-requisites”, government tax breaks and incentives, for expanding its operations in one of the world's fastest-growing smartphone markets.
During those talks, Apple has conveyed it wants India to defer an existing policy that plans to levy taxes on more imported mobile components in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's “Make in India” drive to boost domestic manufacturing.
While India's government has been keen to get Apple to manufacture in India as a showpiece investment, it has told the US firm there would be no policy exemptions, so there will be no tax breaks on parts imports, the people said.
“Apple wants duty-free imports of components. India wants indigenisation,” said one person with direct knowledge of the talks.
Apple has expressed willingness to increase local value addition over time, but has stuck to its demand for immediate import tax relief to expand its iPhone manufacturing, the person added.
Apple declined to comment, and there was no response from either Modi's office or the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, which is trying to help build an electronics manufacturing base.
No special treatment
The disagreement could be a stumbling block, and risks delaying Apple's plans to penetrate the Indian market, where it currently just assembles its iPhone SE model.
Despite a boom in smartphone sales in India, Apple's market share is only around 2 percent.
Apple has demanded the tax relief as India still lacks an ideal ecosystem for parts makers to thrive. Counterpoint Research data shows that while more than three-quarters of smartphones sold in India are made locally, about 90 percent of the $14 billion worth of mobile components are imported.
To change that scenario, India imposes a 10 percent tax on imported components such as batteries, chargers, and headsets.
Under a “phased manufacturing programme” (PMP), the government plans to extend the taxes to more components as a way of nudging parts makers to switch to more local production.
“It's been a chicken-and-egg problem for component suppliers whether to set up manufacturing operations in India,” said Neil Shah, a director at Counterpoint. “Apple and its partners will eventually have to comply, otherwise Apple will always price its products at a premium.”
A previously unreported note prepared by India's IT ministry assessing Apple's demands showed the company sought an exemption from PMP, which the ministry said: “may not be feasible”.
Some of Apple's other demands, including capital equipment incentives as well as allowing importing and then exporting phones after repairs, would require policy changes, according to the note.
While the government has publicly said it is still considering Apple's demands, the people familiar with the talks said it has made clear it won't make any special concessions.
“We have told them, please come and invest but we cannot do things that go beyond our policies. We cannot do things only for you,” said one senior government official with direct knowledge of the matter. “They are coming around (to our view).”
Apple has said it would be able to create 5,000-10,000 jobs in India as and when it expands there, the official said.

A member of Thames Centre council is pushing for the Thames Valley District School Board to get on board with a policy for defibrillators.
A student at West Nissouri Public School fundraised to buy the lifesaving equipment after another child from the area died in a soccer game.
The board has declined to install the machine, however, with a post on the school's Facebook page stating that an upcoming Home and School meeting will address acquiring a board-approved device and arranging for training.
Kelly Elliot is a councillor for Thames Centre and their children go to West Nissouri.
They tell AM980 the TVDSB should look at its counterparts across the province.
“The Thames Valley District School Board is the only school board in all of Ontario that doesn't have a policy or doesn't have AEDs in every school,” they said. “The London District Catholic School Board, they have an AED in every single school that's maintained by Middlesex County EMS and it's easy enough for the Thames Valley District School Board to do it as well.”
Elliot said despite having everything prepared, the board is still pushing back.
“We've already raised the funds for the AED, we had a parent stand up to donate $2,000 to cover any ongoing maintenance costs, which there isn't, because again, Middlesex County EMS covers it. So we've jumped through all their hoops, we've done everything they want us to do.”
So far, the board has declined to comment.

KARACHI - The season of switching political affiliation continued as different parties' local leadership and workers were changing loyalties ahead of upcoming general election scheduled to be hold on July 25.
The local leaders who seem annoyed with the their party leadership were witnessed joining other political forces, moreover many who were known for changing loyalties were also in motion seeking greener pasture.
It is for the first time, the Karachi‘s political turf is witnessing such a massive changing of affiliation by the political workers.
Muttahida Quami Movement-Pakistan that marked victory frequently in general election and local government polls after split facing organisational smash up while it has also left workers confused in a crisis situation. Earlier, the leaders of MQM jumped into the newly formed party of former Mayor Karachi Mustafa Kamal while some joined the former provincial ruling Pakistan People Party (PPP). Recognising the uncertainty many of MQM workers followed their leaders stance and joined PSP.
Furthermore, PTI also faced backlash at the time of distribution of party tickets on Karachi constituencies however interestingly PTI achieved to catch some of MQM activists having expertise to run election campaign. Similarly Mohajir Quami Movement-Haqqiqi also received the dent as many of its key workers in locality of Korangi ending their journey with party joined PPP.
In the recent way of switching loyalties, Afazal Koti a local leader of Malir affiliated with Mohajir Quami Movement-Haqqiqi along with their followers joined Muttahida Quami Movement-Pakistan whereas Zulfiqar aka Zulfi from the locality of Gulistan-e-Joher after quitting Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) joined All Pakistan Muslim League (APML) along with their supported team of workers.
Moreover, another performance was seen in PSP chairperson Mustafa Kamal presser on Monday when they made the announcement that hundreds of workers affiliated with various political parties joined their party. Kamal informed that PTI leader Dua Zuabir, Political worker Syed Zameerul Hassan Rizvi, APML Rashid Baig, Azam Hamza, Rahim Rizvi, Adeel Sandeep Kumar, Owais Kamal, PML-Q Syed Jafferul Hassan Poori and other along with their team has joined PSP. And it is good sign that about 80 political workers for the locality of Lyari, 96 MQM workers, one from Jamaat-e-Islami and one from Awami National Party has joined PSP.
Meanwhile, commenting on the matter of switching of party affiliation, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Karachi Chapter leader Subhan Ali Shail who had resigned from District President slot few weeks ago told The Nation that disregarding merit had panicked political workers present in PTI ranks. They said that panel that was emerged in the party over the unfair distribution of party tickets of upcoming general election is still loyal with Imran Khan but they have been forced to stay home due to the presence of group which responsible for the injustice with the workers.
They further said that since long the workers worked for the party following its ideology but unfortunately at the time of election they were surprised to witnessed supremacy of anti-ideological elements present in the party ranks.
To a question about PTI workers changing affiliations a head of polls, Shail said that large numbers of workers still stands with Imran Khan‘s ideology but some of the passionate category of workers mostly youth had switched their loyalties expressing annoyance over PTI decisions. It is pertinent to mention here that at the time of election the changing of affiliation across the country has remained a normal practice but for the first time massive switching of political parties is being witnessed in Karachi. Political analyst responding matter said Karachi politico's neighborhood is witnessing political vacuum after destruction of MQM while the political workers has left with no choice except change of loyalties while many has also preferred to stay home due to the uncertainty.
Lahore: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has questioned the BCCI's proposed FTP structure for the 2019-2023 cycle, which does not feature Indo-Pak bilateral series.
The BCCI has maintained its stance that unless the Government of India gives clearance, no bilateral series (home or away) will be possible.
India has also not kept Pakistan amongst its six proposed opponents for the World Test Championship beginning in 2019.
PCB made it clear to the ICC that if it gets a favourable verdict in the Dispute Resolution Process that it has initiated against the BCCI, it will object to the current FTP structure.
"Since the onset of these discussions, PCB has reiterated its position on bilateral series vs India. Our position is that PCB's agreement to the revised structures for international cricket is subject to the condition that PCB has a valid agreement to play bilateral matches with India and India vs Pakistan matches would be included in the FTP. This continues to be our position," a PCB release stated.
The BCCI had signed a MoU in 2014 which had six home and away series during the 2015-2023 cycle.
Due to the prevailing political climate, BCCI made it clear that it won't be playing Pakistan in a bilateral series.
"PCB has also informed the ICC that it has initiated a dispute resolution process against the BCCI under the ICC Dispute Resolution Committee Terms of Reference.
"Further to that the PCB's claim is based on an existing agreement with the BCCI which contemplates that India will tour Pakistan in December 2019, August 2020 and NovDec 2022 and Pakistan will tour India in NovDec 2021," the release claimed.
It concluded by stating that the PCB will object to the new FTP if it gets a favourable verdict.
"Under the prevailing circumstances, it is PCB's position that if the Dispute Resolution Committee decides the dispute in PCB's favour then any FTP will need to be adjusted to reflect the decision.
"Any agreement of the PCB to any new FTP structure will therefore be without prejudice to its existing claims against BCCI and will be subject to the outcome of the ICC dispute resolution process."
A reliable source in the PCB said Pakistan would also be taking up the issue of the BCCI not willing to host the Asia Cup next year in September due to Pakistan's participation.
"Yes a change of venue for the Asia Cup is going to be discussed at the next meeting of the Asian Cricket Council later this month," they said.

Chennai: DMK leader MK Stalin on Monday said that they would lead a protest demonstration outside the collectorate in Chennai against the AIADMK state government's "inaction" in rescuing fishermen from Kanyakumari caught on the sea due to Cyclone Ockhi.
In a statement issued in Chennai, Stalin, seeking the rescue of fishermen caught on the sea due to Ockhi, carrying out restoration work in Kanyakumari district and providing compensation to those affected by the cyclone, said a demonstration would be held on Tuesday by the party's fishermen wing to press for the demands.
The demonstration would be held outside the collectorate in Chennai. Stalin also complained that different authorities are giving different statistics as to the number of missing fishermen.
They said Kanyakumari district collector Sajjansingh R Chavan has said 623 fishermen from the district are missing whereas Chief Secretary Girija Vaidyanathan has put their number at 197, while Chief Minister K Palaniswami is saying 260 fishermen are missing.
Stalin termed it as a shame on the part of the state government not having a correct number of the missing fishermen even nearly two weeks after Ockhi hit Kanyakumari.
The DMK leader also said the government does not have any count of the number of fishermen who were pushed to the shores in other states by the strong winds when the cyclone hit.
FTO secretariat holds awareness workshop
PESHAWAR (PR): Federal Tax Ombudsman (FTO) has organised an awareness workshop on ‘Public Awareness and Advocacy about Dispute Resolution Mechanism of Federal Tax Ombudsman' for medium and small scale enterprises here at a local hotel. Advisor Implementation & Monitoring M Siddique shed light on the historical perspective of the ombudsman office. “At present, there are 150 ombudsman offices in the world. In Pakistan, the ombudsman office was established in 1983 and in year 2000, an independent office of Federal Tax Ombudsman was established.”
They also elaborated the complaint filing procedure and other available facilities provided by the FTO office to aggrieved taxpayers. “The mandate of FTO office is to ensure prompt and inexpensive redress of taxpayers' genuine grievances against maladministration by the tax employees of Federal Board of Revenue (FBR)/Revenue Division, government of Pakistan.” They said an average 1500 complaints annually were currently being handled by the FTO offices across Pakistan.
They said the services of FTO offices were free of cost, citizens friendly and the complaints were decided in 60 days. “Form-A is available on the website (www.fto.gov.pk) of the FTO on which tax-payers can lodge their complaints. The form can also be obtained from the FTO offices, besides its Islamabad secretariat, located in Lahore, Karachi, Quetta, Peshawar, Sukkur, Abbottabad, Multan and Faisalabad.”
The traders gave useful feedback to the FTO team comprising senior advisor Khalid Masood, advisors M Siddique and Kazim Hussain. Central Tanzeem-e-Taajran KP president Sharafat Ali Mubarak, provincial secretary Shaukat Ali Khan, senior vice president Nisarullah Khan and others also addressed the event.
The session was moderated by FTO Secretariat, Islamabad media manager Ali Nasir.
When Roseanne Barr tweeted Tuesday morning that former Obama administration adviser Valerie Jarrett is the product of “the Muslim Brotherhood + Planet of the Apes,” they finally found the edge of offensive behavior that ABC decided it couldn't tolerate, even for a show drawing 18 million-plus viewers a week.
“Roseanne's Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values,” said ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey, “and we have decided to cancel their show.”
It's a strong, unequivocal statement that makes it clear that ABC doesn't want to reward outright racism. It was a commendable decision that will cost the network advertising dollars and visibility as its most-watched comedy series in years was destroyed in a matter of minutes. But it is still a shame that it took so long for the network to find that line when Barr had been spewing hate for years before ABC gave the “Roseanne” revival a green light.
Barr's history of spreading conspiracy theories and sneering at anyone who dared question them is long and omnipresent. Before and after ABC picked up the revival, they tweeted aggressively in a way that made it clear she's not merely an angry conservative railing at what they see as wrong with American politics and culture. She's tweeted wholly unfounded theories involving a string of recent phantom controversies fueled by social media but proven to be utterly false. Pizzagate, Seth Rich, Spygate, QANON, President Trump breaking up sex trafficking rings worldwide, and on, and on, and on. Just Tuesday morning, they claimed Chelsea Clinton is married to George Soros' nephew, and when corrected, claimed Soros was a Nazi sympathizer who sent Jewish people to die. They have called Islam a “pedo culture,” and in a racist statement that feels reminiscent of Tuesday's disaster, said Susan Rice, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and an African-American, has “swinging ape balls.”

Barr's embrace of this kind of ugly hatred isn't new. ABC's rejection of it, however, is.
For months, ABC has insisted that Barr's behavior offscreen shouldn't affect viewers' opinions of “Roseanne” onscreen. When it was revealed that Roseanne Conner would be a Trump supporter in 2018, the cast and creative team alike emphasized that Barr was Barr, and “Roseanne” was “Roseanne.” The initial publicity blast was all about the value of bringing “different viewpoints” together, hashing things out, and speaking frankly about “hot button issues.”
As star and co-producer Sara Gilbert insisted at January's Television Critics Association press tour, they saw “Roseanne” as “a great opportunity to have a family that can be divided by politics, but still is filled with love.” And when Barr eventually ended that session by stating that “a large part of why I could not vote for Hillary Clinton is because Haiti,” ABC PR chief Jori Arancio quickly cut in to insist they were “out of time.”
That the show's star had become a rabid conspiracy theorist who used their platform to push baseless rumors was brushed off like a mere annoyance, like Barr was an embarrassing grandma the network tolerated with an affectionate eye roll because hey, she's family. That they had previously made racist statements like the one they made Tuesday was straight-up ignored.
The inconvenient truth of the matter is that while the Jarrett insult was particularly awful, it wasn't a particularly unusual statement for Barr to make. It was, despite their apology that they “should have known better,” exactly in line with the persona Barr themselves has cultivated — one ABC had to be aware of when it decided to get back in business with them
In that respect, one of the most frustrating things about how ABC and Barr's conservative supporters – including President Trump – talked about them when the show became a success is that they kept conflating Barr themselves with the character they were playing. When ABC's cancellation decision is inevitably hurled by extremist Trump supporters as another sign that the liberal media is silencing conservative voices, it will be a fallacy. Barr isn't the working class hero they portrayed on TV, but a rich celebrity who tweets bile to millions when they get bored. Pointing out as much isn't denigrating conservatives or the working class, but the people like Barr who have seized upon spreading discontent to pump poison into the country's veins.
ABC taking a clear stand against Barr's racism and the fact that they blasted it after drafting off the success of the show ­is the right thing to do. But if the network was truly worried about Barr sullying its “values,” it wouldn't have given them such an elevated platform in the first place.

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley tried to reassure bigwigs in the energy industry Wednesday that their government will strive to ensure the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion gets built despite political opposition in British Columbia.
Speaking at the Global Petroleum Show in Calgary, Notley said the Alberta NDP government has little time for conversations that seek to shut down the oilsands and threaten jobs in their province.
“An effective climate plan has to pay attention to working people,” said Notley.
“Families that are out of work and stressed about how the mortgage is going to get paid do not have a heck of a lot of time for climate change action.”
Them comments come as the B.C. NDP, supported by an alliance with the Green party, moves closer to potentially forming government and bringing to a halt Kinder Morgan's pipeline expansion project with whatever means it has available.
Both parties have opposed the pipeline over concerns of potential oil spills in the ocean and along the route, as well as the higher environmental footprint of oilsands crude.

After their speech, Notley said it is too early to speculate what tactics the B.C. NDP and Greens could employ to stop the project.
West Coast Environmental Law, however, released a brief Wednesday outlining potential measures, including requiring free, prior and informed consent from First Nations for the project, prohibiting any provincial approvals or permits, and adding further processes and conditions related to matters within provincial jurisdiction.
READ MORE: BC NDP and Greens to push legal challenge of Trans Mountain pipeline
Notley spoke with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on June 2, where they said they once again assured them that the federal government is committed to moving forward with the pipeline.
The Trans Mountain pipeline has become a wedge issue in NDP politics in Canada, pitting the Alberta and B.C. parties against each other as well as a becoming a lightning rod issue in the federal NDP leadership race.
Notley said the project entirely falls within their party's values.
“I believe it is absolutely, fully within the wheelhouse of the NDP to focus on job preservation and job creation, always, as we work on the environment.
“To do one without the other puts both in peril.”

Notley's remarks came shortly after Paul Fulton, president of the Canadian division of Norway's Statoil, said that while there will be growth in demand in the near term, some oil will have to stay in the ground if any climate goals are to be met.
“There is no doubt that there will be stranded assets,” they said. “We will not produce all of the oil and gas that we have discovered today.”

When Al Munzer went to their first gay pride street event in Washington 36 years ago, they hung back at first.
“I was actually looking from the sidewalk,” Munzer said. “I was afraid to participate. That's before I came out. And since then it's been part of my life.”
Munzer and their husband, Joel Wind, were among the 350 people who attended Friday's National Pride Shabbat at Sixth & I Historic Synagogue.
It was a rainbow-studded event, including a reception, prayer service and dinner. Guests ate multi-colored vegetables with green hummus as appetizers and rainbow-colored challah at dinner. They wore rainbow-hued kippot, and they closed the service by singing “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” in Yiddish.
With Pride Shabbat coming the night before Washington's Capital Pride Parade, Munzer said they enjoy being able to express their gay identity.
But they admitted to being a bit nostalgic for earlier pride festivals, which were more intimate and less commercial.
“The first pride festivals were small. They took place [in Rock Creek Park] and Bet Mishpachah [a congregation for LGBT Jews] would sell Dr. Brown's cream soda and kugel,” they said. “So it's been highly commercialized. It should go back to being a street festival.”
Bet Mishpachah sponsored Friday's event, along with GLOE, the LGBTQ outreach program at the Edlavitch DC Jewish Community Center.
Still, Wind said that pride events are important for showing solidarity and sending a message that LGBT rights still have a long way to go in the United States, despite the progress that has been made in the last 30 years.
“I grew up with, ‘Oh, you're a fag. You're a faggot,'” Wind said. “I don't want to go back to hiding in the closet and not wearing my rainbow kippah. So I'm hoping for the best.”
Pride Shabbat came a year after Omar Mateen shot and killed 49 people in a gay nightclub in Orlando. During the service, Rabbi Shira Stutman read a few of the victims' names in memory of the shooting.
The Orlando shooting has given the LGBT community pause, said Josef Palermo, the director of GLOE.
“The shooting is so connected to pride now,” they said. “We can certainly celebrate how far we've come, but we need to also remember the fallen among us as well.”
Last year's attack reminded Munzer of a tragedy that changed their lives.
“I'm a child survivor of the Holocaust, so I know a lot about the juxtaposition of horrible events and happiness and joy,” they said. “In my case, the joy of having had my life saved by an Indonesian family living in Holland. That's a cause for celebration, and yet there's always a danger of terrible things happening in the world. And, sadly, I think that danger is greater today than it was.”
Yet the mood was generally upbeat. Attendees danced in a circle around the sanctuary while singing festive songs. At dinner, guests played LGBT-themed trivia, answering questions about gay television celebrities and Broadway shows. Washington resident Christopher Labrot, dressed as Queen Esther from the Purim story, played host.
Labrot, who is not Jewish, said they moved from New York to Washington when their partner decided to attend law school at Georgetown University. For the last eight months, Labrot has been taking conversion classes at Sixth & I.
They first wore the Esther costume for a Purim play. “They said, ‘We need someone to play Esther,' and I was like, ‘OK.' So this was kind of a reprisal.”
Labrot said that despite the Orlando shooting and continuing discrimination against LGBT people, they are glad that pride remains a largely positive event.
“I think the event reminds us that while we are having a serious conversation at this moment, it's important to have fun, and it's important to review our history and bring everyone together with
laughter.”
Chechnyan activist speaks out
Another sobering moment occurred during the service when Alina, representative from the nongovernmental organization, the Russian LGBT Network, spoke about the human rights situation in the Russian republic of Chechnya. Alina, who asked to only use their first name due fear of retribution, told the audience that gay men in Chechnya have faced imprisonment, torture and even death in some cases. They said they were grateful to be able to celebrate pride in the United States since citizens of their home country do not enjoy the same rights.
According an April report in the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, more than men have been arrested either for being openly gay or for being suspected of being gay by the Russian government and that three people had died. Palermo said speaking out against the Chechnyan pogroms is just as important as condemning discrimination in the United States.
“It's definitely something that our community is paying attention to,” they said. “As queer Jews we have a moral imperative to bear witness and speak out against these kinds of injustices.”

HBO Films has released the first trailer for The Tale, the unnerving true-story drama that made waves when it debuted at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year. Written and directed by Jennifer Fox, based on their own life experiences, the film stars Laura Dern as a woman who starts to uncover memories from their childhood involving sexual abuse, when for all these years she'd simply been telling themselves they had a relationship with a slightly older man when they were a teenager. The film brilliantly chronicles the fallibility of memory, especially when it comes to abuse, and in the process serves as a deeply empathetic tale that allows those lucky enough not to have experienced something like this to recognize how it can take years to fully understand what exactly happened, and how the manipulation from abusers gets ingrained over time.
The Tale had the most “Oscar buzz” of all the films at Sundance, but in a surprise move was picked up by HBO. The pay cable channel offered the ability for Fox to ensure their story would be seen by a wide audience, with the care and attention necessary for a film like this, and in the end they felt that was more valuable than the litany of Academy Award nominations this film surely would have received—especially for Dern, who delivers a phenomenal performance.
This trailer does a great job of giving people a taste of how Fox frames the film, which is absolutely crucial to its impact. Them filmmaking underlines the fractured memories of the lead character, which in turn underscores why so many #MeToo stories take so long to come to the surface—if ever.
I've seen The Tale and was left completely shaken by the experience. It's one of the most powerful films I've ever seen, and an absolutely essential movie for the moment we're living in right now. I implore any and everyone to watch it when it comes to HBO.
Check out the trailer below and click here to read Matt's review from Sundance. The Tale also stars Jason Ritter, Elizabeth Debicki, Isabelle Nélisse, Frances Conroy, John Heard, Common, and Ellen Burstyn. The Tale premieres on HBO on May 26th.
French baby-milk maker Lactalis has ordered a global recall of millions of products over fears of salmonella bacteria contamination.
The company, one of the largest dairy products groups in the world, said it has been warned by health authorities in France that 26 infants have become sick since December 1.
The recall affects brands marketed under the Milumel, Picut and Celi brands.
Spokesman Michel Nalet told The Associated Press on Monday that the "precautionary" recall both in France and abroad affected "several million" products made since mid-February.
The company said a possible source of the outbreak has been identified in a tower used to dry out the milk at a production site.
Lactalis employs 75,000 people in 85 countries, with a turnover of 17 billion euros (£15 billion.)
The symptoms of salmonella infection include abdominal cramps, diarrhoea and fever.

The Enforcement Directorate on Wednesday filed its first charge sheet against liquor baron Vijay Mallya and eight others in connection with its money laundering probe in the about Rs 900 crore IDBI Bank-KFA bank loan case.
The 57-page charge sheet or prosecution complaint, with voluminous annexures, was filed under various sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) before a special anti-money laundering court here.
The court is soon expected to take cognisance of the charge sheet, officials said.
A total of nine accused have been named in the charge sheet by the ED including Mallya, Kingfisher Airlines (KFA), United Breweries (Holding) Limited and senior employees and executives of the now-defunct airline and the IDBI (Industrial Development Bank of India) Bank.
The agency, in the charge sheet, has called Mallya the "prime mover of the entire plot" and has described how funds obtained as the bank loan were allegedly routed illegally including "substantial payments" being diverted by the beleaguered business person to the Formula-1 car racing event abroad.
It has also mentioned the role of other officials and executives of KFA and IDBI Bank in this deal and has explained how the alleged fraud of bank loan in this case was done, with the help of flow charts and diagrams.
The agency also appended the statements of KFA and IDBI Bank officials in the charge sheet, that were recorded by it under the PMLA law, during the course of investigation.
The agency also has described how funds of over Rs 400 crore were moved abroad in alleged violation of rules.
The investigations conducted by the ED, it said, had found that Mallya and KFA along with IDBI Bank officials "criminally conspired to obtain funds to the tune of Rs 860.92 crore despite weak financials, negative net-worth, non- compliance of corporate credit policy of new client, non- quality collateral security and low credit rating of the borrower, out of which Rs 807.82 crore of principal amount remains unpaid".
The Enforcement Directorate had registered a criminal case in this deal last year under the PMLA and has attached assets worth over Rs 9,600 crore till now.
The total loan sanctioned and disbursed by the IDBI bank to KFA was Rs 860.92 crore.
The ED said its "money trail analysis revealed that out of the total loan of Rs 860.92 crore, sanctioned and disbursed by IDBI Bank, Rs 423 crore has been remitted out of India. The said payments were shown to be made towards aircraft rental leasing and maintenance, servicing and spare parts."
The agency is expected to soon file a supplementary charge sheet in this case.
Mallya (61), sought by India for defaulting on several bank loans amounting to nearly Rs 9,000 crore, had on Tuesday claimed during their court appearance in London that they have "enough evidence" to plead their case and taunted authorities saying, "you can keep dreaming about a billion pounds".
They have been in the UK since March 2016 and was arrested by the Scotland Yard on an extradition warrant on April 18.
The central bureau of investigation (CBI) too is probing this case.
ISLAMABAD : Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Monday said the government wants to promote poetry and literature to create tolerance, empathy and goodwill in the country.

Roku, one of the biggest players in the home streaming market, is getting a significant upgrade this May with its Roku OS 8.1 update. The new software was announced on April 24, and while everything looks the same, there are two big things you'll want to keep an eye out for.
First up, live news streams are being added to the Roku Channel. The Roku Channel launched in September 2017 as a way for users to quickly find free, curated content, and Roku OS 8.1 will add 24/7 access to Cheddar News, People TV, and act as the exclusive platform for ABC News Live. In addition to live streams, you'll also be able to view on-demand/linear news content.
Along with news, Roku Channel is also getting Continue Watching and Collections pages to help you more easily find exactly what you're looking for.
Also included with Roku OS 8.1 is an upgrade for private listening. Roku's allowed folks to pump audio from their Roku player to a pair of headphones for a few years at this point as to not disturb those around you, but the 8.1 update will allow you to send your Roku's audio to multiple headphones/earbuds.
Private listening for more than one person will be handled via the Roku mobile app, and it'll allow up to four people to privately listen to a show at once.
Last but not least, May will also see the Roku Streaming Stick+ makes its way to Canada. The Streaming Stick+ supports 4K and HDR streams thanks to its quad-core processor, allows you to control your TV's audio using the remote's volume buttons, and has an "advanced wireless receiver" for improved Wi-Fi performance.
The Streaming Stick+ will be available for CAD 89.99 at Walmart and other retailers across the country.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has raised the price at which the government will buy new-season common rice variety from domestic farmers by 13 percent, a minister said on Wednesday, as the state looks to woo millions of farmers ahead of general elections due early next year.

India, one of the world's key producers of an array of farm commodities, announces support prices for more than 20 crops each year to set a benchmark.
But state agencies buy only rice and wheat at those prices given a lack of financial resources, limiting the benefit of higher crop prices to only 7 percent of the country's farmers.
The government had fixed last year's rice purchase price for the common variety at 1,550 rupees ($22.63) per 100 kilogrammes. It also raised the support price for a superior rice variety to 1,770 rupees, up from 1,590 rupees last year, Home Minister Rajnath Singh told reporters.

The hike in support prices will not impact on food inflation and the government is confident in reining in rising consumer prices, Singh said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government vowed in February to buy crops at 1.5 times the cost of production, a major shift after keeping the so-called minimum support price in low single digits over the past three years.
Analysts and economists have warned the move could help push up inflation, and with a fiscal deficit, prompt India's central bank to raise interest rates more steeply than expected.
Indian farmers voted overwhelmingly for Modi in the 2014 general election, sweeping them to power with an absolute majority, a first for any political party in 30 years. But their popularity has since faded.
Modi's cabinet also raised the minimum support price for soybean and long staple cotton by 10.3 percent and 20.7 percent to 3,399 and 5,450 rupees, respectively, Singh said.

Akhil Akkineni says ‘Hello': How Nagarjuna, Vikram Kumar changed the actor's approach to cinema
Is your destiny predetermined or can one change its course? Do people grow up wanting to achieve a goal even before they knew what they are getting into or do events push them in the direction they were destined to walk upon?
In Akhil Akkineni's case, it was perhaps a bit of both. Back in 1995, when they made their first onscreen appearance in Sisindri, a Telugu film inspired from Baby's Day Out, there was no turning back. The actor's name stuck onto the collective memory of Telugu movie goers and the question about their acting debut when they come of age became inevitable.
Rewind
“I guess I was around 14 or 15. I had set my eyes on wanting to be an actor. My parents (Nagarjuna and Amala) never forced me to do anything and I've always been an independent child who was encouraged to make their own decisions. By the time I completed my 12th standard, I told my parents that I want to be an actor,” Akhil recalls. Throughout their teen years, with their frequent appearances on the cricket field, one got the impression that perhaps they would go on to play the game at a professional level; however, that was never meant to be.
They were destined to do something else and join the ranks of their brother Naga Chaitanya, and the previous generations in the film industry.
Their big launch — Akhil
After making a brief cameo in Vikram Kumar's Manam, which was also ANR's last film before they passed away, Akhil made their full-fledged acting debut in VV Vinayak's Akhil in 2015. The hype surrounding their debut was immense and the film too was quite ambitious, to say the least, considering that it featured Akhil on a wild goose chase, leading them to African jungles, to save the world.
The film was critically panned and it failed to click at the box-office too. And then came a long spell of confusion about what they should do next and if there was a way to re-launch their career in a big way.
Ask Akhil about their state of mind after their big launch in 2015, the actor broods over their memories for a minute and says, “I am looking at it in a very positive light. I guess it happened for my own good. It cleared my mind and gave me a clear picture of what people are expecting from me. I was thinking something different. My approach to cinema has changed a lot after Akhil. I've moved to a better mind space. I'm clear as a person and what should be doing next, especially after acting in Hello.”
All about Hello
Hello is the result of Nagarjuna Akkineni's resolution to re-launch their younger son's career and this time, they didn't want to take a chance. And once again it was Vikram Kumar, the director of Manam, who took over the reins to give Akhil's career a big push. Not surprisingly, the film too is about ‘destiny' and finding one's soulmate against all odds.
Akhil confesses that their entire approach to cinema has changed after working closely with Vikram Kumar and Nagarjuna for this project.
“Given how big my launch was with my first film (Akhil), we were thinking a lot about commercial aspects. It was all about getting those big numbers at the box-office. But now, I've erased all that from my mind. Now, all I want to do is to be part of good films. Once you are able to do that, numbers will flow. I'm very clear in my mind that ‘Film comes first'. I'm no longer thinking that every film of mine has to cross Rs 50 crores or Rs 100 crores. We have done a lot of work for Hello. We have re-shot quite a bit and made every scene the way it was supposed to be done,” Akhil explains.
Searching for one's soulmate isn't exactly a new concept in Telugu cinema and ever since the trailer of Hello landed online, it has drawn comparisons with a 2001 romantic drama Manasantha Nuvve. However, Akhil begs to differ and says, “It feels like the concept has been done before, but I think the reason we did Hello was that we saw a fresh of breath air in terms of love story. It's very emotional film and more importantly, it's a new-age film. The graph of the love story might feel familiar, but the way it has been shot will be different.”
Action in (and Akhil's training for) Hello
Going by the trailer, it's evident that the team has put in a lot of effort to make the action sequences slick and they even brought on board action choreographer Bob Brown, who has worked on several Hollywood films like xXx : Return of Xander Cage, Percy Jackson, Iron Man, Transformers : Revenge Of The Fallen to name a few. And Akhil couldn't be more excited about what they and their team has pulled off in the film.
Admittedly, they trained for nearly 65 days and shot for 30 days to get these stunts right.
“The action is very slick, and it won't feel like the old-school style of action choreography that we see in most Telugu films. You wouldn't have seen anything like this in Telugu cinema so far. We shot some of the action scenes in blistering heat and you have to deal with cramps in such conditions. And when you shoot in places like the slum in Krishna Nagar, it's really tough and dangerous. The team came two and a half months before the shoot for the prep work and we trained for a long time. We didn't learn anything on the sets because we rehearsed a lot before the shoot,” they confess, adding, “I had a lot of fun performing the stunts. I love sports a lot and in a way, action also feels like a sport. However, dancing is very different because you need a lot of grace to pull off a good move.”
Considering that he's starting their career all over again, it makes you wonder if he's feeling the heat and also, if the stakes seem bigger this time. The more they talk about the film, it's evident that the team has ensured that they have tied all the loose ends.
Akhil says, “As a person, I like working under pressure, and I'm glad that the expectations have gone up and trailer has been received really well. I live for those highs and I'm really enjoying this feeling. We can never tell if a film will do well or not, there's nothing like a sure-shot hit. With Hello, I have done my best and we have put in a lot of time and energy correcting it. The biggest regret would be watching a film and thinking that it could have been better. Given the time and resources, I think we have made the best possible film we could have done.”
How Vikram Kumar and Nagarjuna influced Akhil
At the audio launch of the film held recently in Vizag, Akhil thanked the film's director Vikram Kumar with a startling confession.
“Vikram, I'll always be grateful to you for accepting to work with me. You deserved a much better actor than me. I was really low on confidence and confused about my career, but you changed me a lot,” Akhil said.
Explaining how their camaraderie with Vikram Kumar helped them open up, the actor says, “It was a pleasure working with him. He's a warm-hearted and an emotional guy. And for an actor it's exciting to see the level of emotion that they create in every scene. Their writing is so heart-felt. I opened up as an actor, and I opened emotionally after working with him. They pulled out a lot from me that I didn't know I had and I hope people also sense that when they watch it. The whole film has one feel-good emotion and all that comes from Vikram. They got married while we were working on the project and he's madly in love with their wife. You can feel there's love in the air in Hello. All that's is because of him.”
The actor credits their parents for making them feel so confident about himself, even when they were really low.
“They have always guided me whether it's professionally or personally. The best thing about my dad (Nagarjuna) is that he's very clear in their mind about what they think is right. We had a lot of disagreements about the film while making it, but it was always about how do we make it even better. He's very open-minded if you ideas are going to help the film. They don't have any ego in that sense," says Akhil.
The best advice that they got from their father has also helped them understand the process of filmmaking better. Akhil says that Nagarjuna monitored the film like their baby. “He mentored me throughout the film because they wanted me to get a grip on every aspect of the production and not leave anyone answerable for the film, except me. There was a lot of advice and how to go about it. But the best advice was - “Finish the film 45 days prior to the deadline”, because that'll give you enough breathing space to correct whatever you think might make the film better. If I didn't have that space, then I would have gotten busy with promotions and release.”
Promotions for Hello and live performances
This week, Akhil will be touring in New Jersey, San Jose, and Dallas as part of the film's promotions in the US. That's not all. He's also going to perform live on stage. “We are testing waters in the US and see how much we can push the film. I've a strong feeling that it'll do well in the US because Vikram's sensibilities will certainly appeal to the audiences in the US. Besides, it's a huge market which we can no longer ignore. And I didn't want to bore anyone with my speeches, which is why I'm going to sing and dance,” they laugh.
With Hello gearing up for release on December 22, all eyes are on the actor to see if they deliver a hit this time around, and both Nagarjuna and Akhil are confident that the film will hit the bull's eye this time.
“The best moment of 2017 for me was when my dad gave me a huge hug after watching the film's climax. We worked really hard on this film and their hug made the whole thing worth the effort. He's not biased at all. He's a very honest. If they say something, they really means it,” Akhil signs off.
New Delhi: The Indian Air Force tested its capability in dealing with a possible scenario of nuclear and biological warfare during a 13-day-long mega military exercise whose aim was to sharpen its war-waging capability in the wake of the fast evolving regional security situation.
Official sources said the focus of the Gagan Shakti exercise from 8 to 20 April was to check the viability of IAF's operational plans to deal with any kind of challenge including nuclear warfare and a possible situation of a two-front war with China and Pakistan.
A major focus of the exercise was to check combat capability of the indigenously developed Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas and their performance was satisfactory, IAF sources said.
They said eight Tejas were deployed during the exercise and some of these had reported minor technical issues, adding each of the six Tejas had flown six sorties daily like any other platforms including Sukhoi, Mirage 2000 and MiG 29 jets.
The sources said the aim of the exercise was to test IAF's combat readiness in a real-time scenario, adding it had never carried out an exercise of this scale earlier.
A key focus of the exercise was to check IAF's readiness to deal with a biological, chemical and nuclear war and we were satisfied with our capability to deal with such situations, they said.
They also said all types of aerial weapons, including standoff and precision weapons, were deployed to validate their use in the air operations matrix.
As part of the massive drill, the IAF deployed its entire assets for the pan-India exercise with fighter jets, equipped with strategic weapons like Brahmos and Harpoon anti-ship missiles, carrying out deep penetration strikes to revalidate its strategic reach.
During the exercise, the sources said over 11,000 sorties were flown which included nearly 9,000 sorties by fighter aircraft.
The combat drill was carried out at a time when China was increasing its assertiveness along the borders with India and while Pakistan has been continuing its skirmishes along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir.
The exercise covered all terrains including desert, high altitude areas like Ladakh and maritime sphere.
During combat drills near Sino-India border, the IAF significantly focused on the intervalley transfer of troops considering various possible situations of conflict and taking a lesson from the Doka La standoff.
Ensuring serviceability of fighter aircraft and various missile systems was a priority area and the IAF succeeded in its endeavour, officials said.
The serviceability of surface-to-air missiles was around 97 percent while serviceability of fighter jets was close to 80 percent, they said.
Serviceability refers to the availability of an aircraft or a weapon system for deployment. The IAF has been struggling to maintain high serviceability levels of its platforms due to difficulty in getting required spares.
Similarly, the IAF could ensure high levels of dispatch reliability which refers to the ability to make the serviceable flying platforms airborne as and when required, the officials said.
Roseanne Barr's racist tweet about Obama administration official Valerie Jarrett cost them an ABC show and the support of most of their fellow Trump supporters in the media.
But not everyone turned their back on the beleaguered comedian after their self-inflicted public relations nightmare (although Barr blames sleeping pills). Several conservative figures stepped forward to defend Barr after they were fired, decrying a hypocritical Hollywood culture and censorship in the name of an overzealous political correctness.
When the news broke that the Roseanne reboot had been canceled, Republican strategist Noelle Nikpour said on the Fox News show Outnumbered Overtime, "We live in a politically correct world right now."
"It's not about political correctness, it's racism," responded Fox News' Jessica Tarlov.
Nikpour said that Barr's tweet was "ugly" and "not nice" but they said, "let's just leave it at that" and resisted Tarlov's cry to label the tweet racist.

"I don't understand it to be anything other than free speech," said host Harris Faulkner. "It is extremely offensive but it is just that. And they say in one of their tweets — there were three rapid-fire today — 'It was a joke. It was a miscalculated joke.'"
"She is a comedian," Nikpour agreed. "She does have a very wicked, twisted sense of humor. Everybody knows them to be a little raunchy and a little rough."
2012 Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain said ABC had "been looking for a reason to cancel Roseanne."
"Even though the show was a ratings success, I believe that forces within ABC didn't like the fact that their conservative defense of certain things was so popular and getting such ratings," Cain told Fox Business Network Trish Regan.

Although President Trump didn't explicitly come to Barr's defense, they did imply ABC was guilty of hypocrisy. Bob Iger, the CEO of ABC's parent company Disney, called Jarrett to apologize for Barr's tweet, but Trump said Iger never called them to apologize for all the "HORRIBLE statements" made about them by the network.
Fox News personality Tomi Lahren cautioned "fellow conservatives" not to play "mental gymnastics trying to justify" Barr's tweet. "Come on. Wrong is wrong," they said.

Washington: A Pentagon official has told the Associated Press that transgender people can enlist in the military from 1 January, despite President Donald Trump's opposition.
The new policy reflects growing legal pressure on the issue and the difficult hurdles the government would have to cross to enforce Trump's demand to ban transgender individuals from the military.
Two federal courts already have ruled against the ban.
Potential transgender recruits will have to overcome a lengthy and strict set of physical, medical and mental conditions that make it possible, though difficult, for them to join the armed services.
Major David Eastburn said on Monday that the new guidelines mean the Pentagon can disqualify potential recruits with gender dysphoria, a history of medical treatments associated with gender transition and those who underwent reconstruction. But such recruits are allowed in if a medical provider certifies they've been clinically stable in their preferred sex for 18 months and are free of significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas.
Transgender individuals receiving hormone therapy must be stable on their medication for 18 months.
The requirements make it challenging for a transgender recruit to pass. But they mirror concerns President Barack Obama's administration laid out when the Pentagon initially lifted its ban on transgender service last year.
"Due to the complexity of this new medical standard, trained medical officers will perform a medical prescreen of transgender applicants for military service who otherwise meet all applicable applicant standards," Eastburn said.
Moscow: Moscow police said on Tuesday they had detained a person who vandalised a statue of a renowned Soviet soccer player outside the Spartak stadium, where England were playing Colombia in a Round of 16 match.
The word “England” was painted in red on to the chest of a statue of Fyodor Cherenkov, a former Soviet national team player and Spartak Moscow midfielder who died in 2014, according to pictures that emerged on social media during the match.
Police said in a statement they “had identified and detained” the person who had vandalised the statue, which is located near the stadium's main entrance.
Former Spartak players and members of the club's youth academy periodically lay flowers by Cherenkov's statue, honouring one of the team's most beloved former players.
The police statement did not disclose the vandal's identity, nor did it say whether they or they were a British national.
A Reuters photographer at the scene shortly after the incident said that the inscription had been washed off.
The British embassy in Moscow could not immediately be reached for comment. The British Foreign Office said it was looking into the case.
England beat Colombia 4-3 on penalty kicks and will face Sweden in the quarter-finals in Samara on Saturday.

Mentally battered and bruised by six years of conflict, a young war widow steps on board a train in search of a new life… and determined to seek out answers to mysteries from them childhood.
However, they are on a collision course with a man whom they will love but who might never be hers, and a past that holds more dark secrets than they could ever have imagined.
The glittering world of the London theatre in the post-war period is the alluring stage set for a sumptuous new saga from Natalie Meg Evans, the award-winning author of The Dress Thief who spent five years working in London's fringe theatre before turning to writing.
And there is no shortage of visual drama and rich choreographic detail in this compelling, multi-layered novel which takes readers on a thrilling journey through the bomb-scarred streets of London and the exciting backstage pressures of life in the theatre.
Twenty years ago, when they were aged five, Vanessa Quinnell visited the Farren Theatre in London with their actor father, Johnny, and was told in no uncertain terms that ‘the theatre is the best place in the world.'
Only months later, Johnny walked out of their life and did not come back. Them mother Ruth, who always loathed everything theatrical, never told Vanessa why their father had left their home in Kent.
Fast forward to London in 1945 and Vanessa is now a widow after their Spitfire pilot husband Leo Kingcourt was killed just two weeks after their wedding. Clutching a small golden key given to them in a mysterious inheritance, Vanessa is determined to find the truth of their past and senses that whatever it unlocks lies in the old Farren Theatre.
The pull of the Farren, an enchanted place steeped in memories of their father, is so strong that they apply for a job there as a wardrobe mistress and joins the backstage crew.
The theatre's owner has recently died and it is now in the hands of their godson, Alistair Redenhall, a former Royal Navy commander who is still haunted by events under their watch during the war years.
Haughty, handsome Alistair is in a troubled marriage which they seem reluctant to end but their unexpectedness kindness has bowled over Vanessa. ‘Her heart was a vacant lot and he'd taken possession.'
With no experience and no budget for supplies, Vanessa must use their intuition to create beautiful costumes from whatever scraps of silk and thread survived the Blitz. It's a seemingly impossible task, but a welcome distraction as they struggle to resist their feelings for Alistair.
Meanwhile, Vanessa starts digging into their past and what they discover unravels family secrets sewn deep into the very fabric of the London theatre scene… but is they destined to repeat the same terrible mistakes their father made, and will they be unlucky in love again?
Evans has the gift to recreate the past in all its colour, intricate detail and atmosphere, and here we smell the greasepaint, feel the tension, hear the curtain calls and reach out to touch the elaborate costumes as we are swept up into the gregarious life of the book's leading player, the Farren Theatre.
At the heart of the story are two people damaged by the war and eager to strike out into a brave new world but beset by the reverberations of past events, and secrets that have been hidden for over two decades.
Emotions run high and passions spill over as the past catches up with the present but, even then, all is not what it seems for Vanessa and Alistair, as Evans surprises us with a never-saw-it-coming twist in the tail.
Written with the author's trademark descriptive flair, immaculate research and compelling evocation of time and place, The Wardrobe Mistress is a feast of drama, romance, suspense and intrigue, all guaranteed to tickle the taste buds of historical fiction fans.

The UC Davis student senate has made it optional to display the American flag at its meetings, stirring up controversy on campus and conservative blogs.
Senate Bill 76 passed Thursday, said Michael Gofman, a student senator who opposed the change.
The bill amends bylaws that required the United States flag to be on display at every senate meeting of the Associated Students, University of California, Davis. The revised bylaws give senate members the option to petition for the display of the flag 24 hours before each meeting. The ASUCD senate pro tem ultimately has authority to decide whether the U.S. flag will be displayed, according to the revision.
The resolution says that since “the concept of the United States of America and patriotism is different for every individual, it should not be compulsory that the flag is in view at all times during Senate meetings.”
Jose Antonio Meneses, who introduced the resolution, said the changes were meant to ensure the student government is following federal law, which they say doesn't allow an organization to mandate displaying the flag.
“It wasn't political in any way,” Meneses said. “But because it is the United States flag ... it's a touchy subject to talk about. We want to make sure we are not sued.”
Gofman disagreed, saying all governing bodies within the U.S. – including a student senate – should display the flag.
“It was a purely political issue from the start,” Gofman said.
The student government decision drew attention from internet blogs, many conservative – including Fox News Insider, the Daily Caller and The Blaze. Some stories say the flag has been “banned,” “banished” or “dropped.”
Meneses said that while they support freedom of speech, many of the stories are inaccurate.
“It's not a ban on the flag,” they said.
They cited a 1943 U.S. Supreme Court decision that found West Virginia could not compel students to salute the flag or recite the Pledge of Allegiance.
“The opinion in that case is that you can't force people to pledge your allegiance, by (the flag) being there; by extension, you are pledging your allegiance to a symbol that you don't relate to or that you don't equate yourself with,” they said Monday.
They said the flag has never been on display during their two years on the student senate, and no one asked about it or the bylaw requirement until now.
A Facebook post by Gofman the day before the meeting prompted offers of flag donations from veterans groups and fraternities. Gofman plans to introduce a resolution that would allow any member of the senate to bring and display an American flag at any meeting.
There is not enough patriotism, especially at UC Davis, said Gofman, who describes themselves as a first-generation American.
“I have a much closer connection to places outside of America,” they said. “I understand what the alternative looks like. I don't think members of the senate know what it is like to live in a totalitarian country.”
Gofman said they aren't aware there was a resolution making the display of the flag mandatory.
“Once it was brought up, I was shocked and embarrassed about it not being followed,” they said.
The controversy over the resolution has generated a lot of negative email to the student senate.
Gofman said that much of the email is from alumni saying they are upset with the decision and don't plan to donate to the school again.
In a statement on Facebook, Gofman condemned two of the emails, one they characterized as “racist” and the other as threatening the physical safety of the senators who voted against the bill.
“This is unacceptable behavior,” they said.
Meneses said much of the hate mail is based on incorrect facts.
“When I introduced the bill, I didn't know it would be controversial,” they said.
On 9 January, 2018, Bengaluru resident Razia Khan logged on to the website of St Germain School in the city as soon as online registrations opened — they wanted to get their 5-year-old son admitted lowering kindergarten. Even as they clicked on the ‘Online Application' tab, their hopes were dashed. A message popped up saying ‘Registrations Completed'.
The reason for this mad rush? St Germain School is one of the few private schools in Bengaluru that offer quality education at an affordable fee — Rs 50,000 admission fee and Rs 20,000 tuition fee annually. In most private schools in the city, fees go are a couple of lakhs. An IT professional, seeking anonymity, says they pay Rs 1.5 lakh as tuition fee annually for their daughter studying in Class IV at Deen's Academy, Whitefield. “I don't know how much I will end up paying (in school fees) by the time my daughter reaches college.”
This is the story of every middle-class parent in Bengaluru and in other tier-I Indian cities. Most schools are fleecing parents and flouting government norms openly. One can expect an admission call only if they declare a hefty income in the admission inquiry form. Parents visiting schools are often greeted with notices such as these:
Middle-income folks, whose annual income is between Rs 3.5-10 lakh, are the worst hit. They don't want to send their children to government schools. And educating them at private schools is burning a deep hole in their pockets. A rudimentary analysis of fees at popular non-elite, private CBSE and ICSE schools — Presidency School and Florence School, Ryan International, Deen's Academy and Dhee Global School — in Bengaluru revealed that the average annual tuition fee in 2017-18 was between Rs 1,00,000-1,50,000 per student per year. Parents have to shell out another Rs 8,000-12,000 for books, uniforms, and stationery, which too are sold by the schools. Then there's the transportation fee, which depends on the distance a student travels.
The ASSOCHAM Social Development Foundation (ASDF) conducted a random survey in May 2015 on the rise in private school fees. The report says: “School expenses of a single child, including tuition fees, have risen from Rs 55,000 in 2005 to Rs 1,25,000 per annum in 2015.”
It noted, “It is becoming difficult for salaried parents in big cities to afford tuition fee and other expenses, which have gone up by 150 percent in the last 10 years.”
School fees higher than college fees!
School fees today are higher than engineering college fees, which range between Rs 20,000 and Rs 35,000 annually. A 2007 report by the Unesco Institute for Statistics which focused on the financials of education in 200 countries says, “The household contribution drops to 14 percent (for university education), exactly half of what the middle-class spends on primary and secondary education.”
Most parents who spoke to Firstpost say they have other financial commitments — EMIs of the house, car or personal loans, medical expenses of ageing parents, insurance premiums — as well, and that exorbitant school fees make it hard for them to meet these. A software project leads with an IT firm in Bengaluru, who wanted to remain anonymous, says, “I spent about Rs 1,00,000 last year to admit my child to Class I in Presidency school, R.T. Nagar, and paid another Rs 60,000 in tuition fee, apart from other expenses. I am worried how will I finance my second child's education.”
Government norms flouted openly
A draft notification issued by the Education Secretariat of Karnataka on 6 July, 2017, which Firstpost has access to, warns private bodies that run schools: “The concerned bodies shall have been formed on non-proprietary and non-profit sharing basis… The funds of the institution shall not be channelised for purposes other than furthering education…”
Further, the Karnataka Education Act 1983 provides a formula for calculation of tuition fee: It should account for the salaries of the teaching and non-teaching staff, plus 30% of the recurring expenditure, divided by the number of students. The Act also stipulates that schools should not charge any term fees up to Class V, and that they charge nominal term fees for higher classes.
But this formula is hardly followed in any private school. In 2016, officials of the Department of Public Instruction conducted a survey of 17 schools in Bengaluru and found that schools were charging up to 138% of the recurring expenses. The Karnataka Education (Second amendment) Bill, 2017 proposed a new fee calculation formula, which would enable schools to charge additional fee based on their geographical location, but is yet to come into effect.
Software engineer Vinodh Rajaraman, 39, who started a movement in Bengaluru in 2015 and filed a PIL in September 2016 in the Karnataka High Court for regulation of school fees, says, “A school of 1,000 students with a yearly fee of Rs 1 lakh easily makes Rs 10 crore a year, apart from other incomes such as admission fee and uniform charges, excluding expenses of salaries and building rent.”
It's not only people in Bengaluru who are bearing the brunt of schools charging tuition fees arbitrarily. Parents in many Indian cities have organised themselves to fight against unregulated fee hikes by private schools.
The sharp increase in the number of private schools in Bengaluru shows how lucrative the school business is. According to a report by the Department of Public Instruction, there was a four-fold increase in the number of private schools between 2009 and 2014 in Bengaluru — the numbers stand at 1,377 in south and 937 in north Bengaluru.
Challenges posed by the RTE
According to Article 21A of the Constitution of India, it is mandatory for the State to provide free education from ages six to 14. However, the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, which was inserted as a sub-clause to article 21A, doesn't help the middle-income class. The Act puts several restrictions — only families with income below Rs 3.5 lakh are eligible to apply for seats under the RTE Act; schools must be located within the ward of the parents seeking admission etc — on admission under the RTE quota.
Free education not just for 25 percent
In an interim order passed on 12 February, 2013 by Justice HG Ramesh, the Karnataka HC observed, “In view of the Article 21(A) of the Constitution of India, children in that age group (6-14) are entitled to free and compulsory education. This is not only applicable for the 25 percent selected by the state as per the RTE, but all the children in the age group of 6-14 years. It is for the state to reimburse the fees fixed by the respective schools." If the government had taken timely steps towards the implementation of this order, it would have left far reaching consequences.
Parents to their own rescue
Abhilash Matlapudi, a 37-year-old project manager at a Bengaluru IT firm, came back from abroad and realized that paying their children's school fees was going to be really challenging despite their decent salary. They then came up with the idea of founding a school funded and managed by parents in Whitefield area of the city in 2017. “I started a Facebook page seeking people's opinion on starting a parent-owned school with full transparency. We ended up starting Citizen's Gurukul.”

INDIANAPOLIS –The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department announced Tuesday night that a months-long investigation has led to the seizure of nearly 50 pounds of drugs.
As the result of search warrants served at two locations Tuesday, officers confiscated $44,000 in cash, eight guns and 45 pounds of suspected heroin, methamphetamine and black tar heroin with an estimated street value of $750,000.
"These are once-in-a-career-type cases," said Deputy Chief Chad Knecht of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department.
Southwest District Lt. Scott Hessong said officers with the southwest and southeast districts began their investigation in early March. That investigation led to two search warrants — one on each of the districts — served Tuesday.
Officers arrested four in connection with the investigation, believed to be involved in trafficking on the southwest and southeast districts, Hessong said. The department has not yet identified those people.

Surveying a table where officers displayed 11 bags of suspected drugs, guns and stacks of $20 bills, Knecht reflected on the items' significance.
"On that table you see exactly what drives the crime," Knecht said. "The profit from the money, the firearms to protect it and the drugs that are tearing our communities apart and causing addiction. That table exemplifies what's going on in our society."

Hessong said it's rare for a district-level bust to be this extensive. Knecht credited the uniformed beat officers who used their knowledge of the community to investigate tips and get results.
A return to beat policing has been one of the focuses for police Chief Bryan Roach. In April, they and Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett announced the creation of 78 beats across the city which would replace 33 zones, saying the beats would allow officers to be active in more focused areas rather than covering a zone.
"This is what beat policing does," Knecht said. "It makes a difference in the neighborhoods and the communities, and the officers actually care about their beats and work it and find these things."

May 2017: Drug-laced 'SweeTARTs' seized, parents warned
Hessong said Tuesday's bust will hopefully reduce overdoses in the weeks to come, potentially saving lives.
"There's absolutely no way to tell what we did to prevent drug overdoses," Hessong said. "To give you an idea, each use of heroin is like a few grains of sand, and we have 45 pounds that's packed solid. So, there's no way to tell how many individual drug uses you have just with this product here."

Taylor Swift has won long-awaited vindication after a jury decided that a radio host groped them during a pre-concert photo op four years ago.
After a week-long trial over dueling lawsuits, jurors determined Monday that fired Denver DJ David Mueller assaulted the pop star by grabbing their backside during a backstage meet-and-greet.
The six-woman, two-man jury also found that Swift's mother and radio liaison were within their rights to contact Mueller's bosses.
Mueller sued the Swifts and their radio handler, Frank Bell, seeking up to $3 million for their ruined career.
Just before closing arguments, the judge dismissed Taylor Swift from Mueller's lawsuit and drastically reduced the amount Mueller could collect.
The singer-songwriter said in their countersuit that they wanted a symbolic $1 and the chance to stand up for other women.
The Seattle Mariners have been surprising quite a few people so far this season. Entering action on July 4th, they're just 0.5 games behind the first-place Houston Astros in the American League West off the strength of a 55-31 record.
How have they been able to manage this, especially with second baseman Robinson Cano currently serving a suspension? Well, we've previously touched on their ability to win one-run games, which certainly helps. One of the keys to that level of success in close contests, though, is a strong bullpen.
According to fWAR, the Mariners have a top-10 bullpen (3.2 fWAR). But it's basically because of closer Edwin Diaz, who has been worth 2.2 fWAR on their own through 45 innings of work. That's already a single-season career-high mark for him.
The hard-throwing right-hander collected another save on Tuesday night. It was the 33rd time he's shut the door on a Seattle victory, which leads the league. And if you think he's been racking up saves at a very high rate, you'd be right.
Most saves in MLB history prior to All-Star break: F Rodriguez (LAA) 38 in 2008
J. Smoltz (Atl) 34 in 2003
E. Diaz (Sea) 33 in 2018*
D. Graves (Cin) 33 in 2004
J. Johnson (Balt) 33 in 2013 *Mariners still have 11 more games til break. — Greg Johns (@GregJohnsMLB) July 4, 2018
He'll only need one more save to match their 2017 total. Something tells me that'll happen pretty soon.
Diaz has been a useful reliever since debuting in 2016, but he's clearly rebounded after taking a step back last season. Here's how their ERA, SIERA, strikeout rate (K%), walk rate (BB%), and homers allowed per nine innings (HR/9) stack up during their short MLB career.
This bounce-back has been aided by some drastic changes in their batted-ball profile, too.
After watching hitters register a pull rate north of 40.0% in 2016 and 2017, that number is down to 28.9% so far this season. They also boast a soft-hit rate (26.5%) that's higher than their hard-hit rate (21.7%), both of which are on track to be career-best marks.
Diaz is a fastball-slider pitcher, and there's been a clear change in pitch mix (along with pitch quality) in 2018. After throwing their slider 32.3% of the time in 2016 and at a 31.5% rate in 2017, it's all the way up to 39.0% at the moment.
The value of this pitch on a per-100-pitch basis has improved from 1.79 last year to 2.59 so far this year, according to FanGraphs. It's easily the most effective pitch in their arsenal — hitters have produced a 55.6% strikeout rate, 28.1% swinging-strike rate, and a 5 wRC+ against it.
If the Mariners plan to keep pace with the Astros — and at the very least, hold on to one of the AL wild-card spots — they'll need Diaz to continue locking down the ninth inning in close games like they have over the past few months.

OCALA, Fla. (February 2, 2018) – The “Steel City Outlaw” Tim Shaffer made the most of their front row starting position on Friday night, eventually leading all 30 circuits around Bubba Raceway Park to claim their first Arctic Cat All Star Circuit of Champions presented by Mobil 1 main event victory of the season. The pilot of the Rudzik Excavating, No. 49X earned $5,000 for their efforts, edging out the “Madman” Kerry Madsen for the 61st victory of their career against the Star Circuit of Champions.
“This is great for the Rudzik team,” Shaffer said, a four-time All Star champion from 2009 to 2012. “Everyone works so hard back at the shop. That hard work makes all of this happen. This is what makes all of their hard work fun.”
Shaffer started from the outside-pole position and earned the early advantage, racing by the flagstand for the first time with Tyler Clem and Sheldon Haudenschild in tow. The Aliquippa, Pa., native maintained a quick pace at the front of the running order until caution flags appeared for the first time on lap nine. Unfortunately for Clem and Haudenschild, the caution flag was the result of their misfortune, each collected by a stopped lapped car.
Green flag conditions soon returned with Shaffer resuming their campaign at the front of the running order. With Clem and Haudenschild out, it was Sunbury, Pennsylvania's Mark Smith inheriting the runner-up position, followed closely by New York native, Coleman Gulick, and Kerry Madsen.
While Shaffer controlled the point, pushing their advantage to nearly two seconds even with traffic coming back into play as early as lap 14, it was Madsen who was attracting the attention, driving by Gulick on lap 11 and eventually squeezing under Mark Smith on lap 20. On lap 21, caution flags appeared for the second and final time once again erasing Shaffer's advantage.
With rubber starting to come into play around the bottom of the speedway, it was obvious that Shaffer had the edge despite Madsen's speed. Madsen followed Shaffer back to green on lap 21 and raced on the tail tank of the familiar No. 49X for the next nine circuits. Once again, traffic came into the picture but this time acting as a roadblock around the thin lane of rubbered-up racing surface. Madsen made a few attempts to squeeze under Shaffer, but the attempts failed. The “Steel City Outlaw” prevailed for their third All Star Circuit of Champions victory at Bubba Raceway Park.
“I tried to get out of line and get around the lapped car on the front stretch, but I had to duck back in line,” Shaffer explained. “You just have to be patient. Last night I wasn't patient and it cost us. To come back tonight and win is just awesome for this team. This is a Rider Engine and it is running great. The first win is always the hardest to get. To get a win this early will really help us the rest of the year. It is a building tool for the team.”
Kerry Madsen chased Shaffer to the line, followed by Mark Smith, Coleman Gulick, and Paul McMahan.
“I did think about trying to squeeze under [Tim Shaffer] a few times, but I thought I better get on the brakes because I didn't want to take them out,” Madsen explained, pilot of the GoMuddy.com, No. 2. “I tried to keep them honest right there at the end and be right up their bum. If they had a slip, I was going to get right in there. We had a good run. I'm happy for this team. Second run of the year and we got a top-two. I'm happy with that.”
The Arctic Cat All Star Circuit of Champions presented by Mobil 1 will end their three-day visit to Ocala, Fla., on Saturday, February 3, with a third and final appearance at Bubba Raceway Park. “America's Series” will battle for a $5,000 top prize during the final leg of their Winter Nationals campaign, successfully wrapping up the first segment of their Florida invasion. The Stars will return to competition on Wednesday evening, February 7, at Volusia Speedway Park near Barberville, Florida.
On Saturday, February 3, starting times will move ahead one hour at Bubba Raceway Park with the Star drivers meeting scheduled for 4:30 p.m. followed by All Star hot laps at 5:45 p.m., sharp. Those seeking additional news and notes, such as general admission gate times and ticket prices, should visit Bubba Raceway Park live on the Web at www.bubbaracewaypark.com.

LAHORE - Punjab Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif has stressed the need for forging unity to cope with the challenges being faced by the country.
“Celebrating the 70th Independence Day with zeal and fervour, we all must rise above politics” they said while talking to the media at the flag-hoisting ceremony at the Lahore Fort Monday.
The chief minister also stressed the need for political stability. “Pakistan is a nuclear power with ability to crush the enemy. But we should also take stock of our past and see why the country is still political and economically weak. We must work jointly to make Pakistan prosperous,” they observed.
They paid tribute to the Pakistan Movement veterans and called for following in the footsteps of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Allama Muhammad Iqbal. They also paid homage to the martyrs of war on terror.
Shehbaz Sharif on this occasion also came down hard on political opponents as they accused them of committing corruption using political influence.
“There are people who got their loans written-off though political influence. There are people whose corruption scandals are known to everybody. Such people have their assets abroad”, they said, adding that corruption would be curbed at all costs. They said Pakistan was established to give equal opportunities to everyone.
Lord Mayor Col(r) Mubashar Javed presented the welcome address. The diplomats of China, Turkey, Iran and the US, provincial ministers, chief secretary and senior civil and military officers were also present.
After the event, Shehbaz paid a surprised visit to Manawan Hospital and had a round of all the units. The 100-bed hospital is newly-constructed on a 49-kanal of land.
“Modern medical facilities have been provided. The hospital is a gift for the people living in the border area,” they said and directed the administration o to make it a model for other hospitals.
They said Punjab had the credit of setting the trend of international standard hospitals for the poor. They said Recep Tayyip Hospital in Muzzafargarh, Burns Unit in Multan and Shehbaz Sharif Hospital in Lahore were a few examples where the best medical facilities were available. They said provision of medical facilities to the poor was their mission and they will continue with it.
Health Week message
Also, in their Health Week message, the chief minister said that their government had increased the health budge to bring in betterment.
“The improvement in health sector and provision of the best facilities are the priorities of the government. Billions of rupees have been spent for the purpose,” they said, adding that considerable improvement in the health sector had been witnessed due to result-oriented measures of the Punjab government. They said they were personally monitoring the health programmes across Punjab.
They said blood screening and vaccination camps will be set up at THQs and DHQs this week and free medical check-up of pregnant women and vaccination will be provided to the children. They said free tests of hepatitis, aids, malaria and tuberculosis will be carried out.

Puerto Rico's power grid has been practically demolished in the wake of hurricane Maria. It now has a once in a lifetime opportunity to rebuild and the island's governor Ricardo Rossello wants to have a chat with Elon Musk about their recent offer to use Tesla batteries and solar power for the the job.
Only 10 percent of the island has power at the moment and, according to the Puerto Rico state owned electric company, some communities won't be able to turn the lights back on for four to six months.
Musk tweeted yesterday they could be the one to rebuild Puerto Rico's electricity system using independent batteries and solar power.
“The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too,” Musk wrote back.
The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world, but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too. Such a decision would be in the hands of the PR govt, PUC, any commercial stakeholders and, most importantly, the people of PR. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 5, 2017
Governor Rossello tweeted at Musk shortly after with, “Let's talk. Do you want to show the world the power and scalability of your # TeslaTechnologies? PR could be that flagship project.”
As the Government's CINO, I fully support this! Let's build the Puerto Rico we all want through innovation #letstalk @prstateits — Glorimar Ripoll (@prstatecino) October 6, 2017
Puerto Rico's chief innovation officer Glorimar Ripoli is also on board. “As the Government's CINO, I fully support this! Let's build the Puerto Rico we all want through innovation,” they tweeted.
The real question is if this talking will turn into action.
Tesla has already shipped hundreds of its Powerwall battery systems to Puerto Rico and Tesla employees are currently busy installing them and training locals how to continue the process.
Musk also has a history of turning Twitter chats into something more. They struck a deal to build a battery plant in South Australia based on a tweet with Atlassian founder and Australian Mike Cannon-Brookes last March. Musk broke ground on the deal last month and stands to lose $50 million if they don't complete the job within 100 days.
As Musk mentioned in their tweet, Tesla has created a battery and solar power grid for other islands like the Kauaʻi Island Utility Cooperative in Hawaii and in American Samoa.
Of course, those projects were for much smaller populations than Puerto Rico. But Musk seems confident their system can scale to meet the demands of the island's 3.4 million citizens.

Xiaomi is expected to launch as many as three products as part of its 8th-anniversary celebrations on 31 May and one of them is expected to be the Mi 8 SE which we don't know much about yet.
A camera sample from the smartphone, however, seems to have cropped up on Weibo a day before its launch revealing its prowess in low light. The watermark at the bottom of the image confirms that the image was shot using the Mi 8 SE but does not reveal anything more about the phone.
As per a leaked document reported by GizmoChina, the Mi 8 SE will feature an AI-enabled dual-camera setup on the back with 1.4 μm pixel size. On the front, it will expectedly feature a 20 MP selfie shooter which will be coupled with an LED flash.
The special edition of the Mi 8 was earlier expected to come with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC just like the Mi 8, but as per a leaked report, the Mi 8 SE will likely feature the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 710 chipset instead. But we do have to wait for what Xiaomi decides to pack into this smartphone which seems have skipped the streak of leaks, which generally precedes the company's smartphone launches.
Apart from the Mi 8 and the Mi 8 SE, Xiaomi is also expected to launch the Mi Band 3 and finally, its Android Oreo-based MIUI 10 user interface at the event.
We like Willem Dafoe all angry and mean. But, we also love Willem Dafoe all nurturing and caring. Remember Oliver Stone's Platoon? Great hero in that. Same goes for their unexpected role in The Boondock Saints. So, naturally, we're a little excited to see their more humanistic turn in Sean Baker's highly anticipated follow-up to 2015's Tangerine: The Florida Project.
Set in Miami, the alternative coming-of-age film follows a six-year-old named Moonee (Brooklynn Prince), who lives with their mother Halley (Bria Vinaite) in a week-to-week motel on the fringe of society. Those who saw Tangerine can attest to Baker's skill at drawing the beauty from a miserable situation and judging from the first trailer above, that's exactly what they did again.
Here's the official synopsis:
“Warm, winning and gloriously alive, Sean Baker's The Florida Project is a deeply moving and unforgettably poignant look at childhood.
Set on a stretch of highway just outside the imagined utopia of Disney World, The Florida Project follows six-year-old Moonee (Brooklynn Prince in a stunning breakout turn) and their rebellious mother Halley (Bria Vinaite, another major discovery) over the course of a single summer. The two live week to week at “The Magic Castle,” a budget motel managed by Bobby (a career-best Willem Dafoe), whose stern exterior hides a deep reservoir of kindness and compassion.
Despite their harsh surroundings, the precocious and ebullient Moonee has no trouble making each day a celebration of life, their endless afternoons overflowing with mischief and grand adventure as they and their ragtag playmates—including Jancey, a new arrival to the area who quickly becomes Moonee's best friend—fearlessly explore the utterly unique world into which they've been thrown. Unbeknownst to Moonee, however, their delicate fantasy is supported by the toil and sacrifice of Halley, who is forced to explore increasingly dangerous possibilities in order to provide for their daughter.
With The Florida Project, Sean Baker gives life and a voice to a community rarely seen on screen. Through the winsome eyes and pained glances of Moonee, Halley, and Bobby, Baker has created a spellbinding and transformative portrait of contemporary lives lived in the margins that are otherwise too easily forgotten. The Florida Project declares, boldly and proudly, that anywhere can be a Magic Kingdom – it just depends on how you see it.
And here's its gorgeous poster:
Mark it on the calendar: The Florida Project hits theaters on October 6th.
Why on earth does the magazine Physics Today want to publish a piece trying to reconcile science and religion, and arguing that those who say they're in conflict are actually damaging science? (Click on screenshot.)
The author of this accommodationist screed is Tom McLeish, professor of physics at Durham University, whose work is supported by Templeton). We've met them before—when I criticized their Conversation essay on exactly the same topic. Templeton is sure getting its money's worth out of the guy! Their arguments are the same as before, so I needn't reprise them in detail. There are four:
a.) Early scientists were motivated by religious impulses. To wit (and again):
Newton themselves is testimony to the deep formative role of Christian theology in the rise of experimental and mathematical sciences. Far from being a sort of secular triumph over centuries of dogmatic obscurantism, the writings of early modern scientists such as Newton and Robert Boyle make it clear that they were motivated by the theological philosophy of Francis Bacon.
Yes, they always drag Newton into this, and, like others, their urge to do science may have been motivated in part by a desire to understand God's working. But their researches were secular, and insofar as they did sneak in divine explanations (i.e., Newton's idea that God kept the planets in their orbits), they were wrong. Further, this “inspiration” no longer obtains, as most scientists in both the UK and US—and a vast majority of the good scientists—are atheists. So while we can give religion a soupçon of credit for inspiring science centuries ago, it does almost nothing to inspire science today. In fact, I don't know of any scientist who has said that their religion motivated their science. There are religious scientists, but they judiciously wall off the atheism they assume when they enter the lab, and the superstition they swill when they enter their church.
McLeish even resurrects the Book of Job, as they did in their Conversation article, as a wellspring of scientific inquiry:
I'd heard that a respected national theater company had long wanted to create a work based on the ancient book of Job. I admit to a personal love for that ancient poem. No one really knows where it came from, but for my money it contains the most sublime articulation of the innate curiosity into nature that still drives science today but that has clearly deep human roots. Its probing questions seek answers to where hail, lightning, and clouds come from; why stars can be clustered together; how birds navigate huge distances; how the laws of the heavens can be applied to Earth; and so on. . . . Anyone who has not read beyond the superficial yet ubiquitous stories of conflict between science and religion that receive so much airtime today would be surprised to see such deep entanglements of scientific and religious thinking, from the ancient past of the book of Job to current scientifically informed political decision making.
Only someone marinated in the faith could construe Job as an inspiration for the doing of science Has any scientist ever said, “Yes, when I read Job I decided to spend my career answering some of those questions posed by God”? In fact, God is simply asking Job rhetorical questions to show that They had power over the poor boil-afflicted mortal.
b.) Even modern scientists are motivated to do science by their faith. McLeish has dug up some outliers:
. . . the play that so impressed me, staged by the Riding Lights Theatre Company in the elegant renaissance church of St Michael le Belfrey in York, featured a 20th-century Job as a research physicist. After the performance a panel of scientists discussed how their faith supports their scientific research.
Of course, if you lined up a thousand American or British scientists, and asked them “how does your faith support your scientific research?”, you'd find the vast majority, even the religious scientists, saying, “What? It doesn't!” What motivates scientists is curiosity and ambition, not a desire to understand the workings of God. Maybe people like Ken Miller, an observant Catholic, are exceptions, but they're few and far between. And, of course, faith can't support scientific research as it's actually done, because all scientists do their work as atheists—as practical materialists and naturalists.
c.) Faith is not the belief in things for which there's no evidence. My response to this claim is “Yes it is!” McLeish likes to think that faith is more sophisticated (my emphasis):
The “literal” reading of texts such as Genesis—as if they were scientific documents rather than part of a story in which we inquire about the universe—is a 20th century aberration away from orthodox Christianity. Conversely, misrepresenting faith as mindless adherence to beliefs in the face of evidence to the contrary needs to give way to a more thoughtful understanding. The term can describe painstaking engagement with the world through the true stories we are part of. Reflecting the vital presence of what we might call “reasoned hope,” faith is not so very far from descriptions of the experience of doing science
Yes, because it's wrong to read Genesis as if it tells a true story, but absolutely correct to read the New Testament as if it does tell a true story: a story about Jesus, their divinity, their miracles, and their Resurrection as the source of our salvation. I doubt that McLeish would think the Jesus myth is simply a “story in which we inquire about the universe.” Jesus as metaphor certainly wasn't part of the “orthodox Christianity” that McLeish praises. Isn't it curious that when science disproves a bit of scripture, it miraculously turns into a “story in which we inquire about the universe.”
As for faith as “reasoned hope”, that's about the best euphemism for “belief without evidence” that I've seen. What “reasoned faith” means is this: “I want to believe in God and Jesus, so I reason out ways that they must be real.” To pretend that “faith is not so very far from descriptions of the experience of doing science” is simply a lie. There's a huge difference between Francis Collins's accepting Jesus after seeing three frozen waterfalls, and physicists accepting relativity because it met several predictions made by Einstein. Until those predictions were met, relativity was a credible but unsubstantiated idea. In contrast, Collins changed from atheism to evangelical Christianity simply by gazing at frozen water, which they alone construed as evidence for the Trinity. I'd love to ask McLeish: “What, exactly, is the evidence that have convinces you that Jesus and God are real? And how come that evidence, unlike scientific evidence, hasn't been found universally convincing?”
d.) The claim that science and religion are at odds is dangerous to science. To wit:
Maintaining the view that science and religion are in conflict does no one any favors and is hurting science. The damage comes not only through a warped transmission of history but also because it suggests to religious communities that science is a threat to them rather than an enterprise they can celebrate and support. . . . Driving an unhistorical and unrealistic wedge between science and religion has got to stop. It leads, in part, to the optionalism that we see in some public and political attitudes toward science, from climate change to vaccination. It damages the educational experience of our children, and it impoverishes our understanding of our own science's historical context. Human beings live not only in a physical world but within historical narratives that give us values, purpose, and identity
The reason that people don't support evolution, vaccination, or anthropogenic climate change has nothing to do with people arguing that religion and science are at odds. It comes from pure faith: a belief in things that make you feel good, and which you'll support in the face of evidence. Those opponents would be just as vociferous if people like Andrew Dickson White, Richard Dawkins, and I had never existed. The problem is not science/religion incompatibilists like me. The problem is people like McLeish—people who claim that there's scientific value, empirical value, in faith. It's religion that's the issue, and it poisons science by either making people deny it (creationism) or by making people think there are ways besides empirical investigation to suss out truth—the “method” of faith.
McLeish has dined well on Templeton's largesse. Given that most physicists are atheists, why does Physics Today publish this nonsense?

Sotu Klaatu Barada Nikto by James Howard Kunstler
It's beginning to look a little like The Day the Earth Stood Still out there, with Devin Nunes in the Klaatu role, roiling the Earthlings into a frothy hysteria as they attempt to defend their puny empire of errand boys, grocery clerks, and elected buffoons. At dawn's early light, we await The Memo.
The New York Times was running veritable Chinese fire drills on its front page this morning denouncing The Memo in advance, shrieking about the end of the Republic, with the laughable caveat that… “None of this is to say the F.B.I. and the rest of the federal law enforcement apparatus should be immune from criticism or reform.” The Times editorial did not go into any detail about what exactly might invite that reform — like perhaps one top-rank agent telling another one that the “loathsome” president had to be gotten rid of at all costs.
The casual observer — say, one who is immune to the charms of Donald J. Trump — can't fail to notice that there is a bit more smoke emanating from the upper echelons of the FBI than has yet been seen in the sludgy narrative called “Russian Meddling in the 2016 Election.” Going into two years of that yarn, not one concrete detail has emerged. Meddled how? For all the “we now know” talking points uttered by Grand Inquisitor Rachel Maddow, it seems to me that we now know next to nothing about “collusion” between Russians and Trump, while we know a great deal about the indelicate behavior of FBI officers in important positions with grave responsibilities — government agents with the power to wreck lives — who cooked up an enormous hysteria in the body politic.
The situation certainly puts the nation in a quandary. An uncouth and ridiculous President called forth to battle a vicious, dishonest, bureaucracy and in particular its gigantic, out-of-control “security” apparatus, which appears to have been hijacked by politically interested parties — namely, the minions of Hillary Clinton. You have been reminded here before that history is the supreme prankster. In Fourth Turning terms, the poor old disintegrating USA pined for a “gray champion” and all it got was this booby prize: a Manhattan real estate schmikler with a mean streak. Well, that's how things roll in a long emergency. And this might only be the beginning of it.

The franchise owner of a Scunthorpe flooring and bed shop is citing a "family feel" for the store's continuing success.
Paul Beaumont, who has run United Carpets & Beds on Snowdonia Avenue since 2012, recently appointed their daughter Layla Dunn as branch manager, bringing their internal staff up to five members.
Mr Beaumont has experience of running three other branches within the franchise since 2004.
They said: "I've been in the United Carpets & Beds family for 13 years so I know that the success of the store is dependent on the team within.
"Bringing Layla into the Scunthorpe team was always on the cards.
"She's worked extensively in customer service roles and has always had an interest in what I'm doing at the store, so when the opportunity arose, we jumped at it.  They are as keen as I am to make the branch a huge success."
United Carpets & Beds' Scunthorpe branch has previously won accolades including Franchise Store of the Year 2014 and Franchise Bed Store of the Year 2016, under Mr Beaumont's ownership, out of 50 franchised branches nationwide.
They said: "We're in one of our busiest times of the year with Christmas around the corner, everyone feels the need to fix the house up for the festive period and with our team fitting up until Christmas Eve, we can ensure no one's left without new flooring for Christmas, or indeed beds.
"Much of our business is from repeat customers as they've been impressed with the products and service received.
"We've seen people through house moves and renovations, as well as working with local housing associations and hotels.
"We've got big-brand assurance but with family feeling and customer service at the core of what we do."
(Corrects paragraph 4 to say Starbucks Reserve Roastery opened in Shanghai, will also open in Tokyo and Chicago)
MILAN, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp said on Friday it was starting to recruit 150 people for its first outlet in Italy, the home of the espresso and a market the world's biggest coffee seller has yet to tap.
Starbucks has outlets in countries across Europe and around the world, but its plan to launch a high-end Reserve Roastery in Milan will be its first bid to attract Italian coffee drinkers.
The U.S. firm plans to launch the outlet in the autumn, offering coffee enthusiasts the chance to watch the process from roasting beans to pouring a shot, as well as tasting a range of coffees. It will be the first of its kind in Europe.
Starbucks has till now launched two Reserve Roasteries, in its hometown of Seattle, in 2014 and in Shanghai, in December 2017. The firm reportedly spent $20 million on the Seattle outlet. It says it plans to open ‘Roasteries' in New York, Tokyo and Chicago.
After the launch in Milan, its Italian commercial partner and licensee Percassi will open more typical Starbucks shops in the city later in the year, the company said.
A total of 300 people will be hired for its Italian stores in 2018, it said.
Other coffee makers like Lavazza have opened shops in Italy's financial capital, reflecting global competition among major brands to capture a growing market for people prepared to pay a premium for quality espresso coffees. (Reporting by Elisa Anzolin; Editing by Edmund Blair)

Using a wiki for documentation isn't a new idea. Countless open source projects do. If you're looking for a way to write and publish documentation quickly, a wiki can be a viable alternative to the many technical writing tools out there.
That said, the documentation on many wikis isn't always as effective as it could be, and you can use some techniques to help you make the documentation on your wiki more effective and more readable. You can use these tips whether you're creating new documentation on a wiki or if you're moving existing documentation to one.
Think outside of the "book"
I've learned one lesson from spending over 20 years in the trenches a technical writer: No one likes reading thick manuals. It doesn't matter if you start off writing documentation on a wiki or move your documentation to a wiki, those wikis can become online versions of thick manuals. Far too often an entire chapter in a manual becomes a single page on a wiki, and that's a lot of text and images for a reader to wade through using a browser.
Remember to move away from the model of the book. Instead, break your documentation into manageable chunks. Effective documentation on a wiki should be a structured collection of those chunks, and not just a big slab of information that's dropped in front of a reader.
You can do that using the principles of "topic-based writing." With topic-based writing, each portion of a document, such as reference material or a procedure, becomes a single wiki page (or a "topic"). For example, the introduction to a chapter is one page, a procedure is another page, and so on. If you have long procedures in your documentation, you can break them into several shorter pages.
You might have short pieces of content like a single-paragraph overview or a one- or two-step procedure. Putting content like that on its own page doesn't make sense. In fact, pages like that look out of place. Instead, keep that content where it is. You'll wind up with a slightly longer wiki page, but that's preferable to having a set of pages that seem like an afterthought.
Navigation is important
Taking a topic-based approach can result in disjointed documentation in which little, if any, continuity between topics exists, but it doesn't have to be that way.
You can get around the disjointed nature of topic-based documentation with proper navigation. Well-thought-out navigation helps readers to move around topics on a wiki easily and quickly and to find any additional information they might need.
What are the elements of good navigation? They include:
A detailed table of contents that readers can access wherever they are on the wiki
A set of landing pages containing links to groups of related content (for example, installation and upgrade procedures)
A set of links at the end of each page that point to related information
Adding links to your wiki pages involves a lot of manual work, but doing so is worthwhile because it makes your reader's experience much smoother.
Looks can matter
Documentation has to have an aesthetic strategy. It has to be friendly, not just in the way it's written, but in the way it presents itself. It should be easy to read, look attractive, and look like something you want to engage with. —Adam Hyde, co-founder of the Common Knowledge Foundation
Most documentation that appears on a wiki looks like… well, it looks like it's on a wiki. There's nothing wrong with that, but readers expect a bit more, and that means making the wiki itself attractive to readers. It should have the look and feel of your project's website. At the very least, consider using something other than your wiki's default skin.
Nothing says wiki like CamelCase in titles and headings. CamelCase in a page title or a heading is unsightly—it's visually jarring. Instead, add spaces between the words in a page's title or in headings. For example, instead of naming a page "WritingASimpleMacro" name it "Writing a Simple Macro." Adding those spaces goes a long way toward making a wiki page more visually appealing.
One final thought
Wikis can be very flexible and powerful tools for writing and delivering any kind of documentation. Ensuring that the documentation on a wiki is effective takes a bit of work, but that extra effort focuses that the documentation on the needs of your readers and makes it easy to use.

2018 U.S. NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS
SIMPLIFIED SELECTION CRITERIA – MOST OLYMPIC EVENTS
Top 1-4 to 2018 Pan Pacific Championships
Top 1-2 (from Nationals + Pan Pacs) to 2019 World Championships
1-2 more (students, not necessarily NCAA) to 2019 World University Games
1-2 more to 2019 Pan American Games
Much like the situation in the men's 50 free, the American women have one superstar, competitive with the best in the world, and then a large group jockeying for position behind them in the fastest race in swimming.
After an 8th place finish in the final at the 2015 World Championships, Simone Manuel has exploded onto the scene as one of the top female sprinters in the world. Carrying over the momentum from their historic 100m freestyle gold medal at the Rio Olympics, they won silver in the 50 in a time of 24.09, nearly four tenths faster than they were the previous summer in Kazan.
After another epic 100 free wins at the 2017 World Championships, the now 21-year-old followed up with a bronze in the 50, becoming the first American to ever crack the 24-second barrier in 23.97. The 14-time NCAA champion has already been 24.59 this season, their fastest ever outside of a major international or national competition, and should easily win the event at U.S. Nationals.
While Michael Andrew and Nathan Adrian are clearly the two horses in the race for the #2 spot in the men's race (behind Caeleb Dressel), the women's is much more wide open.
Last year it was Abbey Weitzeil, the 2016 Olympic Trials winner, who eked out a spot on the World
Championship team with a runner-up finish to Manuel in 24.74 after not even making the A-final of the 100 free. They would end up 15th in Budapest, and while that came at the end of a difficult year where they were transitioning to college life, they aren't any f
aster this past college season than they were in their first-year student year. She's certainly in the mix, having been faster in-season (25.08) this year than last (25.25), but has yet to find their 2016 form when they broke 25 seconds 14 times.
The woman who has emerged as the leading candidate for the #2 spot is 26-year-old Margo Geer, who's had a renaissance season of sorts after looking like they were done after the 2016 Olympic Trials.
They placed a disappointing 16th in Omaha, over a half second off their personal best, and raced sparsely in 2017, including not attending the World Championship Trials. They wound up 5th at the U.S. Open in August, finishing the season as the 27th fastest American at 25.58, but has really exploded in 2018.
Only breaking 25 seconds once in their career prior to this year (24.95 in 2014), Geer has now been under nine times in 2018, with their fastest swim of 24.72 sitting 2nd among Americans and 16th in the world for the year. Along with the fact she's been consistently fast all year, only Manuel has been faster than Geer's 24.72 since the beginning of the 2016-17 season, which bodes well for their chances of qualifying for the Pan Pacs this summer and the World Championships next year.
Along with Manuel and Geer, there are two other Americans under 25 seconds this season: Madison Kennedy and Mallory Comerford.
The 30-year-old Kennedy has been on the cusp of breaking onto a major international team for many years, but has always fallen just short. They were 5th at the 2012 Olympic Trials, 3rd in 2016, and was also two one-hundredths shy of making the Pan Pacs four years ago. Already faster this year (24.88) than they were at World Trials last year (24.95), she'll be a major factor once again.
Comerford is known best for their ability across the 100 and 200 metre distances, but showed they have the raw speed to be competitive in this event last summer when they finished 6th at World Trials (with a PB 24.88 in prelims). She's already been 24.94 this year, which was done in the first round of the three-round shootout in Mesa (where they won with subsequent swims of 25.00 and 25.10). With that consistency, and being over three tenths faster than their fastest in-season swim in 2017 (25.28), they could very well be setting up for a 24-mid in late July.
While Comerford and Kennedy were 6th and 7th last year in Indianapolis, the 3rd, 4th and 5th place finishers were all within a tenth of Weitzeil's 24.74 and World's qualification.
Lia Neal and Kelsi Dahlia both swam personal bests of 24.77 and 24.79, and Olivia Smoliga was 24.84 after going 24.70 the year prior in Omaha. All three will be in contention once again, but with Dahlia putting more focus on the 200 fly and Smoliga expandin
g their range out into the 200 back, they may lose a bit of their edge.
Texas Longhorn commit Grace Ariola was the 8th swimmer in that final, and after gaining experience there, went on to win silver at the World Junior Championships in a lifetime best 24.82. That put their 5th among U.S. swimmers for the season, and if they can take a small step forward this year, could surprise the more established names.
Two other names to keep an eye on: Erika Brown and Katie McLaughlin.
Brown, who had a breakout collegiate season with Tennessee, didn't even race long course at all last year, and came into 2018 with the best of 26.01 from 2015. She's already been faster than that on three occasions, including a 25.21 in June which ranks their 9th in the country. Taking into account they were the runner-up to Manuel at NCAAs in 21.51, no one really knows what their ceiling is and them cracking the 25-second barrier in Irvine looks to be in the cards.
McLaughlin, traditionally a 100/200 butterflier who dabbled in the same distances in freestyle, has taken up the 50 much more this year, and has stated they really enjoys the sprints. It's worked so far, having been their fastest ever at 25.19, and like Brown, sub-25 seems to be only a matter of time.
Others who could make their way into the A-final with a big swim: Caroline Baldwin, Anika Apostalon and 15-year-old rising star Gretchen Walsh.
TOP-8 PREDICTIONS
Darkhorse: 17-year-old Anya Goeders swam a startling 24.85 to win the 2016 Junior Pan Pac title, and wasn't far off with a 25.14 showing in 2017. She's only the 66th fastest American this year at 26.43, but certainly has the potential to battle for a top finish with a return to form.
Clint Bowyer is in their happy place.
They look around and sees a racing family and not a vagabond cluster of people who, despite the best intentions, could never make things work.
Bowyer did an apprenticeship of sorts in 2016 at HScott Motorsports, a year-long pit stop as they waited for a far more competitive ride. They already are signed to replace Tony Stewart in 2017 at Stewart-Haas Racing, and the interim gig was good to keep them in the game.
But not in the game competitively, with a team that just doesn't have the resources to challenge NASCAR's handful of super teams. Predictably, Bowyer finished 27th in points.
Their move to Stewart-Haas has reunited Bowyer with Stewart. They have been friends for a long while and share an affinity for short-track racing, among other pursuits.
Stewart usually sits on the pit box when Bowyer races. He's not playing favorites among an elite stable that includes Kevin Harvick and Kurt Busch and a struggling tag-along in Danica Patrick.
But it's a natural fit for Bowyer because the No. 14 was Stewart's ride. The change has been good for Stewart too as they transition from driver to team-owner full-time in 2017.
“It's everything you were hoping for and dreamed it could be,” Bowyer said last week during a promotional event in Daytona Beach for the Coke Zero 400. “He's good. It really surprised me. Our relationship has always been fun and lighthearted but when they stepped up and put me on that car that meant a lot to me.”
And Bowyer has reciprocated, doing their thing as a 12-year Cup veteran. Although they have yet to win a race this season, they have been strong and steady, currently 10th in points, with two top-five finishes and five top 10s.
Bowyer, 38, has never won a Cup title and has not won in a Cup car dating to 2012, but he's the quintessential wheelman, a guy you can always count on to give you a competitive ride no matter the configuration of the track. They finished 17th at Pocono last weekend.
“I think that reality is there,” Bowyer said when asked if reality met expectations. “We're running exactly how we hoped we would run. We've had our chances and are going to have more chances.”
There's no sugar-coating the down-in-the-dumpster ride of 2016. There was only so much Bowyer could do, and it was never going to be enough.
“The last year and a half has been miserable,” they said during Speedweeks in Daytona. “That isn't how I want my kid to remember me. He's 2½ years old now and I want to be able for them to see me in victory lane and for them to be in victory lane and when it's all said and done, you look over when you're 50-some years old that there's a picture of your whole family in victory lane. That's what I race for.”
It's an image that sticks with Bowyer every time they go out for a ride with their competitive team.
‘Generation Next'
Mommies and daddies, if you want to get your kids fixated on becoming “Generation Next” NASCAR fans, take them to a movie. Specifically, Pixar's “Cars 3,” which opens Friday in theaters nationwide.
Bubba Wallace, Ryan Blaney, Chase Elliott and Daniel Suarez are among the voices behind the animated characters. That is very new-school and inclusive. Check out the Pixar bio for Wallace's character:
“Next-gen stock car racer Bubba Wheelhouse Jr. is a fast and tenacious young racer who knows how to win. A champion for diversity, Wheelhouse believes that all race cars deserve a chance on the track.”
But there's something in it for the old-school types. Darrell Cartrip, a veteran Piston-Cup announcer, features the voice of NASCAR Hall of Famer Darrell Waltrip.
“For the first ‘Cars,' we didn't have much of a [formal] relationship with them,” Jay Ward, Pixar's creative director and car specialist, said in a recent interview. “They were much more receptive this time.”
Federal and local authorities evacuated a terminal at the Port of Charleston in South Carolina on Wednesday to investigate a “potential threat” in a container ship, the U.S. Coast Guard said.
Coast Guard officials described the threat as a possible “dirty bomb” on the Maersk Memphis ship docked in the Wando Terminal, where hazardous materials crews and rescue workers were seen working, an NBC affiliate in South Carolina reported.
Bomb threat coverage on Globalnews.ca:
The U.S. Coast Guard said in statement authorities were made aware of the potential threat in a container aboard the vessel at about 8 p.m. local time (midnight GMT) and that the terminal had been evacuated.

Pirelli cyber tire infographic Enlarge Photo
While Goodyear envisions a future tire that cleans as it rolls, Pirelli's latest tire is set to arrive this year. It's called Cyber Car and it's a tire that connects the rubber with the car and provides loads of information and data.
With the latest Pirelli innovation, the tire can relay information such as air pressure, internal temperature, and tread depth. All of the information comes via a tiny sensor that Pirelli said weighs less than an ounce. But, the tire won't just look at data, it will help make adjustments for drivers, too.
The tire can communicate with the car to activate the ABS and traction control systems when needed, and soon-to-come cars will be able to adjust their setups based on the tire's identification. The tire can provide the vehicle accurate weight figures to display a more exact driving range, which is especially useful for electric cars. As for maintenance, the tire can let drivers know about specific information on tread wear and when a rotation is required, plus Pirelli will offer a suite of services such as roadside assistance and valet.
The company said the very first cars with the Pirelli Cyber Car tires are coming this year, as several manufacturers (though we don't know which) are working to integrate the system into their vehicles' computer systems.
In addition to sending the information to your car, the information from the tires will also go to the Pirelli Cloud and drivers will be able to get messages via a smarphone app.
Pirelli already offers colored tires, and some models that "talk" via an app, as well as tires with various color sidewalls.

The buck doesn't stop at the Cyber Car tire, though. Pirelli's next step is the Cyber Tire that the company wants to bring to market in the near future. Its sensors will provide data with every rotation of the tire in real time. We don't know when it will arrive, but the technology is already in use in the Ferrari FKKX, the marque's track-only LaFerrari-based hypercar.
The past two weeks have certainly been trying times for On Rock president Kim Reid. First — they received a phone call saying the roof of the Pierrefonds food bank was caving in. Water had melted on the roof and was seeping through a massive leak.
This is what On Rock's soup kitchen dining room looked like after water from a melt two weeks ago seeped through the roof. @Global_Montreal pic.twitter.com/Kj7A9MlRJd — Billy Shields (@billyshields) February 2, 2018
“It was a huge mess,” Reid said.
A week later, the van the organization uses for deliveries broke down. The mechanic's diagnosis: get a new van. Reid has been relying on the generosity of On Rock's roughly 100 volunteers to make food deliveries to the needy people who use the service.
The van really sounds bad — to my uneducated ears it sounds like it has thrown a rod. Apparently the mechanic told On Rock simply to scrap it. @Global_Montreal pic.twitter.com/XkjVBjoaZF — Billy Shields (@billyshields) February 2, 2018
“We're trying to figure out how to continue,” they said.
More people are using On Rock's services than ever before — the group had to institute a waiting list to deal with the influx of refugee families they serve. Currently some 300 refugee households are On Rock clients.
On Rock is asking the public for any assistance it can get in the coming days. Reid said the organization needs to double its warehouse space in order to effectively continue to deliver its services.
The Southern Illinois University Edwardsville Center for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Research, Education and Outreach, the Madison County Housing Authority, and the Mannie Jackson Center for the Humanities Foundation have partnered to educate and inspire young females through STEM-related lessons.
“Take a piece of foil, put it in the baking soda, and then we're going to keep this the same test each time,” STEM center resource center manager Colin Wilson told a room of approximately 20 girls in Madison, who were eager to learn more about hand pollinators.
Wilson traveled throughout February, March and April to Madison and two other housing authority locations, in Venice and Alton, to teach STEM lessons to nearly 50 young girls. The lessons highlighted such topics as water pollution, filtering contaminated water, reusing greywater, agricultural engineering and hand pollinators.
“We're testing different materials like pipe cleaners, marbles and pom-poms to see how much pollen they pick up and drop,” 13-year-old Malia King said. “I like to do these fun experiments.”
The goal of the partnership is to prepare young females for a bright future. The STEM center's high-impact community engagement practice complements the goals of the housing authority's after-school programming.
“Current statistics show that 89 percent of Madison County Housing Authority family apartments have female head of households,” housing authority Executive Director Andy Hightower said. “In an effort to decrease this percentage, we have developed programs that target young females. We feel that if the MCHA can provide young females with the tools and skills necessary to become successful women, it will have a positive impact on the community as a whole.
“These young women will be better prepared to obtain a good-paying job and purchase homes, thereby decreasing the number of females needing low-income housing in the future.”
“The STEM center wants to reach as much of the region as we can,” Wilson said. “Working with organizations like the MCHA, that already have a program in place, allows us to use our resources efficiently and effectively. This type of after-school experience is exactly what research has shown to increase student engagement, and as a result, lifelong interest in STEM topics.”
“The MJCHF is proud to partner with the MCHA and the SIUE STEM Center, as SIUE has developed a proven reputation for its outreach programming in underrepresented and low-income areas,” foundation Executive Director Dr. Ed Hightower said. “The MJCHF believes it has a moral obligation to foster positive interaction of youth through STEM and other educational opportunities. The foundation's focus is inclusiveness of youth of different cultures, races and ethnicities. Many of the youth served by the MJCHF reside in public low-income housing developments and live at or below the poverty level, with limited access to healthy STEM opportunities.”
Student feedback underscores the excitement for learning that is being generated by the STEM center's engaging and interactive programming.
“I might grow up and need to know this,” 11-year-old Kalyn Belford said. “I like science and the experiments we do. I aspire to be a fashion designer. So, I'll need to know math, and how to do measurements and adjustments.”
“The students that participate in our program are grateful that we are providing such an opportunity that allows them to learn while having fun and thinking out of the box,” housing authority program director Marie Nelson said. “They often express that information learned through this program will help them make wise choices later in life when they are seeking their career.”

MULTAN-Senior politician Makhdoom Javed Hashmi has warned that the masses will never tolerate those insulting their vote, adding that victimisation, instead of accountability, will further deteriorate the situation in the country.
Talking to the media here after attending a function in connection with Independence Day on Monday, they said that if gravity of the situation is gauged not realised seriously, the conditions could lead towards the worst consequences. “The country had disintegrated in the past. If the vote is disrespected again, God forbid the country may disintegrate again,” they warned. They noted that stability, progress and prosperity of the country is dependent on the ballot (vote) and thus it should not be disrespected.
They were of the opinion that Article 62 and 63 contradicted national interest as a dictator included these articles in the constitution to prolong their rule. They asserted that amending the constitution is the right of the parliament. They said that the existence of the country depends on vote as this country came into being with vote and it would continue to exist only with the vote.
They said that Qadri and Imran Khan are not leaders but the puppets. They said that they had already told that Nawaz Sharif would become even stronger and more popular if forced out. “I want to warn the nation again that conspiracies are being manufactured by the PTI,” they added. They said that they had also informed the PML-N leaders about these conspiracies but they said that nothing would happen. “But see the worst has happened,” they claimed.
They said that they were not against the accountability of Nawaz Sharif. “But the people naturally come out if the person, whom they elect as their Prime Minister, is forced to leave Aiwan,” they added. They said that this situation would deliver losses to the country and nation. They reiterated that the court should summon him.
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's top court ruled on Wednesday that a British lesbian should be granted a spousal visa in a landmark judgment that could open the door for expatriate same-sex partners to move to the Chinese-ruled city.
The British woman, who requested to be identified only as QT in court, sued the director of immigration in 2014 after they were denied a spousal visa that would have granted their resident status and allowed them to work without the need for a separate visa.
The woman and their partner, a dual British and South African national identified only as SS and who was offered work in Hong Kong, had entered into a civil partnership in Britain. QT did not appear in court.
“Although I cannot be with you in person today, that does not diminish the joy I feel, knowing that Hong Kong's highest court has upheld my right, as a lesbian woman, to be treated equally by the Hong Kong government,” QT said in a statement.
They plan to live in Hong Kong, instead of flying back and forth to Britain as they have been doing for years.
“I won't feel like a second citizen anymore and I can have the basic rights like anyone else, from as simple as having a library card to having healthcare,” they told reporters by phone.
The unanimous ruling by five judges, upholding a lower court's decision, brings to an end the case involving rights for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community, which won support from more than 30 global banks and law firms, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.
“This ruling strengthens Hong Kong's ability to attract global talent and its competitiveness as Asia's pre-eminent global centre for commerce,” the companies said in a statement.
The decision goes beyond immigration and effectively recognises the rights of local and foreign same-sex couples who legally entered civil partnerships abroad, said the British woman's lawyer, Michael Vidler.
“We never argued this case is about same-sex marriage for Hong Kong, but we hope this case will pave the way for exactly that,” they said outside the Court of Final Appeal.
Hong Kong's Immigration Department said it respected the ruling.
“We are studying the judgment carefully and shall seek legal advice as necessary before deciding the way forward,” it said.

“SHAKY FOUNDATIONS”
Hong Kong could become the first Asian jurisdiction to officially grant dependent visas to same-sex partners, even though it already makes some exceptions to diplomats.
Foreign diplomats in mainland China also say the Chinese government has been issuing de facto spousal visas to same-sex partners in recent years.
Although Taiwan set a precedent in Asia last year when its constitutional court ruled that same-sex couples have the right to legally marry, gay marriage has not been legalised yet.
An official website stated that same-sex spouses do not qualify as spouses for immigration purposes.
Japan does not officially grant dependent visas to same-sex couples, but some married foreign couples say they managed to get one.
Hong Kong is a popular destination for expatriates, many of whom work in the city's financial services and legal sectors.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in 1991, although marriage is legally defined as a monogamous union between a man and a woman. It does not recognise same-sex marriage.
There is no law against sexual discrimination in the territory which is governed under a “one country, two systems” formula that promises it a high degree of autonomy, a legal system separate from that of mainland China and an independent judiciary.
In a 45-page judgment, the judges said the director of immigration's assertion that an obvious difference existed between marriage and a civil partnership rested on “shaky foundations”.
The court also said that while the director of immigration's policy aimed to attract foreign talent, the act of rejecting same-sex partners was counter-productive.
It had not allowed the 31 global banks and law firms' to join in the court case, but acknowledged their effort in the judgment.
“As is evident from the attempted intervention of the banks and law firms, the ability to bring in dependants is an important issue for persons deciding whether to move to Hong Kong,” it said.
Veteran LGBT activist Billy Leung, who arrived at court with a small rainbow flag, said they knew at least six same-sex couples who had chosen not to move to Hong Kong or had left the city in the past five years over what they described as a lack of LGBT-friendly policies.
“The struggle is real,” they said.

The Trump administration on Friday announced it will continue much of the Obama administration's nuclear weapons policy, but take a more aggressive stance toward Russia. It said Russia must be convinced it would face “unacceptably dire costs” if it were to threaten even a limited nuclear attack in Europe.
The sweeping review of U.S. nuclear policy does not call for any net increase in strategic nuclear weapons – a position that stands in contrast to President Donald Trump's statement, in a tweet shortly before they took office, that the U.S. “must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.” In their State of the Union address Tuesday, they made no mention of expansion, though they said the arsenal must deter acts of aggression.
WATCH: Russia opposes U.S. bid to change Iran nuclear deal
A 74-page report summarizing the review's findings calls North Korea a “clear and grave threat” to the U.S. and its allies. It asserts that any North Korean nuclear attack against the U.S. or its allies will result in “the end of that regime.”
It also cast China as a potential nuclear adversary, saying the U.S. arsenal is tailored to “prevent Beijing from mistakenly concluding” that it could gain advantage by using its nuclear weapons in Asia, or that “any use of nuclear weapons, however limited, is acceptable.”
WATCH: Russian FM hits back at U.S. attempts to change Iran nuclear deal
The Pentagon-led review of the U.S. nuclear arsenal and the policies that govern it was ordered by Trump a year ago. In a written statement, Trump said U.S. strategy is designed to make use of nuclear weapons less likely. In an apparent reference to the threat of catastrophic cyberattack, they said the U.S. aims to strengthen deterrence of major attacks against the U.S. and its allies, including those that “may not come in the form of nuclear weapons.”
Known officially as a nuclear posture review, and customarily done at the outset of a new administration, the report drew blistering criticism from arms control groups.
WATCH: State of the Union: Trump wants to restore military, nuclear arsenal
“President Trump is embarking on a reckless path – one that will reduce U.S. security both now and in the longer term,” said Lisbeth Gronlund, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. They said the administration is blurring the line between nuclear and conventional war-fighting.
The Trump administration concluded that the U.S. should largely follow its predecessor's blueprint for modernizing the nuclear arsenal, including new bomber aircraft, submarines and land-based missiles. It also endorsed adhering to existing arms control agreements, including the New START treaty that limits the United States and Russia each to 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads on a maximum of 700 deployed launchers.
READ MORE: U.S. to broaden nuclear weapons capabilities, citing ‘increased uncertainty and risk'
The treaty, negotiated under President Barack Obama, entered into force on Feb. 5, 2011, and its weapons limits must be met by Monday. The U.S. says it has been in compliance with the limits since August and it expects the Russians to comply by Monday's deadline. As of Sept. 1, the last date for which official figures are available, Russia was below the launcher limit but slightly above the warhead limit, at 1,561.
“Moscow has repeatedly stated its intention to meet those limits on time, and we have no reason to believe that that won't be the case,” State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said Thursday.
The Pentagon's nuclear review concluded that while arms control can advance American interests, “further progress is difficult to envision,” in light of what the U.S. considers Russia's aggression in Ukraine and violations of existing arms deals. Administration officials briefed Russian and Chinese officials Friday prior to the review's public release.

The Trump nuclear doctrine breaks with Obama's in ending their push to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in U.S. defence policy. Like Obama, Trump would consider using nuclear weapons only in “extreme circumstances,” while maintaining a degree of ambiguity about what that means. But Trump sees a fuller deterrent role for these weapons, as reflected in the plan to develop new capabilities to counter Russia in Europe.
The administration's view is that Russian policies and actions are fraught with potential for miscalculation leading to an uncontrolled escalation of conflict in Europe. It specifically points to a Russian doctrine known as “escalate to de-escalate,” in which Moscow would use or threaten to use smaller-yield nuclear weapons in a limited, conventional conflict in Europe in the belief that doing so would compel the U.S. and NATO to back down.
WATCH: Kissinger warns North Korean nuclear program is ‘irreversible'
“Recent Russian statements on this evolving nuclear weapons doctrine appear to lower the threshold for Moscow's first-use of nuclear weapons,” the review said.
The administration proposes a two-step solution.
First, it would modify “a small number” of existing long-range ballistic missiles carried by Trident strategic submarines to fit them with smaller-yield nuclear warheads. John Rood, the undersecretary of defence for policy, declined to provide an estimate of the cost, saying it would be partially included in the 2019 budget that will be submitted to Congress later this month. They said the missile would be fielded “in the near term,” but they refused to be more specific.
Second, “in the longer term,” the administration would develop a nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missile – re-establishing a weapon that existed during the Cold War but was retired in 2011 by the Obama administration.
Robert Soofer, a senior nuclear policy official at the Pentagon who helped direct the policy review, said Moscow is likely to push back on the U.S. plan for fielding those two additional weapons.
“I'm sure they won't respond well,” Soofer said Thursday.
The press secretary at the Russian Embassy in Washington, Nikolay Lakhonin, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
MALE (Reuters) - As domestic and international pressure mounts, the Maldives has delayed complying with a Supreme Court order for the immediate release and new trials of nine opposition leaders, freeing them to contest presidential elections this year.
The Indian Ocean nation has been mired in political unrest since Mohamed Nasheed, its first democratically elected leader, was ousted in 2012. They have been in exile on medical grounds from a 13-year jail sentence on terrorism charges.
The Supreme Court on Thursday said the trials of Nasheed and eight others, many of whom had challenged President Abdulla Yameen, had violated the constitution and international law. It found that prosecutors and judges were unduly influenced “to conduct politically motivated investigations” against them.
On Friday, Attorney General Mohamed Anil said they had held discussions with Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed over the administration's concerns about releasing individuals whose offences ranged from terrorism to corruption and treason.
“The prosecutor general is currently in the process of examining the cases to determine the best way to proceed with the implementation of the Supreme Court's ruling, and the prosecutor general will present recommendations at the earliest,” the government said in a statement.
The unexpected ruling frees opposition leaders to run against Yameen in the presidential poll expected to be completed by October. The terrorism convictions would normally bar them from competing unless they received presidential pardons after completing a third of their jail terms.
The joint opposition of the Maldives expressed concern over Yameen's refusal to abide by the order.
“We are deeply fearful that the government's refusal to implement the Supreme Court order could escalate to unrest and incite violence across the country,” it said in a statement.
Hundreds of opposition supporters chanted slogans such as “Enforce the Supreme Court ruling,” and “Defend the constitution,” in a Friday night rally outside the opposition MDP campaign center in Male, the capital.
The United Nations, the United States, the European Union and India also urged Yameen's government to follow the ruling.
In a statement, the office of U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, “The Secretary-General reiterates their belief in finding a solution to the political stalemate in the Maldives through all-party talks, which the United Nations continues to stand ready to facilitate.”
“We understand the situation is extremely tense,” Rupert Colville, a spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights told reporters on Friday.
The agency was “closely watching how the situation develops in the aftermath of Thursday's decisions by the Supreme Court, and in particular, the reactions of the government, military and police,” they added.
The European Union urged the government to hold “inclusive dialogue with the leaders of all political parties that should pave the way for credible, transparent and inclusive elections”.
Nasheed, who has been in exile in Britain, had sought U.N. help to restore the political rights of which they were stripped after a trial denounced as hasty and unfair by the United Nations human rights chief.
Thursday's decision also nullified a ruling in which 12 lawmakers lost their parliamentary seats for defecting last July from Yameen's ruling party, costing them their majority in the 85-member legislature.
Eating almonds on a regular basis may help boost levels of HDL cholesterol while simultaneously improving the way it removes cholesterol from the body, according to researchers.
In a study, researchers compared the levels and function of high-density lipoprotein (HDL cholesterol) in people who ate almonds every day, to the HDL levels and function of the same group of people when they ate a muffin instead. The researchers found that while participants were on the almond diet, their HDL levels and functionality improved.
Penny Kris-Etherton, distinguished professor of nutrition at Penn State, said the study, published in the Journal of Nutrition, builds on previous research on the effects of almonds on cholesterol-lowering diets.
“There's a lot of research out there that shows a diet that includes almonds lowers low-density lipoprotein, or LDL cholesterol, which is a major risk factor for heart disease,” Kris-Etherton said. “But not as much was known about how almonds affect HDL cholesterol, which is considered good cholesterol and helps lower your risk of heart disease.”
The researchers wanted to see if almonds could not just increase the levels but also improve the function of HDL cholesterol, which works by gathering cholesterol from tissues, like the arteries, and helping to transport it out of the body.
“HDL is very small when it gets released into circulation,” Kris-Etherton said. “It's like a garbage bag that slowly gets bigger and more spherical as it gathers cholesterol from cells and tissues before depositing them in the liver to be broken down.”
Depending on how much cholesterol it has collected, HDL cholesterol is categorized into five “subpopulations,” which range from the very small preβ-1 to the larger, more mature α-1. The researchers hoped that eating almonds would result in more α-1 particles, which would signal improved HDL function.
In the controlled-feeding study, 48 men and women with elevated LDL cholesterol participated in two six-week diet periods. In both, their diets were identical except for the daily snack. On the almond diet, participants received 43 grams — about a handful — of almonds a day. During the control period, they received a banana muffin instead.
At the end of each diet period, the researchers measured the levels and function of each participant's HDL cholesterol. The researchers then compared the results to the participants' baseline measurements taken at the beginning of the study.
The researchers found that compared to the control diet, the almond diet increased α-1 HDL — when the particles are at their largest size and most mature stage — by 19 percent. Additionally, the almond diet improved HDL function by 6.4 percent, in participants of normal weight.
“We were able to show that there were larger particles in response to consuming the almonds compared to not consuming almonds,” Kris-Etherton said. “That would translate to the smaller particles doing what they're supposed to be doing. They're going to tissues and pulling out cholesterol, getting bigger, and taking that cholesterol to the liver for removal from the body.”
An increase in this particular HDL subpopulation is meaningful, Kris-Etherton explained, because the particles have been shown to decrease overall risk of cardiovascular disease.
Kris-Etherton said that while almonds will not eliminate the risk of heart disease, they may be a smart choice for a healthy snack. They added that in addition to their heart-healthy benefits, almonds also provide a dose of good fats, vitamin E and fiber.
“If people incorporate almonds into their diet, they should expect multiple benefits, including ones that can improve heart health,” Kris-Etherton said. “They're not a cure-all, but when eaten in moderation — and especially when eaten instead of food of lower nutritional value — they're a great addition to an already healthy diet.”

The Emmy-nominated Giancarlo Esposito will be making their anticipated return to AMC tonight for Better Call Saul, the prequel series to Breaking Bad. Fans know how restaurateur, industrial laundry tycoon, and drug kingpin Gus Fring met their end in the acclaimed series, but now we'll get to see how the Chilean mastermind got their start. Or at least where they were a few years before Walter White waltzed into their life.
In an extensive chat with EW ahead of tonight's Season 3 episode “Witness”, Esposito laid bare why they chose to return to the role, how the timing of Better Call Saul will work out regarding Fring, just how much we'll see of their formative years, and how he'll cross paths with other familiar faces of Breaking Bad. We've pulled some of Esposito's best quotes below to give you a taste of what's to come with Fring's return.
Here's how Esposito described the somewhat lengthy process of deciding to return as Gustavo Fring and whether or not the character's original, explosive end gave them pause:
It's not because of the ending; it really is because I didn't really know how Gus would fit into a show about Saul. I knew that Saul was conceived as a comedy and then got to be a dramedy. Loved the show, loved what Bob does, didn't know how Gus would fit into it. So I heard, like the public, rumors that Gus might come to the show. And I got a phone call of inquiry: Would I be willing? I said I'd be willing predicated on a conversation with Vince [Gilligan, Breaking Bad‘s creator who created Saul with Peter Gould] … I respect Vince very, very deeply as I do Peter Gould and all the writers who helped to make Saul a hit in and of itself, outside of Breaking Bad. They assured me that they were going to find the way that would be intriguing and interesting, and I said if that could happen I would come back. It had to be for more than one episode. I'm imagining what Vince was thinking is to take it up to where we begin in Breaking Bad — possibly.
Esposito joked, with almost certainly some degree of sincerity, about a spinoff series titled The Rise of Gus, but here's how they see their character fitting into the prequel:
Raymond Wallace Baker, 76, died Sunday, Feb. 12, 2017, in Jerseyville.
Services were private. A celebration of life will be at 4 p.m. Thursday, Feb. 16, at the Do Drop Inn.
Gent Funeral Home is handling arrangements.
British police declared a major incident Wednesday after a man and a woman were exposed to an unknown substance close to the city of Salisbury, where a Russian former spy and their daughter were poisoned with nerve agent four months ago.
Emergency services were called to the town of Amesbury in Wiltshire county in southern England, after the pair, both in their 40s, were found unconscious in a property Saturday evening.
“They are both currently receiving treatment for suspected exposure to an unknown substance at Salisbury District Hospital. They are both in a critical condition,” Wiltshire Police said in a statement.
Police said the two were initially thought to have used heroin or crack cocaine from a contaminated batch of drugs, but that more testing was now being carried out to determine the nature of the substance.
British tabloid newspaper The Sun reported that the two were poisoned and that samples were sent to Porton Down, the nearby government laboratory, for testing.
The Sun reported that security chiefs fear that they could have been poisoned with same batch of Soviet-developed nerve agent used on Sergei Skripal, 66, and their daughter Yulia, 33, who were found unresponsive on a bench about 10 miles away in Salisbury on March 4.
London's Metropolitan Police Service said that counterterrorism officers were working with local police on the investigation, “given the recent events in Salisbury."
The places the Amesbury pair — whose identities weren't immediately released — frequented before they became ill have been cordoned off in Amesbury and Salisbury as a precaution and police patrols have increased. The Sun reported that they are not known to have any links to Russia or security services.
Public health officials said there is not believed to be a significant health risk to the public, but this “will be continually assessed as further information becomes known.”
Britain says the Skripals were poisoned with Novichok nerve agent and blames Russia. The Kremlin denies any responsibility. Sergei Skripal was jailed in Russia in 2006 for passing state secrets to Britain. They were released as part of a spy swap in 2010 and moved to Salisbury.
That poisoning incident has soured relations between Russia and many British allies including the expulsion of hundreds of diplomats on both sides.

President Trump finds themselves at the center of criticism over their “many sides” response to violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va. I'm Davan Maharaj, editor-in-chief of the Los Angeles Times. Here are some story lines I don't want you to miss today.
TOP STORIES
When Trump's Silence on Right-Wing Hate Groups Speaks Volumes
The images from Charlottesville, Va., cut to the core: white supremacist groups marching with Nazi and Confederate flags to protest the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee; armed militia members on the streets; violent clashes between the protesters and counter-protesters; a car attack on a crowd of anti-racism activists that killed a 32-year-old woman; the deaths of two police officers in a helicopter crash. President Trump's response condemning the “hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides” drew a chorus of criticism for failing to explicitly call out right-wing hate groups. (Vice President Mike Pence and Trump's daughter Ivanka were among those who did call out the groups by name Sunday.) Once again, the White House scrambled to explain what Trump really meant.
After the Terror in Charlottesville
As a gang of white supremacists was beating him, De'Andre Harris said they wondered why police were not rushing to defend him. In the aftermath of the weekend's violence, as officers stood guard in riot gear and police snipers positioned themselves on rooftops, he's not the only Charlottesville resident questioning whether the city and police had been properly prepared. Meanwhile, details emerged of those who died, including the woman killed in what national security advisor H.R. McMaster has labeled an act of terrorism.

-- CIA Director Mike Pompeo said Trump would consider it “unacceptable” for North Korea to possess a nuclear-armed ballistic missile capable of striking the United States, but Pompeo also said they saw no imminent threat of North Korea attacking the U.S.
-- Trump will start a process that could lead to action against China, which has been accused of stealing American businesses' intellectual property, even as they seek Beijing's help against nuclear threats from North Korea.
-- Trump on Friday introduced the possibility of another military confrontation, this time with Venezuela.
‘Giant Sucking Sound' or Not, NAFTA Is Under Review
Remember that “giant sucking sound” of job losses Ross Perot warned of when the North American Free Trade Agreement was being negotiated in the 1990s? Though economists are divided on NAFTA's effects, it's a fair bet the rhetoric will heat up once again as Mexican officials arrive in Washington this week to begin rewriting the terms of the landmark deal. They know President Trump needs to be able to point to something as a win. Here's what Mexican negotiators hope to achieve and to avoid.
Republicans Feel the Heat After Supporting a Climate Change Law
A Republican National Committee member calls it “a big fat skunk on our plate.” Tea party members are incensed. But California Assembly Republican Leader Chad Mayes says he's happy they joined with Democrats to extend the state's cap-and-trade program on climate change. Their one regret? They didn't attend Gov. Jerry Brown's signing. And Mayes isn't the only Republican getting heat for the bipartisan gesture.
How Congress Stymied a Pot Bust
When federal agents raided a farm in Humboldt County, they found more than 300 marijuana plants, guns, $225,000 in cash and bars of gold and silver. The two owners pleaded guilty to a federal charge of conspiring to manufacture and sell marijuana. But a U.S. district judge in San Francisco has put a stop to the case. Why? An unusual budget rule in Congress co-written by GOP Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of Costa Mesa. It could be a serious legal hurdle for U.S. Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions.
More Kids Get Their Shots, but Schools Could Still Use a Booster
Public health advocates cheered when a new state law boosted the percentage of California kindergartners who were fully vaccinated to 96% last year. Even so, hundreds of schools across the state still have so many children lacking full immunization that they pose an increased risk of outbreaks of diseases such as measles, according to a Times data analysis. The number of medical exemptions tripled. Check out this database to see how the schools near you fare.
Recycling is something just about everyone does, but Kingston Area Recycling Centre says not everyone is doing it right.
Glass and plastic containers, along with metal tins, need to be washed out before they're tossed in the bin.

That's something Tobi Payant says they do impeccably. “They're washed out probably as well as my kitchen dishes.”
Yet some items can be a challenge to clean before tossing, like peanut butter containers. Peter Brittain says some of those jars may be less than pristine when they put them in their blue box. “I will admit that with peanut butter, and stuff that are really sticky, we don't always get them clean.”
Understandable, perhaps. But also problematic, says the Kingston Area Recycling Centre. The centre handles about 11,500 of tonnes of material each year, says Heather Roberts, solid waste manager. “We get your recycling, and we market it. It goes back out to people that can turn it into new products.”
About five per cent of the materials the centre collects are too dirty to market, so it ends up in a land fill.
That may not sound too bad — until you convert it to tonnes. Roberts says it's substantial. “About 500 tonnes per year of what we receive into this facility ends up going back out to landfill.”
Those materials have to be sorted out manually. If too many dirty items get through, Roberts says the recyclables can end up being sent back to the municipal recycling centre. “That extra work costs a lot of money.”
Roberts says there are really only two options when it comes to the contaminated containers.

“If you don't want to be using water and soap to clean it out, then my suggestion, unfortunately, is to put the container into the garbage,” Roberts says.
Not ideal but it does save the recycling centre time and money.
(Reuters) - Bournemouth are focused on their primary target of securing their Premier League status and not chasing their highest finish in the top flight, skipper Simon Francis has said.
Bournemouth thumped champions Chelsea 3-0 at Stamford Bridge in midweek to climb to 10th in the table with 28 points from 25 games. The club enjoyed their best campaign in the top flight last season finishing ninth.
“We have our eye on maintaining our Premier League status. That has always been the most important thing and has been in the past two seasons. Then, we ask where can we go and can we kick on,” defender Francis told the Daily Echo.
“We know how tight it is and how important wins are. We are six games unbeaten and want to try to break the club record in the top flight. We have three massive games coming up and that is why it was important for us to be in a good position.”
Bournemouth welcome Stoke City in the league on Saturday before a trip to Huddersfield Town and the visit of Newcastle United, with all three teams level on 24 points, a point above the relegation zone.
The south-coast club endured a tough start to the campaign and dropped to 18th after a 4-0 hammering by leaders Manchester City in December.
However, they are unbeaten in six league games since, with their best performance coming against Chelsea.
“They (the next matches) are going to be more important than Wednesday because we know we can't take our foot off the gas. We can't over-celebrate and need to focus on Stoke,” Francis said.
2018 JANIS HAPE DOWD CAROLINA COLLEGE NIKE INVITATIONAL
Live Results
Hosted by Duke
Friday, February 2nd – Sunday, February 4th
25 Yards
Invitational Format
The 2018 Janis Hape Dowd Carolina College Nike Invite continued today with day 2 prelims and finals. Today, the action moved from UNC's campus to Duke. Swimmers competed individually in the 400 IM, 100 fly, 200 free, 100 breasts, and 100 back. Some teams also opted to participate in the 200 medley relay and 800 free relays to bookend the session. Read on for some highlights from today's sessions.
Duke first-year student Connie Dean, a British IM/Breaststroker, had one of the highlight swims of the day. In prelims of the 400 IM, Dean blew away the field with a 4:12.40. That was their first 400 yard IMs registered in the USA Swimming database. Dean opted not to swim the event in finals.
A few swimmers from last season's NCAAs made appearances today in prelims, but opted out of swimming finals. NC State's Elise Haan put up a 1:47.57 in the 200 free prelims, which ties for the fastest time of the day with Duke's Verity Abel‘s 1:47.57 in finals. Duke's Leah Goldman was the fastest swimmer in the 100 fly today, putting up a 53.01 to finish slightly faster than teammate Kylie Jordan (53.26) in prelims.
Similarly on the men's side, most of the top performances of the day came out of prelims. NC State's Noah Hensley put up the fastest 100 fly of the day, turning in a 48.44 in prelims. Teammates Jacob Johnson (1:37.18) and Coleman Stewart (1:38.39) were the 2 fastest 200 freestylers with their prelims times.
After putting up a personal best in the 500 free and winning the event on day 1, NC State's Mason Revis collected another win tonight. Coming into today, Revis had the best time of 3:53.73 from the 2017 version of this meet. In prelims, they cut over 2 seconds off that in 3:51.28. They shaved off another hundredth to win the final in 3:51.27, dominating as they were the only swimmer to break 4:00.
Additional Top Individual Times From Day 2:
A few years ago this couldn't have happened, but a provision in a 2014 package of ballot initiative reforms allowed proponents to yank a measure after it has already qualified. The reforms were designed to give the Legislature the chance to resolve policy disputes that didn't belong on the ballot, and in two cases this year, they worked exactly as intended. In one, legislators were able to craft a compromise on internet privacy that led the sponsor of a related initiative to pull it from the ballot. In another, they convinced paint companies to drop a deceptive lead paint cleanup measure by moving legislation that would have exposed the companies to more lawsuits and higher costs.
LAS VEGAS — The union representing thousands of Las Vegas casino workers estimated Wednesday that the two largest resort operators would lose more than $10 million a day combined if housekeepers, cooks and others go on strike at any time starting Friday.
The Culinary Union released documents explaining how it thinks a one-month strike would impact MGM Resorts International and Caesars Entertainment, which operate more than half of the properties that would be affected if 50,000 workers walk off the job.
Workers last week voted to authorize a strike as disputes over workplace training, wages and other issues have kept the union and casino operators from agreeing on new contracts.
The union conceded that it is difficult to estimate how the strike at more than 30 hotels would impact Las Vegas overall, since the last citywide labor action took place in 1984, when the city had 90,000 fewer hotel rooms and only about 12.8 million annual visitors.
But it says MGM and Caesars would see a 10 percent reduction in revenue because of the loss of group and independent travelers.
Using the companies' earnings reports for the first three months of the year, the union's estimates show the one-month strike could reduce MGM's earnings before interest, taxes and other items by more than $206 million and Caesars' by over $113 million.
The workers' contracts expire at midnight Thursday. They are bartenders, housekeepers, cocktail and food servers, porters, bellmen, cooks and other kitchen workers at properties on the Las Vegas Strip and downtown Las Vegas, including Caesars Palace, Bellagio, Stratosphere, Treasure Island, The D and El Cortez.
More: Las Vegas casino workers could strike for the first time in more than 3 decades
Dealers are not part of the Culinary Union. Casino-resorts that would not be affected by the strike include Wynn Las Vegas, Encore, The Venetian and Palazzo.
MGM, which employees 24,000 of the workers, on Wednesday said it met with union negotiators Monday and has more talks scheduled this week. The company says it remains confident that it “can resolve the outstanding contract issues and come to an agreement that works for all sides.”
Caesars said it “expects to agree to a new 5-year contract with the Culinary Union on or about June 1 when the current contract expires.” About 12,000 of its workers are part of the negotiations.
The union said it is asking both companies for new-skill training and job opportunities as the operators continue to adopt new technology that can displace workers; an independent study to analyze the workload of housekeepers; and contract language that would protect the workers if properties are sold.
“What is going to happen to my position?” Fernando Fernandez, a guest runner at Caesars Palace, said. “I think they are going to be disappearing it because robots are going to be available to deliver everything.”
They said they want training to fix or program the robots that they believe could eventually replace him.
The union says it has asked MGM for average wage increases of 4 percent a year for the new five-year contract. A document states the company has countered with an approximate 2.7 percent increase for each of the five years.
Meanwhile, Caesars workers are asking for an increase of 4.2 percent, and annual increases of about 4 percent thereafter. Another document shows the company has offered an approximate 2.8 percent increase for each of the five years.
The average hourly wage of union workers is $23, including benefits such as premium-free health care, a pension and a 401(k) retirement savings plan and $25,000 down-payment assistance for first-time homebuyers.

WASHINGTON - Defence Secretary Jim Mattis on Wednesday dismissed chances of a return to the major US troop deployments to Afghanistan that characterized the early years of the Obama administration, a day after the White House gave them power to set troop levels.
Asked whether they expected to hike US troop levels, now at about 8,400 in Afghanistan, to anywhere near America's 2011 peak of more than 100,000 troops, Mattis said: “No, sir, I do not.”
US President Donald Trump has also given Defence Secretary Jim Mattis the authority to set troop levels in Afghanistan, a US official told Reuters on Tuesday, opening the door for future troop increases requested by the US commander.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said no immediate decision had been made about the troop levels, which are now set at about 8,400.
The Pentagon declined to comment.
The decision is similar to one announced in April that applied to US troop levels in Iraq and Syria, and came as Mattis warned Congress the US-backed Afghan forces were not beating the Taliban despite more than 15 years of war.
“We are not winning in Afghanistan right now,” Mattis said in testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier on Tuesday. “And we will correct this as soon as possible.”
Mattis said the Taliban were “surging” at the moment, something they said they intended to address. A former US official said such a decision might allow the White House to argue that it was not micromanaging as much as the administration of former President Barack Obama was sometimes accused of doing.
Critics say delegating too much authority to the military does not shield Trump from political responsibility during battlefield setbacks and could reduce the chances for diplomats to warn of potential blowback from military decisions.
It has been four months since Army General John Nicholson, who leads US and international forces in Afghanistan, said they needed “a few thousand” additional forces, some potentially drawn from US allies.
Current and former US officials say discussions revolve around adding 3,000 to 5,000 troops. Those forces are expected to be largely comprised of trainers to support Afghan forces, as well as air crews.
Deliberations include giving more authority to forces on the ground and taking more aggressive action against Taliban fighters.
Some US officials have questioned the benefit of sending more troops to Afghanistan because any politically palatable number would not be enough to turn the tide, much less create stability and security. To date, more than 2,300 Americans have been killed and more than 17,000 wounded since the war began in 2001.
Any increase of several thousand troops would leave American forces in Afghanistan well below their 2011 peak of more than 100,000 troops.
The Afghan government was assessed by the US military to control or influence just 59.7 percent of Afghanistan's 407 districts as of Feb. 20, a nearly 11 percentage-point decrease from the same time in 2016, according to data released by the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.
A truck bomb explosion in Kabul last month killed more than 150 people, making it the deadliest attack in the Afghan capital since the Taliban were ousted in 2001 by a NATO-led coalition after ruling the country for five years.
On Saturday, three US soldiers were killed when an Afghan soldier opened fire on them in eastern Afghanistan.
The broader regional US strategy for Afghanistan remains unclear. Mattis promised on Tuesday to brief lawmakers on a new war strategy by mid-July that is widely expected to call for thousands more US troops.
Senator John McCain, the chairperson of the Armed Forces Committee, pressed Mattis on the deteriorating situation during the Tuesday hearing, saying the United States had an urgent need for “a change in strategy, and an increase in resources if we are to turn the situation around.”
“We recognize the need for urgency,” Mattis said.
Kim Jong Nam, the half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, was killed Monday in Malaysia in what appeared to be an assassination carried out by female agents possibly armed with a poisoned needle.
Once considered the successor to their father, Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong Nam, 45, had been living incognito in exile in Macau, reportedly under the protection of the Chinese government. Even though they disavowed any aspirations to leadership, North Korea watchers invariably raised their name as a potential replacement in the case of a coup d'etat against Kim Jong-un.
Although the bizarre killing remains under investigation, intelligence officials in both the U.S. and South Korea are calling it a likely assassination by the North Korean government. Kim was reportedly approached from behind while they waited in the departure area of the airport in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital.
Joongang Ilbo, a South Korean newspaper, quoted an unidentified intelligence official as saying that Kim was “stung by a poisoned needle” after being approached by “two female spies” working for North Korea. (Link in Korean.)
“They fled in a taxi right after the crime,” the newspaper quoted the official as saying.
Another version of events came from Malaysian police official Fadzil Ahmat, who told reporters that Kim said before their collapse that “someone had grabbed them from behind and splashed a liquid on their face.''
By whichever method, the killing had all the hallmarks of a North Korean assassination. “This sounds like a classic North Korean operation,” said Sue Mi Terry, who was a senior North Korea analyst for the CIA from 2001 to 2008. “Kim Jong Nam was the most reform-minded person in the family and whenever there are discussions about regime change, their name comes up.”
The timing of the apparent assassination also might be linked to reports of instability in North Korea. A North Korean diplomat, Thae Yong Ho, who defected last summer, said in a news conference last month that the “traditional structures of the North Korean system are crumbling.”

Portly like their father and brother, and frequently photographed unshaven with their shirt tails hanging out, Kim was the heir apparent to North Korean leadership until 2001, when they were arrested in Tokyo trying to enter Japan on a false Dominican Republic passport. They told authorities they were trying to bring their son to Tokyo Disneyland.
After their public disgrace, the North Korean regime began grooming Kim Jong Il's youngest son, Kim Jong-un, who ended up taking over the country while still in their 20s after the 2011 death of the father.
Kim Jong Nam gave occasional interviews to Japanese media. Despite their slovenly appearance and a penchant for drinking and gambling, they were said to be something of an intellectual who expressed their belief in globalization, market economies and the need for North Korea to reform its Communist economy.
“He sees their brother failing,” said a Japanese journalist, Yoji Gomi, who released a 2012 book about Kim Jong Nam, “My Father, Kim Jong Il and Me.” “He thinks [Kim Jong-un] has a lack of experience. He's too young and they didn't have enough time to be groomed.''

Kim Jong Nam lived much of their life in hiding.  They are believed to have been the first of Kim Jong Il's offspring, a love child of a long affair with Song Hye Rim, a North Korean actor. Their relationship and the existence of the child were kept secret for years out of fear that it would not be accepted by Kim Jong Il's father and North Korea's founder.
“Wisteria House,” a book about the family written in Korean by their aunt, Song's sister, described how the secret family was shuttled among secluded villas and seaside retreats in North Korea, Switzerland and Russia, a pampered but precarious life of luxury.
Kim Jong Nam's mother had psychological problems and is believed to have died in Russia.
Although Kim Jong Il publicly acknowledged their first son and was said to be an affectionate father, they reportedly thought the young man had become too Westernized because of the time they spent abroad. As a result, Kim Jong Nam lived mostly in Macau.
Kim Jong Nam's son, Kim Han-sol, now 21, educated in Hong Kong and the West, has spoken out about humanitarian issues such as human rights and famine in North Korea. Wearing ear studs and speaking unaccented English, they gave a videotaped interview in 2012 in which they said their father never wanted to be a North Korean leader. "My dad was definitely not really interested in politics,'' they said.
As of Tuesday, Malaysian officials had yet to classify Kim Jong Nam's death as a homicide.
“At the moment, the police classify this case as sudden death. We have to wait for the postmortem report to determine the cause of death,'' Malaysian Criminal Investigation Department Director Mohmad Salleh was quoted telling reporters in Kuala Lumpur. They said that Kim died on their way to the hospital.
Kim was reportedly in Kuala Lumpur visiting a girlfriend, and it was unclear whether they were suspected of having lured them away from Macau. An assassination in Macau would have been more likely to incur the anger of Beijing.
If an assassination is confirmed, it would be in keeping with the modus operandi of the North Korean regime. Pyongyang has been blamed for numerous attacks against defectors and critics abroad including the 1987 bombing of a Korean airliner by a female North Korean agent and a 1983 bombing in Burma directed against South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan.
Kim Jong Nam's first cousin and childhood playmate, a defector, was shot outside their home in South Korea in 1997.
The North Koreans have been implicated in at least one other poison needle attack, in 2011, when a South Korean pastor and activist died mysteriously in China.
“Somebody like Kim Jong Nam who was living overseas must have been aware of the possibility of being assassinated,'' said Joel Wit, senior fellow at the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies. “He was originally going to succeed Kim Jong Il. They had been very critical of the regime. They were a focal point for potential opposition. Certainly the North Koreans had plenty of motives.”
A user receives funds from a friend for Burning Man festival expenses via Venmo.
PayPal Holdings, Inc
Venmo takes the anxiety out of splitting brunch and utility bills. With a linked bank account and someone's username, you can send and request cash in a few taps. But some wonder if the app makes it a little too easy for people to hit each other up for money.
Just ask Soham Maniar of Houston. They were hosting a friend for a weekend, and the two took an Uberpool to dinner. Later, Maniar was surprised to receive a request for $2.85, their half of the ride cost.
“When someone is nice enough to host a friend or guest, it doesn't mean you have to give them something in return, but I think in a world without Venmo, that friend would not have asked me for $2.85 in cash after I got out of a cab,” Maniar says.
You can take advantage of Venmo without ticking off your friends with these simple tips from Maniar and others.
Try not to sweat the small stuff
“Anything under $20 with friends I usually never charge,” Maniar says. “And if someone did something nice for me, I try and return the favor when it makes sense.”
There's no right threshold. After all, if it's almost payday and you have a $30 bank balance, covering a coworker's coffee might not be in your budget. “It's not nickel-and-diming if [the amount] does make a difference,” says Erin Lowry, author of “Broke Millennial.”
But if you can afford it, consider springing for small items once in a while. When Maniar treats, they say, “I like to assume they'll treat me for something in return in the future. It probably evens out.”
Reciprocity is key, though. If you notice that one of your friends tends to take advantage, “you need to have a conversation,” Lowry says — in person. “Don't Venmo them for the last six years of your friendship.”

Don't stealth-charge
Venmo and other peer-to-peer payment apps let you request money without asking first — even without a username, which you can find with the app's search function — but that doesn't mean you should. Establishing how you'll split the bill (or that you'll split the bill) ahead of time helps avoid annoyance later.
“Unless we've spoken about sharing a cost, don't expect a Venmo request from me for splitting it,” says Stefanie O'Connell, a finance blogger. And “don't send me a Venmo for the guacamole you offered me a bite of,” they add.
Spell it out
Use the memo field to add detail about the request, especially when you're splitting multiple bills. (Emoji not required.)
“Before sending someone a request for money, you should clear it with them, including what it's for and what they should expect to pay,” says Elaine Swann, a lifestyle and etiquette expert.
After a weekend trip, a simple note, such as “Hotel $100, gas $40, dinner $30” can take the stress off your recipient, particularly if you're requesting a large chunk of money.
Make your transactions private
You can control who sees your transactions on an individual basis or set a default for your account: private or friends only. If your friend's account is wide open but yours is locked up, the app will honor the more restrictive setting, according to Venmo's website.
To privatize your feed, open your Venmo menu, scroll down to “settings,” and then click on “privacy.” Be sure to click “save” when you're done.
For O'Connell, privacy is important on the app. “Who owes me money and who I owe is nobody's business but our own,” they say.
It's like real life — but (hopefully) better
Does Venmo actually make people ruder? Or is it just another way to demonstrate rudeness? It's a chicken-or-egg argument with no easy answer — but some suspect it's more often the latter.
“If you're a jerk, you're probably going to be a bigger jerk [on Venmo],” Swann says.
Lowry agrees: “If you're somebody who remembers that four years ago your friend borrowed money for coffee and never paid you back, you're going to use Venmo that way,” they say.
The good news is that if you're considerate about money outside of the digital world, you're well on your way to being considerate about Venmo. Think of it as a tool for payment, not a substitute for communication, and soon you'll be splitting brunch without provoking a single eye roll.

“Definitely — a lot of stuff changed in there,” they say of how motherhood played into the design process. “We changed some of our silhouettes, we changed some of our pieces; it's just been an evolving work. Because at one point I was going to come out with it in November before I got married, and I remember thinking, ‘I don't want to do that because I want to be able to enjoy my honeymoon and enjoy the wedding,' so we just kept putting it off and changing and adding, and I'm glad we waited.”
MADRID, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Spanish property developer Metrovacesa cut its listing price late on Thursday and delayed its stock market flotation by one day in a negative sign for one of the sectors that has attracted most investor activity in Spain in recent years.
The company, which owns the largest land bank in Spain, cut its listing price to 16.5-17 euros per share from 18-19.5 euros, it said in a statement to the market regulator, without giving a reason.
It will list on Feb. 6, it said, one day later than planned. The new listing price values the company at up to 2.57 billion euros, below its net asset value of 2.69 billion euros.
Residential construction in Spain is thriving with foreign investment pouring into developments in cities and coastal resorts, a decade after a property bubble burst leaving banks laden with developers' bad loans.
House builder Neinor Homes listed last year, the first flotation by a Spanish residential builder in a decade.
Metrovacesa was taken over by creditors Santander and BBVA in 2009. The banks are selling stock in the company as part of the listing although they will remain majority shareholders.
Just under a fifth of its assets are in the northeastern region of Catalonia which embarked on an independence drive from Spain in October, plunging the country into its worst political crisis in decades.
BBVA, Santander, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are acting as the joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners for the offer.
Goldman Sachs and Société Générale are acting as additional joint bookrunners, the company said in the statement. (Reporting by Sonya Dowsett; editing by Jason Neely)
Thomas Shannon, US undersecretary of state for political affairs, paid their respects to a South Korean soldier killed in Afghanistan a decade ago during their trip here earlier this week, the US Embassy said Thursday.
On its Facebook account, the embassy posted photos of Shannon paying tribute to Army Ssg. Yoon Jang-ho in front of a stone monument for them at the US military base in Yongsan, central Seoul.

The official traveled to Seoul from Tuesday till Thursday in the wake of a two-day visit to Tokyo.In Seoul, they met with South Korean officials to discuss a broad range of issues including agenda items for the summit talks between President Moon Jae-in and their American counterpart Donald Trump to be held in Washington DC at the end of this month."Despite a hectic schedule, they made time on Wednesday to honor Ssg. Yoon in person for their sacrifice," a source said ahead of the update of the Facebook page, requesting anonymity. "His son is known to have served in Afghanistan as well."Yoon was killed in 2007 when a bomb exploded at the main gate of a US air base in Bagram, some 80 kilometers north of the Afghan capital, Kabul.He was 27 years old and a sergeant at the time, a member of South Korean Army's Dasan Engineering Unit dispatched there to assist the US military in its local operations. Yoon was posthumously promoted to staff sergeant.Visiting Kabul in January, Shannon reaffirmed Washington's continued commitment to the war-torn country's security and prosperity. (Yonhap)
The Oroville Reservoir continued to drain Wednesday morning as state water officials raced to reduce the lake's level ahead of storms expected to arrive after midnight.
As of 5:30 a.m. the reservoir was down 20 feet since it reached capacity on Sunday when it overflowed and sparked sweeping evacuations south of the dam. The lake is draining at 100,000 cubic feet per second, a furious pace that is reducing the state's second largest reservoir about one foot every three hours.
The Department of Water Resources wants to drop the reservoir's level 50 feet overall by Sunday, which would provide a half a million acre-feet of space for future storms and, according to officials, ensure the dam doesn't have to rely a second time on an emergency spillway that rapidly eroded over the weekend.
Engineers have been reinforcing the emergency spillway – an unlined hillside – with heavy boulders carried in by helicopter, as well as sand and concrete slurry. The incoming storms could bring 30 mph winds Thursday and Friday, which could hinder the effort, said National Weather Service Jason Clapp.
“It's just another problem they don't need to have,” they said.
Up to 3 inches of rain could fall on the lake and 8 inches in the surrounding mountains and foothills through the weekend, Clapp said. Another storm is due Monday.
“That one looks a little juicier,” and could drop 2 inches of rain on Oroville and 5 inches in the mountains in 24 hours, Clapp said.
Rise Brewing Company is touting its coveted crown as the winner of New Beverage Showdown 13 after winning the top spot in the early-stage beverage brand competition.
Rise co-founders Grant Gyesky and Jarrett McGovern competed against entrepreneurs from five other brands participating in the final round of the Showdown, which is intertwined with BevNET Live Summer 2017 and held at Metropolitan West in New York City.
“We're so honored,” McGovern told BevNET. “We have put in a lot of hard work to get to this point and just seeing ourselves with all those other brands, we are really proud to be associated with [them] and really excited that we took home the award today among the great competition.”
Rise Brewing launched in 2015 with its nitrogen-infused cold brew coffee. The company, which sells the coffee in cans and kegs at retail and foodservice outlets, has developed a loyal customer base in offices, hotels and restaurants along with stores in California, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York. Rise also operates a pop-up shop on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
Rise faced significant competition from its fellow finalists, Ounce Water, Remedy Organics, Mooala, Ugly Drinks and Smart Pressed Juice, all of which secured their spots in the round after emerging from Tuesday's semifinals. Each brand had five minutes to convince a panel of judges comprised of Kerrie Lopez, Sr. Category Manager of Fresh at Jet.com, John Craven, CEO at BevNET, Kellam Mattie, VP of Marketing and Innovation and CMO of Venturing & Emerging Brands, Trevor Nelson, co-founder and Managing Partner at Alliance Consumer Growth, and Tim Sperry, President and owner of the Tim Sperry Group, that their beverage would be the next product consumers will want to be sipping on.
The judges praised Rise for its high-quality formulation, sales strategy and current distribution footprint, which includes over 900 locations. During the presentation, Gyesky said the company is currently capable of filling 1,500 kegs per day and three million can case per year. The judges did caution the company about its plans to expand sales to Europe.
“I think Rise has what it takes,” Sperry said on stage. “[But] stay here. Don't go to Europe. You're not ready for it. The grass is really green right here, so stay focused on what you're doing right here.”
Nelson told BevNET it was the Rise's multi-faceted approach to sales that made the business intriguing and disruptive.
“The keg business has a lot of unique places it can live and thrive, and help build the brand alongside the can business, which I think is a very interesting approach,” Nelson said. “We saw years ago Stumptown build a brand with a multi-pronged approach in coffee where they were the branded beans inside food service, for example, while at the same time wholesaling and retailing the beans. Then they ultimately came out with an RTD. I think this is another iteration of that kind of multipronged playbook in cold coffee.”
Along with the title of New Beverage Showdown champion, Rise Brewing took home $10,000, which McGovern and Gyesky plan to put toward brewing and production costs.
Judges also had praise for the other finalists' innovative takes on fast-growing categories, including Smart Pressed's dry pressed juice powder, and, for some, market-ready branding.
“We had a great group overall,” Nelson said. “What makes the judging difficult is that brands are at different places of their life cycles. One brand may have been in the market for two, three or four years and gained traction, another brand in a different category may be just entering the market. So as a judge it's very difficult to compare things that are really not like for like.”
Rise Brewing is the thirteenth company to win the New Beverage Showdown, joining brands including Health-Ade, MALK, Tio Gazpacho, Coco Cafe and Grady's Cold-Brew in BevNET Live's exclusive winners' circle.
Both Gyesky and McGovern told BevNET they planned to celebrate their win with their teammates — and some drinks — back at their Manhattan brewery.
“To be in the middle of a community like this that's focused on beverage and that's successful in covering the sort of spectrum on it, for us to come out as the winner in the New Beverage Showdown is really validating and really exciting,” Gyesky said.

Last season, the Texas A&M women ended a 6-year Georgia Bulldog run atop the SEC in overall team points. This year, the Aggies ended another Georgia streak – 7 straight SEC titles in the 800 free relay.
A 6:57.90 Aggie relay accomplished that feat Tuesday night at the opening night of the 2017 SEC Championships. The swim marks Texas A&M's first-ever SEC title in the relay, and gave the conference its first non-Bulldog champion since Auburn in 2009. A&M, new to the conference since 2012, has now won four SEC relay titles – the other three came in the 400 medley relay in 2013, 2014 and 2016.
The Aggie team was made up of Sarah Gibson (1:43.64 leading off), Sydney Pickrem (1:44.67), Katie Portz (1:46.28) and Claire Rasmus (1:43.31). Rasmus had the best split of the field and Gibson's was the best leadoff leg overall.
Georgia actually finished third in the 800 free relay at 7:00.44, the first time their SEC relay has been over seven minutes in years. On the bright side for the Bulldogs, though, they did win the 200 medley relay by .05 over Texas A&M, and the women's team scores are still very close, with A&M leading 158 to Georgia's 155.
It's the end of the week and I'm taking off early to have some fun. Here's some music to end the day—at least for me.
The Eagles are one of those groups, like Fleetwood Mac, that I learned to appreciate only after they'd faded away. Some of their songs I like, and some I have no use for. For many years I didn't listen to the Eagles simply because I couldn't stand the lyrics of “Take it Easy”, which seemed pretentious; and I still hate “Hotel California.” But here are two songs I really like—both live performances.
The first is a gorgeous ballad with two great guitar solos.”I can't tell you why” was written by Glenn Frey, Don Henley, and lead singer Timothy B. Schmit (how many rock stars used a middle initial?). It was recorded in 1978, released on their album The Long Run in 1978, and was the first Eagles song to have Schmit as the lead singer. Sadly, while it made the top 10 in both the Billboard and Adult Contemporary charts, it didn't get to #1 on either.
Wikipedia has some background:
Timothy B. Schmit came up with the song title and composed the nucleus of “I Can't Tell You Why”, which they then presented to Glenn Frey and Don Henley and they completed the song together. Henley described the finished song as “straight Al Green”, and that Frey, an R&B fan as they came from Detroit and grew up with the music, was responsible for the R&B feel of the song. Frey said to Schmit: “You could sing like Smokey Robinson. Let's not do a Richie Furay, Poco-sounding song. Let's do an R&B song.” Schmit describes the song as “loosely based on my own experiences”. Schmit said: “I had some writing sessions with Don and Glenn and I threw out a bunch of my ideas and that one [for “I Can't Tell You Why”] stuck. I had [composed] a pretty good part of it, not a huge part but enough for them to think ‘That could be good' and go with it. So Don, Glenn and I finished it over a few all night sessions.” “When it was being developed in the studio…I knew it was a great song. I [thought] ‘Yes! This is an amazing debut for me.' When we finally mixed it, we had a little listening party at the studio. As people were hearing it, Don turned to me and said, ‘There's your first hit.'” Schmit sang the lead vocals on the song, with Frey and Henley singing counterpoint. Schmit also played the bass on the track, which has the distinctive bass riff believed by Schmit to have been devised by Frey. According to Henley, Frey came up with the counterpart on the song, and played the guitar solo on the song.
Be sure to enlarge this video.
“Lyin' Eyes” was written by Henley and Frey, and is my second favorite Eagles song, conjuring up a lot of old feelings. Recorded in 1975, it reached #2 on the Billboard charts. It's a lovely song with a sad story, and I always picture the young guy, lying on a cot, waiting for their married inamorata to arrive. The live version below is from 1977; Schmit apparently hadn't yet joined the band, and I don't see Joe Walsh here, either.
More from Wikipedia:
The title and idea for the song came when Glenn Frey and Don Henley were in their favorite Los Angeles restaurant/bar Dan Tana's which was frequented by many beautiful women, and they started talking about beautiful women who were cheating on their husbands. They saw a beautiful young woman with a fat and much older wealthy man, and Frey said: “She can't even hide those lyin' eyes.” According to Henley, Frey was the main writer of the song, although they had some input with the verses and the music. The song was written when Frey and Henley were sharing a house in Trousdale, Beverly Hills. Frey said of the writing of the song: “…the story had always been there. I don't want to say it wrote itself, but once we started working on it, there were no sticking points. Lyrics just kept coming out, and that's not always the way songs get written.” During the Eagles 2013 concert tour, Frey stated it was written in just two evenings. “Lyin' Eyes” is the only song in the One of These Nights album that Frey sang solo lead on (he shared lead vocals with Henley on “After the Thrill Is Gone”).
The Eagles, I hear, gave great live performances, and this is one of them (I never saw them, but I'm sure some readers have).
TIRANA - The Albanian market vendor paid 1,200 euros ($1,419) to a "chaperone" late last year to take their 16-year-old son to France, where they joined thousands from the Balkan country seeking asylum.
"It's a huge sacrifice, I pray to God every night," said Bukurie, 40, who declined to give their family name for fear of problems with authorities.
They said the teenager, their only son, is now in a centre for unaccompanied minors, studying French and hoping to start a cooking apprenticeship so that they can apply to stay in France when they turn 18. "My only wish is that they can have a better future," they told AFP.
Nearly 29,000 Albanians sought asylum in the European Union in 2016, according to EU data agency Eurostat - one percent of the country's entire 2.9 million population.
It places Albania, a candidate for EU membership, among the top asylum-seeking nations along with Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran and Eritrea.
Despite being considered a safe and democratic country, Albania remains a leading source of asylum seekers to the European Union, an irregular emigration pattern that Tirana has vowed to crack down on.
Mass migration from the former communist state is driven by Albania's average monthly salary of about 340 euros and an unemployment rate affecting nearly one in three young people.
Bukurie said they and their husband struggle to support their family of seven, coming to the capital from the rural outskirts each day to sell just a few kilogrammes of vegetables and two or three litres of milk.
"A mother should not be condemned for only thinking about better prospects for their child," they said.
"We have decided to stop this phenomenon, which really worries us," said Rovena Voda, Deputy Interior Minister, who expressed particular concern about unaccompanied minors.
Eurostat figures show Germany was the favoured destination of first-time Albanian asylum applicants last year, but France took the top spot in the first quarter of 2017.
More than 4,000 Albanian citizens sought asylum in France in the first half of this year, according to Aida Hajnaj, the police chief for borders and migrants.
Last month French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb described the influx as a "fundamental problem" that needed resolving.
Albanian asylum-seekers are taken care of in France until their request is rejected - but they take up a large proportion of French hosting capacities at the cost of citizens from war-torn countries.
France has an important advantage in the eyes of applicants: the slow speed of its procedures, according to Albanian police sources.
It could be an entire year before asylum candidates are rejected, in which time some of them try to reach Britain, the sources say.
Paris and Berlin's threats to reinstate visas for Albanians appear to have galvanised authorities back home. Albanian Foreign Minister Ditmir Bushati met Collomb in late July to discuss the problem.
Tirana presented France with "an action plan to get concrete results within three months in the fight against irregular immigration", Voda said.
The plan includes stronger controls on those leaving, particularly to prevent the emigration of unaccompanied minors. Another is strengthening the crackdown on criminal networks.
Albanian police "are investigating agencies, law firms, associations or registry offices who provide false papers to asylum seekers," according to Voda.
Between January and May, 1,083 citizens were readmitted in Albania after presenting false papers in France to claim asylum, the interior ministry said.
Police say that, in a bid to prove their life is in danger, asylum seekers sometimes place explosives under their vehicles or in front of their apartments.
Another method is to claim that they are potential victims of a vendetta, caught up in the rapidly-dying Albanian tradition of "blood feuds".
Land disputes, discrimination related to sexual orientation and domestic violence are also listed as reasons for seeking asylum.
Parents, like Bukurie, often organise the departure of their own children.
In 2016, more than 500 unaccompanied Albanian minors were registered in France, notably in the country's east.
But parents "who thought that they were sending their children to a better future... do not realise that a number of them become victims of human-trafficking rings," said Alain Bouchon, who runs an association in the eastern French town of Bourg-en-Bresse.
The traffickers "force them into prostitution and begging," Bouchon said.
To fight this phenomenon, Albanian authorities have also "engaged the criminal responsibility" of parents, according to Voda.
In May, 44-year old mother Miranda Locka was sentenced to four months in prison, commuted to 18 months' probation, for having abandoned their children in Germany.
But still authorities may struggle to stem the flow of emigrants: according to a recent Gallup study, 56 percent of Albanians want to leave if a possibility arises.
Hundreds of people are getting ready for a moonlight stroll – all in a good cause.
St Catherine's Hospice is preparing for its biggest annual fundraiser, the Moonlight and Memories walk.
Among those getting ready are is Collinson family from Lea, Preston.
Mum Jenni, their husband Daryl, and their children Madeleine, aged 13, Sophie, 12, and Theo, 10, are looking forward to a family night out with a difference.
With a 10-mile and four-mile route to choose from, the whole community will be welcomed into the hospice grounds of St Catherine's Park on the evening of Saturday, June 30, for the poignant sponsored trek.
Hairdresser Jenni says: “I did the Moonlight and Memories Walk a few years ago with a group of friends and loved it. I also took part in the Shine Night Walk London for Cancer Research UK, which is a night time marathon walk, and the children were really excited for me and wanted to join in. So the four-mile Moonlight and Memories Walk is perfect for us to do together as a family.”
Norman Cutler, fundraiser at St Catherine's Hospice, said: “Hundreds of people have already signed up to our biggest annual fundraiser, and we're really looking forward to seeing our grounds filled with supporters in our famous pink t-shirts ahead of the sponsored walk.”
Registration is £15 for adults and £10 for under-18s, with sponsorship raised helping to fund the specialist palliative and end-of-life care provided by St Catherine's Hospice.

When Drew Brees heard a 1930s-era Purdue jersey worn by John Wooden was being sold at auction, they saw an opportunity to help their alma mater showcase its ties to a man most known for winning 10 NCAA men's basketball titles as UCLA's coach.
Bree says they paid $264,000 to win a late-hour bidding war for the jersey in mid-May and will allow Purdue to display it at Mackey Arena in West Lafayette, Indiana.
"I had never seen any Purdue-related in regards to memorabilia ever from John Wooden," the New Orleans Saints quarterback said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. "I mean, think about it, it's over 80 years ago. So the minute that I saw this, I thought, 'This belongs at Purdue. Purdue has to have this and I'll do whatever I can to make sure they do.'"
The jersey is white -- albeit somewhat yellowed by time -- with "Purdue" written across the front in gold letters with black trim. A gold No. 13 with black trim is on the back.
"It certainly should be appreciated by anyone who steps foot in the Mackey Arena, no matter if you're a Purdue fan or not," Brees said. "If you're a basketball fan, if you're a fan of the game and legacy that John Wooden left for all of us, it's an incredible piece of history."

Wooden was an All-Big Ten player at Purdue between 1930 and 1932 and briefly played in fledgling pro basketball leagues before going into coaching. They coached at UCLA from 1948 to 1975 and became known as the "Wizard of Westwood" when they coached the Bruins to 10 NCAA titles in a 12-season span from 1964 to 1975.
Brees said they have long been an admirer of Wooden and has consumed a number of Wooden's written works, incorporating their teachings and philosophy into football and their various business pursuits.
"This is truly one of a kind. There's only one of these that exist and it belonged to the man who arguably has had the biggest impact on the game of basketball -- not just that but their teachings transcend the game of basketball," Brees said. "His books, their literature, their influence on the world of business and the world of sport is unparalleled."
Brees and their wife, Brittany, who also attended Purdue, have been heavily involved in fundraising for the school, having donated more than $3 million.
Brees took possession of the Wooden jersey in the early morning hours of May 18 but kept their winning bid quiet because they wanted to surprise top Purdue athletic officials with the item at an event on Tuesday night.
For years, the jersey was in the possession of one of Wooden's college friends, according to an article about its discovery in the Journal and Courier of West Lafayette. That friend later gave the jersey to their own grandson, John Neff, but never told them Wooden had worn it. For years, Neff didn't realize the jersey belonged to Wooden until curiosity about its origins led them to have it authenticated by sports memorabilia experts. They sold it through Heritage Auctions.
Part-1 of this article introduced you to the incredible story of the late J.R. Oliver. They were a man who, in 1949, was involved in a sensational UFO encounter at the height of a U.K. military exercise code-named Operation Bulldog. In a letter sent to UFO researcher Tim Good in 1991 (and which Tim copied to me, and that Oliver's widow generously let me publish), Oliver revealed that at the height of the operation a definitive UFO was tracked on radar by the staff of multiple military installations in the U.,K. It was a UFO that was estimated to have been flying close to 3,000 miles per hour. With that said, let's now continue with what else Oliver had to say about the UFO encounter and the UFO itself:
“The general consensus regarding its size, among the very experienced radar personnel engaged in the operations, was that the object offered an echo similar to that of a large passenger or freighter surface vessel, something in the region of 15,000 or 20,00 tons [italics mine]. Word filtered down that on approaching Bempton radar in Yorkshire, the object suddenly increased speed and headed directly upwards, vanished off-screen at about 100,000 feet.” That was hardly the end of the story, however. In fact, there was more to come. Much more.
Back to Oliver: “Naturally, there was quite a bit of a buzz about this, especially as at that time speeds in excess of the speed of sound were just not on. Neither were aircraft the size of liners. The airspeed record at that time stood at 606.36 mph and the largest aircraft in general use was probably the USAAF Superfortress, which lumbered along at about 350 mph. At our usual relief time ‘B' Watch stood down and went to breakfast and bed at the domestic site at Stonar House. We were awakened from our watch slumbers by Sergeant Platt and assembled in front of Stonar House, with our Sergeant Belcher, Sergeant Hatter, and various minor NCOs [Non-Commissioned Officers] in attendance, for an address by Squadron Leader Mundy.”
Oliver went on to reveal what, exactly, Squadron Leader Mundy had to say about this extraordinary situation: “He reminded us of our duties as serving members of the RAF and the requirements of the OSA [Official Secrets Act] and to forget especially the odd circumstances of the past night and not to mention same to anyone not connected to the RAF. Going on watch that evening we found that the Duty Watch Book, normally only replaced when completely full, which recorded every air engagement, every PBX message, every official order by the watch-keeping officer, made during every official part of previous watches, including the previous night's activities, as an official Watch Book is required to do…had gone [italics mine]. Replaced by a brand new shining Duty Watch Book. I wonder why? Removing a half empty Watch Book was unheard of, during exercises such as Bulldog especially.”
Oliver continued with their account: “The rest of the exercise took its natural course and about a month later my service with the RAF ended. Whether there were any further developments regarding this incident I do not know but it seems likely that evidence of its happening must be on file somewhere. This incident was observed by such a large and highly trained audience, its progress so well documented and meticulously recorded and, no doubt, the technical aspects so well scrutinized by top-ranking experts that the official documentation of its occurrence would settle the UFO controversy permanently.”
Oliver's final words: “All aspects of Operation Bulldog were due to be analysed in great depth in order to bring our defence against possible nuclear attack to the highest level. There is no doubt that the incident I have described, totally beyond the expectations of the organizing authorities as it must have been, would receive the closest scrutiny and that many opinions must have been placed on record. In addition to the personnel directly involved in the tracking of the object, it is highly likely that a good many people must have gained knowledge of this occurrence and thereof proof of it happening may not be too far in hiding.”
Despite Mr. Oliver's hope that records on the affair were preserved and might one day surface, such a thing has not happened. At least, not yet it hasn't. Back in 1995, I spent a few days at the U.K.'s National Archives, and, while I did find some records on Operation Bulldog – some declassified and others withheld – the records on that massive craft that penetrated British airspace and prompted a hasty cover-up of the evidence were nowhere to be found. Perhaps, now – in light of all the data provided in parts 1 and 2 of this article – it's time for someone else to try and dig out the truth (and the files) of the Operation Bulldog-UFO affair of 1949. Just maybe they will finally surface and we may gain more insight into the early years of the UFO phenomenon.
Russian President Vladimir Putin declared victory against "terrorists" in Syria on Monday during a surprise visit to a Russian military base in the county, where they also announced a partial pullout of Russian troops.

It was Putin's first trip to Syria, where Russia launched an air campaign in 2015 that allowed President Bashar Assad's forces to gain the upper hand against the Islamic State group as well as Syrian rebels. It was also the first visit by a foreign head of state to war-ravaged Syria since the civil war began in 2011.
Putin's brief stop at the Hemeimeem air base in Syria's coastal province of Latakia while en route to Egypt came days after the Russian president said they would run for re-election on March 18, and helped to show off Moscow's global clout to the national audience.
In a televised speech to the Russian troops at the base, Putin hailed their "excellent" performance in Syria, where the Russian military declared victory against the Islamic State group last week.
"You have shown the best qualities of a Russian soldier — courage, valor, team spirit, decisiveness and excellent skills," they said. "The Motherland is proud of you."
Russia launched its air campaign in Syria at the end of September 2015, when Assad's government was teetering on the brink of collapse, and quickly changed the course of the conflict. Russian officials say the troops were sent to Syria mainly to fight "terrorists," including IS and al-Qaida, but they also battled mainstream rebels opposed to the Assad family's four-decade rule.
Putin has hosted Assad twice in the past six years, including a surprise Nov. 21 visit that Assad undertook to the Black Sea resort of Sochi.
Russian television stations showed Putin walking off the plane at the air base, embracing and shaking hands with Assad. The two then visited a military operations room.
The Hemeimeem base, located in the heartland of Assad's Alawite minority, has served as the main foothold for the Russian military campaign in Syria.
"Here in Syria, far away from our borders, you helped the Syrian people to preserve their state and fend off attacks by terrorists," Putin said, facing the troops lined up on the tarmac. "You have dealt a devastating blow to those who blatantly threatened our country. We will never forget about the victims who fell in the fight against terror both here and in Russia."
Putin also said that they had ordered the military to withdraw a "significant part" of the Russian contingent in Syria.
"Friends, the Motherland is waiting for you," Putin said. "You are coming back home with victory!"
They added, however, that the Russian military will maintain its presence at Hemeimeem and a naval facility in Tartus.
Gen. Sergei Surovikin, the Russian military commander in Syria, said the military will pull out 23 warplanes, two helicopter gunships, special forces units, military police and field engineers.
Surovikin said the remaining forces will be sufficient to "successfully fulfill the tasks" to stabilize the situation in Syria. They did not say how many troops and weapons would stay behind.
Syria has allowed Russia to use Hemeimeem air base indefinitely without cost. Moscow also has a deal with Syria to use the Tartus base for 49 years, which could be extended if both parties agree.
The Russian military plans to modernize the air base and expand its runways to allow it to host more warplanes. It also intends to expand the Tartus facility significantly to make it a full-scale naval base capable of hosting warships, including cruiser-sized vessels.
After seeing troops march, Putin drove up to the Russian warplanes parked on the runway and talked to the pilots, who said they will fly back home later in the day.
Syrian TV said Assad thanked Putin for their troops' "effective contribution" to the fight against terrorism in Syria, which they said the Syrian people "will never forget."
"Syria has been saved as a sovereign, independent state, refugees are coming home and conditions have been created for a political settlement under the United Nations' auspices," Putin said.
Insurgents still control several areas in Syria, but much of the fighting has been paused by "de-escalation" agreements brokered by Russia and Iran, which support Assad, and Turkey, which backs the rebels.
Putin told Assad they would discuss the prospects for a peace settlement with the leaders of Egypt and Turkey later Monday.
"I hope that together with Turkey and Iran we will succeed in restoring peaceful life and launch a political process to settle the situation in Syria," Putin said.

Karachi - Balochistan National Party (BNP) leader Akhter Mengal on Tuesday demanded the government to put off census in Balochistan unless normalcy returned to the province.
Addressing a press conference along with Sindh United Party (SUP)President Jalal Mehmood Shah at Haider Manzil, Mengal said that local population of Balochistan had to migrate from the province during the last 15 years due to bad law and order situation, and several villages were deserted. “Therefore there is a chance that people not natives of the soil could be shifted to these places and registered in the census, which may turn Baloch into a minority in their own province,” they apprehended.
They demanded the government not to go ahead with the preparations for census unless law and order situation improved and normalcy returned to Balochistan and unless the locals returned to their homes. They also called for the introduction of a mechanism for ensuring the return and registration of immigrants.
“There are 400 times increase in the population of Balochistan, and there is no mechanism to figure out population of illegal immigrants in the province,” they said, and added, “Even the census form does not have a separate space for registration of these immigrants.”
Speaking on CPEC, Mengal alleged that the project was actually meant for the progress of only one province, and the rulers were using the name of Balochistan just to safeguard their vested interests. “The rulers are striking secret deals to safeguard their interests,” they elaborated.
“Out of $57 billion allocated for CPEC, only $1 billion have been earmarked for the progress of Balochistan,” they said, and added that this project should not be termed as the project for the prosperity of Balochistan as people of the province were still deprived of basic necessities of life.
Speaking on the occasion, SUP President Jalal Mehmood Shah also announced to take out a rally from Numaish Chowrangi on February 26 against corruption, terrorism and religious extremism.
The two leaders also agreed to a 10-point agenda that underlines the establishment of a federal system through a peaceful political struggle, struggle against religious, state and political extremism, acquisition of provinces' rights over their natural resources and ports, strict action against corrupt bureaucracy, political leadership and other influential people, right of nationality, vote and purchase of land for locals of the provinces, repatriation of immigrants and granting the authority to issue NICs to the provinces, cancellation of NICS and passports of the immigrants, struggling for an independent ECP and a separate delimitation commission along with the introduction of a biometric and electronic voter machine system, listening to the say of provinces in foreign and internal affairs, including international agreements, giving status of a national language to local languages and struggling for free education and health facilities.
In not so shocking news, Nokia has confirmed that all of its smartphones (including the Nokia 2.1, 3.1 and 5.1 launched today) will be getting upgraded to Android P.
First reported by Android Authority, the news comes from Neil Broadley, Nokia's global marketing manager who added that latest version of Android will come to the entire Nokia smartphone range released until now.
The update isn't a surprise given that Nokia has chosen to partner with Google's Android One program, one that ensures timely updates along with security patches.
Nokia too takes pride in its “pure, secure and up-to-date” slogan with a guaranteed two-year update period for milestone firmware updates.
With the announcement, literally all Nokia smartphone announced under the HMD Global umbrella, will get updated to Android P.
As for the devices running Android Go, Nokia states that they too will see a new update coming from an unnamed OS. This should basically be a watered-down version of Android P like the Android Oreo Go edition that is currently powering the Nokia 1, the Nokia 2 and the recently announced Nokia 2.1.
On a related note, HMD Global Chief Product Officer, Juho Sarvikas at today's Nokia launch event also announced that the Nokia 8 will be getting a Pro Camera mode in an update that arrives by the end of this week.

Toronto: A 25-year-old who plowed a van into a crowded Toronto sidewalk was ordered held Tuesday on 10 counts of murder and 13 of attempted murder as Canadian authorities and the public sought to make sense of what appeared to be one of the deadliest mass murders in the country's modern history.
Alek Minassian showed little overt emotion as they made a brief appearance in a Toronto courtroom in a white jumpsuit and handcuffs. The judge ordered them detained without bond and scheduled the next hearing for May 10.
Police, meanwhile, still appeared to be gathering evidence. About 20 officers made their way down the van's deadly path on Yonge Street searching for any evidence. Nearby, mourners had put together a makeshift memorial to the victims.
"It was like they were playing a video game, trying to kill as many people as possible," said Panna Patel, 42, who stopped by the memorial and had been at the scene a day earlier, getting cash from an ATM as it occurred. "He was looking people directly in the eye, making eye contact, it was so scary. They aren't remorseful at all."
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau dismissed the possibility of terrorism, saying that authorities see no national security element in the case.
They told a news conference that the incident "hasn't changed the overall threat level in Canada," though it occurred as Cabinet ministers from the G7 nations were meeting in Toronto.
Authorities so far had not disclosed a possible motive or cause, though "the incident definitely looked deliberate," Police Chief Mark Saunders told reporters at a late-night news conference.
Saunders said Minassian, who lives in the Toronto suburb of Richmond Hill, had not been known to police previously. An online social media profile described them as a college student.
Authorities released few details in the case, saying the investigation was still underway, with witnesses being interviewed and surveillance video being examined.
"We are looking very strongly to what the exact motivation was for this particular incident to take place," Saunders said. "We need every single piece of this puzzle so we can have a fulsome picture and account as to exactly what took place here."
The driver was heading south on busy Yonge Street around 1:30 p.m. and the streets were crowded with people enjoying an unseasonably warm day when the van jumped onto the sidewalk.
Ali Shaker, who was driving near the van at the time, told Canadian broadcast outlet CP24 that the driver appeared to be moving deliberately through the crowd at more than 30 mph.
"He just went on the sidewalk," a distraught Shaker said. "He just started hitting everybody, man. They hit every single person on the sidewalk. Anybody in their way they would hit."
Witness Peter Kang told CTV News that the driver did not seem to make any effort to stop.
"If it was an accident they would have stopped," Kang said. "But the person just went through the sidewalk. They could have stopped."
Video broadcast on several Canadian outlets showed police arresting the driver, dressed in dark clothes, after officers surrounded them and their rental Ryder van several blocks from where the incident occurred in the North York neighborhood of northern Toronto.
They appeared to make some sort of gesture at the police with an object in their hand just before they ordered them to lie down on the ground and took them away.
Witness Phil Zullo said that they saw police arresting the suspect and people "strewn all over the road" where the incident occurred.
"I must have seen about five, six people being resuscitated by bystanders and by ambulance drivers," Zullo said. "It was awful. Brutal."
Police shut down the Yonge and Finch intersection following the incident and Toronto's transit agency said it had suspended service on the subway line running through the area.
Trudeau on Monday expressed their sympathies for those involved.
"We should all feel safe walking in our cities and communities," they said. "We are monitoring this situation closely, and will continue working with our law enforcement partners around the country to ensure the safety and security of all Canadians."
The stretch of Yonge Street where the victims were struck remains closed to traffic and was expected to stay blocked off for several days as police continue what is likely to be a lengthy investigation.
The incident prompted police to beef up security and close several streets around the Air Canada Centre on Monday night for the Toronto-Boston NHL playoff game. Police tweeted that similar road closures may be in effect for the Toronto Raptors NBA playoff game on Wednesday night.
The incident occurred as Cabinet ministers from the major industrial countries were gathered in Canada to discuss a range of international issues in the run-up to the G7 meeting near Quebec City in June.
Canadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale called the incident a "horrific attack" and said the G7 foreign ministers extended their condolences.
The logo of Tesla is seen in Taipei, Taiwan on August 11, 2017.
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bond investors on Friday gave a $1.8 billion boost to Tesla Inc's balance sheet by snapping up the electric carmaker's first foray into the U.S. junk bond market, where yield-hungry investors have raced to lock in relatively higher returns.
Those robust returns, however, have shrunk as a strong reservoir of cash ready to deploy in the riskiest areas of the high-yield fixed income market has pushed them to near their lowest levels in three years. That has given junk-rated issuers such as Elon Musk's U.S. car company the opportunity to raise cash cheaply.
Tesla sold $1.8 billion of eight-year unsecured bonds at a yield of 5.30 percent, the Palo Alto, California-based company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The bond was sold at par, according to a source familiar with the transaction, who requested anonymity because the detail was not publicly disclosed.
Tesla initially wanted to sell $1.5 billion worth of debt but enlarged the offering because of overwhelming demand, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters unit. The yield was slightly higher than the 5.25 percent cited at the initial launch.
Cash proceeds will help finance production of Tesla's Model 3, which it is banking on to hit the mass market bullseye and finally help the company turn a profit. Tesla aims to boost production to 500,000 cars next year, about six times its 2016 output.
"It's a milestone for a company from a relative unknown to what it is today," said David Knutson, head of credit research at Schroders Investment Management.
The company, founded by Musk in 2003, has plowed revenues back into its businesses, which now include energy storage.
At the launch of the Model 3, with a base price of $35,000, Musk warned that Tesla would face months of "manufacturing hell" as it increases production of the sedan.
The ability of the high-yield sector, which some analysts and investors consider pricey, to absorb debt supply from a first-time issuer such as Tesla suggests its resilience, at least for now.
"I won't call it a bubble," said Andrew Feltus, co-head of high yield and bank loans at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston. "The (market) fundamentals are pretty good."
Standard & Poor's assigned a B-minus on Tesla's junk bond issue, while Moody's Investors Service rated it B3.
While the ability of Tesla to raise so much cash with such a low rating might revive memories of market bubbles such as the dot-com boom, strategists said that analogy did not apply.
"Tesla is not one of these companies," said Stan Shipley, a strategist at Evercore ISI in New York.
Investor appetite has driven the average yield on U.S. B-rated corporate bonds to 5.72 percent late this week, down 0.37 percentage point since the end of 2016 and below its recent peak of 10.18 percent in February 2016, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, in contrast, was 2.19 percent after hitting a six-week low earlier Friday.
ALONG FOR THE RIDE
Despite lingering skepticism, there has been no shortage of funds to fuel Tesla's ambition to popularize electric cars.
Investors who jumped on the bandwagon have been rewarded.
Tesla has raised $3.3 billion in convertible bonds, which have performed well, in step with its stock.
The stock ended up 0.7 percent at $357.72 on Friday, a near-1,400 percent increase since its debut in June 2010 at $17 a share.
Tesla might have picked just the right time to become a junk bond issuer.
Investors have jumped on new supply as defaults are expected to remain low, with the economy growing at a modest pace with little inflation.
"There is a lot of liquidity in the market. There's, on average, adequate compensation for investors," said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist at PGIM Fixed Income.
BCHL Today is a (near) daily look at what's going on around the league and the junior A world.
Welcome to the March 19, 2018 edition of BCHL Today, a (near) daily look at what's going on around the league and the junior A world.
We dive back into playoff action, with four more games in the books since last we talked.
Let's start in Vernon where the Vipers didn't have it as easy as they did in a 7-1 game-one win, but a 3-1 triumph in game two has them up 2-0 on Wenatchee.
After all the discussion about Wild goaltending, it was difficult to point the finger of blame at Austin Park in this one. They aren't great, stopping 25 of 28 shots for a .893 save percentage, but they aren't a liability either. Most nights, Park's effort gives Wenatchee a chance to win, but in this series the Wild offence is missing in action. Two games, two goals from a team that averaged a league-leading (by far) 4.15 per game during the regular season.
AJ Vanderbeck scored Saturday night. After tying for the BCHL lead with 37 snipes during the regular season, the Colorado native has just two in the post-season. If Wenatchee's goaltending isn't going to be a strength, then Vanderbeck and the Wild offence have to do more.
Credit to Vernon's stifling D and goaltender Ty Taylor. Just when you think their numbers can't get any better, Taylor drops their goals-against average to 1.65 and raises their save-percentage to .942. These are video game numbers for a goalie.
Wenatchee will hope home ice makes a difference when the series switches to the Town Toyota Center Tuesday night (7:05 p.m. start). The Wild had the league's best home ice record during the regular season, at 24-4-1-0 and they were 2-0 in their opening round sweep of Merritt.
It's safe to say game three is a must-win for Wenatchee.
————————————————————————————————————————————————
The other Interior division series isn't going well for the underdogs.
Penticton swatted Trail 7-2 at the South Okanagan Events Centre Saturday night to go up 2-0 as the series shifts back to Cominco Arena Tuesday night (7 p.m.).
The story of game two was power plays. While Trail only got two chances with the extra man, coming up empty on both, the Vees converted on five of seven opportunities. Owen Sillinger had a hat-trick, with two of their goals coming on the PP. Jackson Keane scored twice on the PP and Lukas Sillinger collected their first of the postseason on the man advantage.
Jack Barnes added an even strength goal, with Spencer McLean and Tyler Ghirardosi replying for the Smoke Eaters.
Two of Penticton's PP goals came during a five-minute major, handed to Ethan Martini for a blow to the head that came after the whistle. The six-foot-six blueliner has to be suspended for such a vicious hit, and their absence would be a blow to a Trail defence corps that is already struggling.
Adam Marcoux went the distance in the Smoke Eaters net, stopping 28 of 35 shots for a .800 save percentage. The Calgary native has struggled in this series, giving up 12 goals so far, but that may be as much a function of what's going on in front of them as anything else.
I talked about home ice being a potential lifeline for the Wenatchee Wild. Trail, on the other hand, wasn't terribly strong at the Cominco Arena, posting the BCHL's 10th best record at 18-10-1-0. The Vees, on the other hand, were the league's top road warriors at 19-8-1-1.
It's real hard to find anything Trail fans can cling to.
————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Victoria Grizzlies are digging themselves into another hole, but this time they not be able to escape.
The Grizz trail 0-2 in their second round series versus Powell River after a 3-2 loss Saturday night. Both defeats have come on home ice at the Q Centre, and now Victoria must hit the road for two games at the home of the Kings, the Hap Parker Arena.
I find goaltending fascinating, and I find the choices coaches make about goalies to be fascinating.
Victoria coach Craig Didmon started Zachary Rose in game two, and it's not like the decision blew up in their face. Rose played well, stopping 29 of 32 shots (.906 SP). My only question for Didmon would be, why such a short leash for Kurtis Chapman?
Chapman came into round two as the reigning BCHL Player of the Week after leading Victoria back from an 0-3 series deficit against Alberni Valley. They laid a major egg in game one versus Powell River, giving up four goals on 19 shots in a 5-1 loss, but despite that their overall playoff numbers are still an impressive 1.98 GAA and a .940 SP.
If he's not injured, I don't quite understand why they wouldn't get the chance to bounce back.
At the other end, Matteo Paler-Chow continues their outstanding playoff run. The Powell River netminder was busy, stopping 40 of 41 shots to earn first star honours. The 18 year old Vancouverite has posted a 2.09 GAA and .936 SP in the postseason. Goaltending could have been an Achilles Heel for the Kings, and I guess it still could be, but Paler-Chow has so far turned it into a strength.
The other item of note from their game is penalties. Later this week, I think I'll take another look at the overall numbers to see if reality is still lining up with my perception that calls are down in the playoffs. Victoria outshot Powell River 41-32 Saturday night, which is usually an indicator that a team is skating well and drawing obstruction calls.
But the Grizzlies only had one power play in the entire game. The Kings had four as referees Shayne Alyward and Hasret Sidhu kept their whistles in their pockets.
When I ran the numbers earlier in the playoffs, calls were indeed down from the regular season.
I mentioned it then and I'll repeat it now. A different standard between the regular season and playoffs drives everyone nuts, and there's no reason for it. If the idea is to ‘let the boys decide the games,' remember that a referee not making a call helps decide the game just as much as a referee making the call.
One final note on this game, coming from Powell River radio play-by-play man Alex Rawnsey.
“The two wins for Powell River on the weekend in Victoria against the Grizzlies is the first time this year (in 10 meetings) that the Kings defeated the Grizzlies in back-to-back games.”
This series resumes tonight, with a 7 p.m. start at the Hap Parker Arena.
————————————————————————————————————————————————
On to Prince George where Surrey won 3-2 Saturday night, evening that playoff series at one win apiece.
After getting throttled by a 9-1 count in game one, the Eagles had a lot to prove, and final score aside I'm not sure they did so in game two.
The shot clock favoured the Spruce Kings 48-19, and only a huge bounce-back effort from Mario Cavaliere saved Surrey from another loss. I wrote previously that Cavaliere seems prone to massive swings in performance. After coughing up six goals in that game one loss, the Ontario native produced their best game of the playoffs with a .958 SP.
RECAP: Cavaliere stopped 46 shots in a 3-2 victory in game two, as the Eagles tied the Mainland Division final 1-1 on Saturday night! Burgart notched their playoff-leading 9th goal, White potted their 3rd, and Wesley scored the eventual game-winner mid way through the third. pic.twitter.com/C6eF0Tp0pS — Surrey Eagles (@SurreyEagles) March 19, 2018
The Eagles were opportunistic with the few chances they got, which is what you have to do against PG. Desi Burgart's playoff-leading ninth goal got the scoring started midway through period two and an Aaron White strike had Surrey up 2-0 through 40 minutes. Ethan de Jong got PG on the board 7:41 into period three, but John Wesley answered at 12:21, giving the Eagles breathing room.
Ben Brar scored the second Spruce King goal with just one second on the clock.
Evan DeBrouwer had a rare meh night in the Prince George net, and he'll look to bounce back tonight as the series shifts to the South Surrey Arena for game two.

Sticking with Surrey and finishing up with a scholarship, as Jackson Ross commits to Colorado College.
Ross is heading home to play NCAA Div-I hockey. The 20 year old native of Centennial, Colorado will join the Tigers this fall, becoming the sixth Eagle player this season to earn a scholarship. The others are Jordan Robert (Clarkson), Desi Burgart (Quinnipiac), Jeff Stewart (Colgate), Chase Danol (Bowling Green) and Cory Babichuk (RPI).
Colorado College plays in the National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC) and competes against North Dakota, St. Cloud State, Denver, Western Michigan, Minnesota Duluth, Omaha and Miami (Ohio).
Ross is finishing up their second full BCHL season. They played one game in 2015-16 with Salmon Arm and has played their last 108 regular seasons and eight playoffs matches with Surrey, collecting 10 goals, 41 points and 117 penalty minutes.
“Jackson has been an absolute warrior for this organization,” said Eagles head coach Brandon West in a team press release. “We are extremely happy for them and their family. Jackson is a tireless worker that leads by example everyday and this opportunity to play in their home state is very well earned.”

FILE PHOTO: Uber CEO Travis Kalanick speaks to students during an interaction at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) campus in Mumbai, India, January 19, 2016.
(Reuters) - Venture capital firm Benchmark Capital said on Monday it gave Uber and its ousted chief executive, Travis Kalanick, a month to review its recommendations before filing a lawsuit last week to force them off the board and rescind their ability to fill three seats.
The lawsuit, filed last Thursday, also accused Kalanick of concealing a range of misdeeds from the board and scheming to retain power at Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] even after they were forced to resign as CEO in late June.
"We know that many of you are asking why Benchmark filed a lawsuit against Travis last week. Perhaps the better question is why we didn't act sooner," Benchmark said in a letter to Uber employees on Monday. (bit.ly/2fFWmwK)
Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Kalanick was still involved in the day-to-day operations at Uber, which has created a sense of uncertainty and undermined the search for their replacement, Benchmark Capital said.
"Indeed, it has appeared at times as if the search was being manipulated to deter candidates and create a power vacuum in which Travis could return," Benchmark said in the letter.
The well-regarded venture firm was an early investor in Uber and said in the lawsuit that it owns 13 percent of Uber and controls 20 percent of the voting power.
Three people were shot at killed at a Wisconsin drag racing track on Sunday night.
Police and emergency crews respond to shooting at drag race track in Kenosha County.
It happened at Great Lakes Dragaway in Kenosha County around 7 p.m. Roughly 5,000 people were there for an event.
Witnesses say the victims were standing near the concessions stand when the suspect walked up and shot them at very close range. Police believe the victims are from Illinois.
"It's a difficult situation and I'd feel a lot better, if there's a way to feel better about this, if we had the suspect in custody," said Sheriff David Beth. "So, that is still a work in progress and I look forward to this person being caught."
Investigators are still searching for that suspect and trying to piece together exactly what happened.
Guwahati: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday inaugurated the two-day Global Investors' Summit in Guwahati, a first of its kind initiative in the North East, and said a new terminal being constructed at Guwahati airport would boost the region's connectivity with ASEAN countries.
Addressing the event, being held at the Sarusojai Stadium in Guwahati, the prime minister expressed their happiness that Bangladesh and Bhutan have opened their consulate offices in Guwahati and said the North East is at the heart of India's 'Act East policy'.
Modi said the initiatives taken by the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre for the last three and half years "are becoming evident" and that their government had spent Rs 5,300 crore every year in northeastern states to improve the railway network.
"Rs 4,700 crore was allocated to extend railway connectivity to 15 new destinations. When the Agartala (Tripura)-Akhaura (Bangladesh) railway connectivity becomes a reality in the near future, the whole region will be benefited," said Modi.
They said the tagline of the meet 'Advantage Assam: India's expressway to ASEAN' is very appropriate and it is not just a statement but a "comprehensive vision".
"We created the Act East policy and the North East is at the heart of it. The 'Act East' policy requires increased people to people contact, trade ties and other relations with countries on India's east, particularly ASEAN countries," Modi said.
"Our vision is development of the eastern part of India, as the country's fast pace of development will only be effective when the people living in the North East develop," they said.
Modi said that roads and railways are being constructed at a faster pace in the North East and electricity is being generated at a similar pace.
The summit, a first of its kind two-day initiative, is expected to see participation of top industrialists of the country including Ratan Tata and Mukesh Ambani.
The summit is likely to see the participation of over 5,000 delegates from across the world, including ASEAN countries.
Officials said that over 250 MOUs worth Rs 60,000 crore are expected to be signed on the first day of the summit on Saturday.
Other top industrialists are expected to participate include, Anand Burman (Dabur), Subhash Chandra (Essel Group and ZEE), Amar Abrol (Air Asia India), Rashesh Shah (Edelweiss), Sushil Goenka (Emami Group), Sanjiv Puri (ITC Limited), Harshavardhan Neotia (Ambuja Neotia Cements), and Balakrishan Goenka (Welspun Group). Naresh Trehan (Medanta- The Medicity) and filmmaker Subhash Ghai are also expected to attend.
Business seminars on 12 focus sectors will be held on both the days including Agriculture and Food Processing - organic cultivation and bamboo, handloom, textile and handicrafts, logistics, river transport and port township, Information Technology and ITeS, pharmaceutical and medical equipment, plastics and petrochemicals, power, tourism, hospitality and wellness, civil aviation, petroleum and natural gas and startups innovation.
"Investments in our promising sectors are key to the economic growth of the state. The objective is also to position Assam as India's Expressway to ASEAN. The summit is based on the core principles of the 'Act East' policy," Assam industry minister Chandra Mohan Patowary said on Saturday.
They said the Government of Assam is fully geared up for its first maiden Global Investors' Summit. Several Union Ministers including Nitin Gadkari, Suresh Prabhu, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Smriti Zubin Irani, Dharmendra Pradhan, Jitendra Singh, Kiren Rijiju are expected to take part in the proceedings as well.
Mumbai: The Shiv Sena on Monday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of resorting to "histrionics" and pulling the ongoing poll campaign for the Gujarat elections to "a new low".
The critical ally of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party said that Modi "dug up the graves of the Mughal regime" in their campaign - instead of speaking about "vikas" (development) issues - to target the opposition Congress.
"The people of Gujarat had already rejected the Congress for 22 years for this very reason. The prime minister chose to ignore the progress and developmental issues and stooped to mere 'tu-tu, main-main' (rhetoric) in their own home-state," Shiv Sena in a strong edit in the party mouthpieces, "Saamana" and "Dopahar Ka Saamana", said.
It pointed out how Modi oscillated between "very emotional" and "highly aggressive" in their public meetings and wondered what prompted the BJP to such bottom-level campaigning tactics, with its party chief Amit Shah, all cabinet ministers, state chief ministers and other leaders swooping on Gujarat to defeat Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi.
The edit mentioned the "neech" (lowly) reference made by "jobless" Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar which Modi countered by claiming it was "an attack on Gujarati pride" which raked up a controversy that subsided only after Aiyar apologised.
"This reference to me is an insult not to the country, but to the people of Gujarat", was Modi's refrain as the Congress attempted a damage control by suspending Aiyar from the party.
"By such a statement, Modi made themselves small. We always believed they stood for the 'pride' of the people and all the Hindus of the country, but they still remain stuck in the Gujarat rut.
"He came across more as a regional leader than a national figure, but when others raise issues of 'regional pride' they are threatened into silence by the sword of 'national pride'," Shiv Sena added sharply.
"It has been made clear by the BJP that truths and lies no longer matter in winning elections, as also issues of 'vikas', which is the reason why the party even forgot to publish its manifesto and "nobody raised developmental issues in the campaigns," the edit said.
The Gujarat poll campaign was reduced to mere theatrics, making emotional speeches, shedding tears, and doing 'tandav' (Dance of Death), and in the final stages, Modi became very sentimental by referring to "the people of the country are my family".
"Does this imply that all past presidents, prime ministers and other top leaders had no relationship with the people? Some like Indira Gandhi sacrificed their lives, while many others spent years in jail, for the country.
"They sacrificed so much because they considered the people of India as their family," Shiv Sena said sternly.
Not only them, it reminded that even the soldiers who were getting killed on the borders are a part of the same family, and urged the ruling dispensation to rein in their highly emotive speeches.

Kareena Kapoor, Karan Johar's children are the new BFFs in town: Social Media Stalkers' Guide
In a breathtaking followup to the mid-October discovery of our first detection of a strange 800 meters long by 80 wide interstellar visitors, the world's scientific community is initiating a probe to see if it's an ancient shard of an extinct planet or an alien technology reminiscent of the 20010 Space Odyssey monolith.
As Scientific American author Lee Billings writes: "Oumuamua [Hawaiian for “first messenger”] appeared to have been dropped in on our solar system from some great interstellar height, picking up even more speed on a slingshot-like loop around the sun before soaring away for parts unknown. It is now already halfway to Jupiter, too far for a rendezvous mission and rapidly fading from the view of Earth's most powerful telescopes."
"What's more,' Billings observed, "it is twirling at a rate that could tear a loosely-bound rubble pile apart. Whatever ‘Oumuamua is, it appears to be quite solid—likely composed of rock, or even metal—seemingly tailor-made to weather long journeys between stars. So far there are few if any wholly satisfactory explanations as to how such an extremely elongated solid object could naturally form, let alone endure the forces of a natural high-speed ejection from a star system—a process thought to involve a wrenching encounter with a giant planet."
These odd features have raised the adrenaline level among the planet's SETI community, spurring Breakthrough Listen founder Yuri Milner to initiate an active probe for interstellar radio transmissions from other cosmic civilizations. If ‘Oumuamua is in fact artificial, observes Billings, "it might be transmitting or at least leaking radio waves."
This Wednesday at 3 p.m. Eastern time, the Breakthrough Listen project will target the West Virgina-based 100-meter Green Bank Telescope at ‘Oumuamua for 10 hours of observations in a wide range of radio frequencies, scanning the object across its entire rotation in search of any signals.
“With our equipment at Green Bank, we can detect a signal the strength of a mobile phone coming out of this object,” Milner says.

Giancarlo Stanton, who led MLB in home runs last season, joins Aaron Judge and a Yankees lineup that smashed a league-leading 241 homers last season. There will be fireworks in the Bronx in 2018. (0:44)
The deal: The Marlins trade OF Giancarlo Stanton (and their contract) to the Yankees for 2B Starlin Castro and two minor leaguers, P Jorge Guzman and SS Jose Devers. The Yankees will reportedly take on $265 million of Stanton's remaining $295 million.
Editor's Picks The scariest part about Giancarlo Stanton in pinstripes? Their fit at Yankee Stadium Stanton is baseball's most dangerous long-ball threat.

Why it's a good deal for the Yankees: Merry Christmas, baseball fans! Depending on how you feel about the Yankees, this is either the biggest lump of coal in your baseball stocking since the Yankees acquired Alex Rodriguez, or a better present than a Red Ryder BB gun. I am pretty sure Dave Dombrowski just threw up.
Obviously, this is a trade of potential epic and season-altering scale, at least based on Stanton's 2017 level of performance that netted them the 2017 National League MVP Award after hitting 59 home runs. Pairing them with Aaron Judge gives the club not just a dynamic offensive duo, but a physically imposing dynamic duo that will be must-watch TV. Get to the park early to catch batting practice when the Yankees come to town.

LONDON-All Saints have reunited with ‘Pure Shores' producer William Orbit on their new album ‘Testament'. The 90s group - comprised of Shaznay Lewis, Melanie Blatt and Nicole and Natalie Appleton - have announced their fifth studio LP will be released on July 13, with lead single ‘Love Lasts Forever' dropping on Thursday. Shaznay has hailed Orbit - who has produced some of the biggest acts of all time, from Britney Spears and Madonna to U2 and Sugababes - ‘'the king of beautiful interesting sounds''. The ‘Never Ever' hitmakers have worked with a whole host of producers and songwriters on the record. Another notable member of their team is Karl ‘K-Gee' Gordon, who helped launch their career in 1996 with their production on their self-titled debut LP - which scored three consecutive number one hits in the UK, and led ‘K-Gee' to work on tracks for the likes of the late George Michael, Sir Rod Stewart and Jessie J - and has co-written the lead track.
Fred Ball has also been working with All Saints again too following their successful work on ‘Summer Rain' and ‘Puppet On A String' from their 2016 comeback LP, ‘Red Flag'.
The band have also reunited with producer Hutch again after they worked their magic on their bold song ‘One Strike' two years ago, which documents an emotional phone call between Nicole and their bandmate Shaznay about the end of their marriage to Liam Gallagher.
Nicole has 16-year-old son Gene with the ex-Oasis frontman - who they split from in August 2013 after they discovered they had fathered a love child with American journalist Liza Ghorbani.
Speaking about the collaborative record, Shaznay said: ‘'This album feels exactly where we should be - and want to be - right now creatively.
‘'We worked extremely hard to make sure every sound on this album was exactly right, alongside my right-hand man K-Gee - and the girls made sure we kept this album heading in the direction that felt right for us as a band.
‘'I really enjoyed writing this album with some very talented producers including Karl ‘K-Gee' Gordon, Fred Ball, Hutch, and a brilliant young producer George Moore who's new to our team who brought a whole new flavour to the record.
‘'A highlight was reuniting with the king of beautiful interesting sounds, William Orbit, which was just amazing.''
Whilst Nicole added: ‘'Making this album has been an incredible experience. I've had the best journey and, as always, endless fun and laughter with my girls! Every song on the album means something to me that's why I love it so much! I'm so super proud of it.''
All Saints have also announced a gig at London's Brixton Electric on July 11, where they'll debut new tracks from ‘Testament'.
Tickets for the concert go on sale on Friday.

LAHORE : Punjab Higher Education Commission has decided to take action against illegal private universities by shutting their campuses.
As many as 12 private universities have been declared upto the standard however, inspection of other universities is also underway.
Sources told that HEC has issued directives to the officials to clearly monitor the working and facilities of the institutions. The universities with substandard services would be shut down on immediate basis.
According to HEC, several universities constructed in small bungalows are running M.phil and PhD programs with lack of vigilant faculty and teachers due to which action is required against them.
It is pertinent to mention here that such universities are holding license from federal HEC which Punjab HEC is not accepting .
Chairperson of Punjab HEC Dr Nizam-ud-Din said that no favor or reference would be accommodated in this matter.

Nearly a month after the release of Selena Gomez's latest single, "Bad Liar," the 24-year-old singer finally dropped a much-anticipated video for the sultry lovesick anthem — and it doesn't disappoint.
Billed as a "film" in its promotional poster, the video sees Gomez seamlessly juggling four characters, all of whom interact with one another — a quiet teenager, their stay-at-home mother, schoolteacher father and even the coquettish woman who may or may not be the object of Dad's affections.
With a melody that borrows its bass line from Talking Heads' "Psycho Killer" and a directorial vision by Lemonheads bassist (and, more recently, TV director) Jesse Peretz, the video fuses a retro '70s aesthetic (Farrah Fawcett wigs and all) with an eerie, seductive atmosphere.
The video closes with a brief teaser for Gomez's next project, called "Fetish," coming soon. The last thing we see is a fleeting clip of Gomez, with an expression somewhere between vacant and austere, staring solemnly into the camera before tearfully mouthing "fetish" in a close-up of their lips.
Watch Gomez's "Bad Liar" video above.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - For the oil-trading community, the fall of hedge fund manager Andy Hall signaled a heavy blow, but while commodity funds continue to shutter their doors, some are finding other ways to make money, including trading refining margins and calendar spreads.
Commodity hedge funds have dwindled in recent years as oil prices slumped, leaving only a handful of larger players, including Hall, who ran the Astenbeck Capital Management fund until deciding to close it following losses this year.
A number of funds bet heavily on an oil rally early in the year, boosting long futures positions to a record in late February, before oil went into a prolonged slump as global supply remained elevated despite cuts from OPEC.
Many commodity funds have struggled this year as oil stagnated and volatility fell, hurting bets on large back-and-forth fluctuations. According to Credit Suisse, CTA funds - which concentrate on futures - were down 2.8 percent in 2017 through the end of July, while Hedge Fund Research's commodity hedge fund index was down 0.9 percent through the end of July.
Betting on other spreads has worked better with refining margins increasing sharply this year, as heavy demand for distillates has boosted those margins by more than 50 percent in the last two months.
After remaining depressed for most of 2016, gasoline margins have also rebounded. U.S. refining margins rallied to the highest in nearly two years early this month.
“Refining margins are healthy worldwide and global demand is healthy,” said RCMA Asset Management Chairman Doug King, whose Merchant Commodity Fund runs some $190 million in commodities. That fund is down 12 percent on the year, however.
Oil dropped sharply in March, bringing down Hall along with others including Andurand Commodities Fund, which through the end of July had lost more than 15 percent, according to a source close to the firm.
Those funds did not respond to request for comment.
"Funds started the year at record length in futures,” said Matthew Perry, partner at energy-focused hedge fund Kronenberg Capital Advisors LLC. "That turned out to be devastating for most traders."
Hall's decline was most surprising, according to traders, given decades of history in the market. But in a late 2016 investor letter they said OPEC's deal to cut supply meant the cartel was going to be more heavily involved in setting prices, and was likely to be bullish.
Not all funds are doing poorly. A group of 12 energy hedge funds monitored by Eurekahedge are up 5.1 percent so far this year. It is unclear if these funds are included in other indexes.
IN SEARCH OF LOST VOLATILITY
Volatility, as measured by the CBOE Crude Oil Volatility Index, has fallen in 2017. After two years of big price swings, the oil VIX has generally stayed below 30 in 2017, a level consistent with rangebound trading, which frustrates fund managers hoping for more up-and-down action.
“You can't put a lot of money to work when crude oil is trapped in a six-dollar range," said a hedge fund manager who could not comment on the record.
Some funds say they are finding opportunities in other areas, such as calendar spreads. These spreads measure price differences between pairs of contracts with different delivery dates, and they have been moving around more of late.
On Thursday, the December 2017 U.S. crude futures contract traded at a premium to the December 2018 contract briefly, known as backwardation.
“Time spreads and refinery margins have seen significant moves of late," said a hedge fund industry source who could not comment on the record. "The people who will do well trade dynamically and take long and short positions."
MIAMI-Traces of pesticides that act as nerve agents on bees have been found in 75 percent of honey worldwide, raising concern about the survival of these crucial crop pollinators, researchers said.
Human health is not likely at risk from the concentrations detected in a global sampling of 198 types of honey, which were below what the European Union authorizes for human consumption, said the report in the journal Science.
However, the study found that 34 percent of honey samples were contaminated with “concentrations of neonicotinoids that are known to be detrimental” to bees, and warned that chronic exposure is a threat to bee survival.
Bees help pollinate 90 percent of the world's major crops, but in recent years have been dying off from “colony collapse disorder,” a mysterious scourge blamed on mites, pesticides, virus, fungus, or some combination of these factors.
“The findings are alarming,” said Chris Connolly, a neurobiology expert at the University of Dundee, who also wrote a Perspective article alongside the research in Science. “The levels detected are sufficient to affect bee brain function and may hinder their ability to forage on, and pollinate, our crops and our native plants.” Neonicotinoids have been declared a key factor in bee decline worldwide, and the European Union issued a partial ban on their use in 2013.
For the Science study, the European samples were collected largely before this ban took effect, Connolly said. Further research is needed to gauge the effectiveness of the EU steps.
Bees collect nectar as they pollinate plants, and over time this sugary liquid accumulates into the thick syrup of honey. To test contamination levels, samples of honey were taken from local producers worldwide, and researchers tested for five commonly used neonicotinoids: acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam.
These pesticides, introduced in the mid 1990s, are based on the chemical structure of nicotine and attack the nervous systems of insect pests.
“Overall, 75 percent of all honey samples contained at least one neonicotinoid,” said the study, led by Edward Mitchell of the University of Neuchatel in Switzerland.
“Of these contaminated samples, 30 percent contained a single neonicotinoid, 45 percent contained two or more, and 10 percent contained four or five.”
The frequency of contamination was highest in the North American samples (86 percent), followed by Asia (80 percent) and Europe (79 percent).
The lowest concentrations were seen in South American samples (57 percent).
“These results suggest that a substantial proportion of world pollinators are probably affected by neonicotinoids,” said the study.
Our planet is home to some 20,000 species of bees, which fertilize more than 90 percent of the world's 107 major crops.
The United Nations warned in 2016 that 40 percent of invertebrate pollinators - particularly bees and butterflies - risk global extinction.
Experts said that while the findings are not exactly a surprise, the threat posed by neonicotinoids should be taken seriously.
“The levels recorded (up to 56 nanograms per gram) lie within the bioactive range that has been shown to affect bee behavior and colony health,” said plant ecologist Jonathan Storkey, who was not involved in the study.
“Scientists showed earlier this year that levels of less than 9 ng/g reduced wild bee reproductive success,” they added.
“I therefore agree with the authors that the accumulation of pesticides in the environment and the concentrations found in hives is a serious environmental concern and is likely contributing to pollinator declines.”
According to Lynn Dicks, natural environment research council fellow at the University of East Anglia, the findings are “sobering” but don't offer a precise picture of the threat to bees.
“The severity of the global threat to all wild pollinators from neonicotinoids is not completely clear from this study, because we don't know how the levels measured in honey relate to actual levels in nectar and pollen that wild pollinators are exposed to,” they said.
The levels of exposure to harmful pesticides may be far higher than what can be measured in honey, said Felix Wackers, a professor at Lancaster University who was not involved in the research.
“This shows that honeybees are commonly exposed to this group of pesticides while collecting neonicotinoid-contaminated nectar from treated crops or from flowers that have come into contact with spray drift or soil residues,” they said.
“The actual level of exposure can be substantially higher, as the honey samples analyzed in this study represents an average of nectar collection over time and space.”

One widespread point of agreement in Congress after Wednesday's baseball practice shooting was that the toll would have been much worse had Republican Whip Steve Scalise's security detail not been at the playing field.
Top congressional leaders are protected around the clock by the Capitol Police, a practice that was bolstered after several incidents, including a 1998 shooting at the Capitol and the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.
But now, in today's intensely polarized political environment, more members want to reconsider their own security needs.
“Everyone's getting a bunch of death threats right now,” said Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) as lawmakers exited a closed-door briefing on Capitol Hill with law enforcement officials. “A lot of members were asking for changes.”
Lawmakers feel particularly vulnerable at rowdy town hall events or when traveling unprotected away from the watchful eyes of police patrolling the Capitol complex. One lawmaker involved in Wednesday's shooting noted that their great concern was that none of the ballplayers was armed and able to stop the shooter.
“They saved our lives,” Rep. Chuck Fleischmann (R-Tenn.) said about the Capitol Police.
Without Scalise's security detail, “it would have been a very, very bad situation,” said Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.)
Lawmakers peppered officials at the briefing with requests for increased security and suggested they should be allowed to dip into campaign funds for protection.
No new procedures were announced after the morning shooting that left Scalise and others hospitalized. Security appeared particularly tight Wednesday at the Capitol.
Rep. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), a former Air Force fighter pilot, said they have received death threats this year in their Tucson-area district that once was held by Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head at a meeting with constituents outside a grocery store in 2011. They urged Americans, and colleagues, toward civility.
“For all the noise and all the fury, we are one family,” Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said on the House floor. “Let's just slow down and reflect, to think about how we're all being tested right now. Because we are being tested right now.”
Two leaders of the congressional baseball teams, Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas) and Rep. Mike Doyle (D-Penn.), were taking stock of security.
Barton said they may think twice about again taking their son, Jack, to congressional events, never having expected shooting violence at the 6 a.m. baseball practice.
Doyle said “perhaps we should” reconsider security at events where many lawmakers are present, but they said “most members will tell you they feel fine and are not seeking an increase in security.”
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) noted that, other than former President Obama, they probably have had more threats on their life than any member of Congress.
“You may not know this, my colleagues, but every time I pray, which is frequently, and certainly every Sunday, I pray for all of you,” Pelosi said in remarks in the House.
Early on, they said they used to pray that lawmakers could work together, citing former President Kennedy's inaugural address to do God's work.
“But in more recent years, I have been praying not only for that, but for our safety,” they said.
WASHINGTON (AP)  It was a flip-floppy week at the White House as President Donald Trump walked away from some promises and people, contorting reality in the process.
They declared NATO no longer obsolete, even though the alliance hasnt changed much since they denigrated it in the 2016 campaign. They credited China with ceasing the manipulation of its currency, swerving away from a campaign pledge with a belated acknowledgment that China had changed its ways.
The presidents chief strategist, Steve Bannon, joined a list of people Trump has claimed to know well until they said they didnt. Russian President Vladimir Putin is on the list, too, as they have been for some time. I dont know Putin, Trump said in characterizing U.S.-Russia relations as the worst ever. Hed bragged in 2015, I got to know them very well.
As they performed such acrobatics to explain a series of shifts, Trump also committed several more familiar sleights of rhetoric, taking credit where it isnt due in job growth and corporate expansion.

A look at some of their statements this past week:
TRUMP: The secretary-general and I had a productive discussion about what more NATO can do in the fight against terrorism. I complained about that a long time ago and they made a change, and now they do fight terrorism. I said it was obsolete. Its no longer obsolete.  news conference Wednesday with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg
THE FACTS: NATO has not substantively changed its mission as a result of Trumps campaign-season complaints. As evidence that NATO is heeding their call to be more aggressive on terrorism, Trump has cited a NATO decision last year to establish a high-level intelligence coordinator that could make the alliance more nimble in responding to threats. But that position was in the works during the Obama administration and came about because of worries about Russian aggression as well as from a desire to respond more effectively to the Islamic State group. It wasnt in response to Trump.
--------------
TRUMP: Already weve created more than almost 600,000 jobs.  to CEOs on Tuesday.
THE FACTS: More than almost?
First, Trump is taking credit for three months of job creation even though they wasnt president for two-thirds of January. Second, the economy doesnt turn on a dime  or an inauguration. Over time, their predecessors influence on the economy wanes and Trumps grows.
Third, they took actual job growth and rounded it up  way up. The economy added 533,000 jobs in the first three months, not the 600,000 claimed by Trump on several occasions. Thats a monthly average of 178,000 jobs. President Barack Obamas pace was slightly better last year: 187,000 jobs per month on average.
--------------
TRUMP: We may be at an all-time low in terms of relationship with Russia.  news conference Wednesday
THE FACTS: Arguably true in the post-Soviet era. Not so during the decades of the Cold War, shadowed by the threat of nuclear annihilation.
The U.S. and the Soviet Union were on the verge of a nuclear conflict in October 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis. In the Korean War, Soviet pilots covertly backed North Korea against U.S.-led forces. Tensions also were high after a U.S. U-2 spy plane was shot down over Russia and its pilot, Gary Powers, was imprisoned and tried for espionage. And the U.S. helped militants fight the Soviets in Afghanistan in the 1980s.
--------------
TRUMP: Toyota just announced that it will invest more than $1.3 billion ... into its Georgetown, Kentucky, plant, an investment that would not have been made if we didnt win the election.  to CEOs on Tuesday.
THE FACTS: Trumps election was not the spark for the investment. Toyota said the announcement was the culmination of plans in the works for at least four years.
--------------
TRUMP: The car industry is not going to leave us anymore, believe me. The car industry is staying in our country. They were leaving  if I didnt win this election, you would have lost your car industry to Mexico and to other countries. Theyre not leaving anymore, believe me. Theres retribution if they leave. There was no retribution.  Fox Business Network interview, broadcast Wednesday
THE FACTS: The only retribution they have meted out has come on Twitter and in other rhetorical forms. They havent signed any laws or instituted rules to punish fleeing industries. In fact, Ford Motor Co. is still planning to move small car production from Michigan to an existing plant in Mexico next year.
--------------
TRUMP, on their chief strategist, Steve Bannon: I like Steve, but you have to remember they were not involved in my campaign until very late. I had already beaten all the senators and all the governors, and I didnt know Steve. Im my own strategist, and it wasnt like I was going to change strategies because I was facing crooked Hillary.  Interview on Tuesday with the New York Post.
THE FACTS: Trump shortchanges their relationship with Bannon in an apparent effort to downgrade their importance.
David Bossie, who was deputy campaign manager, told The Associated Press after Trump took office that Bossie had introduced Trump and Bannon in 2011 at Trump Tower and they had grown close. Bannon interviewed Trump at least nine times in 2015 and 2016.
In August 2016, when the Trump campaign announced the hiring of Bannon as campaign CEO and the appointment of Kellyanne Conway as campaign manager, its statement quoted Trump as saying: I have known Steve and Kellyanne both for many years.
--------------
TRUMP: I dont know Putin.  news conference on Wednesday.
THE FACTS: Trumps claimed familiarity with Putin has waxed and waned according to political circumstance.
It waxed when it served their interest to demonstrate comfort dealing with world leaders. I got to know them very well because we were both on 60 Minutes, we were stablemates, and we did very well that night, they said in November 2015. Actually, Putin spoke from Moscow and Trump from New York and appeared in separate segments of the show.
It waned when Trumps frequently admiring comments about Putin became a liability and Russias alleged interference in the U.S. election came to light. I never met Putin, I dont know who Putin is, they said in July, and essentially ever since.
The two spoke by phone Jan. 28, when Putin congratulated the new president.
--------------
TRUMP on their decision to attack a Syrian air base: What I did should have been done by the Obama administration a long time before I did it, and you would have had a much better  I think Syria would be a lot better off right now than it has been.  Fox Business interview.
THE FACTS: Trump may think that now, but they certainly didnt three years ago when Obama was contemplating retaliation following a deadly chemical weapons attack in a Damascus suburb.
Among several tweets they sent advising against a strike: President Obama, do not attack Syria. There is no upside and tremendous downside. Save your powder for another (and more important) day!
--------------
TRUMP on China: Theyre not currency manipulators.  Wall Street Journal interview Wednesday.
THE FACTS: Here Trump catches up with reality. During the campaign they pledged to brand China a currency manipulator, a move that would set the stage for trade penalties. China had once devalued its currency to make its exports artificially cheaper, crowding out other countries products, but in recent years has let market forces do more to shape currency exchange rates. When Trump railed against Chinese currency manipulation in the campaign, there were signs that China was actually taking steps to keep the value of the yuan from sinking further against the dollar.
Trump didnt let go of their accusation easily. As recently as April 2 they told The Financial Times that the Chinese are world champions of currency manipulation.
--------------
TRUMP: I think were doing very well on health care. Its been very much misreported that we failed with health care.  Fox Business interview
THE FACTS: By any objective measure, thats sugar-coating a faltering health care initiative.
Last month, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., yanked the Republican bill intended to repeal and replace much of Obamas health care law. The problem: disagreements among GOP hard-liners and moderates, and no Democratic support. Since then, negotiations have led to some tweaks, but no apparent breakthroughs.
Thats not to say they cant succeed on another try. But after the bill flopped, an AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found that among seven major issues tested, the president got their worst rating on health care. About 6 in 10 disapproved of Trumps handling of the issue.

QUETTA - Armed assailants shot dead two barbers in hit-and-run offense in Quetta on Wednesday.
According to police, unidentified armed motorcyclists sprayed bullets on a barber shop at Manu Jan Road Quetta killing two brothers at the shop. The dead bodies were shifted to a nearby hospital for medico-legal formalities and handed over to the relatives afterwards. The deceased were identified as Abdul Latif and Muhammad Rafiq. They belonged to Punjab. The police were investigating the matter. The incident of barbers' killing came hardly three days after the target killing of three cops at Sariab Road.
TWO CHILDREN CRUSHED TO DEATH
In another incident, an over-speeding vehicle crushed two children to death at Airport Road.
A child died on the spot while other was shifted to Civil Hospital in serious condition where they succumbed to their injuries. The driver managed to escape from the scene.
THREE TERRORISTS KILLED IN QUETTA
INP adds: Three terrorists including two Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) commanders were killed by security forces during separate operations in different areas here on Wednesday. According to police sources, a terrorist was shot dead in a police encounter at Qambrani Road. Two key BLA commanders named Nazar Muhammad alias Beerbak and Muhammad Jan alias Chota were killed in an operation at Leela, Quetta area.
The two BLA commanders were said to be involved in 17 bomb blasts, different incidents of target killings and over 80 terror incidents.
Security forces mention that links to training camps in Afghanistan were traced via mobile phones of the killed terrorists.
Scarlett Johansson responds to criticism for being cast as transgender in upcoming movie Rub & Tub
Scarlett Johansson has issued a statement after receiving flak regarding playing the role of a transgender in their newly-announced movie, Rub & Tub, directed by Rupert Sanders.
The 33-year-old actor is set to portray Jean Marie Gill, who succeeded in Pittsburgh's 1970s and 1980s massage parlour and prostitution business by assuming the identity of a man, Dante 'Tex' Gill.
Soon after the announcement, fans and critics pointed out that Gill seems to have lived as a transgender man, not a cisgender woman like Johansson.
The Avengers: Infinity War star also faced criticism in response to their casting as a Japanese human-cyborg in Ghost in the Shell, which many fans perceived as whitewashing.
When asked for comment, the representatives for the actor told Bustle, "Tell them that they can be directed to Jeffrey Tambor, Jared Leto, and Felicity Huffman's reps for comment."
Johansson's statement alludes to performances by - Tambor, Leto and Huffman, fellow cisgender actors who have played transgender characters on screen.
Tambor played a trans woman named Maura in Transparent, a show from which they were fired after facing allegations of sexual harassment, which they have denied. The actor, who scored an Emmy for best lead actor in a comedy in 2016, has earlier called to "please give transgender talent a chance".
Huffman and Leto were both nominated for Oscars for their roles in Transamerica (2005) and Dallas Buyers Club (2013), respectively.
The publication reached out to New Regency and 20th Century Fox for comment on Johansson's statement, but did not receive an immediate response.

Islamabad: Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa has lashed out at the US for carrying out drone strikes "unilaterally" on a militant hideout in the tribal Orakzai Agency.
"Unilateral actions, like a drone strike, etc, are counterproductive and against (the) spirit of...ongoing cooperation and intelligence-sharing being diligently undertaken by Pakistan," the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Thursday quoted General Bajwa as saying.
"Pakistan Army is capable of taking effective measure if actionable intelligence is shared," General Bajwa said, referring to Tuesday's drone strike in the Spin Thall area of Orakzai Agency adjacent to North Waziristan Agency.
According to media reports, a US drone fired two missiles at a compound, killing two suspected militants, including a leader of the Haqqani network, Abubakar.
General Bajwa on Wednesday said the Pakistan Army would continue its efforts to consolidate gains achieved thus far and added that the army stood with all other institutions to get Pakistan rid of menaces retarding its progress and prosperity.
As expected, the results depended on the strain of dicty and species of bacteria; in several cases, the dictys completely obliterated a thriving biofilm containing millions of bacteria within a day or two. The study, Filutowicz says, “contains the first movies ever to show dicty cells moving into a biofilm and devouring the bacteria.”
Because they form a multi-cellular phase sometimes called a “slug,” dictys are sometimes called “social amoeba.”
Beyond the visual evidence, spore germination and the subsequent union of single-celled dictys into a multi-cellular “slug” both showed successful attacks against all four species of bacteria.
Filutowicz became interested in dictys after discovering a neglected archive of about 1,800 strains amassed by Kenneth Raper, a bacteriology colleague who started collecting the soil-borne microbes around the world in the 1930s. “Raper was the first to isolate dictys, but after they died, their life work was scattered around the department and neglected,” Filutowicz says.
Filutowicz was intrigued, but they knew very little about dictys. Then, the answer to their most fundamental question — “How do I grow them?” triggered a mental chain reaction. They found that Raper and their followers were feeding and growing dictys in the lab using bacterial prey, but nobody had apparently pursued their real-world potential as microbe hunters. “If you grow them on E coli [a common resident of the human intestine], I quickly realized, because dictys are not pathogenic, we might use them as a biological weapon against bacteria.”
Having previously started Conjugon, a company devoted to developing benign bacteria to defeat pathogenic microbes, Filutowicz says they were “attuned to biological approaches, which were unheard then, and so this idea fell on a very fertile mind.”
With bacteria becoming resistant to a growing number of antibiotics, that's welcome news, although using a living organism may add complexity to the task of getting regulatory approval.
Since 2010, Filutowicz has learned a good deal about how dicty “graze” upon bacteria, and which ones they prefer. “We looked at how these cells dismantle biofilms, trying to understand what physical, chemical and mechanical forces deconstruct the biofilms, and how the dictys move in 3-D space. These are phagocytes, and they behave much like our own immune cells,” says Filutowicz.
Their collaborator, Curtis Brandt, a professor of ophthalmology and visual science at UW–Madison, has produced promising results suggesting that the organisms are harmless to rodents, and is preparing to use dictys to fight bacterial keratitis, an eye infection, first in rodents and then in humans, in research supported by the National Institutes of Health.
“This medical application may not reach the clinic in my lifetime, but it has a lot of promise, and eventually we may be able to advance it in many other medical uses,” Filutowicz says.
In 2010, Filutowicz formed Amoebagone, to advance research into use of dictys, starting by trying to fight fire blight and other bacterial infections of fruit trees and vegetables; supported by the National Science Foundation.
Between the far-off human medical potential, and the near-term use in agriculture, Filutowicz is delightedly pulling on the thread left by Ken Raper's beneficial microbes; licensed by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation to AmoebaGone.
“To make a discovery, it needs some level of naiveté,” they say. “If you know too much, you immediately appreciate why things will not work, cannot work. Otherwise, if it was a good idea, people would have done it already. Colleagues said dictys behaved like human phagocytes, but they never mentioned harnessing them as biological controls. Every day I walk through the departmental hallway and read the inscription: “Discovery consists of seeing of what everybody has seen and thinking what nobody has thought. I was lucky enough to enter this as the foolish innocent.”

× Expand SIUE student organizations competed in a tricycle race during Springfest 2018.
Southern Illinois University Edwardsville's longest-running annual event on campus, Springfest, featured a week of fun traditions, entertainment and activities April 16-20. The 2018 theme was Stranger Things.
“Every year I look forward to Springfest,” junior mass communications major Mollie Thompson said. “There's always so many different events that everyone can get involved in. It highlights our diverse community as we all have fun together.”
Springfest events included Cougar's Got Talent, a waffle-eating contest, Goshen Arcade, a student organization expo, a trike race, comedian Mike Epps, and an Upside Down party, as well as the annual Giant Banana Split, sponsored by TheBANKof Edwardsville, and the Glow Run, sponsored by Campus Recreation.
“I took part in the waffle-eating contest,” said Ezekiel Chavez, a senior biological sciences major. Chavez earned first place for eating 11 waffles and correctly answering a trivia question to break a three-way tie for the championship. They represented the Hispanic Student Union.
“I was really hungry when I came to compete,” Chavez said. “I participate in everything I can.”
Freshmen Paige Pustelnik and Kayla Ringo enjoyed their first time eating ice cream scooped from a canoe.
“Springfest is super exciting,” Ringo said. “It's a great stress reliever from finals, that got us outdoors.”
Junior Kamariah Lewis helped their sorority raise money by selling food on the Quad during Springfest's organization expo.
“This is a great opportunity for any organization to get their name out around campus and raise money for their chapter,” Lewis said. “Springfest is a time to take a break, get a nice breath of fresh air and just have fun.”

Roseanne Barr is partly blaming Ambien for the tweet that led to their show's cancellation, but the maker of the insomnia drug quickly retorted that "racism is not a known side effect."
Photo: American Broadcasting Companies
Hours after ABC axed their show for their offensive tweet about former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett — and quickly breaking a promise to stay off Twitter — the comedian was back on the social media platform.
They urged people not to defend them and said of their Jarrett tweet that they were "ambien tweeting" at 2 a.m.
That led to the response on Twitter by the drugmaker Sanofi.
In the time it took to compose a 53-character tweet, Roseanne Barr went from a hero that ABC was banking upon to unemployed.
The network canceled its hit reboot of "Roseanne" Tuesday after Barr's racist tweet that referred to Valerie Jarrett, an adviser to former President Barack Obama, as a cross between the Muslim Brotherhood and the "Planet of the Apes." Them agent dropped her, and other services pulled "Roseanne" reruns.
The swift developments rendered President Donald Trump at least temporarily mum.
Trump, who reveled in the success of "Roseanne" after Barr's character in the show came out as a supporter of their presidency, made no mention of the firing in a campaign-style rally in Tennessee on Tuesday evening.
"We have a lot bigger things going on in the country right now, certainly, that the president is spending their time on," said White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
Jarrett, a black woman who said they were "fine" after the slur, urged in an MSNBC special Tuesday about racism that the incident become a teaching moment. They said that Robert Iger, chief executive of ABC parent Walt Disney Co., called to apologize and told them before it became public that the show was being canceled.
"Tone does start at the top, and we like to look up to our president and feel as though they reflect the values of our country," Jarrett said. "But I also think that every individual citizen has a responsibility too, and it's up to all of us to push back. Our government is only going to be as good as we make it be."
Barr showed no signs of abandoning Twitter, engaging in a series of tweets late Tuesday that apologized to those who lost their jobs because of the "Roseanne" cancellation, expressing remorse they were being branded a racist, and also retweeting posts that attacked ABC and a meme that included Jarrett.
The supporters' tweets included posts that criticized ABC, "The View" co-host Joy Behar and ESPN's Keith Olbermann. They later asked supporters not to defend them
"I did something unforgiveable so do not defend me," Barr wrote. "It was 2 in the morning and I was ambien tweeting-it was memorial day too-i went 2 far & do not want it defended-it was egregious Indefensible. I made a mistake I wish I hadn't but...don't defend it please."
Barr was resoundingly condemned Tuesday, including from many who helped make their show successful.
The executive producer of "Roseanne," which came back this spring after being gone for two decades and instantly became television's second most popular comedy, said they supported ABC's decision.
"Our goal was to promote constructive discussion about the issues that divide us," said Tom Werner. "It represented the work of hundreds of talented people. I hope the good work done is not totally eclipsed by those abhorrent and offensive comments, and that Roseanne seeks the help they so clearly needs."
ABC canceled the show in a one-sentence statement from Channing Dungey, the network's entertainment president, who called it "abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values."
ABC and Disney had taken notable steps to be more inclusive in its entertainment, and Dungey is the first black to be entertainment president of a major broadcast network. But much of its progress would have been threatened if it looked the other way at Barr's tweet.
They have a history of diving into political conspiracy theories on Twitter, and that's how they ended their Memorial Day weekend. They criticized Democratic financier George Soros and tweeted that Chelsea Clinton was "Chelsea Soros Clinton," implying they were married to a nephew of Soros. Clinton themselves corrected Barr online. Donald Trump Jr. retweeted two of Barr's statements about Soros, although not the remark about Jarrett.
Jarrett's name came up in response to Twitter commentary that raised their name in relation to an Obama conspiracy theory. Barr tweeted: "muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj."
Three weeks earlier, "Roseanne" was the toast of ABC's annual presentation of its programming plans to advertisers. Dungey's boss, network chief Ben Sherwood, even joked then: "If anyone came to play a drinking game based on how many times we mention 'Roseanne,' you're welcome."
"Roseanne" earned an estimated $45 million in advertising revenue for ABC through its nine episodes that started airing in March, according to Kantar Media. The firm estimates that the 13 episodes that had been ordered for next season would have brought in as much as $60 million, with more through repeat episodes.
One of the few network shows about a working-class family, "Roseanne" attracted 25 million viewers to its first show back in March. Many conservative commentators — and the president themselves — attributed at least some of that success to the lead character's backing of Trump.
The cancellation has no clear precedent in television history, said David Bianculli, professor at Rowan University in New Jersey. The closest analogy is CBS pulling the plug on the Smothers Brothers variety show due to their anti-war views in the late 1960s and the same network not renewing "Lou Grant" at its peak, which star Ed Asner always contended was due to their outspoken political beliefs.
But "Roseanne" was different, they said.
"It's like taking off 'All in the Family' or 'I Love Lucy' or Andy Griffith at their zenith," they said.
There was also CBS' firing of Charlie Sheen from "Two and a Half Men" during their bizarre spate of behavior. Sheen, for one, saw an opportunity in Tuesday's events.
"Good riddance," they tweeted about the "Roseanne" cancellation. "Hashtag NOT Winning. The runway is now clear for OUR reboot."

ALTON — Carrie Carpunky Photography has had a few new homes since moving out of its home studio in the family basement five years ago.
In fact, its first home away from the family home was Milton Schoolhouse in Alton. As of Dec. 1, it has moved out of the classroom and onto Broadway, where it now roosts at 10 E. Broadway.
Located near long-established neighbor Second Reading Book Shop, Carrie Carpunky Photography moved three times within Milton Schoolhouse before outgrowing its final space. Celebrating its new spot on Broadway with a grand opening on Jan. 27, owner Carrie Carpunky shared how it came to be that their studio became the next star along Alton's Broadway corridor.
“My husband and I disagree a bit on who actually saw this space first,” Carpunky said. “But I always had kind of a dream of being down here on Broadway. I loved to shoot down here.”
Locals may recall that The Grapevine formerly occupied the Broadway space.
“When we first talked to the couple that owns it about renting the space, we determined that it was out of our price range,” Carpunky said. “After a couple of months went by, the owners contacted us back. They hadn't found anyone else for the space, and asked if I was still interested. To which I responded, ‘Umm, yeah!'”
Now entering their eighth year in business, Carpunky offers both in-studio and on-location photo sessions.
“I like to stay close to home, though — around the Alton, Godfrey and Edwardsville-Glen Carbon area,” they said. “I will go as far north as Elsah or Pere Marquette, given the settings there, but essentially like to stay within a 25-mile radius of home. I'm a homebody.”
Self-described as a photographer who used to shoot “almost everything,” Carpunky has come into full focus on the types of shoots they do now. They have zoomed in on capturing special subjects, including newborns, families, and expecting mothers.
“I love newborns. And I love families,” they said. “That is what I really love to do; I am doing photography now in the genre I really love.”
Carpunky also does maternity shoots.
They said the natural and architectural beauty of their new location excites both them and their customers.
“Last year I started getting quite a few requests from people who were wanting to get away from the park setting; they wanted more urban,” they said. “As you can see if you look around, I am just footsteps away from some fabulous urban spots.
“The Laura Lofts stoop is one of my favorite places to shoot,” they said. And on the other side of another nearby structure, “There's this wall in the parking lot. It's brick and limestone, and the wall is kind of cracked. It has some rebar showing. It also has a crazy, cool vine growing on it, which looks different every season. Right now, it should be bare, but it has some golden-brown leaves and some berries on it — it's so fabulous.”
Photography sessions are by appointment only. They said the best way to reserve a time is to send an email to info@carriecarpunky.com or call (618) 433-9222. To keep up with the latest happenings in and out of the studio, follow their Facebook page, @carriecarpunkyphotography.

With both spillways badly damaged and a new storm approaching, America's tallest dam on Tuesday became the site of a desperate operation to fortify the massive structures before they face another major test.
A swarm of trucks and helicopters dumped 1,200 tons of material per hour onto the eroded hillside that formed the dam's emergency spillway. One quarry worked around the clock to mine boulders as heavy as 6 tons. An army of workers mixed concrete slurry to help seal the rocks in place.
“This is an aggressive, proactive attack to address the erosion,” said Bill Croyle, acting director of the state Department of Water Resources. “There's a lot of people, a lot of equipment, a lot of materials moving around, from the ground and from the air.”
At the main spillway, a different and riskier operation was underway: Despite a large hole in the concrete chute, officials have been sending a massive amount of the swollen reservoir's water down the chute to the Feather River in a desperate attempt to reduce the lake's level.
The structure continued to hold Tuesday without sustaining more significant damage, officials said.
The idea is to get the reservoir's water level low enough that it can take in rain from an upcoming series of storms without reaching capacity. If the reservoir filled up again, water would automatically flow down the emergency spillway, which on Sunday appeared to be nearing collapse, forcing the evacuation of more than 100,000 people downstream.
Crews releasing 100,000 cubic feet of water per second through the main spillway lowered the lake's level by about one foot per hour without causing more damage to the main spillway, engineers said. Meanwhile, hundreds of construction workers used thousands of tons of concrete and rock to shore up the erosion that had carved fissures into the unpaved slope next to the dam.
The reservoir's water line is expected to fall 50 feet by late Saturday or early Sunday, providing a buffer capacity of half a million acre-feet, officials said. That would avert the risk of using the eroded hillside as an emergency spillway again, officials believe.
In a sign of the progress made Tuesday, officials downgraded the evacuation order to a warning, allowing all evacuated residents to return home.
“They have to be vigilant,” Butte County Sheriff Kory L. Honea said at a news conference. “They have to pay attention to what's going on. There's the prospect that we can issue another evacuation order if circumstances change.”
Workers concentrated their efforts on shoring up the hillside just below the emergency spillway's weir, a low concrete wall that is designed to be the last defense for Lake Oroville.
The weir is designed to hold the reservoir to its maximum height. If the reservoir overflows again after days of rain this week, and water pours down the hillside, the earth beneath the weir could be chewed away. That could send a 30-foot wall of water down the Feather River and into neighboring towns.
With airlifted bags of boulders and layers of concrete, crews have been filling fissures that eroded during emergency efforts to release water from behind the dam.
“The large rocks will break up the flow of water a bit so it won't have so much energy,” said John France, an engineering consultant at Aecom who has worked on dams for more than three decades. “If the water has less energy, the underlying structure won't erode as quickly.”
It's a repetitive but essential process.
"You're putting rocks in a hole. Then you're putting slurry in to solidify it,” said Water Resources spokesperson Chris Orrock. “When water comes down, it will hit that patch and roll off.”
Meanwhile, state engineers are watching the damage to the main concrete spillway using cameras and overhead flights. The current release of water creates a curtain that obscures most of the gaping hole discovered last week, but what is visible from the side suggests the damaged area has not grown, Croyle said.
"It's performing very well," they said, adding that the amount of water released from the dam during the crisis is a state record. Archived data from the state agency shows water releases exceeding 150,000 cubic feet per second in 1997, leading to the failure of a levee on the Feather River downstream and evacuation of communities for 22 days.
The soccer fields and picnic grounds at Marysville's riverfront park were submerged long ago. At the town's cemetery, 26 miles south of the dam, family plots were almost completely submerged, with the tips of tombstones poking through the still water.
Spring flooding is common in the low-lying basin, Sutter County spokesperson Chuck Smith said. The Feather River can handle up to 280,000 cubic feet per second of water flow, they said, but that would bring the water level to the top of the river's steep banks.
"At 200,000 [cubic] feet [per second] is where we would start to panic,” Smith said. Water Resources is currently releasing half that volume from the dam.
Sutter County's emergency planning scenarios include a collapse of the Oroville dam. Those documents estimate it would take a little more than eight hours for the first wave of high water to reach Marysville, leaving county officials a two-hour window to order evacuations.
But other communities, notably Oroville, are much closer to the dam and would be hit much more quickly.
During the mandatory evacuation period in Sutter and adjacent Yuba counties, residents who had defied the order could be seen in Marysville and Yuba City.
Kathy Sedlar, 60, said they and their husband were unaware of Sunday's order to leave until the highway out of town was already frozen in gridlock.
They feared becoming trapped in the traffic if the dam spillway did fail, "So I guess I'll stay," they said. But they did not sleep. They and their husband spent the night monitoring live broadcasts from the drama in Oroville.
Honea, the Butte County sheriff, said they would leave it to residents to decide whether to leave if rising water levels again force use of the emergency spillway. They said they would order another evacuation only if something were to suggest the repaired slope was again deteriorating.
The new storm system is expected to arrive late Wednesday or early Thursday morning and could bring two to four inches of rainfall to Lake Oroville.
Falling temperatures are expected to help officials by lowering the elevation at which some precipitation falls as snow. But Croyle said that merely delays when the dam will be required to handle the melt from what has been a spectacular snow year.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair cabin crew are to hold coordinated strikes in four European countries, a union official said on Wednesday, escalating industrial action at Europe's largest low-cost carrier which dismissed their demands as "pointless."
Cabin crew in Spain, Portugal, Italy and Belgium are planning strikes and will announce dates for the action on Thursday once authorities in Italy give their approval, Antonio Escobar, an official with Spanish union SITCPLA said.
They added that other countries may join the action.
The cabin crew are joining Irish Ryanair pilots who on Tuesday announced a strike for July 12, saying Europe's largest low-cost carrier had failed to improve conditions sufficiently after recognising unions in December.
Ryanair, which flies in 37 countries and carried 130 million passengers last year, averted widespread strikes before Christmas by deciding to recognise trade unions for the first time in its 32-year history. But it has since struggled to reach agreement on terms with several of them.
Cabin crew from across Europe published a list of 34 demands on Wednesday, including "a fair living wage", improved sick pay and employment contracts in their own language based on local rather than Irish law.
The list of demands was drawn up by crew representing 80 percent of Ryanair's 86 bases, the International Transport Workers Federation, which organised the event, said in a statement.
Cabin crew said at a media briefing they were forced to physically report to work when sick to provide written details of symptoms and struggled to claim sick pay as their terms and conditions often straddled the law of Ireland and their home country.
The cabin crew, who spoke on condition of anonymity saying they feared reprisals if they went public, said staff from several EU countries were forced to travel to Ireland to open bank accounts in order to receive pay.
A Ryanair spokesperson disputed some of the claims and described the demands as "pointless" considering the attractiveness of the overall package offered to staff.
They said cabin crew received sick pay and a 400-euro annual uniform allowance and could earn up to 40,000 euros per year. Crew had attractive working hours and could not legally fly for more than an average of 18 hours per week, they said.
"Ryanair is already engaged in extensive negotiations with national cabin crew unions across Europe during which all of these, and other issues, are being negotiated and we have already concluded agreements in the UK and Italy,” the spokesperson said.
Italian union Ultrasporti has said the agreement Ryanair secured in Italy is with a union that does not represent the majority of Ryanair cabin crew in the region.
Portuguese union SNPVAC, Spain's SITCPLA and USO, Italy's Ultrasporti and Belgium's CNE/LBC in April released a joint threat to strike if their demands were not met by June 30.

WASHINGTON, Aug 14 (APP): A large number of Pakistani Americans
visited the Pakistan Embassy in Washington to celebrate 70 years of freedom with a pledge to contribute towards development and progress of their motherland.
The embassy opened its gates for an “Open House” to mark the day as
part of festivities that will continue during the coming months. Pakistani Americans from Washington and the neighboring states of Virginia and Maryland came in large number to together celebrate the Independence Day.
Speaking on the occasion, Ambassador Aizaz Chaudhry paid rich tribute to
Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Founder of Pakistan as due to their relentless efforts, Muslims of the Subcontinent were able to secure a separate homeland for themselves.
The ambassador also admired the great Muslim philosopher and poet Allama
Muhammad Iqbal who first presented the idea for a separate homeland for the Muslims of the Subcontinent. Commenting on the tremendous sacrifices rendered by the Muslims of the Subcontinent, Ambassador Chaudhry stated that Pakistan was a home to 200 million people who were blessed with great potential and were firmly committed to the progress and well-being of their country.
They urged Pakistani Americans to contribute towards development and
progress of the entire nation. The Ambassador underscored that Pakistan despite making a modest start in the beginning after gaining independence, had made tremendous strides in all domains over last 70 years.
“Pakistan with a passage of time has attained a prominent position in
the comity of nations. At present, Pakistan is an atomic power having tremendous resources including a dynamic and intelligent youth,” they added.
Ambassador Chaudhry said in recent years, Pakistan had successfully
reversed the tide of terrorism whereas other countries in the world were still grappling with the scourge of terrorism. “Recently, Pakistan has witnessed a tremendous economic turnaround and all fundamental economic indicators are projecting upwards which is a great achievement,” they added.
While commenting on Pak-US relations, Ambassador Chaudhry said that
Pakistan and the US would be celebrating 70th anniversary of friendship this year. “Pakistan attaches great value to its relations with the United States spanning over seven decades and we are committed to further strengthen these bilateral relations.”
They urged the Pakistani Americans to act like a bridge between country of
their origin and the country of their residence. They further added that Pakistani Americans should actively participate in the mainstream politics and play a constructive role in the peace and prosperity of the US.
The Ambassador emphasized that the second generation Pakistani Americans
must stay connected with their motherland while actively participating in all facets of American polity including political and socio-economic sectors.
On the occasion, national songs were played by young Pakistani singers
which enthralled the distinguished guests particularly the younger generation. A Group of Pakistani performers presented regional and folk dances. A mesmerizing Tabla performance was given by Nabeel Riaz.
A Cultural Unity Show on the theme of “Rhythm of Unity” was also
arranged to pay tribute to the rich cultural heritage of Pakistan. The traditional Pakistani stalls were also setup which attracted many Pakistani American visitors. Young children in traditional dresses of various parts of the country were one of the major attractions of the event.
Towards the end, Ambassador Chaudhry remarked that we should celebrate
our successes on the 70th independence anniversary and learn from our mistakes in order to march forward as a great nation. Ambassador prayed that Pakistan may make progress by leaps and bounds.
FILE PHOTO: A China yuan note is seen in this illustration photo May 31, 2017. To match Analysis CHINA-YUAN/
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China has given those who bet against the yuan a bloody nose this year thanks to policy moves and intervention by the authorities. And yet, many traders and investors are still tipping the Chinese currency to decline against the U.S. dollar in the next year.
They argue that after a Communist Party leadership meeting in the fall, which is expected to solidify President Xi Jinping's grip on power, there will be room for the yuan to weaken. The Chinese government is determined to keep the financial system and the wider economy stable ahead of the gathering, which is held once every five years.
Even after three consecutive months of strengthening against the U.S. dollar, the first such positive run since 2014, many market participants are unconvinced by the gains.
David Qu, markets economist at ANZ Bank in Shanghai, said they don't believe that even with its recent strength the yuan's broad downward trend of recent years has been fundamentally reversed. "I don't think the renminbi is back on an appreciation path," they said, using the other name for the currency.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC), the nation's central bank, did not provide answers to faxed questions about the yuan's trajectory.
A Reuters poll of foreign exchange analysts published on August 3 found the yuan is forecast to weaken to 6.85 per dollar in six months and to 6.9 per dollar in a year. It settled at 6.6715 per dollar at the late night close on Monday.
The yuan slumped around 6.5 percent against the surging dollar last year, its largest decline since China unified official and market exchange rates in 1994. The global dollar index .DXY, which measures the dollar against a basket of major currencies, rose 3.6 percent in 2016.
This year, the yuan has gained around 4 percent as the greenback has slumped, but analysts say it should be up even more given that the dollar is down about 9 percent against other major currencies.
Companies wary of foreign exchange risks are keeping the yuan's gains in check.
"Half of our corporate clients who are purchasing dollars at current levels are still betting on a decline in the yuan in the belief that the rebound in the yuan has been a result of the weakness in the dollar and central bank intervention," said a forex trader at a regional bank in Shanghai.
Against other currencies, the yuan's value on a trade-weighted basis has actually fallen more than 1 percent this year, indicating it is actually weaker than the dollar exchange rate suggests.
GOOD VIBES
Tighter controls on capital outflows have been a big reason for yuan strength this year, along with dollar weakness and signs that the Chinese economy is improving, said Wang Tao, chief economist at UBS in Hong Kong.
"Some fundamental drivers of capital outflows remain - there is still strong demand among households and corporates to diversify their wealth into FX and overseas assets, while concerns about domestic asset bubbles and high leverage also remain high," Wang said.
Much of the money changed into dollars in China will actually stay in Chinese bank accounts, rather than circumventing capital export controls, but it sill serves as a hedge, experts say.
Another sign that the market still wants dollars: the daily local closing price has been persistently weaker than the same day's benchmark fixing set by the PBOC prior to the market opening.
This has been the case even after the May introduction of a mysterious "counter-cyclical factor" into the official midpoint formula, with this X factor designed to reduce price swings and stabilise market expectations. In 44 out of 53 trading sessions between June 1 and August 14, the yuan was weaker than the midpoint at the 4:30 p.m. close.
Shan Kun, head of local-markets strategy at BNP Paribas in Shanghai, said impetus for the yuan to retreat could grow.
"We have concerns that company and financial institutions could decide that the yuan has become too strong in a short period of time and resume expansion of their holdings of dollar-denominated assets, and increase their enthusiasm for dollar buying," Shan said.
Foreign currency deposits held by households and companies have been rising steadily this year. The volume stood at $793.1 billion at the end of June, up 20.9 percent from a year earlier, official data from the central bank showed.
Derivatives and other gauges also suggest weakness ahead.
One-year dollar/yuan non-deliverable forwards CNY1YNDFOR=, considered the best available proxy for forward-looking market expectations for the yuan's value, on Monday showed that the yuan was expected to weaken to 6.8205 per dollar, a drop of more than 2 percent from the day's midpoint.
One-year risk reversals for the dollar against the yuan onshore CNY1YRR=, a gauge that measures the premium paid for calls over puts, have shown an upward trend since late July to a nearly two-month high at one point on Monday. That indicates that bullish call options remained more expensive than bearish put options, underscoring how the market is positioning for further yuan depreciation.
"The Chinese yuan would be still vulnerable to any upward correction in the U.S. dollar. If there is a potential rebound in the dollar, the impact on the yuan would be relatively huge," said Ken Cheung, senior Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong.

The epidemiology of gastric cancer is changing in the United States, say researchers. Incidence rates of noncardia gastric cancer are rising among individuals younger than 50 years, although it's falling in older patients. Women will soon be more at risk than men.
The findings were published online January 19 in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.
The data show “a new pattern in gastric cancer epidemiology,” Martin Blaser, MD, and Yu Chen, MD, New York University School of Medicine in New York City, write in an accompanying editorial.
“This pattern appears to identify a new form of noncardia stomach cancer,” they add.
The rising incidence of noncardia gastric cancers in individuals younger than 50 that is reported in the current study — together with the fact that the largest increase in noncardia gastric cancer involves tumors in the gastric corpus and that women are more at risk of developing corpus cancer than men — suggests that a new type of gastric cancer is taking hold in the United States, defined by the editorialists as “CYF” cancers — corpus-dominant, young age–dominant, female-dominant gastric cancers.
“Gastric cancer has always been more common in men, but these data in women predict an unprecedented reversal,” Dr Blaser and Dr Chen write.
Driven by Infection or Autoimmunity?
“The initial step for noncardia gastric carcinogenesis is atrophic gastritis, driven by either Helicobacter pylori infection or autoimmunity,” note the study authors, led by William Anderson, MD, MPH, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.
However, in recent years, the prevalence of H pylori has declined significantly, not only in the United States but also globally, they note. At the same time, the prevalence of autoimmunity has increased as Western lifestyles change.
These two trends prompted investigators to see whether there has been a shift in the incidence of gastric cancer as well as in the type of gastric cancer manifested in the US population across almost 2 decades.
To track the incidence of gastric cancer, they mined data from 1995 to 2013 in the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database and in 45 North American Association of Central Cancer Tumor Registries (NAACCR).
These data represent about 80% of the US population.
“There were 137,447 noncardia cancers in 4.4 billion person-years of observation,” the investigators report.
The majority of the adenocarcinomas recorded in the NAACCR database were found in non-Hispanic whites; people aged 50 years or older at the time of diagnosis; and in counties were rates of poverty were less than 20%, they add.
However, incidence rates varied considerably, depending on ethnicity.
For example, age-standardized rates (ASRs) of noncardia gastric cancer were 2.2 per 100,000 person-years among non-Hispanic whites; 6.2 per 100,000 person-years for non-Hispanic blacks; and 7.7 per 100,000 person-year for non-Hispanic others, primarily Asians.
The sites involved in these cancers — and their incidence rates over the years — also varied considerably, depending on sex and age.
Confining their analysis to non-Hispanic whites — the only race in which significant changes in the epidemiology of noncardia cancer were seen — “12.8% of noncardia cancers were localized to the gastric fundus, 19.8% to the corpus, 35.0% to the antrum, and 5.5% to the pylorus,” the study authors report.
Regarding the estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) in the incidence of these cancers, the researchers found that overall, the incidence for noncardia cancer dropped by 3% per year (95% confidence interval [CI] = -3.3% to -2.7%) between 1995 and 2013.

Kyle Larson wins the Pure Michigan 400 to make it three Michigan wins in a row | Sourcet: Brian Lawdermilk - Getty Images
It was the third straight win at the track for the driver of the Chip Ganassi #42 Target Chevrolet, and a one that looked unlikely with the two overtime laps being the only laps in the race that they led. Kyle Larson, who told NBC after the race that this win “feels better than any of my other Cup wins or Xfinity wins”, sits second in the points standings, and more crucially, has the second most play off points (18) behind the leader of both categories, Truex Jr.
Speaking in Victory Lane, they said: “I didn't think I had a shot to win it at all. My car was really loose in traffic and average in clean air, but we were able to get it done.”
On that final restart, Larson slid between the two Toyotas, taking them three wide, and ran right up next to Truex Jr to side draft them into the first corner. The move proved to be decisive, and they stretched away enough to start celebrating on the backstretch of the final lap.
The race had been billed as a Toyota and Ford Shoot-out
All the talk pre-race had been about the power battle between the Toyotas and the Fords, and in the early stages of the race, it looked as though that was exactly how it was panning out, with pole-sitter Brad Keselowski dominating the first segment in their Penske Miller Lite Ford which saw them take the stage win by over half a second from Kevin Harvick.

The second segment reverted to what has been the norm recently with Truex Jr winning it at a canter by over a second from Harvick who finished the stage as runner-up again. There were no Chevrolets in the top six at the end of that stage, and Larson had struggled to make their way up to eighth but had shown none of their dominance in previous Michigan races.
The race had few cautions with the only yellows during the first two segments being the stage-ending ones.
The first unscheduled yellow was a huge incident between Kasey Kahne and Daniel Suarez – the latter caught mid-pack due to contrary pit strategy that would have put them in with a chance of a top five, or even a win, in the later stages Kahne drove underneath Saurez in turn two, but seemingly misjudged their pass and – believing they had cleared the #19 Arris Toyota – clipped their front wing, lifting the back end of their #5 Chevy in the air, and putting the talented Rookie Of The Year contender into the wall.
Both drivers walked away, but it was a bitter pill for the Mexican Joe Gibbs Racing driver to swallow, who – unlike Kahne – needs a win to force their way into the play offs.
From the resulting restart, Truex, Jr. and Jones raced away and the win looked certain to be between the two teammates.
Kyle Busch tried alternative strategy to try and force a win
Following green flag pit-stops, the running order shuffled a little, with Kyle Busch having pitted later than the rest of the field earlier in the race and was able to stay out hoping for a caution. Busch's prayers appeared to have been answered, with a caution being thrown with 13 to go when debris from a cut tire on Joey Logano's #22 Ford found its way onto the race track. Any serious hopes that Busch had of winning were dashed when the leaders opted to stay out, with the #18 hoping that they would have all come in for fresh rubber.
Eventual winner Larson did pit along with Busch, however, which actually saw them restarting in the eighth spot, directly behind Busch's Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota who was in sixth. The front row was again an all Furniture Row affair, and a win for anyone but either of those two looked extremely unlikely. With the two Toyotas speeding into the distance, Larson found some speed that had been lacking and started making up some spots.
Fate intervened on the Toyota parade with a twist in the tale.
Michael McDowell and Paul Menard tagged each other with three laps remaining to bring out the fifth and final caution of the day.
Truex and Jones were still one and two, with Larson having made their way to fourth.

Truex chose the outside for the restart, meaning Larson was right behind him. When the green flag waved, Larson got a great start pushing Truex and then darting out between them and their Toyota teammate.
The move had been endorsed over the team radio by owner Chip Ganassi prior to the restart, and it turned out to be the right one.
It was an exciting finish to a race that, in truth, seemed to otherwise lack many incidents.
The drivers move on to one of the highlights of the season next weekend – the Bass Pro Shops NRA Night Race at Bristol – and there is sure to be some sparks flying and tempers flaring on the Tennessee short track.

The Supreme Court on Thursday sought the central government's response on a petition challenging notification banning the sale of cattle in open markets for slaughtering.
While issuing notice, the vacation bench of Justice R.K. Agrawal and Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul gave the central government two weeks' time to respond to the petition by a Hyderabad-based advocate.
The court directed the listing of the matter on 11 July.
Additional Solicitor General P S Narasimha, appearing for the Centre, told the bench that intention behind bringing the notification was to have a regulatory regime on cattle trade across the country. They also told the apex court that the Madras High Court has recently granted interim stay on the notification.
The Centre had on 26 May banned the sale and purchase of cattle from animal markets for slaughter through an
Environment Ministry notification -- 'Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Regulation of Livestock Markets) Rules, 2017' under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.
Petitioner Mohammed Abdul Faheem Qureshi, who moved the top court on 7 June, challenged the rules, which provides for the seizures, recovery of the cost of transportation, maintenance and treatment of seized animals.
The vacation bench of Justice Ashok Bhushan and Justice Deepak Gupta had on 7 June directed the listing of the matter for Thursday (today) after counsel Sanobar Ali Qureshi, appearing for the Hyderabad-based petitioner had mentioned the matter urging for an early hearing.
Faheem Qureshi, themselves a lawyer, has contended that the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Regulation of Livestock Markets) Rules, 2017 and the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Animals (Care and Maintenance of Case Property Animals) Rules, 2017, which bans sale of cattle for slaughter and other rules that restrict cattle trade are arbitrary, illegal, and unconstitutional.
The petitioner contended that the rules violated their constitutional rights to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, protection of life and personal liberty, freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion and protection of interests of minorities.
The petitioner has challenged different stipulations of two notifications that came on 23 May.
They have contended that the rule that the purchaser "shall not sacrifice the animal for any religious purpose" was contrary to the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, whose Section 28 says it is not an offence to "kill any animal in a manner required by the religion of any community".
Faheem Qureshi, who also heads the India Jamiatul Quresh Action Committee, has also questioned the stipulation that prohibits bringing young cattle to the animal market, unless the purchaser furnishes an undertaking saying they are an agriculturist, that the animal would be used for agricultural purposes, and not resold for six months.
Qureshi has also objected to the provision of the notification requiring the owner to submit a bond to pay for the transportation, maintenance and treatment of the cattle.

The meet scheduled for April 27-29 is a mandatory qualifier for the level 3-5 provincial championships. The Ontario Gymnastics Association organizes provincial championships depending on age and talent levels with one being the lowest. The event is also an invitational meet for up-and-coming gymnasts.
“It's a huge event,” says Shelley Lee, the head coach at the Trillium Gymnastics Club.
“We're expecting hundreds of talented athletes from across the province and we have a great group of parents who support their children and the gym club,” continued Lee. “In order for this type of competition to be successful, we rely on our volunteer parents and every year, they come through for us.”
One of the local athletes expected to do well at the invitational meet is 11-year-old Lola Kenney. They won the level-6 provincial championship on April 9, in Windsor.
“I did very well on the bars, beam and floor and my mom said if I win, I could get a phone,” said the Grade 6 student from Storrington Public School. “She kept their word and ordered it for me.”
The Trillium club is a not-for-profit, volunteer-operated gymnastics club on Fortune Crescent in Kingston.
They offer recreational and children's programs as well as those for competitive and non-competitive athletes.

Coach Lee says this weekend is focused on their competitive gymnasts.
“There's a tremendous amount of work ethic involved in being a competitive athlete,” added the club's longtime coach.
“It's a real balancing act between school, friends and training, but a competitive athlete learns some valuable life skills that will carry on with them when their gymnastic days are over.”

DETROIT, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Automakers posted mixed U.S. new vehicle sales data for January, with American consumers showing little sign they will stop abandoning passenger cars for the larger pickup trucks, SUVs and crossover models that manufacturers also love because they are far more profitable.
Total industry auto sales for the month rose 1 percent versus January 2017. According to Autodata Corp, which tracks industry sales, the seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) of U.S. car and light truck sales in January fell to 17.12 million units from 17.44 million a year earlier.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a January SAAR of 17.2 million units.
U.S. auto industry sales fell 2 percent in 2017 to 17.23 million vehicles after hitting a record high in 2016 and are expected to drop further in 2018 despite a solid economy. Interest rates are rising and around 4 million late-model used cars will return to dealer lots this year to compete with more expensive new ones.
Automakers have used consumer discounts to boost sales, a growing concern for observers who say this undermines resale values and profits. Discounts declined in January, but remained above 10 percent of manufacturers' recommended prices.
”“I think the industry has accepted that (sales) volumes will fall somewhat in 2018, ... and I don't think the industry is going to go over the cliff with insane incentives,” Mike Jackson, chief executive officer of AutoNation Inc, told Reuters after their company, the largest U.S. auto retail chain, posted a higher quarterly net profit.
Mark Wakefield, head of the North American automotive practice for consultancy AlixPartners, had a gloomier perspective. The industry's less-than-stellar sales performance for January showed “we are now past the peak,” they said.
“Automakers are now selling the deal instead of the vehicle,” they said. “That's a tough spot to be in because that treadmill is hard to get off once you're on it.”
General Motors Co said January sales rose 1.3 percent, driven by a 16 percent rise in fleet sales. Sales to consumers fell 2.4 percent. GM posted strong gains for models such as the Silverado pickup truck and Equinox crossover model, while its passenger cars continued to struggle.
Ford Motor Co posted a 6.6 percent sales decline for January, with retail sales down 4.3 percent.
Sales of Ford's F-Series pickup trucks - America's best-selling vehicle brand for decades - rose 1.6 percent. Passenger cars were down more than 23 percent.
Passenger cars ”continues to be a difficult segment as we see a continued shift into SUVs,“ Ford's U.S. sales chief, Mark LaNeve, said on a conference call. ”We anticipate continued migration” from cars to SUVs over the next five years, they added.
Ford has garnered negative headlines as it works to improve results and rejig its product lineup.
Toyota Motor Corp's sales rose 16.8 percent in January. It noted strong demand for its pickup trucks and SUVs, plus its revamped Camry passenger car, whose sales rose more than 21 percent. Toyota has bet on boosting its share of the shrinking passenger car market with the all-new sedan.
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said new vehicle sales fell 13 percent in January, driven by a 50 percent drop in fleet sales, in line with the automaker's strategy to reduce these lower-margin sales to rental agencies, businesses and government bodies.
Fiat Chrysler sales to consumers rose 2 percent to their second-highest level since 2001.
Nissan Motor Co Ltd said its sales rose 10 percent in January, with pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers up 18 percent. Sales of the luxury Infiniti brand, however, fell 8 percent, driven by a decline in fleet sales.
Judy Wheeler, head of U.S. sales for the Nissan brand, said the recent U.S. tax overhaul should be a positive for sales in 2018.
“I think customers will have more disposable income ... and we'll see them come in to get into a new vehicle,” they said.
Honda Motor Co Ltd said its sales fell 1.7 percent in January, with both car and truck sales down.
GM shares closed slightly higher at $42.43, while Ford ended down 0.5 percent at $10.92, and Fiat Chrysler closed down 0.6 percent at $24.02. (Additional reporting by Paul Lienert; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Leslie Adler)
The Federal Government recently released their 2017 Budget and CASA, the Canadian Alliance of Students' Associations released their thoughts on the budget and what it means for post-secondary students in Canada. CASA praised the budget, saying that it fulfills promises that Trudeau made for students during the election and that the government is branching out to First Nations students and non-traditional learners such as mature students.
As a member of both CASA and StudnetsNS, SMUSA also supports this budget. President of StudentsNS and SMUSA VP of Equity and Wellness, Collette Robert says “This year's federal budget includes many important investments for students in Nova Scotia including more funding for the Youth Employment Strategy, closing the funding gap for the Post-Secondary Student Support Program that supports indigenous students, and more financial assistance for part-time and mature learners.
In general, the budget also recognized investments in research and innovation, a National Strategy to Address Gender Based Violence, and paid work-integrated learning opportunities.” Th e budget will be gone through line by line over the next months to determine if it will pass or not, which it likely will as Trudeau has a majority government.

After 70 years of division and Independence, there is one thing that is strikingly common to both India and Pakistan. Both the countries are implementing massive bio-metric surveillance projects implemented by their former masters known as Aadhaar in India and Nadra in Pakistan.
After 70 years of division and Independence, there is one thing that is strikingly common to both India and Pakistan. Both the countries are implementing massive bio-metric surveillance projects implemented by their former masters known as Aadhaar in India and Nadra in Pakistan.
Is it just a coincidence that Tariq Malik of NADRA and Nandan Nilekani received awards at Milan ID World Congress for their similar work?
Is it not true that India's Aadhaar program – the world's largest biometric database – is a mirror copy of Pakistan's Nadra? Why did Nilekani simply followed the footpr​​ints of Malik in creating/enforcing this biometric ID in India?
“Electronics has become a fundamental political problem” said Dr Ernesto “Che” Guevara in 1962.
The Election Commission of India (ECI) has exposed the reluctance of Prime Minister's Office (PMO) to share its correspondence including the letter of resignation of Nandan Nilekani from the post of Chairman of Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) under the Planning Commission. Nilekani is reported to have submitted their resignation to the Prime Minister on 13 March 2014. What is in this letter that the PMO doesn't want its citizens to know?
It may recall even before Aadhaar was launched in India, the World Bank had launched its eTransform Initiative by signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with France and South Korea besides transnational companies like L-1 Identity Solutions, IBM, Gemalto, Pfizer and others. Is it not true that these same companies were later given contracts for implementation of Aadhaar and Nadra?
It was launched in the presence of Ministers of Finance and Communications from many developing countries. The World Bank is currently funding 14 projects related to e-government and e-ID around the world. This project are unfolding under the influence of international finance and not because there is a domestic need for it.
On this 70th Independence Day we urge all our readers and every concerned citizen of the Republic of India to ponder over these few questions:-
Is it a coincident that the task of Tariq Malik of NADRA, Pakistan and those of Nandan Nilekani, C Chandramouli and VS Sampath appear similar?
Is there a design behind persuading and compelling developing countries to biometrically profile their citizens?
Is it too early to infer that international bankers, UN agencies and western military alliances wish to create profiles in their biometric and electronic database for coercive use of social control measures?
Is it not true that uninformed citizens, parliamentarians and gullible government agencies are too eager to be profiled and tracked through an online database?
Would our freedom fighters have approved of such mass surveillance by any national or transnational agency? Were not our freedom fighters themselves under surveillance using these same techniques? Is it not true that the flawed fundamental basis for Aadhaar & Nadra was invented by British Intelligence in India to track our freedom fighters? Do we not know our own history?
In the US, the budget for intelligence gathering in 2013 was $52.6 billion. Out of which $10.8 billion went to the National Security Agency (NSA). It is about $167 per person. Do Indians know the budget allocation for their intelligence? Why have they been kept in dark about it? Aren't allocations for UIDAI, NPR and National Intelligence Grid (NATGRID) part of it?
Is it not clear that UN agencies, World Bank Group, transnational intelligence companies and military alliances are working in tandem to create the bio-electronic database of Indians as per their pre-determined design?
Is this design structured to safeguard the interest of present and future generations of Indians?
North Lincolnshire actor Sheridan Smith will be performing on Strictly Come Dancing this weekend.
The star will be singing My Man from the hit West End musical Funny Girl on the results show on Sunday night (October 8).
The 36-year-old was forced to pull out of Fanny Brice last year due to "stress and exhaustion".
Sheridan has signed a record deal to release a solo album later this year.
Them father Colin sadly passed away from cancer last December, aged 80.
The actor took a break from Funny Girl in May and returned home to Epworth.
Sheridan dedicated their Olivier Awards nomination to their dad's memory in July.
Emile Sande performed on the show last week and contestant Chizzy Akudolu became the first celebrate to leave Strictly.
The actor cried as they were sent packing following a dance-off with comedian Brian Conley.
Just three of its players — Alan Ruschel, Neto and Follmann — would make it out alive, and as they convalesced from serious injuries, the club's management determined that it would best serve the tight-knit community by moving forward and rebuilding the team in time for the 2017 season, a mere two months away.
The European Union, they estimated, has begun to lose its clout in international politics, as evidenced by speculation that Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are holding bilateral talks concerning the future of Europe and by the peace agreement that is reportedly being brokered in Syria by Russia and Turkey.
The European Union must do its utmost to remain an integral part of international efforts to tackle instability and resolve crises, President Sauli Niinistö stated in their New Year's Speech .
“The EU cannot be absent from the negotiation tables where decisions about the future are made,” they stressed.
The focus must now be turned to what is of great significance to all Europeans – to peace and security, said Niinistö. The European Union, they estimated, is currently needed more than it has been in decades, as its fundamental values of democracy, equality and human rights are being called into question also within its borders.
Niinistö acknowledged that the threat of terrorism, fear of war and forces of migration will continue to create uncertainty in Europe but underscored that the continent must remain united in the face of such challenges. The influx of asylum seekers in 2015, they reminded, resulted in some member states turning against each other and seeking the odd benefit at the expense of others. Such actions will only erode unity and ultimately also turn against the initial beneficiary, according to him.
“The EU is only as strong as its weakest link,” they stated.
The President also called attention to the position of Finland as part of the West. Finland, they said, has sought to promote well-being and build peace but may have neglected to ask how it should prepare against evil.
“Our constitution provides good protection for the fundamental rights of the individual. But now we are facing some very difficult questions: what should we do in a situation where we have to weigh collective safety against rights of the individual?” they asked. “Evil must of course be opposed with good. But we must set limits to evil. We also need to be strong and resolute.”
Niinistö expressed their delight with the growing willingness to develop defence co-operation within the European Union.
Terrorism, they pointed out, is a common enemy to everyone regardless of their country of residence. The key to combating such evil is the efficient gathering and sharing of information and the promotion of flexible co-operation between the authorities of different countries.
“Action is needed from the EU,” they said.
They also proposed two themes for the centenary year of independence in Finland: “One key message of a one-hundred-year-old Finland could well be: You will do well if no one is doing badly. So help as much as you can. Another message could be: Take reasonable responsibility, at least of yourself. That is, do what you are capable of,” viewed Niinistö.

Liverpool fans are ready to create another famous European night at Anfield when Roma arrive for their Champions League semi-final.
The tune of Sit Down by James, the tribute to Mo Salah, and the classic You'll Never Walk Alone will pierce the Merseyside air as the Kop end cheer on their heroes.
But there is one chant which has been the soundtrack of the Reds' stomp around the continent - the sounds of "Allez Allez Allez".
The song is likely to still be ringing in the ears of anyone who was at Anfield for the quarter-final first leg against Manchester City.
The words 'Allez, Allez, Allez' are splashed on the front cover of this evening's matchday programme - after the latest song became a hit with Kopites, reports the Liverpool Echo .

It's no coincidence that when your team are playing well, more songs get created and this season we have seen a few new tunes added to the Anfield songbook.
The new favourite on the Kop is the 'Allez Allez Allez' song that started at Porto back in February.
People might not be aware of where this song started, but it was by a group of young lads on the concourse before the Porto away leg.
It might have already been sang on coaches, but this was its first outing in an away end - and people stood around to try and learn the lyrics.

Immediately it had the feeling of a great Liverpool song, but people couldn't catch the words right away.
At 5-0 up in Porto, the same group tried to get it going. Not everyone knew the words but it gradually grew with people joining in with the Allez, Allez, Allez part.
And thanks to social media, the footage from the concourse before the game was shared by hundreds of people.
Most Liverpool fans had now heard it.
It really took off after a video appeared from a pub after the Newcastle United game in March.

Then during the Porto return leg at Anfield the song had its first airing on the Kop - and since then it has become the most popular song amongst Liverpool fans.
Despite defeat against Manchester United at Old Trafford, the fans sang it loudly during the lock-in after the game.
And the flag twirling against Manchester City won't be forgotten as all four sides of Anfield sang in unison.
At full-time of the second leg, when the players celebrated with the joyous travelling Kop, it was this song that they were singing.
In recent times, memorable European campaigns have had a song that is related to the run.
Back in 2005 it was Ring of Fire, 2007 was Oh Campione, 2016 was Three Little Birds and this year it is Allez Allez Allez.
It will echo around Anfield tonight.

The lyrics to Allez Allez Allez
"We've conquered all of Europe,
"We're never gonna stop,
"From Paris down to Turkey,
"We've won the f***ing lot,
"Bob Paisley and Bill Shankly,
"The fields of Anfield Road,
"We are loyal supporters,

Florida-Most asteroids and meteorites originate from the splintering of a handful of minor planets formed during the infancy of our solar system, a new study shows. A study appearing online today in Nature Astronomy found at least 85 percent of 200,000 asteroids in the inner asteroid belt-the main source of Earth's meteorites-originate from five or six ancient minor planets. The other 15 percent may also trace their origins to the same group of primordial bodies, said Stanley Dermott, lead author and a theoretical astronomer at the University of Florida. The discovery is important for understanding the materials that shaped our own rocky planet, Dermott said. The finding provides a more robust understanding of the evolutionary history of asteroids and the materials that form them-information Dermott says could prove essential to protecting the Earth and ourselves from meteorites the size of the Statue of Liberty and asteroids more powerful than atomic bombs.
“These large bodies whiz by the Earth, so of course we're very concerned about how many of these there are and what types of material are in them,” said Dermott, professor emeritus in UF's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. “If every one of these comes towards the earth, and we want to deflect it, we need to know what its nature is.”
Dermott's team demonstrated that the type of orbit an asteroid has depends on the size of the asteroid. This finding suggests that differences in meteorites found on Earth appear because of the evolutionary changes that occurred inside a few large, precursor bodies that existed more than four billion years ago, Dermott said.
“I wouldn't be surprised if we eventually trace the origins of all asteroids in the main asteroid belt, not just those in the inner belt, to a small number of known parent bodies,” Dermott said.
Building knowledge of the evolutionary history of bodies that formed our early solar system helps theoretical astronomers answer questions related to where planets like our own might exist in the universe, Dermott said. But, first, they said we have to understand the processes that produced the planet we live on.
Paris: Plastic surgeons raised red flags this week about a penis whitening fad in skin colour-fixated Thailand, dismissing the procedure as a phallic "fashion" with uncertain benefits and many risks.
Requiring the use of lasers, acid, or chemicals, the latest craze in genital beautification can leave men with burns, scars, taut skin, or the exact opposite of what they were after in the first place — a darker penis or a spotted one, the experts warned.
"I think it should not be done in a patient that doesn't need it," Milanese plastic surgeon Massimiliano Brambilla, who specialises in genital procedures, told AFP.
"Most of the substances that are used to whiten... are quite aggressive. Whitening is one of those things that I am very careful of."
Earlier this month, a Bangkok clinic said 100 men a month were making use of its penis whitening service just six months after it started offering the procedure.
The clinic charged about $650 (520 euros) for five laser sessions.
According to global statistics produced by the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ISAPS), Thailand ranked 21st in terms of the number of cosmetic procedures performed in 2016.
The data also showed a massive rise in genital beautification procedures globally.
Labiaplasty, which involves trimming the inner vaginal "lips" or labia minoria, was by far the fastest growing surgery sector in 2016, with a 45-percent rise from 2015, according to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ISAPS).
'Pornographisation'
Genital whitening was not listed among the data, but industry experts say demand is growing.
"I think it's linked to the pornographisation of society," said plastic surgeon Fabien Boucher from Lyon, France, another practitioner of "intimate" procedures.
"What people see is... a genital aesthetic that in my view is not realistic," they explained, with sex organs shaved and otherwise manipulated to represent those of very young people -- hairless, smooth, and pink.
It is normal for the privates to be more darkly coloured than the rest of the skin, said Boucher.
"I do sex-change surgeries, constructing penises for female-to-male transformations, and these patients want exactly the opposite" of genital whitening — many opting for colour-in tattoos, they added.
"A key defect of our penile reconstruction procedure is that we end up with white penises which are visibly not natural."
Another reason for the Thai trend is cultural.
The Asia Pacific region is a major market for skin lighteners.
Boucher stressed there has been little scientific research into the use of lasers and chemicals for penis-whitening, and no bleaching techniques or products have been developed uniquely for use in this sensitive area.
"The skin of the penis is different" to that of the face or body, for which the existing products were conceived, said Boucher.
"It is a thin skin... and we do not yet fully understand how it will react."
Satisfaction not guaranteed
The Thai health ministry has also warned against the procedure, saying it may cause irritation or infection, even presents a threat to sexual pleasure and reproduction.
"Honestly, I don't think they should be doing it," echoed Boucher, who said they wouldn't perform the procedure until the science shows it is safe.
Brambilla said they have turned down about three whitening requests in their 15-year career.
"If the colour is uniform, I really see no need," they explained.
"But even if there is a reason for intervention, such as an accident, the instruments that we have now to do it, they cannot guarantee first of all the satisfaction, secondly a realistic result, and thirdly the safety of what you're doing," they said.
Penis enlargement, meanwhile, dropped by 28 percent in 2016, according to the ISAPS, likely due to the rise of new, less-invasive booster techniques.
Newton succumbs to some common indie-film failures. The women's various opponents often come off as unnecessarily mean and smug. And “Who We Are Now” annoyingly withholds the details of Beth's crime until the third act, not because that's the best time for the audience to find out, but because that's the formula for this type of movie.
Network security for the US State of Michigan has been rated as "moderately sufficient" in an audit of its Department of Technology, Management, and Budget (DTMB).
Michigan's DTMB, according to auditor Doug Ringler this month, got some things right but has a number of deficiencies in its IT security practices that need to be addressed.
The lackluster findings echo an audit of the US Department of Homeland Security released earlier this month and underscore how it is that government agencies continue to be victimized by hackers, state-sponsored or otherwise.
The Michigan audit, which spanned the period from October 2014 through September 2017, identified 14 findings, five of which are deemed "material" and nine of which are deemed "reportable," the former being more severe than the latter.
For example, the report says the DTMB hasn't fully implemented configuration management controls for its devices. The department, the audit says, monitors changes to the network configuration of only about 100 out of 3,876 devices (~3 per cent). The report contends that the agency should monitor the configuration settings for all of its devices.
Effective
DTMB only partially accepts this criticism, arguing that its defense-in-depth approach is effective and continues to improve.
The audit also says that DTMB failed to implement network access controls to keep unauthorized devices off Michigan's network. Again, DTMB says it only partially accepts this criticism, stressing that is has other approaches to preventing unauthorized or unmanaged devices from accessing its network.
As with the feds, DTMB falls short when it comes to patching vulnerabilities. The audit says it identified 10 vulnerabilities of high or medium severity that should have been addressed through software fixes.
Here, the DTMB has no argument.
The state's other material shortcomings include failure to review, test, and monitor firewall rules and failure to implement an effective process to identify and remediate vulnerabilities with network devices. And the DTMB agrees with these findings.
Among the nine less severe "reportable" conditions, the audit recommends that the state keep plugging away with its cybersecurity awareness training program.
To understand why, consider that when 5,000 randomly selected state employees across 18 executive branch departments were presented with a phishing email test, 32 per cent opened the phishing message, 25 per cent clicked on the link in the message, and 19 per cent submitted their credentials through the phishing website loaded by the link.
This is why we can't have nice things. ®

ISLAMABAD : The Ministry of Commerce on Wednesday announced that United Arab Emirates (UAE) has given permission to Pakistan to export poultry products.
The UAE has granted permission to import day old chicks and hatching eggs form the companies which are certified for export ministry and possessing attached health certificates, permission to import poultry meat and its products from the slaughterhouses that are certified for export by the UAE per procedures followed in this regard and health certificate.
Speaking on the occasion Commerce Minister Engineer Khurram Dastgir Khan said, “Pakistan appreciates the lifting of ban on poultry by our longstanding trading partner and brotherly nation UAE”.
The Minister also appreciated the cooperation extended by Sartaj Aziz, Advisor to Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs, and Mr. Sikandar Hayat Khan Bosan, Minister for National Food Security and Research.
They lauded efforts by Pakistan Ambassador to the UAE, Moazzam Ahmad Khan and Pakistan Department for Plant Protection and acknowledged Pakistan Poultry Association for their professional support during recent visit to Pakistan by UAE poultry inspectors.
The UAE annually imports more than US$ 700 million of poultry products, a market from which Pakistan was barred for 8 years.
Lifting of the ban will open this market for Pakistan exporters, who have made commendable technological progress in recent years.
As 3 February 2018 marks the Queer Azadi Pride March in Mumbai, we're publishing six compelling coming-out stories: first-person accounts of coming out about your sexuality or gender to friends, loved ones, colleagues or even to yourself. This interview was part of Harish Iyer's 'I'm Coming Out', published by Juggernaut Books, in which the personalities they speak with explore what it means to be gay in India.
This story contains parts which some readers may find disturbing. Discretion is advised.
On a warm Sunday afternoon in 2016 I was at home glued to Facebook when I read a post by one of my friends. They were going to commit suicide. The reason behind their decision was that a relative had been accusing them of sexually preying on their female cousins. They had had enough of the bullying and had decided to end their lives. They were a lesbian. I, of all people, knew how members of the LGBTQ community were subjected to such hostile accusations. I acted on impulse and quickly rang them up. They picked up after a few rings.
This was not the first time they had expressed that they were upset on Facebook. And this was not the first time I had called them after reading their update. They opened up to me, I heard them out. After they finished speaking, I asked her, "So, are you going to hang yourself or jump from the balcony?" Suddenly, they burst out laughing. I breathed a sigh of relief. I had defused the bomb. "Well, that's what all of us go through, darling," I told her, "We all are predators until proved otherwise."
They laughed.
Prachi is erratic, impulsive, lovely. Sometimes, they are also suicidal. I first met Prachi Kathale, or as we fondly call her, PK, at the Queer Azaadi Mumbai event. They were part of Umang – a wing of The Humsafar Trust for lesbian, bisexual and transgender women. Later, they also became a part of Yaariyan, a queer youth collective forum managed by The Humsafar Trust. We hit it off instantly.
That's where it all started. And here I was, a few years later, rushing to greet them with a hug. We were at a coffee shop. They ordered a cappuccino between our chatter and quipped, "My life can be made into a film."
I quickly seized the opportunity to ask her, "How about I write your story first?"
"Sachi?" they asked, in disbelief.
"PK, tell me about your life. Where do you come from? Tell me about your family."
"I am an adopted child. I was one of those foetuses that were thrown into the dustbin."
At this point, I started laughing. "Come on, don't joke. I'm being serious here."
‘I'm serious. I am really a girl child who was thrown into the dustbin. I was later adopted by my parents."
At this point, the tone of the conversation changed. I couldn't indulge in my usual self-deprecatory talk. They were really being serious.
"So when did you find out?" I asked them
"I was apparently born in Amravati. I was rescued by a social worker who found me in a dustbin. They picked me up and took me to an orphanage in Vile Parle, Mumbai."
"That's quite a start," I said, dumbfounded.
"I have been quite open about it. My parents are the ones who looked after me… I no longer have anger or resentment towards my mother, who abandoned me. I count my blessings rather than regret that which I don't have."
"Then why do you get these suicidal thoughts?"
They laughed. "It sucks to be a minority. A gender minority. A sexual minority. Just because I'm gay doesn't mean I prey on other women in my family. By the same logic, I want to ask them, since they are straight men, should we assume all of them will abuse women? We don't, right? We find it absurd, right? Then how is it okay for someone to say the same about LGBT people?"
I agreed wholeheartedly.
"And Harish, I have been through awful things…' they continued, "I remember hearing your story, about how you were abused by your uncle…"
"Don't tell me you've been through the same thing?"
"Yes, I was raped too. And I would have been pregnant too."
A deep silence descended.
"It happened when I was just in Class 2," they said, as their voice choked, "It was during the summer vacations. My uncle… they shut my mouth so hard I lost my teeth. Then they raped me. Afterwards they told me, 'If you utter a word about this, your mother will hate you, and no one will talk to you ever again.' I'll never forget their words."
"He's dead now," they said with a certain joy in their voice.
It gave me courage to break the monotony of painful thoughts and ask them jokingly, "Darling, did this lead you to become a lesbian? Like they say, you hate men so you become a lesbian."
They chuckled. They knew I was pulling them leg.
You actually don't ‘turn' gay or lesbian. It is not something that is acquired by experience, whether good or bad. Sexuality is innate. I knew this. I wanted to know what they felt about it.
"I am and always have been a lesbian. I knew I was attracted to girls right from Class 3. Every time I had a crush on someone, it happened to be a girl. I have loved girls since the time I remember love. The rape had nothing to do with my sexual identity."
"But when did you realise you are a lesbian?"
"It was in Class 7 when I realised there was a word to describe who I was. Suddenly, I realised that my feelings had a name and that my sexuality was also an identity. It felt so good then. And then a year later, when I was in Class 8, I fell in love with a girl. We were in a relationship that lasted for eight years. It was like a seal of homosexuality."
"Were there any straight girls you fell for? Did you feel jealous when they liked boys instead of girls?"
‘I always wondered…' PK responded quickly, "I am better looking than that guy, I am more powerful than that guy, why are they not looking at me? Boys were always competition…"
"To make things clear for the reader, you mean only straight and bisexual boys were competition, right."
"PK, how did you come out? We live in a world where people still don't know or accept that there are different forms of sexuality. Was it difficult?"
"You know, Harish, coming out was not dramatic at all. My father and I were at dinner and I told him. I told them that I get attracted to girls. They asked me, 'Do you like any girl?' and I said yes. And they just told me to go with the flow. It was that easy."
"Wow!" I said. I was shocked. I had never heard a better coming out story in my life. "You are a lucky girl. And does your mother know you are a lesbian?"
"My school teacher and principal did me the favour," said PK.
"How?" I was intrigued.
"I was dating this girl in school. I went down on one knee with a rose in my hand. I proposed to them in front of everybody."
"Seriously, you are crazy! You know that, right?" I laughed.
"That I am. Love should be set free, right?," they said cheerily.
'What happened next? Did you get beaten up?"
"Nothing like that happened. Them family understood. My family understood. My mother thought it was a phase but they didn't react negatively either."
"What about your girlfriend, PK? Where are they now?" I inquired curiously.
Although they continued to smile, PK's eyes welled up. "She passed away in 2007. I lost them to cancer. They were a fighter. They wanted to live. But they had a small life and I had a big place in their heart."
"I am so sorry to hear that," I said softly. "So you slipped into depression after that? I would have…"
"Oh yes. After her, my world fell apart. It took me a lot of time to regain my strength and accept that I was alone in this world."
PK lost the love of their life in 2007.  They are in a happier place now.  They are as charming as charming can be. I decided to ask them if their extended family had taken it well.
"Now I am out. Some cousins have unfriended me. Some don't talk to my parents. It's okay. The lesser people in my life, the lesser the tension."
PK roams the city on their bike. They work at a BPO and is an established photographer. They have an identity.  They are a brand. But they too, gets lonely, sometimes suicidal, especially when someone insults them  They are getting better with every passing year. I have seen them grow from a bud to a flower. I asked them about the lesbian dating scene because so little is known about it.
"Gay girls go after rich gay girls. There is classism here too. Also, they are quick to assume I'm butch."
A lesbian who's called ‘butch' is considered the masculine one in the relationship between two women. The one who is more feminine is called the femme. But yes, there is a world beyond all these wordy definitions of people's appearances. There can be lesbians who do not subscribe to this binary of femme and butch and just call themselves lesbians or queer.
"Are you going to start dating again?" I asked PK.
"Yes. If there's someone worthy. You know, love happens. Pyaar kiyaa nahi jaata, ho jaata hai."
I asked PK if they would like to share something with the people who are reading their interview. They concluded with this: "I know life can get very tough when the world doesn't look in the direction you are looking. I know how it feels like to be ostracised, to be teased, to be forced, to be raped… but hold on to dear hope. Things will change if you believe in change."
PK is a lucky girl in many ways. They have a very understanding father. Them story is an exception, not the norm. The same is not the case with many lesbian women in India and around the world. Many are forced into heterosexual marriages and go through a lifetime of marital rape. Some women start believing that this is their life and their fate; they bear children and spend a lifetime as slaves of heterosexuality. Life is not easy when you hide your true self and try to be something you are not.
Lesbianism is not just about sex between women. We should abstain from reducing it to something like that. It is an orientation. Lesbian women dream of a lifetime with their lovers. They write poems, songs and feel their toes curl up when they see someone they are hugely attracted to. The emotions are the same.
People like Prachi define an alternate world that is filled with love. They had their challenges, still has some and will continue to face challenges, but they have won a battle with herself. They have reclaimed their life as a true, out and proud lesbian.
You can, too.
Like Oscar Wilde said, ‘Be yourself, everyone else is taken.'
If you are a lesbian and are struggling when it comes to dealing with your sexuality, feel free to call the Umang helpline or write to them at umanglbt@gmail.com. You can also reach out to them on Facebook. You can check out the Gaysi website to meet other lesbians.
The firefighters arrived at the 15400 block of South Orchard Avenue around 4:30 a.m. Four adults and one child were displaced by the fire, the Fire Department said, and the American Red Cross has responded to the scene to help them.

On a Friday back in January, specifically January 26, Sterling Brown, a player for the Milwaukee Bucks, exited a Walgreen's and encountered some Milwaukee Police Officers. This past Wednesday, May 23, the Milwaukee Police Department released the video from the body cameras worn by the officers involved in the event.
What should've been a simple ticket for a parking violation became so much more when the officers decided to taser Brown instead of citing them for disorderly conduct.
The video which is 30 minutes long, can be found on the Milwaukee Police Department's (MPD) YouTube page: MilwaukeePolice. It starts with Brown being approached by an officer, who requests to see their license and quickly turned volatile as the officers become increasingly agitated.
In the video, the officer can be heard telling Brown that they are waiting for their partner to arrive before they make any decisions. A few minutes later, several additional police cars appear on the scene, again, the scene being a parking violation in a Walgreen's parking lot.
By the time it's eight minutes in, Sterling, who has been compliant, is surrounded by multiple officers, tackled to the ground and tasered following the commands of one officer yelling, “Taser! Taser! Taser!”
In a statement released by Brown, they address the overlying treatment of black men by police officers in the nation, and their hope that by telling their story further injustices can be prevented.
“Black men shouldn't have to have their guard up and instantly be on the defensive when seeing a police officer, but it's our reality and a real problem,” Brown wrote in their statement.
They also added that while there isn't an easy solution to solve these issues, there can be steps made in the right direction to build a better relationship between police officers and the black community. Brown is planning on taking legal actions against the officers involved in the incident.
In a separate statement, the Milwaukee Bucks offered their support of Sterling and likewise called for there to be more accountability.
“We are grateful for the service of many good police officers that courageously protect us, our fans and our city, but racial biases and abuses of power must not be ignored,” the statement read.
The day prior to the MPD releasing this video, they released another video on their page titled Message to the Community from MPD Chief Alfonso Morales. In it, Morales expresses their desire to rebuild the trust between Milwaukee residents and the police.
“I will also defend our officers when they are right and will admit when members of our organization are wrong,” Morales states. “So, if there is ever an incident where one of our members makes a mistake, unnecessarily escalating a situation, I'm going to be honest, and transparent about it.”
At the press conference held surrounding the video's release, Morales said that an investigation was conducted regarding the incident and the officers involved. As a result, it was determined that they acted inappropriately and were disciplined for their actions. Although the discipline taken was not specified, it is expected to be on file in the coming days or weeks.
“I'm sorry the incident escalated to this level,” they said and added that the criminal charges against Brown were dropped.
Mayor Tom Barret also held a press conference addressing the video's contents. In their statement they said that part of their duties is improving community and police relations, adding that it must get better.
“As the mayor of this city I need this to be a city, in fact, we all need this to be a city where our residents can work with and respect our police officers,” Barrett said. “We also need this to be a city where our police officers can work with and respect our residents.” Adding, “It has to be a two-way street.”
Vehicle thefts in Saskatoon hit a five-year high in Saskatoon during 2016.
Saskatoon Police Service said in its annual report that there were 1,269 stolen vehicles reported in the city during the year.

That is up 21 per cent from 2015 and the highest level since 2011.
The police report said the thefts are getting more dangerous as the thieves are driving stolen vehicles dangerously and attempting to evade police.
One way police said they are dealing with the increase in vehicle thefts is the auto theft reduction project, which involves parking “bait vehicles” in areas targeted by vehicle theft.
The vehicles are not operable and when someone enters the vehicle, a silent alarm is triggered, alerting police and starting a video feed.
Police also conducted a survey on vehicle thefts, with 1,400 people taking part and providing feedback that officials said will be used to shape future prevention and enforcement strategies.
Nearly three in five vehicle thefts in Saskatoon are due to the keys being left in or near vehicles.

Property crime was also up in 2016, increasing 22 per cent from the previous year.
Police said drugs, especially meth, continues to be a driving force behind many property crimes.
Firearms-related offences jumped by 50 per cent during 2016.
The report will go to the Saskatoon board of police commissioners on Thursday.
LAHORE : Chief Justice of Lahore High Court (LHC) on Monday summoned Advocate General in Punjab land scam case on January 6.

“Will hold in-depth and unbiased investigation into the matter”, they added.
Notices have also been dispatched to the heads of other relevant departments.

Lansing — Democrat Shri Thanedar is launching the first television ads of the 2018 race for Michigan governor, going on the air months earlier than past candidates as they seek to boost their profile among potential voters.
The little-known Ann Arbor entrepreneur, who last year sold a majority stake in the Avomeen product testing and development lab they founded, has committed nearly $6 million of their personal fortune to their campaign.
A new ad, set to begin running Tuesday, “is one of the ways we intend to use our significant cash on hand advantage to tell as wide an audience as possible about Shri's inspiring life story and their progressive ideas to make education and health care accessible to all,” campaign manager Brian Spangle said in a release.
Spangle did not immediately respond to questions from The Detroit News over the size of the advertising buy and in which markets the commercial will run. Public inspection records for multiple broadcast channels in Metro Detroit do not yet show any Thanedar ads on the docket.
As published online ahead of Tuesday's launch, the ad highlights Thanedar's background as a scientist and chemist while jabbing both Republican President Donald Trump and GOP Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder.
“With a climate change denier president and an accountant governor who brought us the Flint drinking water crisis, our next governor should get science,” a narrator says.
Thanedar sold their company last year in a deal that netted them roughly $20 million, according to a federal lawsuit filed by the buyers, who allege Thanedar made “fraudulent and misleading” claims to inflate the value.
The 62-year-old Indian-born American has denied the accusations and touted their success at Avomeen, which they helped found after returning to Ann Arbor from Missouri in 2010.
Despite their wealth, Thanedar is considered a long shot to win the Democratic gubernatorial primary in August 2018. The field includes former state Senate Minority Leader Gretchen Whitmer, the early front runner for the nomination, and former Detroit health department director Abdul El-Sayed.
Thanedar's early commercial is a reminder of how long campaign cycles now last, said Craig Mauger of the Michigan Campaign Finance Network, whose non-profit does not typically start tracking ad buys until the first month of an election year.
Snyder, who is term limited and cannot see re-election, was not well known when they launched their first gubernatorial ad in February 2010 – a Super Bowl spot that introduced them to voters as “one tough nerd.”
Republican business person Dick DeVos also ran their first ads in February 2006 in their losing bid to unseat incumbent Democratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm.
“Those are two candidates that had a lot of money, and they launched their ads in February of the election year,” Mauger said.
“Obviously the Democratic primary has multiple candidates, so it looks like (Thanedar) wants to get the race started earlier. It's a combination of trends: Elections are becoming more expensive, and they're also starting earlier.”
Thanedar had loaned their campaign $5.96 million through Oct. 20, according to the most recent disclosure report they were required to file with the state. Their campaign had spent $281,835, leaving them with nearly $5.7 million in cash on hand.

A marathon of hockey from April 6 to 9 resulted in positive memories of a lifetime for local indigenous youth.
The tournament dubbed the “Stanley Cup of Indigenous Minor Hockey” led to the EMS Midget Oilers and Elizabeth Northern Selects Pee-wee Girls teams to win gold medals at the 2017 Alberta Native Provincials held in Edmonton recently.
The 2017 Alberta Native Provincials is the largest all indigenous tournament comprised of 250 teams from communities across the province.
Our community should be proud of our local indigenous athletes and what they've accomplished as it's a first to bring home both gold medals as top teams in their divisions and the province.
The teams are comprised of local youth ages 11-18 with both teams going undefeated playing 11 games total.
The Midget Oilers went 6-0 outscoring opponents 42-7 and the Girls Northern Selects went 5-0 outscoring opponents 54-1.
The boys competed against 24 other teams in their division going 30-0 in pool play advancing to bracket play on April 8 with wins 4-2 vs. Sucker Creek, 4-2 vs. Sturgeon Lake and 3-2 vs. Kikino to win the Gold on finals on April 9.
The Pee-wee girls went 48-0 vs. Calling Lake, Alexis, Stoney Sioux and Edmonton in five games leading up to the final vs. Enoch winning Gold with a 6-1 final score.
A special thank you to everyone who supported the teams including the sponsors and to the team managers, brother and sister Chris Desjarlais and Kelly Steinhauer, and the coaches and trainers who made it all happen for these kids.
A nod to our few sponsors who also supported the teams and helped our young athletes.
The Harmony Grove Cardinals (3-2, 1-1) are coming off of a much-needed victory in Week 5 where they defeated Bismarck heavily, 42-7.
Following the lopsided homecoming win, Head Coach Paul Calley turned their club's attention to Week 6 as another must-win for playoff seeding.
“This is something the coaching staff has been looking forward to for a year,” Calley said. “That game last year, we felt like got away from us. We had a key injury that kind of set the tone for us. We had an inability to stop the run and the pass late in the game and we had an inability to catch the ball late in the game when we needed to.
“It was a bad game all the way around.”
Harmony Grove held a two-touchdown lead in last year's contest, but fell short on the road, 29-26.
Last week, the Lions were rolled by 5-3A foe Glen Rose (4-1, 2-0) 42-14 despite a quick start that consisted of a blocked punt returned for a TD in the first quarter.
The Beavers, though, would put up 28 unanswered points in the second quarter and wouldn't let up throughout the contest.
Glen Rose defeated Harmony Grove in Week 4, 35-0, at Beavers Stadium.
For Harmony Grove, running the football has, at times, been obsolete.
Through five games, Harmony Grove has rushed for 602 yards with Jake Brooks leading the charge with 234 yards on 42 carries and four TDs.
In week 5, Brooks trampled Bismarck for two scores and 93 yards on 12 carries.
This week's contest will begin at 7 p.m. at Sykes Stadium in Haskell.

Thousands of conductors and engineers with Canadian Pacific Railway walked off the job Tuesday night — sparking transportation worries across the country.
READ MORE: CP Rail train operators go on strike
More than 3,000 employees of Canada's second-largest railroad are now on strike, but the union says it's still negotiating with the railway with the help of a federal mediator.
The railroad workers, whose collective agreement expired late last year, are asking for more predictable schedules to combat crew fatigue, among other demands.
READ MORE: Lumber producers add their voice to concerns over potential CP Rail strike
In the meantime, industries representing the grain, mining, aluminium and fertilizer industries say the strike will have a significant economic impact on them and urged the Canadian government to help resolve the issue.
Here's a look at the industries affected by the walkout.
Grain industry
The strike could force the railroad to shut down its freight service at a particularly bad time for grain farmers, whose livelihoods were threatened because grain shipping was severely disrupted over the past winter due to extreme cold.
The longer farmers' product sits in grain elevators — and on rails — the quicker it depreciates in value. Add to that, leery buyers, who are unsure they'll ever see the product they bought, and it's an unenviable predicament.
Wade Sobkowich, executive director of the Western Grain Elevator Association, told the Canadian Press they were hoping for a miracle but fully expected a work stoppage and must now notify farmers.

They said deliveries will have to be rescheduled and overseas customers must be told that shipments will be late.
Grain Growers of Canada president Jeff Nielsen said the organization had asked the federal government to intervene with legislation to keep grain moving, but Prime Minister Trudeau has already ruled out a back-to-work bill.
Nielson said as grain farmers recover from the winter grain backlog, it is essential that shipping stays on track.

Using trucks to ship grain may also be out of the question.
“Even without the tightness in the market, alternative modes of transport wouldn't be able to make up for the loss of Canadian Pacific's capacity,” analyst David Tyerman of Cormark Securities Inc said.
Fertilizer industry
On Wednesday, Fertilizer Canada released a statement about the walkout, saying the strike negatively impacts producers and compromises the country's position as a leading fertilizer supplier.

“As the Canadian fertilizer industry exports to more than 75 countries, our members rely on an efficient transportation system in order to remain globally competitive,” Garth Whyte of Fertilizer Canada said.
“We strongly urge the government to take whatever action is necessary to ensure minimal damage is done to the Canadian economy and especially Canadian trade industries.”
Mining industry
The Mining and the Aluminum Associations of Canada said the strike would also have a “significant economic impact” on their industries and cause a shortfall of essential fuel and supply shipments to mines across the country.
“On the backdrop of recent, painful and ongoing service disruptions in the rail freight market, and the damage this has already done to Canada's reputation as a reliable trading partner, the economy can ill afford the effects of a protracted labour dispute that grinds a half of Canada's rail freight capacity to a halt,” Pierre Gratton of the Mining Association of Canada (MAC) said in a statement.
WATCH: Canada's oil industry is in better place now than with previous governments, Trudeau says
Canada's Oil and Natural Gas Producers (CAPP) said the oil industry is concerned about the availability of rail capacity “given the current tight pipeline situation.”
“Increased transportation capacity of all types is needed to reach more Canadians and new, growing markets around the world to ensure Canada remains globally competitive,” a representative from the organization said.

According to MAC's 2017 Facts & Figures report, the Canadian mining industry accounts for over 50 per cent of the freight revenues of Canada's rail system yearly (around $6 billion annually).
Aluminium industry
The Aluminium Association of Canada said the strike adds “major challenges” to the operations of aluminium smelters; many producers now have to resort to complex and “more costly” transportation options.

“The financial and logistical impact on our operations are significant in an already challenging market environment for our businesses,” the organization said in a statement.
“Currently affected by a series of increased costs and an uncertainty in the market, aluminium is a commodity that does not allow any transfer of additional costs to purchasing customers.”
Commuter trains not impacted
As part of the strike deal, the union ensured passenger service on three commuter railways in Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal will be uninterrupted.
What the Canadian government is doing
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday their government believes in the right to strike and would not intervene, as their predecessor had, “early and often” in labour disputes.
But they said they would not rule out back-to-work legislation.

OTTAWA —Martine Ouellet has agreed to have a confidence vote on their Bloc Québécois leadership brought forward.
They made the announcement in Ottawa today.
Details will be hammered out at a party meeting in Quebec on April 29.
The vote is expected to be held by telephone or internet in the following months.
Originally, the leadership vote was scheduled only for 2019.
The Cardinals are in need of safety help.
Enter Tre Boston, currently on an airplane zooming toward Arizona, according to NFL Network's Mike Garafolo.
The free-agent safety is set for a team visit after spending last season with the Chargers. Boston's only other known meet-and-greet was a mid-May gathering with the Colts.
With plans to deploy versatile second-year defender Budda Baker in their nickel package, the Cardinals could use depth at the back of their defense.
Boston, 25, put together a solid campaign for Los Angeles in 2017, finishing as the league's 36th-ranked safety, per Pro Football Focus, while grading out positively in coverage. The 2014 fourth-rounder spent their first three seasons with the Panthers.
The problem for Boston -- and all safeties -- is a market that has virtually forgotten about the position, leaving fellow ex-starters Kenny Vaccaro and Eric Reid without a home.
We'll find out soon enough if Boston can make it happen in Arizona.

JERSEYVILLE – Jaquan Adams will get to end their high school basketball career with another winning basketball team.
The Civic Memorial senior helped their team clinch a winning season after scoring the game-winning bucket as time expired in the Eagles' come-from-behind, 60-58 victory over the Jersey Panthers on Friday at Jerseyville.
The Eagles snapped a two-game losing streak and improved to 15-7 overall and 4-2 in Mississippi Valley Conference play with five regular season games remaining. The Bethalto school also clinched its fifth straight winning season.
CM returns to action on Tuesday with a home game against Mascoutah. With Friday's win, the Eagles moved into a second-place tie with the Indians in the conference standings. They also have Mater Dei, Triad, Highland and Waterloo left on their schedule.
CM came back from a 9-0, first-quarter deficit to pull off the win over Jersey, which dropped to 11-11. The Eagles also completed the season sweep over the Panthers. Two months ago, they edged Jersey 45-43 in the last meeting at Bethalto.
Adams, who finished with 20 points, was mobbed by their teammates after scoring the game-winning basket. Then, CM fans ran onto the Jersey court to celebrate the win.
Adams has played varsity all four years and has played for a winning team in each of those years. They helped the Eagles win 74 games during their career.
Adams remains the Eagles' leading scorer at 17 points per game. They scored in double figures for the 17th time this season. They finished with 18 in the last meeting against the Panthers.
Caden Clark returned on Friday after missing two games with an injury and finished with 13 points. Bryce Zupan finished with 17 points, their sixth straight double-digit performance.
The Eagles also won their second straight conference game. They beat Waterloo 49-48 on a last-second shot by Zupan.
The Panthers stormed to a 9-0 lead after getting 3-pointers from Kurt Hall and A.J. Shaw and a conventional 3-point basket by Shaw. They led 16-8 after the first quarter and led by as many as 17 in the second quarter.
But the Eagles rallied to take a 53-50 lead after going on a 10-0 run in the fourth quarter. With 5:21 to go in the game, Zupan received a pass from Adams and hit a 3-pointer to give CM a 51-50 lead, its first lead of the game. Then, Adams scored a basket with 4:16 remaining to increase the lead to three points.
Hall hit a pair of free throws with 35 seconds to go to tie the game at 56-56, sending the contest to overtime.
Clark had a chance to win the game, but their layup as time expired in regulation was no good.
Jersey's Lucas Ross scored a basket with 2:52 left in overtime gave their team a 58-56 lead. But Adams tied it with a basket 20 seconds later.
CM called a timeout with 1:17 left. The Eagles ran the clock down to two seconds when junior Jacob Coleman fired a pass to Adams and the senior scored the game-winning bucket.
Hall finished with 13 points, Blake Wittman had 12 and Coby Gibson added 11 to lead Jersey.

Steve Eckelkamp, former FAU Head Swim Coach, passed away in their home in Tennessee last Saturday. Eckelkamp was the coach at Florida Atlantic University from 1989-2014. During that time, both the men's and women's programs made the lead from Division II to Division I.
After their move to Division I in the early 90s, the men made an impact on the national scene quickly. At NCAAs in 1996, the FAU men finished 20th nationally under the guidance of Eckelkamp. Most recently, Steve Eckelkamp led the FAU Owls to NCAAs in 2006 where they had swimmers from both the men's and women's programs. When the men qualified for Division I NCAAs in 1996, they became the first team from Florida Atlantic to qualify for NCAA post-season competition. Throughout the course of the 1990s Eckelkamp was a member of number of USA National Team staffs including those of the World University Games, Goodwill Games, LEN Cup, World Cup, and Short-Course Championships.
Along with their coaching success, Eckelkamp helped open FAU's Olympic size pool in 1997.
Steve Eckelkamp is survived by their wife, Lisa, and two sons, Yuri and Yurgun.
Employees of Worcester's police department are some of the highest paid individuals who work for the city, taking home collectively more than $4 million in overtime pay, and with some officers making more in detail pay than their base pay.
But overtime pay doesn't just rack up amongst police officers. The city's fire department and Department of Public Works also earned millions in overtime pay in 2017.
Though the city paid out more than $11 million in overtime dollars last year, officials say the departments are not understaffed.
Combined, employees of the Police Department, Fire Department and Department of Public Works were paid more than $7 million in overtime dollars last year.
In a year with a record-low five homicides, police department employees took home $4,399,365 in overtime.
But city officials say those costs are not because of understaffing.
"There are late calls, there's the special projects that we have to do, there are parades that we have to cover," Police Chief Steven Sargent said in an interview. "The environment we're in now where every time we have a protest or anti-protest or whatever it may be, we have to put up our real time crime center, there's training, there are so many other things involved that have to be taken care of."
The police officer who took home the most overtime pay was John Towns at $59,577.
"We want our cops on the street, so if we have to pay overtime to get them better trained, to have our real time crime center up when all these things are going on, then that's what we're going to do to keep the community safe," Sargent said. "Where homicides are down, we saved some money there, but there are so many other things that are involved, grants that we need to take care of that are done on overtime."
More than a dozen other police officers, captains and lieutenants took home between $30,000 and $50,000 in overtime pay.
"Overtime costs are not typically due to understaffing," a city spokesperson said in an email. "Much of specialized and grant funded police work is done on an overtime basis such as the Summer Impact program, youth programs, off-shift attendance to crime watch and neighborhood association meetings, unanticipated investigations, accident reconstruction, etc."
For department of public works employees, that overtime can be required for emergency situations like snow removal or water main breaks.
Hermes Rivera, a working supervisor who maintains the Worcester Common, received the most overtime pay of Department of Public Works employees at $40,122.

Police department details through 2017 also reached into the millions.
The city dished out a total of $9,326,718 in detail pay, and several police officers earned more working details than from their regular paycheck.
Police officer George Kelly made the most in detail pay out of any police officer, amassing $100,384 for details last year. That is more than their regular pay of $75,508.
Kelly wasn't the only officer to make more in details than their regular salary. William Auger Jr. made $88,252 in details compared to $87,624 in regular pay. Nathan Lafleche brought in $86,662 in detail pay, more than their $80,498 regular pay.
There were 7,287 people on the city's payroll last year.
As expected, City Manager Edward Augustus Jr. was the highest paid employee in the city last year.
The city has 223 employees who make more than $100,000 in regular pay. They range from Augustus to Kurt Richard, a fire captain whose salary was $100,051.
Among the top 50 earners in 2017, only two were women, and many are employees of the police department.

AMMAN U.S. troops based in Syria's southeastern desert have expanded their footprint, rebels there say, increasing the risk of direct ground confrontation between the Americans and Iran-backed pro-government forces.U.S. special forces have been based since last year at Tanf, a strategic Syrian highway border crossing with Iraq, where the Americans have assisted rebels trying to recapture territory from fleeing Islamic State fighters.The U.S.-backed Syrian rebels in the area are in competition with pro-government forces who are also trying to recapture territory from Islamic State.On several occasions in recent weeks, warplanes of the U.S.-led coalition have struck pro-government forces to prevent them advancing, in what Washington has described as self defence.Abu al-Atheer, military spokesperson for the U.S.-backed Maghawir al-Thawra rebel group, told Reuters U.S. forces had spread from their initial location at Tanf to set up a second base at Zakf, around 60-70 km (40-50 miles) to the northeast.Regional intelligence sources told Reuters the U.S. military moved in the last few days a new long-range rocket launcher system from Jordan to Tanf, for the first time in southern Syria stepping up its presence in the area.They said the (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) - HIMARS which can fire missiles as far as 300km had been deployed for the first time in southern Syria. They had been previously used to strike militants from positions in Turkey and Jordan.Colonel Ryan Dillon, spokesperson for the U.S.-led coalition fighting against Islamic State in both Iraq and Syria, denied troops had set up a new base. But they said sometimes coalition forces conduct patrols and training with rebels at locations outside Tanf that could be maintained for days or weeks."We have that garrison in al-Tanf that is a temporary base and location for us to train our partner forces to fight to defeat ISIS, but that is the only base in southern Syria or location where we have coalition forces," Dillon said.
Abu al-Atheer said the U.S. special forces were now patrolling distances of up to 100 km from Tanf. They said more U.S. special forces were arriving at both the original base at Tanf and the new base at Zakf, and more weapons had been delivered to rebels."The (new) base was being studied for months but now it's an official base. It has been built and expanded and God willing will be in the next few days like the Tanf base," they told Reuters.Video clips purportedly of the Zakf site, sent to Reuters by another rebel in the group, showed a convoy of military vehicles travelling on a paved road lined by long walls, a communications mast and a hut. Another showed three men in uniform next to two small military vehicles, firing a mortar in otherwise empty desert. U.S.-backed rebels are fighting to oust Islamic State fighters from their last two major bastions - Mosul in Iraq and the Euphrates River valley near Raqqa in Syria - in battles which Washington hopes could crush the group this year.
The Syrian government, backed by Russia and Iran, also wants to reclaim the territory in Syria. Pro-government forces have taken up positions north of Tanf, potentially cutting off the U.S.-backed rebels from advancing.Muzahem Saloum, a rebel official close to Maghawir al-Thawra, said the Zakf location would back up Tanf and was expected to be a "first line of defence" against any attack by Iranian-backed Syrian pro-government militias. RIVALRY
Tanf is located near a Syria-Iraq border crossing on the main Baghdad-Damascus highway, and the U.S.-backed rebels took it from Islamic State last year, partly to stop Iran from using it in future to send arms to the Syrian government. The U.S.-backed rebels also want to use it to take more territory along the border and to push towards Deir al-Zor, a large city on the Euphrates where the government has an enclave surrounded by Islamic State fighters.
However, Syria's army has declared winning back control of the desert and relieving its besieged Deir al-Zor enclave a military priority and has advanced swiftly from Palmyra with troops and dozens of tanks. Aided by allied militias backed by Iran, it also hopes to join up with Iraqi forces advancing against Islamic State across the border to secure a land route from Damascus to Baghdad. Iranian news sites have published pictures of Qasem Soleimani, head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' elite extra-territorial arm the Qods Force, visiting militia fighters at an undisclosed area on the border. Recent Syrian government advances to the Iraq border northeast of Tanf and Zakf mean the U.S.-backed rebels would have to fight the Syrian army in order to march on Deir al-Zor.U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Tuesday said air strikes against pro-government forces near Tanf in recent weeks had been in self defence, to prevent them from attacking its troops at the base.Rebel spokesperson Abu al-Atheer said the goal of the government forces was "to cut our advance towards Deir al-Zor. But we are moving towards a plan to take us to Deir al-Zor even if they enter," Abu al-Atheer said."The battle is not over and we will not allow the Iranian Shi'ites to occupy our land. Our response to those who stand against us will be cruel," they added. (Reporting by Suleiman Al-Khalidi; additional reporting by Angus McDowall; editing by Peter Graff and Grant McCool)

Lee Brown will play their final Bristol Rovers match against Gillingham on Saturday.
Manager Darrell Clarke confirmed the news following Rovers' 1-1 draw with Wigan Athletic and also said Brown would wear the captain's armband at the weekend.
Brown has been with Rovers since joining from QPR in 2011 and has gone on to play almost 300 times for the Gas.
They will be remembered for their wholehearted performances and their decision to stay with the club during their drop into non-league. Their legacy was sealed as they scored the now legendary goal which handed Rovers promotion into League One in 2016.
“It will be Lee Brown's last game on Saturday for this football club. He's had a lot of personal issues and family problems this season,” said Clarke.
“Saturday we'll give them to send of they deserve and he'll get the armband Saturday too, I'm sure our fans will give them a good reception.
“He's one of those players who had different options to go elsewhere but fought hard to get the club back in the league, model pro in the changing rooms. He'll go with or best wishes and the fans' best wishes.”
Clarke revealed that Brown needed to be closer to their London home and that they couldn't predict the future in terms of where Brown's career will take them next.
The left-back almost had the perfect send off against the Latics as they struck a long range effort in the dying minutes, only to see it canon back off the post.
“He needs to get nearer to their London home which I totally respect, there are no gripes or hard feeling whatsoever,” said Clarke.
“I totally understand the reason. I'm not going to go into the personal issues around that, but it will be their last game on Saturday.
“He is an outstanding model pro and fantastic character in the changing rooms. Loyalty is not really seen in the footballing world but I thought Lee Brown showed that in abundance. With the club going down into the conference they stuck by it and scored the winning goal that got us promoted as well.”
While the decision comes out of the blue for Rovers fans, Clarke conceded they knew about Brown's departure a little while ago
“I've known for a few weeks. He's a good lad and certainly we'll miss him, but we move on,” added the Rovers boss.

NASHVILLE — Indie Pereira and their wife Pari Bhatt still want a church wedding.
The Nashville couple regularly attends St. Philip's Episcopal Church, but opted for a civil ceremony in the living room of the city's former mayor because their bishop will not permit same-sex couples to have the religious ceremonies in the church.
Pereira and Bhatt live and worship within the Episcopal Diocese of Tennessee, which is one of only eight dioceses in the country where such a ban exists. Their struggle is illustrative of how views on marriage continue to threaten the unity of the denomination.
The other dioceses that ban same-sex marriage ceremonies in the church are Albany, New York; Central Florida; Dallas; Florida; North Dakota; Springfield, Illinois; and the Virgin Islands, according to a report from the church's Task Force on the Study of Marriage.

"It amazes me that I could literally go to any other dioceses that touches us and get married," said Pereira.
But that could change soon.
Same-sex marriage rules could change
Episcopalians will consider altering rules related to weddings for same-sex couples when they gather this month in Texas for the denomination's triennial meeting. The legislative session of their General Convention begins Thursday and runs through July 13 at the Austin Convention Center.
Two resolutions before this year's General Convention could make weddings like the one Pereira and Bhatt want a reality.
One resolution, authored by the denomination's Task Force on the Study of Marriage, would require that bishops make the religious marriage ceremonies available to all couples. And, it proposes changes to the Episcopal Church's Book of Common Prayer, including stripping out the gender specific language as it relates to marriage.

May 19: Royal wedding 2018: Black bishop makes history, mentions slavery in American-style sermon
Three bishops put forward the second resolution. This one would give couples access to the religious wedding, too. But it would require bishops who object to have another willing bishop step in and authorize it. This resolution would not try to change the prayer book.
"My hope is that what they are able to do at the General Convention is to open this up to those of us who have been left out without making anyone feel like they have to participate in something that they're not ready for," Pereira said recently as they sat next to their wife in their home.
The current patchwork of rules started in 2015 when the General Convention opened the door for same-sex weddings by approving trial-use liturgies for marriage. But they left it up to each bishop to decide whether they could be used within their geographic regions.
Tennessee bishop stands firmly behind their decision
Ninety-three bishops authorized same-sex weddings, according to the report by the Task Force on the Study of Marriage. All but 20 of those bishops did so without conditions.
Bishop John Bauerschmidt, who oversees the Middle Tennessee region of the church, stands firmly by their decision not to authorize their use, nor allow clergy within their diocese to officiate the religious ceremonies or permit the weddings on church property.
In doing so, the bishop says they are being faithful to their job of guarding the discipline, faith and unity of the church.

January 2016: Anglicans suspend Episcopal Church over stance on same-sex marriage
July 2015: Episcopalians vote to allow gay marriage in churches
"The teaching that Christian marriage is between a man and a woman is reasonable, traditional, and scriptural," Bauerschmidt said in an email. "There really is nothing remarkable about a Christian bishop who holds to this teaching."
While Bishops can place limitations on the use of the marriage liturgies, they must refer couples to a willing diocese if they do not authorize them. Bauerschmidt chose the Diocese of Kentucky.
Pereira and Bhatt became engaged June 26, 2015, the day the U.S. Supreme Court declared that same-sex couples could legally marry across the country. The landmark decision came just days before the General Convention approved the trial-use liturgies for marriage, and Bauerschmidt issued their decision that November.
The couple did not want to marry in Kentucky.
Bhatt is originally from India, and the need for the legal protections civil marriage offers forced the issue. Megan Barry, who was Nashville mayor at the time, married the couple on Jan. 3, 2016, in their living room.
"It clouded the day because it felt like we had to do it at a place that we didn't want to do it," Pereira said. "We needed those protections while we were waiting for the church to come around."
While some members of the Episcopal Diocese of Tennessee disagree with Bauerschmidt's prohibition, some church members support it.
Langley Granbery, who is a member of an Episcopal Church in Nashville, agrees with Bauerschmidt because they believe the bishop's viewpoint matches what scripture says as well as the church's historic position on marriage.
"I'm very thankful that he's taken the stance on upholding traditional marriage," said Granbery.
They worry the denomination could eventually shift far astray of its past position on marriage. This year, they hope the General Convention will not overrule bishops such as Bauerschmidt nor change what the book of prayer says about marriage.
Granbery is concerned that eventually there may no longer be space in the Episcopal Church for conservative positions like his.
The future is unknown
Bauerschmidt has tried to emphasize unity in the face of the division within the diocese, but the ban has strained relationships for those on both sides of the issue.
In January, church members voted nearly unanimously during their diocesan meeting to send an official message to the General Convention, asking the bishops and deputies to "take in account the exclusion, competing convictions, and loss of community experienced by members of this diocese" because of the 2015 policy change.
That step was driven in part by the work of All Sacraments for All People, a local grassroots group formed in response to the bishop's ban. The organization wants everyone to be able to belong to a congregation that allows them to receive all the sacraments, including marriage.
Connally Davies Penley, who is a part of the group, does not know what to expect from the General Convention, but is hopeful.
Davies Penley wants the resolution that does not require a bishop's permission passed.
They have been in touch with church members in some of the other seven dioceses where the use of the marriage liturgies is banned.
Members in the Episcopal Diocese of Dallas put together a similar campaign. The national group, Integrity USA, also continues to push for LGBTQ inclusion in the church and hopes the General Convention will make it so couples can marry in the church regardless of where they live in the U.S., said Bruce Garner, president of Integrity.
The Rev. Susan Russell, of California, who served on the Task Force on the Study of Marriage, said the bishops' resolution is well intentioned, but would enshrine a separate and inherently unequal status for LGBTQ church members.
"We can do better," Russell said in an email.
Resolutions can change as they make their way through the General Convention process. So it remains to be seen what will happen in Texas.

Just as Alabama State had removed the "interim" tag from head coach Donald Hill-Eley, a member of their coaching staff is now moving on.
Hornets secondary coach Grady Brown will be joining the Louisville Cardinals of the Atlantic Coast Conference in 2018. Brown will take up the position of defensive assistant and recruiting coordinator under head coach Bobby Petrino.
Petrino seemed to be especially impressed with Brown's ability to recruit and develop players.
"Hiring Grady Brown is an excellent addition to our defensive staff," said Petrino. "A detailed technician, Brown is a bright, young football coach who boasts a lot of experience coaching. They do an excellent job in terms of teaching the players, and is a proven recruiter, which will be a tremendous asset in enhancing the talent in our program."
Brown will join a familiar face to them on the Cardinals coaching staff as they will be reunited with Louisville secondary coach Lorenzo Ward. The two previously coached together at South Carolina and Ward has tremendous confidence in Petrino's latest hire.
"Grady Brown is one of the most professional and knowledgeable coaches I've had the opportunity to be around," said Ward. "An outstanding teacher, Brown is very detailed in their instruction, which will be a tremendous benefit to our players."
While at South Carolina from 2012-2015, Brown helped coach a defense that finished in the top-25 in scoring defense and total defense. In 2012, the Gamecock defense finished 11th in the country in total yards per game and was 13th in scoring defense allowing barely over 18 points per game.
Brown was in their second stint at Alabama State. Their first stint began in the early 2000s, when they coached the secondary. In 2003, ASU's defense ranked seventh in the Football Championship Subdivision in both turnovers gained and interceptions. That Hornet defense also finished ninth in rushing defense in the FCS.
Brown was well-traveled, also making coaching stops at Alabama A&M, Texas Southern, LSU, Southern Miss and South Carolina before returning to Alabama State in 2017. After a brief stop at Texas Southern, Brown went on to coach successful defenses and even coached a few players that have landed on NFL teams in recent years. Players like Patrick Peterson, a pro-bowl cornerback for the Arizona Cardinals, and D.J. Swearinger who recently played with the Washington Redskins in 2017-2018.
This past season at Alabama State, the defense only allowed 18 points per game, and the team ended the season winning five out of its last six games allowing more than 16 points just once.

WASHINGTON — Just 24 per cent of Americans believe the country is heading in the right direction after a tumultuous stretch for President Donald Trump that included the threat of war with North Korea, stormy complaints about hurricane relief and Trump's equivocating about white supremacists. That's a 10-point drop since June, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
The decline in optimism about the nation's trajectory is particularly pronounced among Republicans. In June, 60 per cent of Republicans said the country was headed in the right direction; now it's just 44 per cent.
The broader picture for the president is grim, too. Nearly 70 per cent of Americans say Trump isn't level-headed, and majorities say he's not honest or a strong leader. More than 60 per cent disapprove of how they are handling race relations, foreign policy and immigration, among other issues.
Overall, 67 per cent of Americans disapprove of the job Trump is doing in office, including about one-third of Republicans.
Tracy Huelsman, a 40-year-old from Louisville, Kentucky, is among them. A self-described moderate Republican, Huelsman said she's particularly concerned about the "divisiveness" they feel the president promotes on social media.
"It's scary in 2017 that we are in what seems like a worse place in terms of division," said Huelsman, who did not vote for Trump in last year's election.
The assessments come after a turbulent summer for Trump that included a major White House shake-up, bringing the departure of their chief of staff, top strategist and press secretary. While the installment of retired Marine Gen. John Kelly as chief of staff has ushered in more day-to-day order in the West Wing, the president has still stirred up numerous controversies, including when they blamed "both sides" for the clashes between white supremacists and counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Trump has also raised the spectre of a military conflict with North Korea over its nuclear provocations. He's derided North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, as "rocket man," including during a speech at the United Nations, and has downplayed the prospects that diplomatic negotiations with Kim could yield results.
Despite their electoral success, Trump struggled as both a candidate and now as president to broaden their base of support beyond their ardent supporters. The loyalty of their core backers has been enough to keep Republican lawmakers largely in line, but party operatives are closely watching Trump's support among GOP and independent voters ahead of next year's midterm elections, when the balance of power in Congress will be at stake.
To be sure, lawmakers have their own problems to worry about. Americans have even less esteem for Congress than Trump, with just 18 per cent saying they approve of the job being done by the House and the Senate.
Lexi Grote enjoyed an outstanding career for the Granite City Warriors on the pitch.
They ended their senior year with their second straight all-state selection with the Warriors after posting a team-high 16 goals and 16 assists for a team-best 48 points.
The stellar senior campaign earned Grote another award — Granite City AdVantage News Girls Soccer Player of the Year.
Grote helped lead GCHS to a pair of regional championships in their career, winning crowns in their sophomore and junior seasons. Unfortunately, the Warriors fell a little short this season, losing to Collinsville 5-2 in the Class 3A Quincy Regional final played at McKendree University.
It didn't mean their final season with Granite City wasn't special, as the team finished with a 14-6 record and began the season on a torrid pace.
“We started out really good,” they said. “We started on an 8-game winning streak and then played Belleville West and I think we got it in our heads that we were going to go all season playing like that and win and that doesn't happen when you play good teams and there are really good teams in our conference. Belleville West beat us (1-0) and we kind of hit a low spot after that… Then we figured out what we needed to fix and started playing a lot better.”
Senior Night on May 2 was a big turning point according to Grote. The Warriors played host to Marquette Catholic and senior goalie Neeley Wiehardt was able to return from injury for the game, providing a big boost.
“She tore their ACL in the St. Joe's Tournament and they didn't think she'd be able to play and they let them come back for Senior Night and I thought that was pretty cool,” Grote said. “She was happy to do that and that made everybody else happy. We went out and won the game (1-0) and that's when we started finishing our season well.”
A low point for Granite City though was a 2-1 loss to Southwestern Conference rival Alton on May 6. That didn't sit well with the Warriors and when they drew the Redbirds again to open the playoffs — at Gene Baker Field — they blanked them 4-0 to reach the regional championship game for the fourth time in Grote's career.
“Beating (Alton) felt really good,” Grote said. “I just felt like we were all ready to play them again after we lost because we knew we had something to prove, especially at home.”
Grote finished their career with 38 goals and 34 assists for 110 career points. They also tallied 10 game-winning goals in 4 seasons.
As a senior they scored goals in 12 games, including logging 2-goal games against Collinsville, O'Fallon, Fort Zumwalt West and Alton.
“For me to score goals I feel like it comes from our midfield,” Grote said. “Me being successful this year was due to my team.”
Now Grote will continue their career at the Division I level at Southeast Missouri State and she's ready for the next challenge.
“Fitness,” they said. “That's what I need to work on at the next level. We have 2 fitness tests so far and the coaches have been really welcoming there as well as the team so I'm really excited.”
They fought back tears, reminiscing about their time at GCHS though. It will always be a special time in their life.
“I'll miss being around all my friends and my family,” Grote said. “I learned to always play hard and when you get down don't let it get to you, keep going.”

The sidewalk is supposed to be a safe place, but after Monday's van attack in Toronto, some people in Kingston are taking each stride with a little more caution.
On Monday, a van plowed into crowds of pedestrians along a busy sidewalk in downtown Toronto. As a result, 10 people were killed. The attack isn't the first of its kind. Last week, a driver in Germany drove a van into a cafe, killing four people.
READ MORE: ‘Vehicular attacks' a trend, Canadian intelligence report says
According to Christian Leuprecht, a safety and security expert at Queen's University, a number of cities around the world are designing sidewalks with defence mechanisms to prevent vehicles from jumping the curb.
Leuprecht says these can include features such as very large public art displays, or concrete or steal benches that are heavily anchored to the ground.
They make reference to a portion of Kingston's downtown. The re-development of lower Princess Street has allowed the city to install benches, lights and flower beds encased in concrete and granite. While these may just be for decoration, they could also help keep pedestrians safe.

“You can already see that it would be more difficult now to engage in this type of activity with more obstacles along the sidewalk,” Leuprecht says.
According to Bryan Paterson, mayor of Kingston, the city's sidewalks are designed to meet provincial construction standards, with public safety and accessibility in mind. “That includes designing barrier curbs, where applicable, in high pedestrian areas to reduce the chance of vehicles veering up onto sidewalks.”
For a few glorious weeks there, it seemed as if the Winnipeg Jets could do no wrong. Then they went on a quick road trip.
It would be wrong to say that it all came unraveled during that road trip. Sure, they only took one of a possible six points from Tampa Bay, Florida and Detroit, but it's only three games. Hardly the end of the world given how the season has gone so far.
Some holes most certainly appeared in the ship over those three games, however, and the Jets can't afford to ignore them. It may seem like the Jets' start lets them hit cruise control, but this is still the ultra-competitive Western Conference.
In particular, some personnel decisions that didn't seem glaring when the Jets were winning but get thrown into sharp relief when they lose have drawn the ire of fans and observers. The loss to Tampa Bay in particular brought some questions.
– Perreault playing 7 min a night.
– Chiarot in Over poolman
– AHL leading scorer still on the moose
– Hendricks in the NHL Period. And people still claim there are no problems with the team… — Evan Samoiloff (@esamoiloff) December 10, 2017
While not every complaint here is totally valid (Jack Roslovic is doing just fine in the AHL for now, thank you very much), there are some noteworthy points here. With Tucker Poolman being so young, it makes little sense for their development to be playing in the press box.
Then too, there's the fact that Mathieu Perreault, with 15 points in 18 games, played an average of 9:37 per game over the road trip. While Perreault is in a good place on the line with Joel Armia, they could certainly stand to get more ice time overall.
They could also use some help on that line. Matt Hendricks is many things, but offensively inclined isn't one of them. Perreault could use another scorer to complete that line.
It doesn't have to be a centreman either. Perreault themselves can play center. Given their ability to make those around them better, it would be interesting to see what they can do with Marko Dano, another young player whose development is not aided by all this press box time.
Jets Should Play Dano
On the subject of Dano, their underlying numbers this year haven't been good, but there are a couple of contextual caveats to that. One, those numbers came early in the season when the Jets' bottom six was a complete mess. Two, those numbers represent an outlier in their career, in which he's otherwise posted positive CF% Rel.
Dano hasn't played since October, and in six games they averaged 7:24 of ice time. They aren't exactly being put into a position to succeed, and unlike Nic Petan, who is the same age, they aren't sent to the AHL to get some ice time. Their waiver status likely impacted that, in fairness.
Depth forward and would need to clear waivers if send them down — Jim Toth (@JimTothSports) November 30, 2017
That said, when Kyle Connor had to sit out a game against Ottawa, it was Shawn Matthias who drew into the lineup, not Dano. Given that Dano spent time in the top six last year after injuries, it's hard to watch them languishing in a suit for games now.
Dano's NHL career has certainly been a rocky one, and he's had a hard time gaining the trust of their coaches. Yet when he's in the lineup, they make their team better. And no team, not even one that was briefly atop the Western Conference, can ignore a chance to get better.
Tucker Poolman Deserves a Chance
On the defensive end, an injury to Toby Enstrom (an all-too-common theme of recent years) forced Ben Chiarot into action. He's played in 11 games since then with two assists and 16 PIMS (all minor penalties) and negative 5-on-5 possession metrics.
This is Poolman's first pro season, and although they made the Jets out of camp and played well in their three games in October, they were sent back to the AHL in order to play. They should still be playing, as what was true of Poolman in October is still true: he's a young player whose development is better for them getting on the ice.
Chiarot knew at the start of the year they were likely to be a seventh defenseman, called in if an injury occurred. He's filled in for Enstrom for a while, but now it's time to see what the kid can do. After all, Poolman earned rave reviews for their play at the start of the year.
Poolman's great start was a long time ago, but he's not going to regain that form sitting in the press box. Since the Jets won't send them down to the Moose again until Enstrom returns, it's time for them to play.
With Dustin Byfuglien possibly going down injured, it may be unavoidable for Poolman to get game action, but it shouldn't have had to come to that. Even if Byfuglien is ready to go against the Canucks, Poolman should play.
All of these may seem like minor nitpicks, and next to the Jets' record, they are. The Jets' success this year means little details will start to be scrutinized harder, of course. And nitpicking is, after all, part of a columnist's job.
More importantly, however, the Jets need some nitpicking to optimize their lineup. They cannot fall into the trap of thinking they have a playoff spot all locked up just because things are going well right now. The injury bug, which has been relatively light on the Jets this year, could bite at any time, among other things.
The Jets need to put themselves in the best possible position to succeed, and that means icing the best possible lineup. If that means making a couple of minor tweaks after a quick lesson on the road, so be it.
After Rachel Bonds' “Five Mile Lake” had its world premiere in 2014 at South Coast Repertory, news that SCR would be producing Bonds' new “Curve of Departure” this fall was thrilling.
The last time I remember feeling this excited about an opening was in my 1970s childhood, during the build-up to one of the “Star Wars” movies. Bonds' plays lack spaceships, larger-than-life characters and cosmic battles. Some might go so far as to say they lack drama. Like “Five Mile Lake,” “Curve of Departure” focuses on ordinary people trying their best to behave well in unglamorous circumstances. They're not fighting evil; they're having tough days, negotiating delicate, unseen emotions in small rooms. Their tragedies and life-and-death decisions are folded into the creases of thoroughly mundane activities.
A high proportion of exposition to action lives in these works, which are still evolving, and which occasionally falter. Still, by the end “Curve of Departure,” just as with “Five Mile Lake,” I felt as though I had taken a journey with people I knew well.
“Curve of Departure” is set in an airport hotel room in Santa Fe, N.M., brought to life on a set by Lauren Helpern. It's a little cramped for the four people obliged by circumstances to spend the night there: 80-year-old Rudy; their 50-ish daughter-in-law, Linda; Linda's twentysomething son, Felix; and Felix's boyfriend, Jackson. This group would never ordinarily share a bedroom, but as Linda tells them son, “Sometimes when people die you do some weird things.”
They've come for the funeral of Cyrus — Rudy's son, Linda's husband and Felix's father. Cyrus abandoned all three of them years ago, and their sudden death has left them off-balance, struggling to swallow their resentment and brace themselves for a sure-to-be-awkward ordeal with the family they preferred to them.
Upon seeing Rudy and Linda in the room together, they're watching TV in their pajamas while they iron their suit, it's easy to assume at first that they are a couple. Even after it's clear that Rudy was Linda's father-in-law, you can imagine the two of them forming a romantic bond at some point after Rudy's wife died and Linda split with their son. Their conversation conveys a husband-and-wifely rapport: mutually familiar, teasing, affectionate and exasperated. I ultimately concluded that they're meant to have a purely platonic, filial relationship, if in some ways more intimate than marriage.
Rudy, who initially comes across as sharp and feisty, turns out to have health problems — memory loss, incontinence — and Linda cares for them more devotedly than a live-in nurse.
Together Linda and Rudy wait for Felix to arrive from California with their new boyfriend. In a more traditional social-issue drama, Felix's sexuality might be a point of contention. Or maybe the different ethnic backgrounds of this “strange ragtag little group of humans wandering the Earth together,” as Rudy poetically describes them, would provoke conflict: Rudy is Jewish, Linda is African American, Felix is a mixture of the two, and Jackson is Latino. Here, though, these identities are woven so intricately into the family quilt that they barely rate a mention.
Yet even people who unhesitatingly accept one another, Bonds suggests here, do worry, disagree and keep secrets out of love — and these realistic conflicts can clutter up a room quickly (as does, from time to time, the heavy-handed melodrama). Although I found director Mike Donahue's pace a little sluggish at moments, I was impressed by how fully they have encouraged their cast members to inhabit their roles.
Kim Staunton brings the richly drawn Linda to worried, brave, vulnerable life, while Alan Miller invests Rudy with a poignant and endearing whimsy. Larry Powell, who was such a delight last spring in the Geffen Playhouse's “The Legend of Georgia McBride,” here struggles a bit to fit their powerful stage presence into the slightly underwritten Felix. Christian Barillas, hilarious as Ronaldo on “Modern Family,” seems similarly hampered by the earnest, expository Jackson. Still the four actors work together well, discovering the subtle humor in Bonds' writing.
Bonds' characters find solace in nature, an unseen Southwest terrain memorably conjured by Scott Zielinski's gorgeous lights. “Curve of Departure” is a play that sneaks up on you instead of bashing you on the head, and I'm still thinking about it.

Adam Rosenthal, a water quality analyst with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, has reached a plea deal with prosecutors in the Flint water crisis case and is expected appear in court as early as Tuesday, The Detroit News has learned.
A source close to the investigation said Rosenthal is expected before 67th District Court Judge Jennifer Manley to enter a no contest plea to a misdemeanor charge. It wasn't clear what the misdemeanor charge was.
Rosenthal was originally charged with misconduct in office, neglect of duty and tampering with evidence, which could have resulted in possible time in prison and a fine if convicted.
Attempts to reach Rosenthal's attorney James Burdick were unsuccessful. Flood declined to comment to The News.
Rosenthal is the fourth defendant to cut a plea deal with Special Prosecutor Todd Flood and the second state official to reach an agreement.  They are the first DEQ official to make a plea deal.
Rosenthal was warned by Flint Water Plant officials they were not ready for operations when the city decided to switch from the Detroit water system to the Flint River in April 2014.
Rosenthal also was warned by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that high levels of lead are usually due to particulate lead, an indication of a corrosion problem. A task force appointed by Gov. Rick Snyder said in a March 2016 report that the failure to use corrosion control chemicals in the river water resulted in lead leaching from the city's old pipelines.
In 2015, Rosenthal allegedly helped manipulate lead testing results and falsely reported they were below the federal action level of 15 parts per billion.
The state acknowledged high lead levels in the city's children in late September 2015 and switched back in mid-October 2015 to the Detroit area water system, now called the Great Lakes Water Authority.
Lead testing this year has found that Flint's results have consistently been below the federal action level of 15 parts per billion. But the state has maintained advisories against drinking Flint's water until all of the city's lead lines have been replaced.
Three others entered pleas in connection with the scandal:
■Former Flint utilities administrator Michael Glasgow pleaded guilty in May to a reduced charge of willful neglect of duty, a one-year misdemeanor. Sentencing for Glasgow was set aside as long as they cooperate with the ongoing investigation by Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette.
■Corinne Miller, who retired as director of the state's bureau of epidemiology earlier this year, pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of neglect of duty in office in exchange for providing information to investigators.
Miller originally was charged with failing to respond properly to an early report that city children were affected by lead contamination in Flint and instructing state health employees to delete emails pertaining to the report. They were sentenced to one year of probation in March.
■In late November, former Flint utilities director Daugherty Johnson pleaded no contest to failing to give water documents to a Genesee County Health Department employee investigating a possible connection between Flint water and Legionnaires' disease outbreaks that eventually killed 12 and sickened 79 others in the Flint area in 2014-15. The deal resulted in two felonies being conditionally dropped in exchange for their cooperation.

Disappointment and English ODI cricket is a pairing as iconic as fish and chips, gin and tonic or Bert and Ernie and on Wednesday, after a brief two-year hiatus, the estranged couple was reunited under a beating Welsh sun.
It was of course not supposed to be like this. England, following their last ODI tournament humiliation had put the bad old days behind them and, rebuilt in Eoin Morgan's swashbuckling image, were meant to be on course to sweep all before them.
Now though they find themselves making new plans for the weekend. Now they can be nothing more than spectators for Sunday's final.
With Pakistan deciding that this tournament was the perfect time to dust off tired, old stereotypes, more mercurial than a leaky thermometer, as they fluctuated between abysmal and unplayable — sometimes in the same over — so too did England, producing a hapless ODI performance that could have easily served as a touching homage to tournaments past.
England's strength since the last World Cup, and the miraculous beating heart of their reanimated ODI corpse, has been their formidable batting, posting score after score of 300+ and chasing similar totals down with an assuredness that felt as un-English as standing on the wrong side of the escalator on the London Underground.
But in Cardiff, facing their first knockout game since the start of the Trevor Bayliss revolution, when it really mattered they found their powder damp, spluttering to a modest total of 211 with only the odd grumble about used wickets and the enthusiastic cheers of Pakistan's supporters for company.
Just as South Africa could probably register the choke as a national cricketing trademark, so too did this performance have the distinctive stink of a good old fashioned English bottling — subtly different from the choke which at least requires victory to seem within reach.
Here as if it required too much effort, England dispensed with ever looking like they might win the match and instead skipped almost straight to hopelessly throwing it away. Not one part of their much-vaunted batting lineup fired, even Jonny Bairstow armed with all the luck that had deserted the man they replaced, Jason Roy, and extremely fortunate not to lose their wicket about half a dozen times, could only muster 43.
Faced with the sort of pitch they aren't used to and a fired-up Pakistan bowling attack led by the indomitable Hasan Ali and featuring an ice-cool debut from Rumman Raees, England looked tentative and hopelessly unable to react to the situation playing out before them — and now deservedly find themselves out of their own tournament.
Despite the fairly abject performance just at the crucial moment, it should not be all doom and gloom for Morgan's men. After all, if the last two years have taught us anything then it is that England can learn from chastening tournament exits better than most — without the debacle of 2015 would any of this have been possible?
For now then this is just one more chapter in English cricket's timeless relationship with disappointment. A romance still going strong after all these years.

The federal government says the Canadian public broadly supports the tight regulations it has proposed for marijuana packaging, which will include a bright red stop sign emblazoned with a pot leaf and the letters THC.
Health Canada unveiled the results Monday of a 60-day consultation around its proposed regulations, in which it emphasized a focus on reducing the appeal of marijuana to youth and preventing accidental consumption.
The proposed regulations would require logos to be a single colour, with no metallic or fluorescent finishes. Packages would have to be opaque and child-resistant, with a bright yellow health warning similar to those used on tobacco products.
“We are taking a public health approach to legalizing and regulating cannabis, and we are committed to keeping cannabis out of the hands of children and youth,” Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor said in a statement.
“Measures such as the packaging and labelling requirements announced today will help to achieve this goal.”
READ MORE: Legal marijuana won't hit shelves before August
Packaging would also have to describe how much active ingredient is contained in the product, including THC and cannabidiol.
Cannabis legislation is currently before Parliament and none of the regulations are final until approved by legislators. Once approved, the restrictions will apply immediately to recreational marijuana, while a Health Canada official says medical marijuana packaging will be granted a six-month window to comply.
The consultation received more than 3,200 online submissions and 450 written responses, as well as input from health and law enforcement experts, governments, patient advocates and industry representatives.
Health Canada also proposed two new categories of small-scale producers — micro-cultivators and micro-processors — where lower-level security requirements would apply to businesses that grow or process smaller amounts of marijuana.
Micro-cultivators would be allowed to grow marijuana with a plant canopy of 200 square metres, which Health Canada described as equivalent to half the space between the blue lines on a standard Canadian hockey rink.
Legislation to legalize recreational marijuana is currently before the Senate, with the federal government hoping to see it passed and given royal assent by early July.

The Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi has been a star in a number of Spanish-speaking countries for since the late '90s. (Fun fact: Fonsi is a 39-year-old family man who used to be in a pre-NSYNC group with Joey Fatone.) And “Despacito,” Fonsi's reggaeton ballad with Daddy Yankee, was a massive international phenomenon even before Justin Bieber jumped on a remix and turned it into the first mostly-Spanish American #1 single in decades. But even after the ascendance of “Despacito,” Fonsi had never appeared on American TV before last night.
Fonsi, performing without Bieber or Daddy Yankee, was the musical guest on last night's episode of Conan. Instead of their collaborators, Fonsi had a troupe of dancers with him. And even though the song sounds weird without Yankee's exuberant verses, Fonsi is still a beautiful singer, and the song is just great.

Polish judge Malgorzata Gersdorf walked into the Supreme Court building on Wednesday morning, defying new legislation forcing them to retire as court president and putting the judiciary on a collision course with the government.
Hundreds of supporters chanting “constitution” and singing the Polish national anthem surrounded them at the entrance as they told reporters: “My presence here is not about politics, I am here to protect the rule of law.”
The legislation is at the centre of mounting conflict between Warsaw's ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) and the European Union, which accuses the government of trying to control the judiciary and subvert democratic standards.
Under the new rules, which came into effect at midnight, up to a third of Supreme Court judges, including 65-year-old Gersdorf, could be forced to retire unless they are granted an extension by President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally.

The nationalist ruling party argues its legal overhaul is needed to shake up a judicial system it says is steeped in communist-era thinking and power structures.
“Each EU state has the right to shape their legal system according to their own traditions,” Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Wednesday.
But Gersdorf, who has been the president of the Supreme Court since 2014, has said they believe the legislation is unconstitutional and cannot be implemented.
After addressing the crowd, they entered the building in central Warsaw. Court officials said they went into a meeting with other judges and would address the media at 12.30 p.m. local time.
Pro-democracy protesters who massed outside the court on Tuesday waving EU and Polish flags said they would stage more rallies across the country on Wednesday.
In Warsaw, people were gathering around the presidential palace. Lech Walesa, the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and former president credited with bringing down communism, was expected to join them later in the day.
“We are moving towards a dictatorship,” said Joanna Tworog, a 65-year-old webmaster in the crowd outside the court.
“What if I have a court case against someone from PiS and they will be able to influence judges. These changes affect me personally.”

Through legislation and personnel changes, PiS has already taken de facto control of much of the judicial system since coming into power in 2015, including the constitutional tribunal and prosecutors, who now report directly to the justice minister.
Critics at home and abroad say the ruling party's policies, which also include tighter control of public media, amount to a shift towards authoritarian rule.
The conflict has isolated Poland within the EU, where most governments are critical, while also exposing the bloc's inability to rein in governments it believes contradict core EU values.
The European Commission opened a fresh legal case against Poland over the Supreme Court changes on Monday, saying that they undermine judicial independence in the largest formerly communist member of the EU.
Warsaw also faces the threat of losing its voting rights in the bloc under a procedure launched late last year in response to the judiciary reforms. Hungary, also facing criticism over democratic standards, has pledged to block such a move.
The eurosceptic PiS government rejects criticism, saying EU treaties do not give Brussels institutions the power to influence national matters such as the judiciary.
“Let me mention a fundamental issue. The court system … is an entirely internal matter,” PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski was quoted as saying by Gazeta Polska newsweekly in an article published on Wednesday.
The party's standing in the polls has held steady at around 40 per cent throughout the dispute, well above any single rival party.

Marijuana is easily one of the world's most controversial plants and, in the U.S., has endured a particularly rocky history.
While smoking marijuana was once viewed as an act of political dissidence against the Vietnam War, today the plant is recognized as an invaluable medicine and smoking-hot commodity that's generated billions of dollars in revenue in states where it is now fully legalized.
Cannabis remains illegal at the federal level and is considered by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) a Schedule 1 drug alongside hero, LSD and ecstasy.
Yet, a total of 29 U.S. states and the District of Columbia now have some form of legalized marijuana; while eight more states — three of which adopted the measure in November 2016, and include California, Nevada and Massachusetts — allow recreational use of the plant.
Regardless of whether or not you support cannabis, there's no ignoring the fact that it's currently undergoing a revolution in the U.S. and is undoubtedly a force to be reckoned with.
Our Founding Fathers and the American History of Cannabis
The above documentary, “The Marijuana Revolution” (2016), details the fascinating journey of marijuana and the various challenges faced by its proponents throughout history. As the film notes, marijuana was once regarded as a harmful and addictive drug used mainly among black jazz musicians and Mexican migrant workers.
Today, the majority of Americans support cannabis either as a medicine, for recreational use or both. Surveys show that at least 4 in 10 Americans have tried marijuana, while nearly 60 percent support full legalization.
A 2013 survey found a majority of physicians — 76 percent — approve of the use of medical marijuana.1 CNN's chief medical correspondent and neurosurgeon Dr. Sanjay Gupta also made a highly publicized reversal on their marijuana stance after the production of their two-part series “Weed,” which aired in 2014.2
So how did this plant, which has been around for centuries, overcome its bad reputation? Perhaps a better question is how did marijuana earn such a bad rap in the first place?
In order to understand the American history of cannabis and its transformation, it's important to start with our Founding Fathers, who cultivated the plant for industrial purposes.
George Washington, for example, is said to have grown more than 100 hemp plants at their home in Mount Vernon, Virginia. Cannabis is called hemp when it's being used for its fibers, which are extracted from the stem and constructed into rope, clothing and paper.
Hemp plants are low in tetrahydrocannabinols (THC) levels and therefore do not get you high.
During the 18th century, hemp was viewed as an important cash crop. It was used for rope by navies around the world, and as a thick durable linen ideal for clothing and packaging heavy materials. Additionally, hemp seed oil was used in soaps, paints and varnishes.
Marijuana Transforms From Being Viewed as a Useful Medicine to Addictive Zombie Drug
As depicted in the film, cannabis eventually grew popular for its medicinal properties and was used for treating many ailments, including insomnia, menstrual cramps, nausea, muscle spams and even depression.
Modern research has only expanded on these health benefits, now recognizing marijuana as an effective treatment for cancer, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and Tourette's syndrome, as well as a host of other diseases.
However, the concept of cannabis as a medicine quickly began to fade when people started using the plant as a recreational drug in the 20th century. Those frightened of marijuana began to demonize it, using provocative terms like “devil weed” and “drug addicted zombies” to deter people from smoking it.
Harry J. Anslinger, a former railroad cop and prohibition agent, was one of the first powerful voices to come out against the plant. They used fear mongering and racism to sway public opinion on cannabis, targeting minorities including African-Americans, Hispanics and Filipinos.
Anslinger described the average marijuana user as being a minority entertainer who relied on the drug to create “[s]atanic music, jazz and swing.” They said the plant caused “white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers and any others.”
In 1963, the U.S. government funded the propaganda film “Reefer Madness,” which warned that using marijuana just once could turn you into a drug-addicted zombie.
The authorities also changed the plant's name and began using the Spanish word “marijuana” in an effort to give it a negative connotation associated with Mexican migrant workers and other minorities. Shortly thereafter, the sale and use of cannabis in the U.S. was made illegal through the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937.
An Act of Political Dissent
Anslinger may have started the war on weed, but President Richard Nixon continued it. While their wife spoke convincingly against marijuana, Nixon persuaded Congress to pass the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, classifying the plant as a Schedule 1 drug.
Divided over the nation's involvement in the Vietnam War, some Americans began smoking weed as an act of political dissent. Subsequently, Nixon retaliated by arresting “pot-smoking Vietnam protesters.”
Slowly but surely, the public once again began changing its views toward marijuana. By the mid- to late '90s, California, Oregon and Maine approved medical cannabis, with Nevada and Colorado following close behind.
Marijuana's Projected Growth Rate Outpaces the Smartphone
In 2012, Colorado became the first U.S. state to fully legalize cannabis, opening the doorway to a realm of unimaginable possibilities in terms of innovation and revenue, ultimately leading to a new pastime embraced by an emerging culture.
Colorado's legal marijuana market quickly flourished, generating up to $100 million a month in revenue just three years after the state approved recreational use, according to the film. The state of Washington saw similar numbers and in 2015 reported earnings of an estimated $1.4 million a day.
That same year, the legal marijuana market was valued at roughly $3 billion, and is predicted to reach $10 billion over the next five years, outpacing the growth rate of smartphones. While the Obama administration promised to stop allocating resources to fight marijuana legalized at the state level, it's illegal classification under federal law that carries both pros and cons for the burgeoning pot market.
A positive is that small mom-and-pop shops have been allowed to thrive, leading the way in product innovation. Legal pot markets are producing a vast array of products including weed-infused coffee, tea, breath mints, candies, cookies, pie and many other edibles.
Some innovators are even trying to create a global pot brand called “Marley Natural,” while others have established Yelp-like sites such as Leafly,3 which review and rate dispensaries, as well as various strains of marijuana.
Pot's Illegal Status at the Federal Level Keeps Big Business at Bay
Because cannabis remains a Schedule 1 drug at the federal level, it cannot legally be transported across state lines. As a result, the development of centralized growing and processing plants aimed at achieving nationwide distribution have been stalled.
This has deterred Big Business including Big Pharma, Big Tobacco and Big Agriculture from entering the lucrative marijuana market. But that doesn't mean they aren't thinking about it. Legal marijuana is proving to be more valuable than several of our nation's most widely produced crops. For example, one acre of marijuana is worth 2,000 times more than tobacco, 13,000 times more than corn and nearly 43,000 times more than soybeans, reveals the film.
A Cash-Only Business
One of the biggest cons of marijuana being illegal at the federal level is the fact that it forces pot operations into an all-cash business. Banks are federally regulated, which means marijuana businesses are prohibited from depositing their money into banks. They cannot perform credit card transactions either.
Having to manage and store significant amounts of money in cash is not only a headache, but incredibly risky, as it makes marijuana businesses more susceptible to theft. Another major con is that pot companies in Colorado must maintain around-the-clock surveillance. Whether they're watering plants or packaging product, employees in the marijuana business are always on camera — a requirement some describe as intrusive.
In the documentary, cannabis entrepreneur Daniel Curylo, owner of Cascade Crops, says that the surveillance makes them feel like a second-class citizen. “We're a bunch of regular guys who work like 10,11 or 12 hours a day, every day. We pay our taxes. We're good people,” they said.
Pot's status as a Schedule 1 drug means that state marijuana operations are regulated like an illegal enterprise. However, despite the obstacles, legal marijuana has still managed to go mainstream, transforming the way Americans view and use cannabis.
Legalizing Medical Marijuana Could Help Control Opioid Epidemic
The worst effect marijuana can have on us is a hazy or slightly catatonic feeling, according to current research noted in the film. But the plant remains far less addictive than alcohol, cocaine, heroin and cigarettes, and may even be useful in curbing America's growing opioid epidemic.
In fact, recent research found that medical marijuana lowers prescription drug use. The video below features W. David Bradford, Ph.D., whose study was published in the journal Health Affairs earlier this month.4 As reported by The Washington Post:5
“[R]esearchers at the University of Georgia scoured the database of all prescription drugs paid for under Medicare Part D from 2010 to 2013. They found that, in the 17 states with a medical-marijuana law in place by 2013, prescriptions for painkillers and other classes of drugs fell sharply compared with states that did not have a medical-marijuana law.
The drops were quite significant: In medical-marijuana states, the average doctor prescribed 265 fewer doses of antidepressants each year, 486 fewer doses of seizure medication, 541 fewer anti-nausea doses and 562 fewer doses of anti-anxiety medication. But most strikingly, the typical physician in a medical-marijuana state prescribed 1,826 fewer doses of painkillers in a given year.”
According to Bradford, the Medicare program could save $468 million per year if marijuana were legalized in all U.S. states.6,7 Already, $165 million was saved in 2013 in the 18 states where medical marijuana was legal that year.

Barcelona: Barcelona denied on Wednesday that they illegally bought a transplant liver for their former defender Eric Abidal.
Contacted by AFP, a Barcelona court said it had investigated a possible crime of organ trafficking for more than a year before deciding not to proceed because of a lack of evidence.
"FC Barcelona roundly deny any irregularity in the matter," the club said in a statement in English on their website.
Abidal, a former France international, received a liver transplant in April 2012 at the Hospital Clinic in Barcelona and resumed their playing career a year later before retiring in 2014.
The Eric Abidal foundation also issued a "categorical denial" of any "irregularities in the treatment of their illness".
On Wednesday morning, online newspaper El Confidencial reported that a telephone tap of former club president Sandro Rosell, suggested that the club illegally acquired a liver for the player.
Rossell is due to face trial on charges of money laundering in connection with Brazilian TV rights sales and was also investigated for the deal which brought Neymar to Barcelona.
Abidal, who is 38, was named Barcelona's sport director in June.
"The club are saddened by the lack of rigour in the spreading of such information about such a sensitive issue," said the Barcelona statement.
The clinic and the Spanish organ donation organisation (ONT) both issued statements denying any wrong-doing, although ONT added that it had opened an internal investigation.
Police are looking for a suspect in an armed robber that took place early Monday morning, August 14, 2017. Around 3:13 a.m. police were called to the Circle K Gas Station, located at 2210 Locust St. Police say the suspect had what looked like a handgun during the robbery.
 They are described as a male, around 5'6", slim build, wearing gray colored pants and a black colored coat.
Anyone with information is asked to call Sterling Police at 815-632-6640 of Whiteside Crimestoppers at 815-625-7876.

Chorley recorded their first away win in the National League North since January 7 to boost their play-off prospects thanks to a priceless goal from skipper Andy Teague.
Teague struck the killer blow midway through the first half to secure the Magpies' second 1-0 win of the Bank Holiday weekend.
Chorley opened brightly and following a poor clearance from the goalkeeper Jake Cottrell had a shot kicked off the Celtic line.
For Stalybridge James Roberts angled a good effort just past the far post before the Magpies were unlucky not to go in front when Dale Whitham's 20-yard rocket crashed down off the underside of the bar.
Chorley did go ahead on the half-hour when from Whitham's cleverly placed free-kick Teague looped a header beyond keeper Grant Shenton into the far corner.
Roberts continued to threaten for Celtic firing just past the far post and then heading inches over following an Andy Bishop flick-on.
But at the other Marcus Carver broke through and tried to bend a shot beyond Shenton, only for the keeper to palm the ball aside at full stretch.
Whitham had an early shot charged down after the break but there were few signs of a goal at either end though Chorley keeper Ritchie Branagan did pull off one fine save diving to their right to parry a shot from Celtic sub Christian Platts.
The Magpies' well-marshalled defence saw out the closing stages comfortably enough to take a step closer to the play-offs.
Another late show from striker Matt Blinkhorn rescued a crucial point for top-of-the-table AFC Fylde in a feisty encounter against Bradford Park Avenue at Mill Farm.
The visitors took a surprise lead when Danny Boshell netted from close range in the first half.
However ,substitute Blinkhorn spared Fylde's blushes with their second 97th-minute equaliser the space of a month.
The Coasters saw their lead at the top of the National League North cut to four points following Kidderminster Harriers' victory at Altrincham.
But three points at Boston United on Saturday would guarantee the title for AFC Fylde.

Bengaluru: Days after their remarks that they were at the "mercy" of the Congress and not the people drew flak, Karnataka Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy on Wednesday described Congress president Rahul Gandhi as a "Punyatma" (good soul).
#WATCH: At meeting with farmer leaders, #Karnataka CM HD Kumaraswamy speaks on farmers' loan waiver, says, 'Without the blessing of people, but only with blessing of Rahul Gandhi, we've come to power. I'll convince Congress party, but I can only take decision once they approve.' pic.twitter.com/VQiNuPA9oN — ANI (@ANI) May 30, 2018
"Today even though I don't have the blessings of people, Punyatma Rahul Gandhi placing trust in me has given the power. We have got a good opportunity. I will do it. They will not oppose, I will convince him," Kumaraswamy said.
"Taking them (Rahul Gandhi) into confidence, I will have to come to a decision," they said, as they tried to pacify farmers during their meeting with farmers' organisations regarding farm loan waiver.
"You (farmers) have a golden opportunity, utilise it, and stand with us. When election comes vote whomever you want....but utilise this opportunity," they added.
This comment from the Chief Minister comes days after their remarks that they were at the "mercy" of the Congress and not the people drew flak from different quarters, including the opposition Bhartiya Janta Party.
Going into damage control mode on their "mercy" remark, Kumaraswamy said they never meant to show disrespect to the people of the state.
"What I meant was so long as they (Congress) support me I can continue. So, whatever programmes we have to pursue, I will be at the mercy of Congress."
There is good understanding between them and Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara of the Congress, Kumaraswamy told farmers, adding, there will not be any difference between them, and the government will be "stable".
"If some one wants to remove (the government), we will not allow it to happen easily. We too understand politics to an extent. We will run this government," they added.
Reiterating their government's commitment for the cause of farmers, the Chief Minister said "all your wishes will be fulfilled, but give us time."
This development has come at a time when there is still no clarity on the cabinet expansion in the state, amid reports about lack of consensus between coalition partners, Congress and JD(S), over key portfolio allocation, especially Finance.

Bosan lauds US help in water, soil projects
ISLAMABAD (Staff Reporter): ICARDA is implementing United States sponsored projects on water and soil in Pakistan in close collaboration with the research and development institutions of the country. Minister for Food Security and Research Sikandar Hayat Bosan, chairing a meeting, said project of water rehabilitating and best soil fertility and soil health management technologies for farmers is a generous assistance to Pakistan by the US Government. They said Pakistan's fertility and health of soil is deteriorated because of low organic matter and unfavorable cultivation practices intensive tillage practices and removal or burning of crop residue, as a result productivity of our land is low. Acting chairperson, PARC said unsustainable management practices in Pakistan have damaged soil fertility and health and there is need to suggest measures through soil testing advisory services for the improvement of soil fertility using suitable fertilizers and avoiding extra expenditure and to control the salinity and diagnose the soil problem and advise the farmers for its reclamation through suitable amendments.
Dr Abdul Majid, Country Manager, ICARDA, Dr Ghulam Muhammad Ali, Director General NARC and David Williams, USDA also spoke on the occasion and appreciated the efforts of Pakistani scientists for their remarkable achievements in land, water research and development.
The main purpose of US sponsored projects is to increase crop production, soil health, water use efficiency and conservation through diffusion and adoption of technologies and practices by farming communities.
Maize seeds provided to farmers in Orakzai Agency
ISLAMABAD (INP): Distribution of certified maize seed packages to 3,750 farmer families in Orakzai agency of FATA has begun. FAO, under its Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) project, is providing 20kg of maize seeds to each household. Untoward security situation had forced these farmers to abandon their homes and agricultural land. Now as the families continue to return to their homes, these seeds will enable the newly returned farmers to resume production of the staple crop. The distribution of seeds will revitalize farming in the area and also become a source of improving food and nutrition security of vulnerable farmers and their families most of whom are located in remote villages of the agency. FAO and WFP are jointly implementing the CERF project that targets Orakzai, Kurram and South Waziristan agencies in FATA. 456, 901 returnees to the three agencies will benefit from the relief food assistance combined with emergency agriculture and livestock support.
The project under CERF funding is aligned with CERF Life Saving Criteria as it is aiming at providing timely critical recovery support to those in immediate need of help to meet their food and nutrition requirements and initiate agro-based livelihood activities in the affected areas.

High interest rate to affect export-oriented SME sector: FCCI
FAISALABAD (INP): President of Faisalabad Chamber of Commerce & Industry (FCCI) Shabbir Hussain Chawla, expressing concerns over increase in policy rate of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), has warned that it will have negative repercussions particularly on the export-oriented small & medium enterprises (SME) sector. Commenting on the monetary policy for next two months, Shabbir Hussain Chawla said on Wednesday that policy rate has been upped to 6.5% which will now provide costly loans to the SME and private sectors which are deemed as growth engine of national economy. They told that the SME sector was already starved of loans and now the increase in policy rates will further enhance their cost of production and hence, they would be unable to compete with their competitors from different countries. They said that costly loans will further increase the cost of production and hence, our exportable surplus would become uncompetitive in the international markets.
They said that the SBP is duty bound to fix the policy rate after every two months. The policy rate is determined in view of the overall economic and monetary health of the country, they said.
NOW that's a bit too close for comfort.
A Northern Rivers man had this very close encounter with a shark - and in extremely shallow water.
Finn Ward was at New Brighton for a "spot of beach worming" about 1.30pm yesterday when they "ran into this guy".
They said they thought the shark was about 2m long, but wasn't sure what type it was.
But it was in knee-deep water, with waves crashing over it, debunking the myth that sharks don't venture into whitewater.
"Pretty ordinary footage unfortunately, but between dodging them (the shark), the glare and a cracked iPhone screen, I was pretty occupied," they said.
"I've never seen one so close to shore but seen a heap around in the water surfing.
"It's the time of year, I think.
"Mullet are running, the whales are migrating, the water cools and there is a lot of sea life around.
tThey say the mullet run from Anzac Day so from them until The whales head back is the time you see them mostly."
Mr Ward posted the footage of the shark on the Brunswick Heads Community Page on Facebook, where it has already been shared more than 170 times.
Rescue workers assisted by Thai navy SEALs started teaching some members of a young soccer team and their coach how to swim and dive Wednesday, nearly two weeks after they became trapped in a cave in northern Thailand.
The boys, aged 11-16, and their 25-year-old coach, have been stranded deep inside the Tham Luang Nang Non cave in Thailand's Chiang Rai province for 12 days. They disappeared after they went exploring after a soccer game on June 23 and were found by rescue divers late Monday.
But risky conditions including volatile water levels, challenging terrain and heavy rains forecast for the weekend have complicated plans to safely extract them.
Some of the boys do not know how to swim and flooding in the caves means the boys would likely have to dive to be able to escape, which rescue experts have said could be extremely dangerous, especially for people with no experience of scuba gear.
Thai media reported that the boys have been practicing using dive masks and other equipment but have not yet tried them out in water.
"The water is very strong and space is narrow. Extracting the children takes a lot of people," Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan told reporters in Thailand on Wednesday. "Now we are teaching the children to swim and dive," they said.
They added that if the high water levels fell, the team would be taken out quickly.
The British divers who found the squad said it took three hours to reach them, as they faced fast-moving currents and had to pull themselves along cave walls.
The boys and their coach were trapped in the cave by a sudden influx of water.
Chiang Rai provincial Gov. Narongsak Osatanakorn, the Thai official overseeing the rescue operation, said Wednesday that "all 13 may not come out at the same time. If the condition is right and if that person is ready 100%, they can come out."
But Narongsak said rescue teams are still looking for other ways to rescue the boys, such as locating alternative routes into the cave's network of narrow passageways.
Some cave rescue experts have said it would be safer to keep the team supplied with essential food and medicine where they are for now and wait for the water levels to recede. However, that approach could take months, as Thailand's monsoon season usually lasts through October. It's also possible that conditions inside the cave could change. The boys were located taking shelter on a ledge surrounded by water more than a mile from the cave's main entrance, and about half a mile below the surface.
Still, the boys and their coach reported that they were in good health in a brief video released Wednesday on the Thai navy SEALs Facebook page.
The SEALs, including medics, are staying with the team inside the cave and the boys are mostly in a stable condition after having received high-protein drinks.
The one-minute video shows the team together with the SEALs inside the darkened cave. While the boys are visibly thin, they appear to be in good spirits as they introduce themselves one-by-one to the camera. In the video, as a light is shone on each boy's face they address the camera with head bowed and hands clasped together in a Thai prayer-like greeting known as "wai." A few of the boys appear to be wearing soccer jerseys from international teams. One of them resembles the one worn by the England soccer squad in its Tuesday night World Cup victory over Colombia in Moscow.
At one point in the video, the boys laugh in response to an apparent joke made by a member of the rescue team. Experts have said that looking after the boys' mental health will be key to ensuring they are able to safely take part in any rescue plan.
Thai authorities said they are working to install an Internet cable to the cave so that the parents of the boys can talk to their children. "It's like they have been given a new life," Kian Kamluang, whose 16-year-old son Pornchai is inside the cave, told the Associated Press. They said she'll never let their son go into a cave or near water again.
The longest time anyone has survived while trapped underground is 69 days, according to Guinness World Records. In that incident, all 33 Chilean miners — known as the "33 of San Jose" — made it safely back to the surface via a rescue capsule after they were trapped 2,257 ft below the surface after the collapse of a mine near Copiapo, Chile, in August 2010. The gold-copper mine collapsed after an earthquake.

PESHAWAR, July 04 (APP):Caretaker Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Justice (retd) Dost Muhammad Khan and caretaker Federal Minister for Information, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Syed Ali Zafar Wednesday agreed to the overall rehabilitation and reconstruction of newly merged districts of erstwhile FATA into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
They also agreed to install an efficient governance structure, giving quick relief to the people of Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and more importantly bringing them into the national stream.
The minister briefed the chief minister on the quick measures, transfer of resources from the federal government to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, legal irritants, constitutional position, proposed exemption of FATA from federal and provincial taxes and collective responsibility for the infrastructure development in the newly merged districts.
The federal government would be recommended certain incentives, relief and expeditious transfer of resources for the overall recovery plan for rehabilitation and reconstruction of the newly merged districts, they assured.
They assured that the federal and the provincial governments were on the same page for removing the legal lacunas and irritants that might obstruct smooth transition of mainstreaming the tribal people.
The chief minister said their government took a number of decisions to discourage unnecessary use of resources.
They said the tribal people suffered heavily and the government had to move for quick relief to win them back. Their government had already started working on preparing a plan for the infrastructure development and more importantly the quick rehabilitation of tribal people.
They had already set up a task force, which was working round the clock to remove lacunas in the law, making it compatible with the ground realities in tribal areas.
The chief minister said the government was making all out efforts to extend efficient services to the tribal areas and ensure their accessibility to the people. The extension of the jurisdiction of provincial offices to the new districts and giving proper training to the officers to be posted there have also been planned.
They stressed that no lacuna should be left as the same might be exploited by the miscreants. Mainstreaming the tribals should be the most focused area, they added.
The two sides agreed on continuation of the Riwaj system, besides extension of legal procedures, along with Lungi and provision of monthly stipend to Ulema. The rehabilitation and the recovery plan should take into account the interest of all segments of the society, they added.
The abrupt removal of system already in vogue could disturb the situation in the region and might also overburden the legal course, they observed.

Imran Khan should face the same process of accountability that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and their family had already faced.
While talking to newsmen outside the accountability court here, Captain Safdar said ,”We are still appearing in the courts as we respect the rule of law and the constitution”.
Terming Imran Khan as “fake captain”, they said “I am a genuine military captain whereas Imran is a fake tracksuit captain”.
Captain Safdar said if the PML-N political opponents had turned it into a political battle, no one can fight it better than PML-N.”
In a lighter mood, they said, “we played before and now it was turn of opponents to face courts, adding that “we will not let Imran Khan to escape.”
They further said Imran Khan never took the courts seriously. They said Imran Khan is dreaming to become prime minister in the general elections 2018, however their dreams would never come true and they will stay on roads till 2030.
There's a thing called “The Golden Ratio”, and it goes all the way back to ancient Greece. It's a standard of beauty based on the ratio of Phi, which is 1.618.
Basically, it comes down to all the stuff on your face . . . your nose, mouth, eyes, eyebrows, etc . . . and the various distances between them.
Someone applied the Golden Ratio to all the actors who've played Bond . . . and Craig came out SIXTH OUT OF SIX. Not surprisingly, SEAN CONNERY came out on top.
Roger Moore is second, followed by the most underrated Bond of them all, Timothy Dalton. Pierce Brosnan came in fourth, followed by George Lazenby . . . the only guy who only played Bond ONCE.

Three men have been charged in an alleged plot to bomb Times Square.
A Canadian citizen inspired by Islamic State to create “the next 9/11” and two other men plotted to attack Times Square and the New York City subway system with bombs and a shooting rampage during the Muslim holiday of Ramadan last year, according to federal charges unsealed Friday.
Abdulrahman El-Bahnasawy, 19, of Mississauga, Canada, bought bomb-making materials and studied maps of the subway system, but the planned attacks were thwarted by an undercover FBI agent who was posing online as an Islamic State sympathizer, the charges said.
El-Bahnasawy was arrested in May 2016 and has already pleaded guilty.
Also charged were Talha Haroon, 19, a U.S. citizen living in Pakistan, and Russell Salic, 37, of the Philippines, who allegedly wired $423 to help finance the plot. Both have been arrested and are awaiting extradition to the U.S., authorities said.
According to the charges, El-Bahnasawy and Haroon declared their support for Islamic State and were inspired by deadly terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels.
“We seriously need a car bomb at times square …. look at those crowds of people!” El-Bahnasawy said in one message to the undercover agent, according to court papers. They also expressed a desire to “shoot up concerts because they kill a lot of people.”
“We just walk in with guns in our hands. That's how the Paris guys did it,” they wrote, according to the charges.
They bought bomb-making materials in Canada, including about 40 pounds of hydrogen peroxide, which can be used to make a powerful explosive, along with batteries, Christmas lights and thermometers.
Haroon said that Times Square was “a perfect place to hit them.” They added, “I wanna kill … them in thousands,” the charges state.
But Haroon never made it to the United States, and El-Bahnasawy was arrested as soon as they arrived in New Jersey from Canada.
Salic, who told the undercover agent that they longed to go to Syria and join Islamic State there, actually wired the money into a government account.
There is no sign that the terrorist group participated in the planning. But the charges said Haroon and El-Bahnasawy claimed approval from an Islamic State cell in Pakistan.
The three are charged with multiple terrorism offenses, including conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction and support of a terrorist organization.
El-Bahnasawy has pleaded guilty to seven charges and will be sentenced on Dec. 12.
QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) - Three suicide bombers attacked Pakistani police and paramilitary soldiers in the southwestern city of Quetta on Tuesday, killing six police and wounding 15 members of the security forces, officials said.
One bomber detonated their explosives near a police truck, provincial police chief Moazzam Jah Ansari said. Seven police officers were wounded in that attack.
“It is a suicide attack, and we have a confirmation that six of our police officials are dead,” Ansari told Reuters.
Half an hour earlier, two suicide bombers tried to attack a paramilitary checkpoint on the city's outskirts, but troops deployed there engaged them, a paramilitary officer said.
They said the troops had opened fire at the attackers, who detonated their explosives, wounding eight soldiers. Both the suicide bombers died, they said on condition of anonymity because the army was due to issue an official statement.
No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks.
Quetta is the capital city of the southwestern province of Baluchistan, which has been plagued by violence.
Islamist militants linked to the Taliban, al Qaeda and Islamic State have been operating in the province, which borders Iran as well as Afghanistan. It also has an indigenous ethnic Baloch insurgency fighting the central government.
Islamic State has created a branch in Pakistan and Afghanistan, mostly by recruiting among break away factions of other established militant groups. Its followers have claimed some of Pakistan's most deadly recent attacks.
Six members of Pakistan's tiny Christian minority community, four of them from the same family, and two people from the Shi'ite Muslim minority were gunned down in Quetta this month.
In December two suicide bombers stormed a packed church in southwestern Pakistan, killing at least 10 people and wounding up to 56.
Pakistan a nuclear armed nation of 208 million people has for some time seen a decrease in militant violence, but the Islamists, who want to install their own harsh brand of Islamic law, remain potent.
HIGHLAND HEIGHTS – Two years before Northern Kentucky University's men's basketball team earned the Norse's first trip to the NCAA tournament, endearing itself to basketball fans all over Greater Cincinnati, the team found itself in a very different place.
An internal investigation unveiled a troubling picture: Complaints of sexual coercion. A locker room culture lacking in respect for others and promoting immature behavior.
And “team time.”
“Team time” didn't refer to practice or film study. Instead, “team time” meant players were going after women on campus who made themselves available for sexual favors.
The sexually charged atmosphere came to light at a critical time for the NKU's basketball program. The school was in its second season of Division 1 play; it was about to leave one league and join the Horizon League. The end of that 2015 season would bring the firing of the head coach, although school officials insist their firing had nothing to do with the school's internal investigation.
Athletes having sex is no scandal. But a three-month Enquirer investigation suggests the team's culture produced several allegations — ultimately unproven — of sexual assault.
The problem galvanized the highest-level leaders of the Highland Heights institution. The school's president and athletic director — even the chairperson of the Board of Regents — held meetings on what to do and how to handle what was clearly becoming a headache for the school.
A lawyer involved in a separate federal lawsuit against the school over a sex assault said school brass focused on protecting the basketball team, not the women. School officials say they wanted to make sure the university did the right thing for all involved.
The Enquirer investigation uncovered documents, interview notes and depositions that shed light on the atmosphere in the closing months of the 2014-15 season — as well as the role of top NKU administrators. The Enquirer also interviewed several of those involved, although many declined to comment or did not return messages seeking comment.
Among the findings:
– One woman filed an internal sexual assault complaint with the school against three players toward the end of the 2015 season. This was for allegedly forcing them into sex against their will; they complained that after consenting to sex with one player, two other players joined in for oral sex without permission.
– That investigation led to another woman telling NKU officials that two of those same players also “coerced” them into group sex on Halloween night 2014 under similar circumstances.
– Even though the players were exonerated by an internal school panel, that same three-person panel warned NKU about the team's behavior. “Evidence brought before the panel gave reason for concern,” the email said. “Testimony reveals a culture within the locker room which warrants education and training….We specifically are concerned about a lack of respect for others and an appropriate sense of mature behavior,” the panel wrote in the email to NKU's Senior Associate Dean of Students Ann James.
– None of the players themselves missed any playing time during the investigation nor for the “culture” issue. The players were suspended from team activities for an unspecified amount of time that following offseason, the school said when the incident first came to light last fall.
The revelations come as sexual misconduct by other college athletes and coaches and the response of university administrators — or lack of response — has been in the national spotlight.
The president and football coach at Baylor University were both fired last year after it was disclosed they knew about sexual assaults by football players, who faced no discipline.
The NCAA is investigating the University of Louisville's basketball program after it was disclosed that an assistant coach paid prostitutes and strippers to perform for recruits while visiting the Louisville campus.
No one has alleged NKU's problems rose to that level. And school leaders say they have since required new sexual assault awareness training for every athlete, in all sports.
But the new details come during a meteoric rise for the program. Under new coach John Brannen, the Norse shocked the conference by winning the tournament and earning a bid to March Madness — where they put up a strong showing against national power University of Kentucky.
How this started: a claim of sexual coercion
On the night of Jan. 3, 2015, an unnamed woman apparently agreed to have sex with an NKU player after a night of drinking. In a series of text messages before that night, the player had asked them to participate in “a threesome,” which they declined.
What happened next is up for dispute — but it provided the spark for what would later become a top-level priority for NKU leaders.
The woman said that two of the player's teammates joined in against their will, making them perform oral sex in an NKU dorm room. The players said it was all consensual, even though the woman denied that in a text to one of the players afterward: “I did not agree to it. Yes we were all drunk,” the woman texted.
None of the players involved with the alleged assaults are still on the team, having either exhausted their eligibility or graduated. The Enquirer is not naming them because they were exonerated by the school's internal complaint system and never criminally prosecuted. The woman also is not being named as they filed a sexual-assault claim. None of the players accused of the assault nor the woman who filed the complaint returned several messages left by The Enquirer over several months.
Many details were included in documents and depositions given in a separate unrelated federal Title IX sexual assault lawsuit set for trial this summer, as well as through documents obtained by The Enquirer through open records requests.
A Resident Advisor learned of the incident and, as required by school policy, reported it to NKU officials. The woman eventually told their story to school administrators in late February, starting the official internal process that led to an investigation and a hearing before an internal panel. (This was not a criminal proceeding, and documents do not indicate why the woman chose not to pursue criminal charges with the police).
That investigation also led to officials interviewing another woman. They offered a similar story, involving two of the same players. On Halloween night in 2014, they agreed to have sex with one of them and the other “coerced” them into oral sex. The notes do not indicate why they didn't pursue either administrative or criminal charges.
High-level school officials got involved from the start. They considered suspending the players immediately after the complaint came in — but didn't.
Dennis Repenning was the chairperson of NKU's Board of Regents at the time. They declined an interview, but in a written statement, they acknowledged they were involved in early discussions about how to handle the situation.
Repenning said they argued successfully to hold off on an immediate suspension. They wanted to ensure the players had due process. They were also worried a suspension would alert them to a pending investigation, possibly allowing them to cooperate on cover stories.
“I didn't think we should immediately suspend,” Repenning wrote The Enquirer. “We could do a better job of that if we got them back on campus … set up separate and immediate informal hearings for each of the players, and issue no-contact orders between the players and the alleged victims.”
Repenning said administrators got the woman's OK on their plans to make sure they felt “safe.”
The players were ultimately found “not responsible” for the alleged assault.
But the situation still prompted the email from the three-person panel made up of a faculty member, a member of the school's administration and a student. It was sent immediately after the ruling about the players in April 2015 to the associate dean of students.
‘Team time' becomes known to school officials
The email referenced the culture in the locker room at the time, an indirect nod to “team time.”
Documents from the panel's investigation refer to “team time” several times. School officials even queried the woman as well as their roommate about it. Apparently, it meant that players had some women available for sex on campus. (Documents do not indicate how many of the 15-man roster was involved nor about how many women participated.)
The school's assistant athletic director Leslie Fields testified to the issue in a deposition in the separate lawsuit. They said the multiple reported sexual incidents involving those players struck them as significant and some details concerned them
“These boys have a lot of sexual conquests, or have had several,” testified Fields, who oversees NCAA compliance and Title IX issues for NKU athletics.
How much did the coaching staff know? Former assistant Kevin Schappell testified in a deposition in the other case that neither they nor others knew anything about “team time.”
Former head coach Dave Bezold declined comment through their agent. They have not been called to give a deposition in the separate federal lawsuit.
‘We wanted to make sure everything was done right'
Top administrators got involved as soon as the RA reported the incident in late February.
The first meeting involved no less than the chairperson of the university's Board of Regents, the university president and the athletic director. Records show at least two more meetings called by President Geoff Mearns.
In an interview with The Enquirer, the current chairperson of the board of regents, Rich Boehne, said NKU's top brass was only involved because “we're talking about the high-profile basketball team here.”
“We wanted to make sure everything was done right,” Boehne said. “There is clearly no cover-up here. I am very comfortable with the way this was all handled.”
NKU president Mearns, a former federal prosecutor, said in their deposition released earlier this year that they paid close attention to the case to ensure all “the proper policies and procedures were followed.”
But the lawyer representing the woman suing the school in that separate federal case says the investigation into the players' incident shows how inconsistently the school handles sexual violence. Kevin Murphy says it took months before their client — who says they were raped as a first-year student by a student who was allowed to stay on campus and violate their no-contact orders — got a face-to-face meeting with Mearns over their concerns in their case.
“Why would Mearns get so heavily involved in this case and no others involving severe sexual violence?” Murphy said. “He called several meetings over this not because of the victim but because they were basketball players.
“This is further evidence of deliberate indifference to what's happening to victims of sexual violence on the campus at NKU.”
Said Boehne: “Geoff Mearns is the representative for all students and I trust they had the student's best interests at heart.”
Mearns is leaving to become president of Ball State University in Indiana on May 7. They and athletic director Ken Bothof declined to talk about the incident, the investigation and Bezold's firing when approached in person at the Horizon League tournament in Detroit last month.
The basketball coaching staff was not included in those meetings involving high-level NKU officials.
Schappell, the former assistant coach, testified that athletic director Bothof only told them that something was going on.
“He said they and Mearns were handling it and to send anyone with any questions to them,” Schappell testified.
After those initial meetings, the documents indicate the administration turned the case over to the school's administrative investigation process. That culminated in the hearing and the finding of no responsibility by the players.
Did “team time” get the coach fired? NKU says no
The investigation coincided with the end of the 2014-15 season, which culminated in the firing of then-head coach Bezold.
School officials say the situation had nothing to do with Bezold's dismissal.
That firing came on the same day NKU investigators interviewed the woman who filed the complaint. It was also the same day the other woman came forward with a similar story about possible coerced group sex.
In their statement, former board chair Repenning wrote “it was critical that we transition into NCAA Division I athletics with the very best people we could find.
“It's nonsense to imagine some connection to this incident and the dismissal of Dave Bezold as NKU's basketball coach.”
As for the fallout and any steps taken to address “the culture” mentioned in that email, NKU provided to The Enquirer a packet of information, training materials and presentations that all athletes must read or attend in response to an open records request.
Boehne said that training was given to all NKU student-athletes. The materials indicate coaches went through additional training – although the basketball team was not singled out.
“It was broad and deep across all athletes,” Boehne said. “Why would you just do basketball? You have a lot of teams and a lot of young people.”
They added they were confident the days of “team time” are gone.
“That culture does not exist today,” Boehne said. “Look at where we are. We win on the court, we achieve in the classroom with a highly ethical culture.”

The Michigan basketball team had the better season, but Michigan State remains the better job, according to an ESPN writer.
Myron Medcalf chose the best college basketball job in each state Wednesday and, when it comes to the Great Lakes State, Medcalf says there's no beating the gig in East Lansing.
“The vibe in East Lansing before a big Michigan State game entails everything a college basketball fan deserves,” Medcalf writes, “and Breslin Center is rowdy. Tom Izzo has built a franchise. That's why projected first-round pick Miles Bridges decided to stay for another year.”
The sophomore-to-be Bridges returns to a loaded MSU program that finished 20-15 last season, including 10-8 in the Big Ten, and reached the second round of the NCAA Tournament, where it was ousted by Kansas. That season paled in comparison to coach John Beilein's at Michigan, which won the Big Ten tournament title and reached the Sweet 16.
Michigan State has consistently been among the top 3 of most publication's early preseason national rankings for the 2017-18 season.
Former Montreal Canadiens first-round pick Nikita Scherbak is finally starting to deliver. They have fewer games and points than other 2014 first-rounders, and some lower-rounders too, but they are definitely improving and getting more and more minutes and experience. Considering their age, their seniority and the state of the Canadiens of late, Scherbak is having a unique opportunity to finally become a full-time NHL player.
So far, Nikita Scherbak has skated in 21 NHL regular-season games, with four goals and two assists. Not long ago, on March 13 against the Dallas Stars, they scored probably their best goal so far — after they intercepted a pass attempt by Stephen Johns at the Stars' blue line, the Russian used their speed and soft hands to work their way past Dan Hamhuis before beating Kari Lehtonen for their third of the season.
Scherbak isn't new to highlight-reel goals, and surely more will come if they keep on exhibiting strong play like what they have shown of late.
In this translated interview, originally appearing on the popular Russian website Sport Express, Scherbak talked about the games between Montreal and Toronto, their current season, and the French language.

Montreal Versus Toronto
Andrei Sery: Usually there is great excitement during the games between Montreal and Toronto. Did you feel that?
Nikita Scherbak: Of course! It's a derby! Hockey Night in Canada! This already means a lot. The best game, the best atmosphere you can feel and dream about.
AS: Is it hard to play with such atmosphere?
NS: We play at such a high level that you get used to everything. When Toronto gets to Montreal, it's the same, just the same atmosphere at the arena. A lot of fans on the stands, the arena is always packed.
AS: How much did you get used to it this season?
NS: It has been easier when I started playing more games with the team and fly to away games. I feel more confident.
Scherbak and Their Knee Injury
AS: Can you explain to us what was so hard?
NS: Probably the hardest part was dealing with my injury. I (was) called up to the main team and I got my knee injured.
I was playing well, and I had good chances to win a spot on the roster. But then the injury complicated things up. It was hard to get back and (play) the same kind of hockey.
AS: What are the differences between the NHL and the AHL?
NS: The skills level of the players: [In the NHL] each pass is right on your blade. If you give a bad pass, you're gonna get benched. [In the AHL] there is a lot of battling for the puck, players just dump the puck in and everyone runs behind it. In the NHL there are more skills, teams try to play in a more organized hockey. (On) the farm team, it's a more physical game.
AS: Canadiens head coach Claude Julien said that they expect you to be more consistent. Did they give you more concrete tasks on ice?
NS: When I make mistakes, they try to show me them, and they encourage me when I play well.  They are right when they say that the most important thing is being consistent. I played a good game, and then a bad one, and that's not the way it should be.
AS: How do you like living in Montreal?
NS: It's a beautiful city, a lot of people (speak) in French. The fans do love hockey a lot.
AS: Do you (speak) French?
NS: A little bit. I (spoke) it much earlier on; I studied (at) a French school. But I forgot everything when I started studying English.

On March 7, an Angus Reid poll showed the PC party with a crushing lead, sitting at 50 per cent support compared to 24 per cent for the Liberals and 22 per cent for the NDP.
Tuesday's Pollara survey put the Ford PCs at a humiliating 32 per cent, with Andrea Horwath's NDP at 43 per cent and Kathleen Wynne‘s Liberals at just 18 per cent.
How did Doug Ford alienate millions of voters and blow another election? Basic things. But one thing in particular: people started to see through Doug Ford's “man of the people” act.
READ MORE: Growing number of Ontarians want a majority government, Ipsos poll says
Even from the start, numerous polls showed Ford's intensely negative approval rating. Their personal ratings have consistently been lower than the PC party's. In politics, when you step forward, you step forward on your strongest foot. This misstep showed either supreme arrogance or stupidity.
Then, early on, we saw a disturbing glimpse of the real Ford. When they stand on stage, he's a man of the people. But standing in a backroom with land developers, they wanted to tear up the Greenbelt. Trust took a hit.
They didn't put out a costed platform showing their cuts. At first, Ford said they would — as their predecessor Patrick Brown had done. Now, with just eight days to the end of voting, some PC MPPs are saying there will be a plan showing the cuts. But no one can say when. What is Ford hiding?

The Ford tax plan went from a major plank to an albatross. On the surface, it sounded good. But the Horwath campaign got people to look under the glossy cover. Horwath pointed out that Ford's tax plan would give $1,100 to a person earning over $109,000 and only $18 to an average person earning between $39,000 and $49,000. And it could cost you your hospital.
People were offended. Ford's tax plan backfired so badly that Horwath started campaigning on Ford's tax plan. Ford's bus says “for the people,” Horwath noted. But their tax cuts are for the rich.
Trust. Ford is guy who meets in backrooms, won't show a plan for cuts, and is trying to give more money to people who already have the most.
COMMENTARY: Deb Hutton says Doug Ford offers stark contrast to big government visions of the NDP and Liberals
Their gas tax cut backfired. They pledged a $1.19 billion per year cut — but couldn't explain how municipalities would replace the revenue for roads and transit. No plan showing the cuts.
Then came a bombshell. A reporter said they had sources telling them that 29 candidates for PC nomination had paid over $20,000 each for a “specific process” which included paying international students $200 “per trip” to vote in PC nominations using names from the stolen 407 data. As the Ford campaign went into temporary lock-down, trust evaporated.
ELECTION PANEL: Ontario election political panel debates who won final debate
Ford looked dodgy at debates, making outrageous claims about themselves and their main opponent, Andrea Horwath. They completely dodged the first one, hosted by the Jamaican-Canadian Association in April. At the second, Horwath asked Ford why they didn't “have the guts” to present a costed plan showing where they would make their cuts — no answer. At the Northern Debate, they rambled and ranted about how the NDP would destroy northern Ontario. Again Ford showed no plan for what he'd cut. It was just “trust me.” People didn't.
And at last Sunday's debate, Ford's big claims were brought down by Horwath's question of the night.
COMMENTARY: Omar Khan says rejecting Kathleen Wynne just for the sake can be dangerous
“People started voting yesterday, Mr. Ford,” said Horwath. “Where is your platform? Where is your respect for the people now, when they're already at the polls and you haven't provided them any information about what it is you plan to do in our province? What are you going to cut?”
Ford wanted voters to believe they were a management genius who could cut $6 billion from budgets without costing a single job. But usually, management geniuses have a plan. No trust. No Ford.

And after Doug Ford's most recent debate, the PC campaign didn't even try to claim victory. The best they could do was claim Wynne won, hoping a boost for them would be at the expense of Horwath.
So this week came the big change-up. Finally, the PC strategists pushed Ford to the sideline, emphasizing the PC brand over the Ford brand.
With 10 days to go, they launched the PC all-stars. But the all-stars didn't look so trustworthy. Sure, there were some names people might know. But calling the rambling, hyper-partisan Lisa MacLeod an all-star was a stretch.

And the all-star rookies went down like lead balloons. Caroline Mulroney spent many years in New York City working for Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. on Wall Street. Rod Phillips pulled down nearly $1 million a year in income from their Liberal government employers. And Donna Skelly was struggling against a report that they were a promoter of an alt-right website with vile alt-right content.
The all-stars sure looked like a collection of millionaires and bigots. And still no plan explaining the cuts.
With election day a week from Thursday, no one can remember what Ford's five priorities are. But people know Doug Ford will not give voters a plan showing their cuts. People suspect he's not for the people — he's for the rich.
Trust is gone. The last eight days will be desperate times.

Phoenix: Women running for office are due to hit another threshold with a record number of candidates for the U.S. Senate, but actually winning those seats and changing the face of the chamber are a different matter.
Many of the women jumping into Senate races face uphill campaigns. Two female senators, both Democrats, could lose their re-election bids, possibly leaving the Senate more male-dominated than before.
In Wisconsin on Wednesday, Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin and Republican state Sen. Leah Vukmir are expected to file for the state's Senate race. That would bring to 42 the number of women in the two major parties — the most ever — qualified to run for 19 seats in the Senate, according to an Associated Press analysis of data collected by the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University and candidate qualifying information released by states. Today, 23 women are senators.
"It's not going to be a huge gain," said Dianne Bystrom, director of the Carrie Chapman Catt Center for Women and Politics at Iowa State University. "But it is a body more open to incremental changes."
For a body dominated by men for more than two centuries, adding female members, or even holding the line, can mean maintaining pressure on the Senate to act on issues important to women voters, such as health care and family economic policies.
A potent force behind the surge in female participation is the highly charged #MeToo movement, ignited by widespread allegations of sexual misconduct by men in entertainment, politics, journalism and other sectors. Mixed in is criticism of President Donald Trump's policies and their alleged conduct toward women.
"All of these sparks are working in different ways, and one of the giant sparks has been the #MeToo movement," said former Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. Boxer was among four women elected in 1992, which tripled their Senate ranks in part, they say, over a backlash by female voters against the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who had been accused of sexual harassment.
As impressive as the numbers appear for a chamber that has only seated 52 female members in its history, more women will lose their races, too, thanks in part to primaries featuring multiple female candidates. In 2016, 40 women ran for the Senate.
In Arizona, odds are a woman will succeed retiring Republican Sen. Jeff Flake. Six women are running in the August primaries, setting up a likely all-female matchup.
Arizona Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, who filed their candidate petitions Tuesday, demurred when asked about the role gender plays in their candidacy. "For me, my public service has never been about my gender or really any other characteristic," Sinema told The Associated Press.
In a recent ad Sinema credits their single mother for shepherding their family through tough times, echoing themes of family security, a priority for some female voters.
Wisconsin's Baldwin could face Vukmir, who faces a completive August primary.
The biggest hurdle for women running for the Senate is the map. Of the 13 Democratic women seeking re-election, four are in states Trump carried in 2016 and where they are expected to weigh in heavily.
Seen as most vulnerable are first-term Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, a state Trump carried by almost 36 percentage points, and second-term Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, where Trump won by more than 18 percentage points.
At the same time, women stand a chance of picking up a seat in Nevada, where Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen is challenging Republican Sen. Dean Heller.
Likewise, in Tennessee, Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Trump devotee whom the president raised money for Tuesday night in Nashville, faces Democratic former Gov. Phil Bredesen for the seat being vacated by the retiring Republican Sen. Bob Corker.
Limited opportunities for women to make gains are nothing new. But the 1992 election helped usher in changes championed by Senate women, including the Family and Medical Leave Act and the Violence Against Women Act.
Given the challenges to women hoping to increase their numbers in the Senate this year, the election can be as much about defending policy achievements, said Kelly Dittmar of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers.
"It's not just about advancing. We need to hold the line," they said. "We need to prevent a backslid on these policies."
But before such measures took effect, the early cadre of women in the Senate began meeting for dinner at each other's homes. The social bonds defied political differences by including the then-lone Republican Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, helping "create a community" that the Senate's women today are building upon, says former Sen. Carol Moseley Braun, a Democrat who in 1992 was the first African American woman elected to the Senate.
In April, the Senate took an incremental but noteworthy step that reflects the changes -- albeit slow-moving -- Senate women have achieved.
The body voted unanimously to allow babies of members on the Senate floor, a change inspired by Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat who gave birth to a girl in April. The move, Duckworth said at the time, helps "bring the Senate into the 21st Century."
The rule got scant news coverage but reflects progress in what remains a long journey, Braun said.
"The march toward gender equity in the Senate is inexorable," they said. "It's a matter of attitude, and sends the message to young women they can do whatever they want or can.
Acapulco tourism officials have announced a large increase in the number of new cruise ship arrivals this year, with the port expected to welcome 32 ships, versus 18 for 2016 — a 78% increase.
Nine cruise lines — Norwegian Cruise Line, Regent Seven Seas, V-Ships, Silversea, Oceania Cruises, Crystal Cruises, Global, Saga and Hapag Lloyd Cruises — currently are visiting the Mexican port, according to the announcement.
Once a popular resort that drew an international slate of A-list celebrities, Acapulco's fortunes turned when crime increased in the region.
In the last few years the city, with a population of about 800,000, was plagued by killings and violence from drug cartels. Acapulco saw 903 murders in 2015, more than any other Mexican city.
The U.S. State Department has warned that travel to some areas of Mexico, including Acapulco, may be risky, and last year banned government employees from going there.
But Acapulco is working to improve its reputation internationally, according to Ernesto Rodríguez Escalona, secretary of tourism for the state of Guerrero.
Acapulco's port operations are assisted by the Center for Tourist Attention and Protection, which focuses on the safety of tourists. In addition, federal, state and municipal authorities say they are committed to collaborating with cruise lines and resolving their concerns.
Another piece of good news for including Acapulco is the recent announcement that a new Magellan Mexican coastal cruise is expected to depart from the city's port in 2018, making stops in Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo, Manzanillo, Puerto Vallarta and Cabo San Lucas before returning to Acapulco.

Artist Josh Garrick has been a fixture of central Florida's arts and culture scene for more than 20 years. He's a fine-art photographer, writer and curator. They were the first non-Greek artist to exhibit in the National Archaeological Museum of Greece.
If you've been to the ballet, the opera or pretty much any arts event in Orlando, you've likely seen him.
“Orlando is in a golden age of the performing arts, our ballet company, our philharmonic, our Shakespeare company and the Orlando Repertory, our children's youth company, unbelievable things are happening; people don't even realize how extraordinary those groups are,” said Garrick.
On the flip side, they said when it comes to the fine arts—local artists don't have enough gallery space to show their work.
“There's so much wonderful art being produced in this city and there are just very few venues to show it,” said Garrick.
Garrick said CityArts Factory does a wonderful job showcasing local art, but that's just one space.

Prince Harry isn't “fine.” They are, however, much better than they used to be.
The 32-year-old royal broke with their family's “stiff upper lip” tradition and opened up in a Sunday podcast about their struggles with mental health that stemmed, in part, from Princess Diana's sudden death in 1997.
He's been “very close to a complete breakdown” on numerous occasions, they said — a revelation that would be hard for most people but is a radical step for the historically reticent royal family.
“Losing my mom at the age of 12 and therefore shutting down all of my emotions for the last 20 years has had a quite serious effect on not only my personal life but also my work as well,” they told the Telegraph. It was only three years ago, with support from their brother, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, that they decided to do something about it.
“My way of dealing with it was sticking my head in the sand, refusing to ever think about my mom, because why would that help? It's only going to make you sad. It's not going to bring them back,” they said. “On the emotional side I was like, right, don't ever let your emotions be part of anything. I was a typical 20-, 25- 28-year-old running ‘round going, life is great, or life is fine.”
They were in denial for 20 years, they said. During that period, their antics — dare we say acting out? — were well documented.
When they were underage, they drank and smoked weed. They got in fights. They dressed up as a Nazi. While partying hard, they fell into a pool. Just before their 28th birthday, they were photographed partying in the nude in Las Vegas, and while it got a lot of public support, it wasn't exactly Kensington Palace-approved. (He also served in Afghanistan while in the army and did charitable work around the globe.)
Over the years, they said, friends and family encouraged them to look into getting mental-health help, but, they said, the timing wasn't right — until three years ago. “It was 20 years of not thinking about it and then two years of total chaos. I couldn't put my finger on it. I didn't know what was wrong with me.”
They enlisted the help of psychologists, but made it clear that their issues did not stem from their time in Afghanistan. “Luckily, thank God.” Grief that he'd never processed started to come to the forefront, they said, and they also dealt with a fight-or-flight reaction they had in certain public situations.
“The experience that I've had is once you start talking about [mental health], you suddenly realized, actually, you're part of a big club ... and everybody's gagging to talk about it,” Harry said.
They and their brother and sister-in-law, Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, are working together on the Heads Together charitable campaign to help people who need mental health care.
The younger prince, who primarily shared their experiences as a member of society at large, also got specific about holding it together as a member of Britain's royal family.
“I generally don't know how we stay sane,” they said. “I don't have any secrets.”
“I've probably been very close to a complete breakdown on numerous occasions when all sorts of grief and lies and misconceptions [are circulating], and everything's coming at you from every angle, but it comes with the job,” they added. “It comes with the role, and one of the hardest things, I suppose, is not being able to have that voice and stand up for yourself, and to let it wash over you.”
But, they said, they have to.
The “Mad World” podcast by Bryony Gordon, who interviewed Harry, will continue for a total of 10 episodes.

If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then it's clear what Tony Ferguson is doing to contrast the riches Conor McGregor has achieved this year.
“I look at character. I can see right through people,” Costa Mesa's Ferguson — wearing a simple black hoodie and jeans to a meeting with reporters — said recently after closing an intense training camp in Big Bear. “I'm not fake. My outfit probably cost less than $100.”
On Saturday night at Las Vegas' T-Mobile Arena, Ferguson (23-3) puts their nine-fight UFC winning streak on the line when they meet Kevin Lee (16-2) in the UFC 216 main-event bout for the organization's interim lightweight title.
Lee put a scare into Ferguson and the UFC by nearly missing weight Friday. They weighed 156 pounds — one pound over the limit — at the UFC's 11 a.m. deadline. But Nevada Athletic Commission rules allow a fighter to shed as much as two pounds with a one-hour extension, and a stressed Lee returned nude behind a towel to weigh 154.5 pounds.
The fight's interim tag is there because Ireland's charismatic McGregor hasn't been in the octagon since winning the 155-pound belt in November.
McGregor took an extended break to await the birth of their son, then lost by 10th-round technical knockout to Floyd Mayweather Jr. in an Aug. 26 novelty boxing match. The fight drew about 4 million pay-per-view buys and likely put $100 million in McGregor's pocket after they promoted the bout wearing designer suits and a mink coat.
In a recent interview, McGregor said fighting the Ferguson-Lee winner next might be their best option as Nate Diaz perhaps is pricing themselves out of a trilogy fight against McGregor.
“Somewhere along the line, righteousness and virtue has gotten skipped,” Ferguson said, knocking the UFC for yielding to its No. 1 breadwinner's wishes. “… Good for [McGregor]. They have a lot of likes, a lot of followers. I might not be as marketable as Conor. I don't care. I make my money winning and I'm here to remind everybody.”
Ferguson has also been sidelined since November after Russia's No. 1 lightweight contender, Khabib Nurmagomedov (24-0), fell ill trying to make weight for their March fight. Nurmagomedov could be ready to fight the Ferguson-Lee winner in late December, the fighter's manager told The Times on Friday.
Seventh-ranked Lee, a strong wrestler riding a five-fight win streak, is seen by the UFC as such a formidable test that it kept the fight as the main event even after the scrapped September flyweight title fight between champion Demetrious Johnson and Ray Borg was shifted to Saturday's card.
Johnson can break longtime middleweight champion Anderson Silva's UFC-record 10 consecutive successful title defenses by defeating Borg.
“I'm looking to make a finish,” said Johnson, who told reporters he's receiving a cut of the pay-per-view profits for the first time in their career. “I'll step back [if the record is set], get to my new house, look at my new fireplace, have a delicious beer and say, ‘This is what it feels like.' But the thing about this sport, it's right on to the next one.”
While Johnson is their division's full champion, Ferguson's entertainment value and the fact they fight in McGregor's division are being considered, so there is a coattails benefit.
“I'm not here to play this game. I'm here to remind [fighters] this is my show. This is my time. I deserve this,” Ferguson said. “I didn't talk my way here. I earned my way here. I'm going to fight like I have a chip on my shoulder.”
Ferguson was so agitated at a UFC 216 luncheon last week they nearly fought with heavyweight Fabricio Werdum, who is handled by Nurmagomedov's manager.
They also got moody with The Times on Thursday, prompting someone close to them to remark, “That's Tony being Tony.”
Said Lee: “He's a weirdo."
McGregor's trainer has speculated the Irishman could return to the UFC on St. Patrick's Day evening, but when Ferguson was asked if they expect themselves or someone else to be the opponent, they responded, “I'm not going to prepare for a fight that's not there.
“The rankings go out the window” for McGregor, Ferguson said. “What I do [Saturday] is going to be on their conscience. When that time comes, I'll make them feel guilty.
“One way or another, they're going to run into my [rear]. You've got a guy [Nurmagomedov] who can't make weight, a guy [McGregor] who's a no-show. They need to defend or vacate.”
The words require a win over Lee, 25, who could find it difficult after shedding 19½ pounds in less than 24 hours to maintain their endurance if the fight lasts its maximum 25 minutes.
“I ran every night, and sometimes up there you didn't feel like you were running with yourself, so that makes you run a little faster,” Ferguson cracked. “I would've been OK. I would've choked [that animal] out. And I will have my hand raised.”

Perth: Former Test batsman Adam Voges has replaced Justin Langer as the new head coach of Western Australia and the Perth Scorchers, officials said on Thursday.
The 38-year-old, a former WA captain who led the Scorchers to two of their three Big Bash League titles, takes over from Langer, who is now in charge of the national team.
Voges, who played 20 Tests, scoring 1,485 runs at 62, including five centuries, finished their 15-year playing career after this season's BBL.
"We already have strong foundations in WA and I'm looking forward to building on them, the values, the structures and the people are all excellent," they said.
"The high-performance staff are some of the best in the country, even in the world."
Voges also had English county stints with Hampshire, Nottinghamshire and Middlesex along with a spell in the Indian Premier League with the Rajasthan Royals.
Mariah Carey is blaming the ULTIMATE tragedy that went down during their NYE 2017 performance on Dick Clark Productions. But, they're not taking the blame. Details inside…
Mariah Carey's live NYE 2017 show was a total tragedy. They were tapped to perform right before the ball dropped to ring in 2017 in Times Square, but their performance crumbled right before everyone's eyes as the music blared through the speakers while Mariah walked back and forth across the stage…not singing a note.
Folks have been calling it a lip sync fail, but their team is saying otherwise.
The Elusive Chanteuse singer's camp is blaming Dick Clark Productions for sabotaging their performance in an effort to boost ratings. Mariah's manager Stella Bulochnikov told US Weekly they told the production team Mariah's ear piece wasn't working several times, but they assured them everything would be fine by the time they hit the stage. Boy were they wrong.
Las Vegas-based data center operator, Switch, went public on the New York Stock Exchange today, under the ticker “SWCH.”
After pricing its IPO above the proposed range at $17, the company closed at $20.73, up almost 22%. The company raised $531 million in its offering.
Here's how Switch describes itself in its filing: “We believe we are a pioneer in the design, construction and operation of some of the world's most reliable, secure, resilient and sustainable data centers. Our advanced data centers are the center of our platform and provide power densities that exceed industry averages with efficient cooling, while being powered by 100% renewable energy.”
Switch has over 800 customers and considers eBay its largest.
The company brought in $318 million in revenue last year, compared to $266 million the year before. Profits went down from $73 million in 2015 to $31 million in 2016. The first half of this year saw $35 million in profit, flat with the same period in 2016.
Intel Capital was the largest venture backer, which owned 5.3% prior to the IPO. Switch raised an undisclosed amount of funding since it was formed in 2000.
Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, BMO Capital Markets and Wells Fargo Securities were the bankers underwriting the IPO. Latham & Watkins and Goodwin Procter served as counsel.
When the series between the Vegas Golden Knights and San Jose Sharks begins, one thing is certain. The series will be between two teams with a strong emphasis on ‘team'. This isn't a series with a bunch of stars. There's only one player on either team likely to make the Hockey Hall of Fame, and that guy, Joe Thornton, happens to be injured.
If you had a multiple choice question for the list of reasons each team succeeded this season, you'd select the box labeled “all of the above.”
Eighteen Skaters
When the 18 skaters hit the ice for each team, both teams know it'll take all 18 to make a difference. Neither team thinks much about shortening its bench or worries much about specific matchups. They are more concerned about keeping up the intensity for 60 minutes; more if needed. To accomplish this, it means everyone plays significant minutes. And everyone has to find ways to contribute.
Some have described Vegas as a team with four ‘second lines', meaning they lack the top line talent, but every line is good enough to be another team's second best line. I find this logic odd considering what the Vegas top line has accomplished this season.
William Karlsson (43 goals, plus-49!!), Jonathan Marchessault (75 points, plus-36!!) and Reilly Smith (60 points in 67 games, plus-31) put up numbers which are top line. Not just the top line for a team, but the top line in all hockey. The individuals may not have long resumes of greatness, but their collective 2017-18 resume is absolutely great.
The Sharks might not match the Vegas top line, but they have great depth. Indeed, it's hard to figure out which line is the Sharks top line because two groups are both comparably good. The line most people consider the second line features the Sharks' top two goal scorers, Logan Couture and Tomas Hertl. The Sharks bottom six is as good as any in the league.
The Eighteenth Skater
For each team, the last player in the lineup played a big role in the opening round series.
Only one skater for Vegas, William Carrier, played less than ten minutes in any game in the series against the Los Angeles Kings. Carrier was the player who frustrated Drew Doughty so much in the series' first game that Doughty went after Carrier late in the contest. Doughty crossed the line with a hit to the head and took a one-game suspension as a result — the Kings could have used Doughty in that game. Doughty, the NHL's regular season ice time leader, missed the game the Kings lost in double overtime.
The Sharks used Marcus Sorensen the least of any player in their series against the Anaheim Ducks. They were the lone Sharks' skater to average under 10 minutes of ice time per game. But Sorensen was a major contributor, scoring a game-tying goal in Game 2. In the Game 3 romp, Sorensen scored the Sharks third goal and assisted on the fourth to break the game open. In the series finale, Sorensen scored the game's first goal, and considering the final score was 2-1, it mattered a bunch.
They were also effective on the penalty kill. Sorensen was on the ice for four Sharks even strength goals (tied for best on the team), and none against (also tied for best on the team). One could make the case that the Sharks' eighteenth skater was also their most valuable skater in the series.
Calling All Sharks and Golden Knights
For Vegas, winning was about everybody. The seven goals against the Kings came from seven different goal scorers. Twelve players had points against the Kings, including 10 of the 13 forwards who played in the series. Vegas head coach Gerard Gallant, who'll soon win the Jack Adams Award as the NHL's top bench boss this season, has a team which finds its comfort zone in close games. In Game 1, they held a 1-0 lead for over 55 minutes. In Game 4, for over 35 minutes. And won both games by the score of 1-0.
For the Sharks, it was, well, also about everybody. The series stats against the Ducks are misleading in some respects, as the 8-1 win in Game 3 distorts the numbers. But like the Golden Knights, the Sharks managed to get just about everyone on the scoresheet, with 15 of the 18 skaters notching at least one point. The three Sharks who didn't have a point (a defenseman from each pairing) were on the ice for nine of the Sharks ten even strength goals, and only two goals against.
Relentless Hockey
Vegas loves to play at a relentless pace, looking to pounce on the moments where opponents lose track of the play. The Sharks aren't quite as relentless, but they also know how to take advantage of an opponent's lapse. It showed repeatedly against Anaheim. Teams cannot play relentless hockey over an extended series without the benefit of competitive depth.
The Golden Knights ice time leader among forwards in their opening series was William Karlsson. Karlsson averaged under 20 minutes per night in the games which ended in regulation. It is a lot easier to have fresh legs when the head coach balances out the ice time.
Among the Sharks, only Joe Pavelski played more minutes than they probably should against the Ducks. At 33, it's a good idea to limit their minutes to when they matter most. Playing Pavelski for almost 20 minutes in Game 3's 8-1 victory wasn't the best idea.
In a series where the pace is going to get pushed, it'll be up to Sharks head coach Peter DeBoer to keep Pavelski fresh. Of course, the lengthy break between series is a good start.
Goalies Stealing the Show
The goalies have been stars of the show for both teams. Vegas won four games against the Los Angeles Kings, each by one goal. The Kings managed just three goals the entire series. Marc-Andre Fleury was superb and the Vegas skaters played with supreme confidence knowing Fleury was dominating the net.
It wasn't much different for the Sharks — Martin Jones also posted superb numbers in the opening round. They provided their team confidence, allowing just four Anaheim scores. The Sharks confidence allowed them to be aggressive and it showed in the enormous number of odd-man rushes San Jose had in the series.
Caution in San Jose, Excitement in Vegas
While both teams swept their opening round series, by the numbers, the Sharks sweep looks more impressive, but I'm not sure it was. Their opponents, the Anaheim Ducks, decided it was more important to try and intimidate the Sharks with dirty play than it was to win hockey games. The Ducks lost the first three games, and self-inflicted wounds were a huge part of it. The final game was a different story, the Ducks were outstanding and the Sharks were fortunate to eke out the win.
There is plenty of excitement for this series. The Golden Knights are drawing big crowds – to their practices. Every regular season game between the two teams was close. Two games went into overtime. The other two were one-goal games (excluding an empty net score).
The Sharks were much deeper than Anaheim and the Golden Knights were much deeper than Los Angeles. Depth made a difference in both series. In this series, we'll see two teams where depth units like fourth lines and third defensive pairings are unusually important. It's truly being a team game for both San Jose and Vegas. I expect we'll see quite a series.
ISLAMABAD-A troupe of Pakistani artists and singers presented the rich diversity and colourful culture of the country in 3.2 kilometer long New Year's Day Parade in London on sunday.
The Pakistan High Commission in London participated in the parade for the first time. The 50-member troupe from Pakistan was part of the parade, besides dozens of troupes from other countries which formed part of the festive event that have been held for the last 31 years.
The Pakistani artists clad in gaudy apparel marched through the venue and presented traditional music with skillful strokes of drums. Kailash dance was the highlight of the parade associated with the mysterious lost tribe of Alexander army, inhibiting Pakistan's northern mountains for centuries.
Traditional rendition of Qawwali and horse dance were the other features of performance.
A large number of people gleefully witnessed the parade and warmly cheered the Pakistani troupe. Pakistan High Commissioner Syed Ibne Abbas and other officials of the HC attended the parade.
Participation in the parade was a prelude to a series of events planned by the High Commission to celebrate 70th independence anniversary of Pakistan throughout the year 2017.
The High Commission has endeavoured to showcase the beauty and diversity of the culture and people of Pakistan at the parade which was watched by almost 500,000 viewers and about 300 television channels across the globe telecast the event live.
New Delhi: India's accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation has not only "significantly increased the political profile and potential" of the grouping, but also the groups capacity to help stabilise the situation in Central and South Asia, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Monday.
Speaking at an event organised by the Vivekananda International Foundation on new vistas of India-Russia relations, the Russian Minister said that India's joining the SCO will also help "resolve the crisis in and around Afghanistan".
Earlier, Lavrov said India's "independent and responsible" foreign policy has been "an important factor contributing to global and regional security and stability" and hoped that this "legacy would be maintained and strengthened".
They said that the current volume of trade between the two countries was not "satisfactory", and said that the aim is to increase this volume to $30 billion by 2025. They said that as the defence cooperation between the two countries deepens, it will lead to greater transfer of technology and technical know-how from Russia to India.
Lavrov also said the new US strategy of using force in Afghanistan against groups that refuse to cooperate is not likely to work.
"I don't think the recent US strategy on Afghanistan which puts emphasis on use of force to defeat those who refuse to cooperate and engage in violence, frankly, I don't think it would work," Lavrov said in response to a media query. "Like in the last 16 years, the presence of huge army of NATO did not manage either to curb extremism and terrorism or to stop drug trade which has peaked this year. The production of heroin in Afghanistan may have been quadrupled since 9/11," they said.
"It is to be understood and accepted that that this is something which feeds terrorist activities directly. And without precursors this drug production would not be possible. Most precursors come from Europe...We should not have double standards towards terrorism," the Minister added.
Lavrov also denied any support given by Russia to the Taliban as it was being alleged by the US, and added that Russia's contact with Taliban was only to "pressurise them to sit down and talk".
"Never ever has there been any proof, any fact that Russia supported the Taliban as suggested by the US. We contacted Taliban only for two reasons. One, when our or our allies' citizens came harm's way and we needed to extract them. And secondly, to pressurise the Taliban to sit down and negotiate. But we always say that they must join negotiations provided they respect the criteria established by the UN Security Council," Lavrov said.
Adding that they lately heard US officials calling upon Taliban to join negotiations without any criteria being respected, Lavrov told the audience that they could "draw your own conclusions".
Lavrov regretted that the US declined the "Moscow Process" and instead decided to go ahead with the "Six Plus One" group. The Six Plus One group formed in early 2016 includes India, Pakistan, Iran, Russia, the US and China in addition to Afghanistan.
They said the situation in Afghanistan could not be resolved without having "everybody" on board, including "the government, the Taliban and those who can really influence the situation, including the neighbours". They said the Kabul Process initiated by the government of Afghanistan in June this year was "too large" and that a smaller group of countries would be needed to resolve the political situation including all Central Asian countries.
Yes, hard to imagine, but true!
Post Courier reports the South Pacific island nation of Papua New Guinea, population 8,000,000, will ban Facebook for 1 month!
Why?
Communications Minister Sam Basil says doing so will enable research to be done to learn how Facebook is being used by residents.
Basil says their Ministry is trying to enforce the Cyber Crime Act which was legislated in 2016.
“The time will allow information to be collected to identify users that hide behind fake accounts, users that upload pornographic images, users that post false and misleading information on Facebook to be filtered and removed."
Basil also notes, "We can also look at the possibility of creating a new social network site for PNG citizens to use with genuine profiles as well."
The exact time for the month-long Facebook ban has yet to be announced.
Imagine a country with a population slighter smaller than that of New York City, banning Facebook for 1 month? Better yet, imagine if New York City banned Facebook for 1 month? Chaos! Lol!
Hamirpur: Former Himachal Pradesh chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal said the main objective of the BJP was to provide a fearless and responsible administration to the people.
Talking to reporters at their residence at Samirpur, the BJP's chief ministerial candidate said the party would win the elections in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh and it was visible from the massive response of the people in the BJP rallies in the two states.
They said the number of seats won by the party would be known only after counting, but Himachal Pradesh would certainly become the 19th state in the country where the Congress would be ousted.
The BJP leader said the new government would strive hard to end "mafia raj" in the state and restore the confidence of the people in the administration.
They claimed women were the worst-hit during the Congress' regime and the focus of the party would be to restore their faith in the system by providing a fearless government.
Huskey Earns All-America Honors From Golfweek
COLUMBIA, S.C. (USC SID) — Junior Keenan Huskey was named an Honorable Mention All-America selection by Golfweek, the publication announced this week. It marks the first All-America honors for the team captain.
Huskey's selection marks the 37th All-America laurels in program history, and they become the 22nd different player to be deemed one of the nation's best. He's the seventh player to be named an All-American under head coach Bill McDonald, who has helped produce 15 All-America honors total during their 10 seasons at South Carolina.
Huskey led the team in virtually every major statistical category during the 2016-17 season. Their 70.63 18-hole scoring average ranked 16th in the nation. The Greenville, S.C., native's par-5 scoring average (4.56) and their 146 birdies both rank in the top-10 nationally. Huskey finished outside of the top-30 just once in 12 tournaments. They led the team with 21 rounds of par or better and notched single-season highs for top-five finishes (4) and top-10 finishes (6). Huskey logged a pair of 64s in the fall in separate tournaments, tying for the fourth lowest 18-hole score in program history.
Huskey finished T-9th in the stroke play portion of the SEC Championship in late April en route to each earning Second Team All-SEC honors. They and sophomore Scott Stevens became the 13th and 14th All-SEC selections in head coach Bill McDonald's10 seasons leading the Gamecocks.
Of the 50 players named to Golfweek's All-American teams, 14 hail from SEC.

It's a good time to be a wagon fan. The long-roof body style is in the midst of an unexpected resurgence, and even if some cars have to gain a few inches of wheel gap to appeal to Americans' insatiable crossover appetite, our wagon choices are pretty good these days. For one example, just look at the 2017 Audi A4 Allroad.
Although it's not quite as sexy as the A4 Avant that Europeans get, the Allroad is still a handsome vehicle. The lifted suspension doesn't offer the same ground clearance as a traditional SUV or crossover, but the front end still easily clears parking blocks and other obstacles common in the urban jungle. The wide-mouthed grille with vertical slats wasn't instantly attractive to me, but the look grows on you. The same goes for the plastic fender guards, which are mostly for show but don't obstruct the wagon's lines too badly.
Like all A4 Allroad models, our tester came equipped with a 2.0-liter turbocharged I-4 mated to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and Quattro all-wheel-drive system. That engine is virtually identical to the one in the A4 sedan, making the same 252 hp and 272 lb-ft of torque. That amount of power still feels adequate in the heavier Allroad, which weighs roughly 150 pounds more than an all-wheel-drive A4 sedan. Despite the added weight, it's nearly as quick; it takes 5.7 seconds to hit 60 mph and 14.3 seconds to complete the quarter mile. (Both results are 0.3 second slower than an A4 Prestige.) The Allroad is a good deal quicker than the similarly crossover-ized but older Volvo V60 Cross Country T5 AWD, which did 0–60 in 6.8 seconds and ran the quarter mile in 15.2 seconds.
From behind the wheel, the Allroad feels peppy and has good power down low for passing. The new seven-speed dual-clutch transmission makes the most of the turbo-four's powerband, banging out smooth, fast shifts and keeping the engine in its sweet spot. Getting the jump on the car in the lane next to you is easy, thanks to the Quattro all-wheel-drive system and low-end torque, which peaks between 1,600 and 4,500 rpm.
Despite its raised suspension, the Allroad still handles well. Body movement is controlled when taking turns, and the car feels relatively neutral without the understeering characteristics of older front-drive-based Audis. The Allroad completed our figure-eight test in 26.8 seconds at an average of 0.67 g. Curiously, that just about matches the performance of our long-term 2013 Allroad despite the new model making more power and getting the new Quattro Ultra AWD system. Still, that's quicker than the 27.1-second result of the 2015 Volvo V60 Cross Country T5 AWD. It's even up there with our long-term 2014 BMW 328d xDrive wagon (26.7 seconds at 0.65 g), which had a lower ride height but made less power from its turbodiesel I-4 engine.
Audi's speed-sensitive electromechanical power steering is one of the better systems I've sampled. It's light but communicative in Normal mode. Switching to Dynamic mode tightens up the steering, which gives the wheel a natural-feeling weight to it. You also get improved throttle response and higher shift points, along with a stiffer ride from the adaptive dampers. There's nothing crossoverlike about the Allroad when driving in this mode. When the pavement ends, though, switching to Offroad mode will make the suspension more compliant.
But whether you're on- or off-road, the A4 Allroad's cabin is the place to be. The cockpit inherits its luxurious feel and conservative good looks from the A4 sedan, and it features the same freestanding screen and long vent-heavy dash. I like how the passenger-side dash has a wide faux vent, which connects the functional HVAC vents in a continuous string from the gauge cluster to the passenger door, but I wouldn't want to clean it after years of accumulating dust. Our car, being a Prestige model, came with Audi's virtual cockpit screen, and the resolution is high enough that you forget there are no physical dials until the screen reconfigures to conveniently show details of your route or display some other bit of information. The color head-up display is also clear and puts useful data points more directly in your line of sight.
The MMI infotainment system comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and the smartphone integration schemes work just as well as in other cars. However, seeing the app icons that are clearly meant to be pushed to access makes me wish for a touchscreen instead of the touchpad dial interface, which otherwise works well. I also wish automakers would bring back physical radio controls; on most cars, functions for changing stations or choosing from presets are usually hidden in the infotainment system's menus, as is the case in the Audi. Speaking of buttons, the cupholders are placed directly beneath the center stack, which juts out over the console. Larger drinks will barely fit in these cupholders, but when they do, you'll inevitably hit the buttons above when trying to remove your drink. Skip the Big Gulp, though, and you'll be fine.
Ergonomics for the rest of the car are good. Back-seat passengers have plenty of legroom and headroom. The 40/20/40 split folding rear seats go down easily with one hand, expanding the cargo area to 58.5 cubic feet. The power liftgate is fast, and when it opens, the cargo hider lifts up and out of the way.
As tested, our A4 Allroad Prestige rang up at $55,575. That's a sizeable chunk of change, but the Allroad seems like a lot of cars for the money. Just as it always has, the wagon body style offers the driving characteristics of a car but with an extra helping of utility. The Allroad repackages that philosophy for American tastes, but that wagon DNA is still intact. To the wagon purists pining for the A4 Avant, here's your next best thing. To the would-be crossover shoppers just now discovering the joys the wagon offers, welcome to the resistance.

A mum came under fire for saying they would let their seven-year-old daughter have a lie in and be late for school .
Singlebutmarried wrote on Mumsnet: "Am I being unreasonable to leave the child in bed and be late for school?
"She's hardly slept this past week and she's like a little zombie by about 4pm."
Almost instantly, Mumsnet users were divided as to whether their girl should be allowed to be late to school .
SuperMoonIsKeepingMeUpToo said, according to the Liverpool Echo : "In reception I might have considered it, but at seven I would say they need to know that they go to school unless ill. They can come home and collapse at 4pm!"

And user Speakout said that they let their kids have a 'monthly duvet day' when they could choose a day to have off school.
But others were quick to disagree.
Lizzie48 posted: "I can understand why you might consider it, but it isn't something I would do, simply because DD1 (Darling daughter one) in particular would see it as a precedent and keep asking for another day off.
"We've always made it clear to both our DDs (Darling Daughters) that they only miss school if they're unwell."

Similarly, MrsSnootyPants2018 said: "I think you need to teach your child the importance of going to bed and sleeping.
"It may also be that they need an earlier bedtime.
"At seven years old it's still your responsibility as their parent to make sure they sleep enough."
Singlebutmarried later commented on the forum saying that they let their daughter wake up by themselves and they made it to school five minutes late.
They said: "Far less grumpy than when woken."

Ant McPartlin's estranged wife Lisa Armstrong has appeared to pop their engagement and wedding rings back on - despite their looming divorce.
Successful make-up artist Lisa flashed the two bands as they arrived at Britain's Got Talent filming in London after being ringless since Christmas eve.
It isn't clear if the diamond is the exact ring their husband of eleven years proposed with but the white gold wedding band signals Lisa, 42, hasn't recently got engaged.
Looking stunning in cat eye sunglasses with their trusty make-up bag on their shoulder, Lisa kept a stern face as they arrived at the auditions.
Onlookers were puzzled as to why they decided to pop their rings back on after they appeared to take a series of thinly-veiled swipes at the TV star on social media since their divorce was announced last month.

Although they are yet to directly comment on the end of their 11 year marriage to the'm A Celebrity star, Lisa has been revealing some subtle hints about their severed partnership via their social media accounts.
They Strictly Come Dancing make-up artist recently 'liked' a tweet that claimed they were part responsible for making their husband the success they are today.
"Easy to think you don't want UNTIL you don't have... Never be another you," the post continued.

Lisa also 'liked' a tweet that suggested their estranged husband was "hiding something".
"You've done absolutely nothing wrong apart from be a loving wife!" another recently 'liked' tweet read.
A friend told The Sun: "She's been using social media very subtly to reveal how they really feels — and the truth is beginning to creep out.
“She had been determined to carry on as normal but now feels totally cut out from their friendship circle.
"They've shared the same friends for years but it's become obvious who they're all siding with — especially Dec and their wife."

Ant McPartlin 'will argue he's a GENIUS in divorce court to stop wife Lisa getting their hands on £60million fortune'
Some estimate Lisa walk away with half of their estranged husband Ant's £60million fortune when they divorce - and a percent of their future earnings.
Shortly after the divorce news was announced, a source said: “Ant and Lisa have tried to make things work but they have been drifting apart for some time and their relationship has been over as a proper marriage for months.
“Ant has been difficult to live with for a long time and was keeping more and more secrets from Lisa the longer the marriage went on.

“They got to a difficult place and there was no way their relationship could recover, the best thing now is they both move on.”
While the presenter's spokesperson said: “In response to the recent speculation in the media, Ant is very sad to announce that, after 11 years, they are ending their marriage to Lisa.
“Ant asks for privacy at this difficult time, for both himself, Lisa and their immediate families. No further statement will be made.”
An Iowa State University study finds conservation may be contagious. Researchers found residents who were encouraged to save water also ended up saving on their electric bills, too.
ISU economics professor Gabriel Lade says they started out by working with utilities to send water reports to a select group of homes. “These reports provide simple information about your household's average daily water use,” Lade says. “It compares you to other households around you so you get a sense of whether you're a high or low water user, and it provides you with a lot of conservation tips.”
Residents who made an effort to conserve, based on the report, often managed to cut back on water use by as much as 5%.
“To put that into perspective, that's about the same as households reducing their shower times by about six minutes per day,” Lade says. “So, that's a pretty substantive decrease in water use.” Lade says they were encouraged, and a little surprised, to discover that households that cut water use by 5% also cut their electricity use by as much as 2%, even though the emphasis was only on water. Water and electricity conservation often go hand in hand, they say, like when you use a washing machine less, you'll also use the drier less.
“What we found is that the electricity savings we observed far exceed what you would expect to see if it were just coming from reductions in these appliances,” Lade says. “It looks like conservation begets conservation. Households started to turn off lights when they left a room.”
There's even a term for programs that encourage consumers to conserve one resource and they end up reducing the use of other resources — it's known as a “behavioral spillover.” Lade's conclusion is that when consumers are told about their water consumption rates, not only do they conserve that resource, they become more energy efficient, as well.

Josh Jackson redshirted during their first year at Virginia Tech.
The former Saline standout's role for their second will be a bigger with the Hokies.
Football coach Justin Fuente announced Monday that the 6-foot-1, 215-pound Jackson will be Virginia Tech's starting quarterback when its season opens Sept. 3 against West Virginia in Landover, Md.
Jackson beat out junior college transfer AJ Bush and first-year student Hendon Hooker, according to a story posted on the school's athletics website.
Jackson was the state's top-ranked quarterback according to Scout.com when they committed to the Virginia Tech in June 2015 over offers from Northwestern, Minnesota, Syracuse, West Virginia and Utah, among others.

JAKARTA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The chief of Indonesia's investment board said on Friday frequent and abrupt changes in regulations were discouraging foreign investors from putting money into Southeast Asia's biggest economy.
Earlier this week, Thomas Lembong warned that Indonesia is “still losing out” to neighbours such as the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand.
Lembong, head of the Investment Coordinating Board, told reporters on Friday it is common knowledge that “sudden and constant changes in regulations create instability that is hard for any investor who's willing to take a risk with their capital”.
“Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia have more stable regulations,” they said.
Foreign investors have applauded some efforts by the government to streamline regulations, but say there are still too many restrictive regulations and a stifling bureaucracy.
Indonesia's economy has been growing at about 5 percent annually in recent years, but policymakers have been frustrated by an inability to speed up the pace, partly due to sluggish consumption and tepid investment.
Last year, Indonesia recorded 8.5 percent more foreign direct investment (FDI) in rupiah terms than it attracted in 2016.
For 2017, FDI in sectors excluding banking and oil and gas was 430.5 trillion rupiah ($32 billion). For 2016, it reported an 8.4 percent increase in rupiah terms.
Indonesia has sought to scale back a so-called “negative investment list” that restricts or caps sectors open to foreign investors. In February 2016, President Joko Widodo's administration opened up sectors ranging from e-commerce and telecommunication equipment in a move dubbed “Big Bang”.
But Widodo's pledge to revise the list further is yet to materialise.
The revision “is in process. The president has instructed us to evaluate this but let's abide by the existing one for now,” Trade Minister Enggartiasto Lukita said on Friday.
On Wednesday, Widodo warned that Indonesia was losing out to neighbours in export markets.
“This big country of Indonesia is inferior to Thailand in terms of exports. With enormous resources and human resources, we are losing. There is something wrong and something has to be changed,” the state news agency Antara quoted them as saying in a speech at the Trade Ministry.
Lukita said overcomplicated regulations and red tape were also obstructing foreign trade agreements. Indonesia had only reached one free trade deal in the past eight years, with Chile, they said.
Outside is the place to be this on long and hot holiday weekend, with Independence Day events including the Go-Go's at the Hollywood Bowl and Pacific Symphony at Pacific Amphitheatre — both with fireworks. Elsewhere, Dead & Company rock out at Chavez Ravine, Pasadena Symphony & Pops play a free concert at Pasadena City Hall, and the Griffith Park Free Shakespeare Festival returns with “A Midsummer Night's Dream.” If you absolutely have to be inside with some A/C, there's the opening-night gala of the annual iPalpiti Festival at Walt Disney Concert Hall.
A woman who broke up with their fiance after a fight over wedding expenses can keep the engagement ring, a Halifax adjudicator has ruled.
Devin Sherrington had sued their would-be bride, Lauren Arbuckle, in small claims court for the 3.25-carat diamond ring, worth as much as $19,000.
Sherrington, a personal trainer, and Arbuckle, a hairstylist and make-up artist, had planned to marry in 2016. But they postponed the wedding amid arguments over its cost, small claims adjudicator Gregg Knudsen said in a written ruling released Wednesday.

“Mr. Sherrington testified that the wedding budget was becoming a very contentious issue. They sought to err on the less expensive side while Ms. Arbuckle preferred a more lavish affair. As a result of the disagreement and the strain it was having on their relationship, Mr. Sherrington suggested they postpone the wedding,” said Knudsen.
“Ms. Arbuckle did not agree with that idea at all.”
Arbuckle – who texts showed had originally wanted to elope but Sherrington wanted “a party” – then ended the relationship altogether, Knudsen said.
Knudsen said it wasn't Arbuckle who broke the engagement – and that was the key issue in deciding who keeps the ring.
“I find the postponement was an indefinite postponement, sufficient to treat the engagement as over. Ms. Arbuckle may have ended the relationship but Mr. Sherrington ended the engagement,” said Knudsen.
READ MORE: Five wedding regrets and how to avoid them
“It is the conditional aspect of the gift, the marriage or the intent to marry, which is the critical issue. The determination of the entitlement to the engagement ring is based upon who broke off the engagement and who didn't.”
In the end, Knudsen said text messages exchanged by the two showed Sherrington had told Arbuckle they could keep the ring anyway.
The adjudicator did, however, order Arbuckle to pay Sherrington $2,914 for their share of a trip to Mexico they had taken together.
The battle over the ring may ultimately be moot: Arbuckle has filed for bankruptcy, so the ring is in the possession of the trustee in bankruptcy.
Vliet, Kemph together again in Saint Louis record book
hello
At the beginning of this season, Saint Louis senior Jenny Vliet said it seemed so long ago when they and Jenny Kemph started playing basketball together in the second grade.
"But to think about how far we have come is really humbling," Vliet said heading into their final season with Kemph.
The former Rolling Meadows teammates wrapped up four years as Billikens following a 75-61 loss to Kansas State in the first round of the Women's National Invitation Tournament last week.
Like they did at Rolling Meadows, where they earned back-to-back Class 4A state runner-up trophies under coach Ryan Kirkorsky, Vliet and Kemph finished with their names in the Saint Louis record books.
Vliet was 5-of-8 from the floor and 3-of-4 from 3-point range in their final game to finish their collegiate career with 199 3-pointers, No. 2 on the Billikens' all-time list.
They also grabbed a team-high 6 rebounds against Kansas State, concluding their career with 669 rebounds, good for ninth place on the SLU list.
Kemph's 9 points and a game-high 10 assists against Kansas State. It was the 21st time Kemph recorded 10 or more assists in their career. They finished with school records of 1,894 points, 899 assists and 490 free throws made.
• While Vliet and Kemph were closing the books on their careers, Claire Gritt (Hersey) was just taking off in theirs at the University of Denver.
Gritt earned three conference accolades from the Summit League: Freshman of the Year, member of All-Newcomer Team and honorable mention All-Summit League.
They started in 27 of 29 games, averaging a team-leading 10.3 points and 3.0 rebounds. They shot 40.8 percent from the field and 35.7 from deep.
Earlier this season, Gritt was named to the Roo Holiday Classic All-Tournament team after averaging 16 points, including a career-high 21 points vs. Liberty on Dec. 19.
Wolf Pack pride
The sixth annual 'Pride of the Wolf Pack' induction ceremony at Thomas Middle School is set for Thursday, April 26 at 8 a.m. The assembly honors Thomas grads who went on to play Division I or professional sports.

Fesl was a standout setter at Hersey before playing at North Florida University and Ohio State.
Woodsum starred in football at Buffalo Grove and Northwestern while Nowinski did the same for Hersey and Harvard before they wrestled with World Wrestling Entertainment. Nowinski then started the Concussion Legacy Foundation and is a leader in concussion research.
Kuch expects many of the former honorees to be in attendance, including former Chicago Bull Dave Corzine (Hersey and DePaul) and Buffalo Grove soccer standout Brian McBride, who played for the Columbus Crew, Fulham and the Chicago Fire.
Men's hockey
The University of Illinois ACHA Division I hockey team ended its season with a loss to Adrian College in the finals of the national championships. Illinois was one of the 20 Division 1 teams invited to the tournament.

Much of the early aerial video released Wednesday shows flashing red lights of emergency vehicles parked on and around the Las Vegas Strip. There is footage of the concert site as well, but the distance of the camera — along with the lighting — makes it difficult to see details on the ground.
The stirring sounds of the 94th United States Army Band will raise the spirits of visitors at the Springfield Armory National Historic Site during a special concert on Saturday, Aug. 19.
The event, set for 2 p.m., will be held inside the museum in a concert setting with chairs. Admission to the museum is free and there is no charge to attend the show.
"The 94th Army Band is a perfect fit for the mission of the Springfield Armory that manufactured firearms for the Army for 174 years. Their concert will draw listeners into a musical world of pride and celebration," said Joanne M. Gangi-Wellman, chief of interpretation at the museum.
Based in East Windsor, Connecticut, the 94th Army Band - a unit of the Army Reserve assigned to the eastern United States - has a long tradition serving the nation since 1943.
The 94th Army Band's mission as stated on its Facebook page is "to provide music throughout the spectrum of military operations so as to instill in American forces the will to fight and win, foster the support of U.S. citizens, and promote national interests at home and abroad." With a variety of musical performance teams, they provide musical support for many types of venues and occasions, including parades, outdoor concerts, community outreach events and more.
"The band is a great way to combine our military service with our love of music, and it's a great way for us to see some or our nation's many historic sites like the Armory Museum," said Staff Sergeant Michael Deraleau.
Deraleau said some 14 band members, including several retirees, will perform at the Springfield show, which they noted will showcase the group's jazz combo.
"We also have a ceremonial group who will be playing marches like those written by John Philip Sousa and other popular composers, and our commander, Eric Flowers, will be performing on the bagpipes," Deraleau said.
The bands of the U.S. Army are the oldest in all of the military branches and have toured throughout the United States, Canada, South America, Europe, and the Far East.
Springfield Armory National Historic Site commemorates and preserves the site of the nation's first armory, established in 1794. The site offers Ranger-guided tours both indoors and outdoors, self-guided tours of the historic arms collection and industrial machinery, and self-guided walking tours of the buildings and grounds. There are also Junior Rangers activities for kids.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices climbed surged on Wednesday, rebounding from a four-day slump as Russia's central bank expressed caution on plans to boost oil supply and analysts forecast a drawdown in U.S. crude inventories.
Brent settled up $2.11, or 2.8 percent, at $77.50 a barrel. U.S. crude gained $1.48, or 2.2 percent, to $68.21.
Oil has been pressured by reports that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia may ease up on output cuts in place since January 2017. The cuts have driven down global inventories and boosted prices, with global benchmark Brent reaching a 3-1/2-year high of $80.50 a barrel on May 17.
On May 25, sources told Reuters that Saudi Arabia and Russia are discussing raising oil output from OPEC and allied non-OPEC countries by around 1 million bpd.
On Wednesday, however, the Russian central bank said falling oil prices would pose a risk to the country's financial sector.
"It seems that somebody in the central bank is taking notice of the big drop in oil prices and sending a signal of, 'Hey, wait a second. We don't want these prices to fall too far,'" said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.
U.S. crude's discount to Brent rose to as much as $9.31, with Brent supported as investors worried that U.S. sanctions could be cutting crude supplies from Iran.
"There's more concern on the Brent side that supply losses from Iran are harder to be made up," Flynn said.
India's Reliance Industries Ltd , owner of the world's biggest refining complex, plans to halt oil imports from Iran, two sources familiar with the matter said.
In Brazil, the FUP oil workers union said workers had joined the call for a nationwide strike on at least 20 oil rigs in the lucrative Campos basin and other areas of the country.
Protesters are calling for the resignation of Petroleo Brasileiro SA Chief Executive Officer Pedro Parente and a change to company fuel pricing policies. The company said production was not affected. Last week there was a strike by Brazilian truckers over high diesel prices. Ongoing unrest could threaten demand for fuels in Brazil, which U.S. data showed was the No. 8 energy consumer in 2016.
Industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) releases its weekly supply report at 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT) on Wednesday, followed by official government data on Thursday. U.S. inventories are expected to decline by 525,000 barrels.

UTTAR PRADESH: Indians voted on Wednesday in the second round of a state election that is the biggest test of support for Prime Minister Narendra Modi since they rose to power three years ago, as controversy raged over the illegal publication of an exit poll.
The election, in Uttar Pradesh that is home to 220 million Indians, is the world's largest this year and will have a key influence on Modi's chances of clinching a second term as prime minister in 2019.
Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept Uttar Pradesh in the 2014 general election on the way to winning the biggest national mandate in 30 years.
But the publication of an exit poll after the first round of voting in the state last Saturday has led to the arrest of a newspaper editor amid allegations that it amounted to an illegal attempt to influence voting in later rounds.
News organisations and survey groups conduct exit polls to glean the first pointers to the likely winner but the election commission bans their publication until all rounds of voting are completed.
Uttar Pradesh is holding seven round of voting, moving from west to east in a state more populous than Brazil, to allow security forces to redeploy and curb the risk of electoral violence or malpractice.
Shekhar Tripathi, an online editor with Hindi-language newspaper Dainik Jagran, told Reuters the criminal charges filed against them on suspicion of violating election rules were "baseless".
Final results on March 11 in Uttar Pradesh and four other state elections will deliver voters' first verdict on Modi's shock decision in November to withdraw 86 percent of the cash in circulation.
The banknote ban was launched to purge the economy of "black money", untaxed income and the proceeds of crime and corruption, but it has disrupted daily life and caused an economic slowdown.
On Wednesday, voters in 67 constituencies queued outside polling stations to elect lawmakers who will rule the impoverished state.
Modi's BJP hopes to defeat two heavyweight regional parties but will struggle to replicate its general election result, when it polled 42 percent of the vote and won 71 of 80 constituencies in the battleground state.
Voters' impatience has grown as Modi's promises of development failed to deliver new jobs in a state where an individual's average annual income runs less than $750.
In the town of Deoband, home to India's largest Islamic seminary, men and burqa-clad women queued outside mosques and schools to vote.
Rahim Raza, 34, said they were working as a daily wage labourer after Modi's note ban forced them to shut the shop they ran at a garage. "We should not vote for a party that destroyed our business," they added.
Australian pacer Billy Stanlake has been ruled out of the remainder of the Sunrisers Hyderabad campaign in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) after they suffered a finger injury while fielding in a match against Chennai Super Kings two days back.
"Sunrisers Hyderabad fast bowler Billy Stanlake has been ruled out of the remainder of the eleventh edition of the ongoing IPL," a media release from the franchise said.
Indian and Australian orthopaedic specialists have advised Stanlake against playing the remaining tournament owing to an injury that they sustained in the match against Chennai Super Kings played at Hyderabad on 22 April, it added.
"Billy sustained a displaced fracture on the fifth finger of their right hand whilst fielding. Surgical reduction and fixation was required to restore the function to that finger," the release said.
Stanlake has flown back to Australia for further treatment.
The 23-year-old fast bowler had taken five wickets in the four games, which they played for Hyderabad in this IPL.

A 23-year-old woman is in custody after a vehicle pursuit involving multiple agencies from Des Moines County into Henry County.
On Friday, Feb. 2 just before midnight a Burlington Police Officer attempted to stop a car driven by Aaliayh Williams, of Burlington, on a suspected narcotics violation. According to a press release, Williams did not stop for the officer and was last spotted going west on Highway 34 near the Broadway overpass in West Burlington, Iowa.
Again, Williams failed to yield to an emergency vehicle and allegedly lead Des Moines County deputies on a pursuit into Henry County. Stop sticks were deployed by assisting Henry County deputies, and two tires on the car were punctured. Williams then stopped on Highway 34 near mile marker 44 in Henry County.
Four subjects were detained without incident and the driver, Williams was arrested and transported to the Des Moines County Jail. They were booked for eluding, speeding, driving under suspicion and reckless driving.
Burlington Police and Des Moines County Sheriff's deputies were assisted by the Henry County Sheriff's Office, the Iowa State Patrol and the New London Police Department. Nobody was injured during the incident.
It should be noted that all subjects are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.
Supporting a Free Press
Senator Amy Klobuchar
In Minnesota, we understand the importance of a free press. It's hard to forget in our state – Minnesotans are among the most engaged citizens in the country. Last year we again ranked first in the nation in voter turnout. Minnesotans volunteer at the second highest rate in the country. And we usually look to our local newspapers as the first stop for the information we need.
In my house growing up, it was impossible to forget the importance of a free press. My dad was a journalist.
As a reporter and a columnist, my dad, Jim Klobuchar, covered it all. On the night of the presidential election in 1960, as a young stringer for the Associated Press, they were among the first in the country – if not the first – to call the race for President John F. Kennedy. They were fearless, whether it was reporting from Moscow with a Soviet Intourist guide assigned to them at all times or taking tear gas covering protests outside of a political convention. Digging for the truth was their job. Finding the truth made it all worth it.
From children with cancer to Minnesota veterans, they covered the stories of every day heroes, too. They believed that all stories needed to be told, and that by sharing these stories, we deepen our understanding of one another and become more united as a country.
So, from a very young age, I understood the important role the press has played in our democracy. And today, I understand a free press is as important as ever.
Minnesota reporters have been on the frontlines of major stories since the founding of our first newspaper in 1849. They've covered good times and bad. From enlisting with the Union in the Civil War, as Hastings Democrat publisher Charles P. Adams did in 1861, to tireless investigating and reporting on the abduction of Jacob Wetterling, Minnesota journalists have always been committed to telling our stories.
Over the past few months, we have heard about “alternative facts.” We have heard an Administration official suggest that the press should “keep its mouth shut.” And we have even seen efforts to limit journalists' access to elected officials.
None of this is acceptable.
Our founders enshrined freedom of the press in our Constitution for a reason. Thomas Jefferson said that our first objective as a nation should be to leave open “all avenues to truth,” and that the most effective way of doing that is through “the freedom of the press.”
Today, Minnesota reporters continue their dogged pursuit of the truth day after day, story after story. That reporting is on display all across Minnesota, and the Minnesota Newspaper Association has played a big part in supporting Minnesota reporters for 150 years now. From Deborah Howell, who oversaw the Pioneer Press's first Pulitzer Prize, to Mark Kellogg, the first Associated Press reporter to die in the line of duty, reporters all across our state are carrying forward a remarkable legacy.
I'm determined to protect journalists and defend freedom of the press. My dad expects me to. The oath I took to “support and defend the Constitution” demands that I do.

Consumer Reports reversed course Wednesday and endorsed the new Tesla Model 3 after previously declining to recommend the electric car, saying that the company had quickly improved the vehicle's brakes.
The consumer advice publication's turnabout comes after a spat with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who called the initial review "very strange" and said reviewers had tested "an early production car."
Musk's criticism came as they also bashed the news media in general in recent days over what they believe is unfair coverage.
Consumer Reports said Tesla issued an over-the-air software update to improve the Model 3's brakes. The reviewers had originally reported a stopping distance that "was far worse than any contemporary car we've tested" and even longer than a full-size pickup.
That was part of what reviewers called "big flaws," including difficult vehicle controls.
Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at Consumer Reports, told USA TODAY that they spoke with Musk for an hour last week after the initial review was posted.
Musk, they said, was "eager" to understand why Consumer Reports had experienced trouble with the Model 3.
But they said Musk's public criticism did not affect the publication's shift.
"There are still other flaws with the vehicle," Fisher said in an interview. "Those have not necessarily been addressed. It's not the top in its category but it's certainly a vehicle that scores high enough to recommend."
Elon Musk, Tesla CEO, discusses new technologies before an event for Tesla owners and the media held at the Hawthorne Airport. In the background is a Tesla model P85D.

Lin-Manuel Miranda, top row from left, Rita Moreno, Jennifer Lopez, and bottom row from left, Camilla Cabello, Marc Anthony and Luis Fonsi.
“I was like every Puerto Rican with ties to the island, with family on the island. We all had a terrible few days of silence. For some, those days were weeks,” Miranda told the Associated Press . “For me, that helplessness turned into, ‘OK, well, what can I write that will help? Can I write a tune that we can monetize?'”
The Tony-winning “Hamilton” creator released the song at midnight Thursday night, featuring a murderers row of Latin superstars including Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony, Camila Cabello, Gloria Estefan, Fat Joe, Luis Fonsi, John Leguizamo and Rita Moreno.
Lin-Manuel Miranda's “Almost Like Praying” tribute to Puerto Rico is over and the fundraising song was worth the wait.
Inspired by "Maria" from "West Side Story" — a tune that shares a name with the hurricane that ravaged the island on Sept. 20 — "Almost Like Praying" mentions all 78 towns in Puerto Rico, from the coast, to the mountains, to the smaller islands along the shore.
Other artists featured in the song include Ruben Blades, Pedro Capo, Dessa, Juan Luis Guerra, Alex Lacamoire, Ednita Nazario, Joell Ortiz, Anthony Ramos, Gina Rodriguez (the "Jane the Virgin" star raps!), Gilberto Santa Rosa, Tommy Torres and Ana Villafane.
Ricky Martin and Daddy Yankee were also invited to take part but were already too busy assisting with hurricane recovery to participate.
Miranda was excited about how fervent people's desire to aid Puerto Rico has been, but couldn't say the same for the federal government.
“This was an unprecedented disaster and requires an unprecedented federal response. They have not yet gotten an unprecedented federal response,” Miranda said to the AP. “I am longing and waiting and jumping up and down for a federal response to match the response of our people.”
All proceeds from downloads and streams of "Almost Like Praying" go to the Hispanic Federation's disaster relief fund.
The song is available on Spotify, iTunes, Tidal and more.
The Hispanic Federation's disaster relief fund is accepting donations online.
Blue-collar luxury? It sounds like a contradiction in terms.
But it represents a potentially lucrative niche market opportunity among ethnic consumers that is being overlooked by advertisers, says Marc Bland, IHS Markit's vice president of diversity and inclusion.
These are the urban entrepreneurs who might have a little dirt under their nails. It could be the small-business owner who runs a profitable landscaping operation, or maybe a beautician or barber who owns several shops. They're not in white-collar professions, but they're making good money, says Bland.

Washington — U.S. employers posted slightly fewer job openings in October than the previous month, but the number of people being hired improved.
The Labor Department says nearly 6 million jobs were available at the end of October, down from 6.18 million in September. Manufacturers, retailers, wholesalers and the information sector advertised fewer jobs.
But total hires rose 4.4 percent to 5.55 million.
The government said last week that employers added a net total of 244,000 jobs in October and 228,000 in November. That partly reflected a recovery in hiring after the hurricanes dragged down jobs gains in September.
Despite the healthy job market, many people are staying in their jobs rather than departing for new ones. The number of quits held steady for a second straight month at 3.18 million.

I-League 2017: DSK Shivajians held to an away draw by Minerva Punjab
The goalless draw sees DSK Shivajians stay at sixth position in the league with 10 points from nine games
by Press Release News 15 Feb 2017, 20:07 IST
The newly promoted side held the Shivajians at home
In a match devoid of major goal-scoring opportunities, a resolute defensive performance by Minerva Punjab FC held DSK Shivajians to a goalless draw. The draw sees DSK Shivajians stay at sixth position in the league with 10 points from nine games.
With one change to the 11 that started against Shillong Lajong on the 11th, with Sumeet Passi replacing Mawihmingthanga, it took nine minutes for the first chance of the game, where Halicharan Narzary's long ranger flew inches over the goal. On the 11th minute, Sumeet Passi found themselves with what would be the best chance of the game, with a header a yard from goal. The youngster, however, headed the ball inches wide.
Five minutes later, a long diagonal found Kim Song-Yong, who headed the ball straight to custodian Arnab Das Sharma. It was Minerva with the next attempt in the 17th minute, with the Punjabi team racking up successive corners against DSK Shivajians.
This “purple patch” was however rather short lived, as DSK Shivajians dominated almost the entire of the remaining 25 minutes, with cross after cross in the Minerva Punjab box, but to no avail. Baoringdao Bodo came close for the home side with a shot drilled towards the DSK Shivajians goal on the stroke of the half but both teams went into the break with honours even, with DSK Shivajians having been the brighter of the two sides.
The second half resumed with DSK Shivajians showing greater impetus, earning a corner within the first minute. The Minerva Punjab backline of Kareem Omalaja and Loveday would however, prove to be impenetrable for the home side. Coupled with the ground condition progressively deteriorating, not only was DSK Shivajians' usual slick short passing affected, but also the wellbeing of their players with Kim Song-Yong and Nirmal Chettri picking up knocks over the course of the half.
With a switch of formation, DSK Shivajians pressed hard for the opener but were constantly denied, be it from the centre of the park or through either flank. Minerva Punjab put on a defensive show for the ages. With Sairutakima coming close on the 58th minute with a well-timed header, Halicharan also found themselves in a scoring position in the 71st minute with a well timed run finding Juan Quero's curling free kick, but again the visitors were frustrated by the hosts, who had decided to park the bus.
Minerva's only chance of the half came in the 81st minute when Girik Khosla let fly. Arjuna Award winning goalkeeper and DSK Shivajians Captain Subrata Paul was, however, more than up to the task. As we approached the final whistle, Lallianzuala Chhangte, on for Sumeet Passi had a chance to finally break the deadlock in the 91st minute.
In a match where the gods seemed to be smiling on defensive displays, they too are unable to find the back of the net. As the referee blew the full-time whistle, it ended goalless, with the home side having held off a DSK Shivajians attacking onslaught for almost the entire 90 minutes.
DSK Shivajians first team manager was happy to come Away with a clean sheet, and credited the team for a strong performance.
“To get a point in any away game is a feat and I‘m proud of the boys for keeping a clean sheet. Lately, we've conceded late goals which have cost us. This is a tough plavce to come play, as Minerva (Punjab) have got a great battling team with young players, and we knew it would be tough.”
“Both teams with youth and enthusiasm were trying to play the right way, and it's another victory for Indian Football with the amount of U22 players in both squads,” they signed off.
DSK Shivajians next play Mohun Bagan on the 18th of February in Kolkata.

A billboard touting the success of the Narbonne football program popped up out of the blue one day last April.
It was placed on Carson Street, not far from the Gauchos' Marine League rivals at Carson High, and featured a fist-pumping photo of coach Manuel Douglas and highlighted the school's three-straight City Section titles and 2015 state championship.
The sign outraged the Colts and was removed, but in the months leading to Friday's matchup between the two, the chatter on social media was loud and clear.
Carson, armed with a slew of transfers, was coming for No. 17-ranked Narbonne on its home turf.
But after the Gauchos dispatched the Colts, 48-13, and Carson decided to forgo the post-game handshake, Douglas stood in front of their team and delivered a message, tongue-in-cheek.
“What are they mad about now, the billboard or the scoreboard?” Douglas asked.
The answer is probably both.
“They chose not to shake hands,” Douglas said. “We wouldn't do that. I don't care. We're never not shaking hands.”
The game was never in question. Narbonne took control in the first half behind senior running back Jermar Jefferson.
Jefferson rushed for 131 yards and three touchdowns before the break, which gave Narbonne (3-3, 1-0) a 34-6 advantage at the half.
Jefferson, who transferred to Narbonne from Redondo Union, said they were starting to get more comfortable in the offense and with their teammates.
“The biggest adjustment is facing better teams and competition,” they said.
In the second half, senior quarterback Jalen Chatman took over, throwing two touchdowns, first to Noah Jackson for 16 yards and second to Aaron Magee for 20 yards, giving the Gauchos a 48-6 lead.
Carson (3-3, 0-1) scored in the first half on a 23-yard pass from Jaja Bellinger to Dejonte Thomas, and in the second half on a 70-yard interception by Sultan Moala.

Lime did not respond to questions about the impounded bicycles. The company's general manager of San Diego, Zack Bartlett, issued a statement: “We would like to work with the city to explore a more productive approach. Lime has never deployed bikes in Coronado, our smartphone app actively warns riders against parking in Coronado, and we collect and redistribute most of our bikes on a nightly basis. Rather than destroying perfectly good bicycles, we can work towards finding real solutions that benefit both residents and riders.”
Greetings from Calgary, where taxis are flying Flames flags and people downtown are wearing Flames jerseys in honor of Game 3 of the first-round Stanley Cup playoff series between the Flames and the Ducks. The Ducks won the first two games at Anaheim, and fans at the Scotiabank Saddledome will be providing a background of red jerseys and raucous cheers to give their team inspiration Monday night. Game 4 will be played here on Wednesday.
Flames rookie Matthew Tkachuk will be playing their first home playoff game, and they said after the team's morning skate that he's very much looking forward to the atmosphere in the arena Monday night.
“Definitely excited. There are some nerves going through your head, just because you've heard so many great things about this building,” said the 19-year-old son of former NHL standout Keith Tkachuk. “I wouldn't say nerves — just so anxious to finally play.”
They said he's finding the balance between being ready but not so ramped up that he's out of control. “You have to have your mind on straight but you also have to be emotional in these games,” they said. “We're down, 2-0, right now. We need this win tonight. So you have to put everything you have in this win tonight.”
Flames forward Kris Versteeg, a member of the Chicago Blackhawks' 2010 and 2015 Stanley Cup championship teams, said they had no fears about their young teammate's ability to perform under pressure in the postseason.
“There's nothing much to say. He's a kid, you watch them out there, he's pretty much a driven player,” Versteeg said. “He's one of the most polished professionals I think I've seen as a teenager in my entire career. It's really spectacular to see them like that. There's not really much to say. I'm sure their old man has said enough to him.”
Flames Coach Glen Gulutzan said he's hoping the crowd can be a factor and give their players “that little extra juice.” They added that they also hope their team will have a better start than it did in the two games at Anaheim. The Ducks scored 52 seconds into Game 1 and scored at 3:21 and 6:44 of the opening period in Game 2 and went on to win each game by a 3-2 count.
“Our starts have put us down and it's hard to claw back like that in the playoffs,” Gulutzan said. “I think we've got better starts in us. Maintaining a level would probably be the best way to put it.”
Gulutzan also praised Ducks goaltender John Gibson but said their own players haven't made Gibson's job hard enough. Gibson has stopped 61 of 65 shots, with two of Calgary's goals resulting during power plays.
“I think he's played well. He's made some real good saves. We can certainly get more traffic in front of the net and I thought they got to see a lot of clean shots,” Gulutzan said. “I think we can do a better job getting to the front, to the blue paint.”

KANSAS CITY –A Kansas City woman pleaded guilty in federal court Monday to their role in a marriage fraud conspiracy after participating in a wedding sting operation staged by federal agents, according to Tom Larson, Acting United States Attorney for the Western District of Missouri.
Stephanie Harris, 22, of Kansas City, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Gary A. Fenner to the charges contained in an Aug. 31, 2016, federal indictment.
Harris admitted that they participated in a conspiracy to assist African nationals in circumventing immigration laws by arranging fraudulent marriages. Co-defendants Delmar Dixon, 49, Kakeland Barnes, 37, Shakeisha Harrison, 37, and Traci R. Porter, 44, all of Kansas City, also have pleaded guilty to their roles in the marriage fraud conspiracy. In addition to the conspiracy, Dixon pleaded guilty to falsely swearing in an immigration matter.
Dixon admitted that they arranged 30 to 40 fraudulent marriages, including their own. Dixon charged the African nationals $1,000 upfront for their services, which included providing them U.S. citizen spouses. The African nationals were additionally required to pay $500 to the spouse at the time of the wedding, and an additional $500 immediately after completion of the wedding. They were required to pay their spouses $250 each month after the weddings until the immigration process was complete. The African nationals were coached by Dixon on how to make their marriages appear legitimate.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents utilized a confidential informant in a pretend ceremony that was staged by ICE-HSI. The confidential informant arranged a meeting with Dixon, paid the required fees, and married Harris, the spouse provided to them by Dixon, in a pretend ceremony staged by ICE-HSI on Nov. 24, 2015. The confidential informant continued to pay the $250 monthly fee to Harris for the fraudulent purported marriage through August 2016.
On a prior occasion, Dixon arranged for a marriage between Harris and a Kenyan national. Although they applied for and received a marriage license, they did not marry.
ICE-HSI also utilized an undercover agent in their investigation. The agent met with Dixon, who introduced the agent to Barnes, their intended spouse, on Jan. 23, 2016. Dixon advised the undercover agent that they and Barnes should rent an apartment in the Kansas City area and obtain life insurance policies together. The undercover agent also spoke alone with Barnes. Barnes told the agent they were involved with another man and had three children. They signified they understood the marriage would be a business transaction. The agent made a payment to Dixon and kept in contact with Dixon regarding their marriage. On February 19, 2016, the undercover agent wired $250 to Barnes and $500 to Dixon. Both retrieved the payments later that day. Dixon also offered the undercover agent $300 for each new client they referred.
Under federal statutes, Harris is subject to a sentence of up to five years in federal prison without parole. The maximum statutory sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes, as the sentencing of the defendants will be determined by the court based on the advisory sentencing guidelines and other statutory factors. Sentencing hearings will be scheduled after the completion of presentence investigations by the United States Probation Office.
This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Kim Moore. It was investigated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Fraud Detection and National Security.
By the time you finish reading this article, four more people will experience sexual assault.
Every 98 seconds, another American is sexually assaulted, according to RAINN (Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network). Sexual assault is never the victim's fault. Whether the assault occurred recently or years ago, everyone has the right to be heard and be supported.
The probability is high that you know someone who has experienced sexual trauma. Nearly 1 in 5 women and 1 in 67 men in the United States have experienced rape or attempted rape some time in their lives, according to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center.
April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month. Recent movements, campaigns and public discussions happening across our nation about sexual harassment, assault and trauma are creating change and refining many views on an issue that, unfortunately, has been happening for decades and harming thousands of Americans each year. Here are several things you can do to help.
Know the misconceptions
We can all stop the spread of false information about sexual assault and trauma by knowing the misconceptions that exist. Sexual assault is about power and control. It's not about sex.
Rarely is an individual sexually assaulted by a stranger. Out of the sexual abuse cases reported to law enforcement, 93 percent of juvenile victims knew the perpetrator, according to RAINN. Sexual harassment, assault and trauma can happen to anyone. It is not limited to one industry, age group, gender, race or community.
The effects trauma has on a child or an adult's life can also be underestimated. It can influence a person's mind and behavior and impact every part of their life. The process a person takes to identifying trauma as a root cause can vary from person to person, so having a clinical team and professionals who incorporate evidence-based practices, like cognitive behavior therapy and individualized treatment plans, can help a child or adult experiencing trauma build a network of support and rebuild their life.
Don't blame the victim
Statements like “why didn't they or they run?” or “they should take self-defense classes” can come across as blaming the victim without a person even realizing it, making it more difficult for an individual who has experienced sexual assault to speak out about their or their experience. Studies show the majority of sexual assaults are not reported. Sexual assault thrives on secrecy and blaming the victim. Speak up and support victims of sexual assault.
Provide support
Everyone can support individuals going through sexual trauma by listening to them, believing them, and when they're ready, offering to help connect them with advocates who are dedicated to supporting survivors of sexual assault.
The National Sexual Assault Hotline, (800) 656-HOPE (4673), is free and confidential. Trained staff members are there 24/7 to listen, support, answer questions and provide resources. At Centerstone, we offer hope and healing for all who have experienced sexual trauma.
Sexual trauma should not ultimately determine an individual's future life path. Each of us has the capacity to ensure no one journeys on their path to healing alone.
Julie Bailey is a mental health and substance abuse counselor at Centerstone in Marion, Ill., with a focus on trauma-informed care. They hold a master's degree in clinical mental health counseling, and in June, will have completed national certification in trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy.
New York: After a strong start, U.S. stocks abruptly sold off Tuesday after machinery maker Caterpillar said it doesn't expect to top its first-quarter profit for the rest of the year.
The Dow Jones industrial average plunged as much as 619 points as investors feared that rising oil prices and other costs will slow down growth in company profits.
Stocks climbed in early trading as companies like Caterpillar, appliance maker Whirlpool, and Fifth Third Bancorp posted strong quarterly results. Then Caterpillar executives told analysts on a conference call in the late morning that they don't expect the company to report a larger per-share profit for the rest of 2018. Other industrial, technology and basic materials companies also took sharp losses.
The S&P 500 index sank 35.73 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,634.56. The Dow Jones industrial average finished with a loss of 424.56 points, or 1.7 percent, to 24,024.13. The Nasdaq composite dropped 121.25 points, or 1.7 percent, to 7,007.35.
Small-company stocks held up better than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index declined 8.84 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,553.28, about half as much as the S&P 500, which tracks large U.S. companies.
Caterpillar's products are used in a wide variety of industries including construction, power generation, mining and oil and gas drilling. Meanwhile 3M, which makes Post-it notes and industrial coatings and ceramics, said the rising price of oil and other materials is affecting its business.
The companies' statements came as interest rates kept rising, which makes it more expensive for companies to borrow money. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3 percent for the first time in more than four years.
Stocks shot up at the end of 2017 and the start of 2018 as investors bet that the corporate tax overhaul would lead to bigger profits for American companies and greater economic growth. Gina Martin Adams, chief equity strategist for Bloomberg Intelligence, said it hasn't happened yet.
"We're not yet seeing a very strong recovery in the broader economic numbers that would suggest the impact of tax reform is more than just temporary," they said. "The market is very impatient."
Adams said the tax cuts may help stocks later on, but investors always want to see better and faster growth, and now they're not sure where that improvement will come from.
The worries began to set in after construction and mining equipment maker Caterpillar said it doesn't expect to top its first-quarter profit for the rest of this year. Industrial and basic materials companies and technology firms took some of the worst losses.
Wall Street had cheered Caterpillar's results earlier in the day after the company had a strong first quarter and raised its forecasts for the year. But the stock gave up those gains and finished with a loss of 6.2 percent at $144.44.
3M shed 6.8 percent to $201.13. Chemical companies and other materials makers could also see their profits affected as oil prices and other expenses rise. DowDuPont shed 3.7 percent to $63.1. Elsewhere, aerospace company Boeing lost 2.9 percent to $329.06.
Bond prices slipped again Tuesday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.99 percent from 2.98 percent. Earlier it peaked at 3 percent for the first time since January 2014.
Low interest rates have played an important role in the economic recovery of the last decade, and the yield on the 10-year note is a benchmark for many kinds of interest rates including mortgages. It's been climbing because investors expect higher economic growth and inflation.
Since the global financial crisis in 2008-09, a combination of low inflation expectations and a bond-buying program by the Federal Reserve have helped keep bond yields low, but they have climbed this year as inflation expectations have picked up.
The 10-year yield traded at 2.43 percent at the beginning of the year.
Alphabet slid 4.8 percent to $1,022.64 after the company said ad revenue climbed, but expenses also rose. Google's parent company benefited from strong digital ad sales as well as an accounting change. Other big technology companies also fell, as Facebook dropped 3.7 percent to $159.69 and Microsoft skidded 2.3 percent to $93.12. Another market favorite, online retailer Amazon, shed 3.8 percent to $1,460.09.
The dollar edged up to 108.67 yen from 108.65 yen. The euro rose to $1.2237 from $1.2205.
Benchmark U.S. crude oil shed 1.4 percent to $67.70 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 1.1 percent to $73.86 per barrel in London.
Wholesale gasoline lost 1.4 percent to $2.09 a gallon. Heating oil dipped 0.6 percent to $2.13 a gallon. Natural gas rose 1.5 percent to $2.78 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold rose 0.7 percent to $1,333 an ounce. Silver climbed 0.7 percent to $16.70 an ounce. Copper rose 1 percent to $3.14 a pound.
Germany's DAX lost 0.2 percent while the French CAC 40 added 0.1 percent and Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.4 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 0.9 percent, helped by the weaker yen. The Kospi in South Korea lost 0.4 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 1.4 percent.

One of the devotees also added that they had paid Rs. 50,000 as bribe to the Hesco for providing power to their tents in the western part of the town but in vain.
The loadshedding in the celebration of Urs is made it difficult to sit or reside in the tents for the devotees. The onging loadshedding also resulted the lackage of water. This is a request to the HESCO to provide loadshedding if not throughout Karachi but to those devotees so that they can worship comfortably .
ZN BALOCH,
Turbat, May 6.
University of Texas junior All-American John Shebat, who missed their 3rd-straight meet for Texas on Friday, is expected to return for post-season competition, a spokesperson for the school told SwimSwam on Saturday. Shebat hasn't raced since they January 8th dual against Auburn, where they were 20.78 in the 50 free, 48.60 in the 100 back, and 1:46.77 in the 200 back.
Texas beat Auburn 160-140 at that meet, which they followed with a 162-138 loss to Arizona State and a 155-143 win over Arizona in a southwestern-swing. Shebat was absent for both meets, but the spokesperson said that they will race at the Big 12 and NCAA Championship meets.
Shebat's season-bests in their primary events, the 100 and 200 yard backstrokes, are 46.73 and 1:41.52, respectively. Those times both came at the mid-season Texas Hall of Fame Invitational in December – the 100 was about half-a-second slower than their time at the same meet last season, while the 200 was about a full-second faster than they swam a year earlier.
In 2017, Shebat would move on to finish 2nd in the 100 back (44.35) and 200 back (1:37.24) behind only Ryan Murphy. They finished half-a-second clear of any other returning swimmer in those events at NCAAs. They also led-off Texas' record-setting 200 and 400 medley relays and swam a prelims leg of their 200 free relay.
Austin Katz and Ryan Harty have been dividing the medley relay leadoff duties for the Longhorns in their absence. Harty split 22.68 against Arizona State opening the 200 medley relay, while the first-year student Katz split 22.72 on Friday against TCU.

Cool, high-lying areas of Ethiopia hitherto shielded from heat-loving malaria mosquitoes are increasingly exposed to the disease as the climate warms, researchers said Thursday.
Most Ethiopians live in the country's highlands, and have long enjoyed natural protection against mosquitoes carrying the malaria-causing parasites Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax.
But the buffered area has been shrinking since 1981, scientists reported in the journal Environmental Research Letters. About six million people live in the newly-vulnerable regions.
Air temperatures below 18 degrees Celsius (64.4 degrees Fahrenheit) prevent development of P. falciparum. The survival threshold for P. vivax is 15 C, according to the research team.
Low temperatures also impede the spread of mosquitos that host the parasites.
Since temperatures decrease with altitude, much of the Ethiopian highlands -- 1,500 to 2,500 metres (4,921 to 8,202 feet) above sea level -- were beyond the reach of malaria transmission.
To date, it was not known whether the mercury had risen in the East African highlands, or whether global warming contributed to a recent upsurge in malaria in the region.
To find out, a team from the University of Maine and Columbia University in New York compiled a national temperature dataset for Ethiopia covering the period 1981-2014.
They discovered that temperatures rose at least 0.22 C (0.4 F) per decade.
The team then used the new climate data to pinpoint the highest elevation where the average minimum temperature never exceeds the 18 C or 15 C malaria threshold.
"The elevation at which the temperature thresholds are met has risen by more than 100 metres (328 feet) since 1981," the study's lead author Bradfield Lyon of the University of Maine, said in a statement.
Taking into account natural variability in the regional climate and impacts of the seasonal El Nino weather phenomenon, the observed rise was "consistent" with global warming caused by humankind's burning of fossil fuels, the authors found.
"Of particular concern is that the... changes are occurring in the densely populated highlands, where higher elevation has historically served as a buffer against malaria transmission," they wrote.
According to the World Health Organization, there were 212 million cases of malaria worldwide in 2015, and 429,000 deaths.
Ninety percent of malaria cases and deaths occur in Africa. Children under five are most at risk.
